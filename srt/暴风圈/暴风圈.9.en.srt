1
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,936
TEMPEST

2
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:30,072
<i>You're entering my world now.</i>

3
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,414
<i>Forget everything</i>
<i>that's been protecting you.</i>

4
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,632
<i>Your natural rights,</i>
<i>the Constitution and laws of this country,</i>

5
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,384
<i>your diplomatic immunity…</i>

6
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>and your tremendous inheritance.</i>

7
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,817
<i>From this point on,</i>
<i>one person controls everything.</i>

8
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,192
Are you afraid?

9
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,444
Yes.

10
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,239
Does she look afraid to you?

11
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,832
Show her what real fear is.

12
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,587
Show her what true hopelessness
and despair feel like.

13
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,925
Make her so miserable
she wishes she had never been born.

14
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,534
Mom, where are we going?

15
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,663
What are you planning?

16
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,291
Junsang,
what do you know about women?

17
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:38,093
Women want to have the biggest,
and the most powerful thing in the world.

18
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,888
And I am about to get my hands on it.

19
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,976
Anyone who gets in my way tonight
won't make it out alive.

20
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,310
That's how your brother died.

21
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,899
Munju will meet the same fate soon.

22
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,869
You're going to inherit everything I have.

23
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,080
And that means that
I'm doing this for you.

24
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,668
You murdered Junik for me?

25
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,797
So what do you think you should do?

26
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:43,575
CERTIFICATE OF THE ORDER
OF MERIT YU UNHAK

27
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,120
CERTIFICATE OF COMMENDATION
YU UNHAK

28
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,418
BE FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH,

29
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,295
AND I WILL GIVE THEE
A CROWN OF LIFE

30
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:59,633
YU JONGGIL

31
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,437
She wants to see you, Munju.

32
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,569
Junsang.

33
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,239
I remember the day you became a prosecutor

34
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,325
and the day
you won Prosecutor of the Year.

35
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,160
Junik was so proud

36
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:32,499
to have such a talented and tough
prosecutor as his little brother.

37
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,543
Junsang, listen.

38
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,212
Junik was murdered by your mother.

39
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,259
And tonight, because of her,
countless lives are gonna be in danger.

40
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,762
You're the only one who can stop her.

41
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,641
Nobody else can.

42
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,944
Shut up.

43
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,656
You don't know what you're talking about.

44
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,470
I have a question, Mother.

45
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,308
How long have you been Stella Young?

46
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,487
Since 1983.

47
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,742
My family was exiled to the US
because of my husband's bribery scandal.

48
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,953
<i>A few days ago,</i>
<i>I was at some charity art auction,</i>

49
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,206
sticking my hand in the air
to win this beautiful piece,

50
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,044
but lost out.
So I turned around to see who'd won

51
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,379
and was blinded by a knockout.

52
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,506
Then three days later…

53
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,344
Would you believe it?
That painting showed up at our front door.

54
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,681
And to think we'd meet again this way,
and me without my sunglasses…

55
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,933
<i>That's when</i>
<i>I discovered my hidden talents,</i>

56
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,354
<i>talents for socializing, secrecy,</i>
<i>and conspiracy.</i>

57
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,732
<i>As the wife of a corrupt politician,</i>

58
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,569
<i>I was exactly the kind of contractor</i>
<i>the CIA needed.</i>

59
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:29,824
<i>Someone to report on Korean politicians</i>
<i>and collect dirt on them.</i>

60
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:33,286
We need to drive him out slowly
without him even realizing it.

61
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,874
<i>While supporting pro-American politicians,</i>

62
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,753
<i>our company thrived with US backing.</i>

63
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,052
<i>Then we started helping</i>
<i>American defense contractors</i>

64
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,846
<i>sell weapons</i>
<i>to the South Korean government,</i>

65
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,848
<i>and that's when</i>
<i>I finally found my true path.</i>

66
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,768
-Minister…
-<i>A typical arms dealer measures profits</i>

67
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,187
<i>by how many machine guns, mortars,</i>

68
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,773
<i>and surface-to-air missiles they can sell.</i>

69
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,236
<i>But I thought about how many hearts</i>
<i>the bullets I sold would pierce,</i>

70
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,572
<i>how many tanks</i>
<i>the rocket launchers would destroy,</i>

71
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,867
and how many fighter jets
the missiles would take down.

72
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,913
From then on, submarines became my dream.

73
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:23,086
Strategic nuclear submarines that
could launch ballistic missiles

74
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,422
without anyone ever knowing.

75
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,927
Suspect appears to be
North Korean agent, Paik Sanho.

76
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:16,222
-Is North Korea doing this?
-We've shut down all major access roads.

77
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,849
All standby units are moving to the scene.

78
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,392
Shut down all surrounding roads.

79
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,644
<i>All roads around the Blue House</i>
<i>have been shut down.</i>

80
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,288
<i>Paik Sanho. What do you want?</i>

81
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,796
The NIS director is stepping out now.

82
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,390
He's got one kilogram of C-4
strapped to him.

83
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:03,019
It will go off if either of us dies.

84
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,316
We need to secure
a minimum safe distance of 20 meters.

85
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,402
Security Unit One,
move back beyond a 20-meter radius.

86
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,575
First, let me show you
what one kilogram of C-4 can do.

87
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,453
Stand by.

88
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,539
"Be faithful unto death…

89
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,251
and I will give you life."

90
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,889
Oh, my God. Did you see that?
Hey, what's going on?

91
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,391
Do you have any injuries?

92
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,518
Director Yu's house just exploded!

93
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,941
You blew up my house?

94
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,901
Was that a verse from the Bible?

95
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,696
Your father was the head of
the Defense Counterintelligence Command.

96
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,699
He became a legend
by purging 3,000 leftists.

97
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,077
Was he also the one who would say that…

98
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,289
"If you can't find communists,

99
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,665
-make them"?
-Son of a bitch!

100
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,673
<i>What do you want?</i>

101
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,886
I want to see the president immediately.

102
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,687
The president has arrived.

103
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,063
"THE BLUE HOUSE"

104
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,191
<i>Just one minute.</i>

105
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,360
If I can have just one minute
to speak face-to-face with the president,

106
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,279
you can arrest me afterwards.

107
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,073
And I'll release
the NIS director unharmed.

108
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,412
Shoot him!
I don't care what happens to me!

109
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,123
Don't let one more word
come out of his mouth!

110
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,499
Not another word!

111
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,962
Don't let her hear another word
from this goddamn North Korean spy!

112
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,965
Madam President, you can't give in
to the terrorist's demands.

113
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,967
Time is on our side, Madam President.

114
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,846
Even in the worst-case scenario, we're
only looking at Director Yu's sacrifice.

115
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,602
Hold your fire until I give the order.

116
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,024
Madam President.

117
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,444
<i>I'm staking both the director's life</i>
<i>and my own on that one minute.</i>

118
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:20,406
<i>Countless lives are depending on it.</i>

119
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,326
There's no time.

120
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:35,421
If any of you have even an ounce
of courage, shoot him right now!

121
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,298
I'll commend you for it!

122
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,843
What are you waiting for?

123
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,805
Shoot him, you worthless bastards!

124
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,609
No, Madam President!

125
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,987
Don't speak to him!

126
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,034
Let him go.

127
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,348
Don't do it! Listen to me. Don't do it!

128
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,642
You'll be colluding with a spy!

129
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,193
Start talking.

130
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,572
You have one minute.

131
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,866
Go.

132
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,124
August 13th, 2007.

133
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,629
I'm sure it's a day you'll never forget.

134
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,720
Do you like Proust, Madam President?

135
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,984
Proust? The French novelist?

136
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,656
I don't.

137
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,411
I really can't stand long-winded writing.

138
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:35,458
We could spend our precious time
debating my taste in literature,

139
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,086
but I am very impatient,

140
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,379
like a true Korean.

141
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,549
Anything else you want to say?

142
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,802
If not, then we're done here.

143
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,142
His minute's up. Arrest him.

144
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,030
You son of a bitch!

145
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,658
You're plotting something, aren't you?

146
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:13,955
But you won't live to speak with
the president ever again. You understand?

147
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,249
I will make sure of it.

148
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,503
And your grandmother?

149
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,882
She died two days ago,

150
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,467
waiting for you.

151
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,220
See?

152
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:33,015
I told you to lose that woman
and leave with your grandmother.

153
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,643
You brought this on yourself, you bastard!

154
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:55,121
I built my reputation by quietly handling
problems for troubled countries.

155
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,082
Becoming the world's top arms dealer
wasn't simple,

156
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,252
even so,
I could always keep shipments moving,

157
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,922
and I had good relationships
with dictators.

158
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,593
<i>Then one day, it hit me.</i>

159
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,306
<i>I had the power</i>
<i>given by the United States</i>

160
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,017
<i>and the privilege</i>
<i>of accessing North Korea.</i>

161
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,894
<i>Aseom Shipping stated…</i>

162
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,854
<i>The most secretive land on earth</i>

163
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,232
<i>where high-quality weapons could be</i>
<i>produced at any time.</i>

164
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,449
I built factories there,
developed technology,

165
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,659
and sold weapons to sanctioned countries,

166
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,995
all under complete secrecy.

167
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:41,709
Because my power came from the fact
that no one knew who I really was.

168
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,838
However, I know
this business won't last forever.

169
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:51,719
That's why I had to create the weapon
of my dreams while I still could.

170
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:57,141
Nuclear weapons are actually
a blessing for small countries.

171
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,685
Mutually assured destruction.

172
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:05,608
If I have a weapon that can
annihilate my opponent even if I die,

173
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,235
in the final judgment,

174
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:13,950
that puts me on equal footing
as our biggest and strongest enemy.

175
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,912
The great powers always think
they're the only ones

176
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:22,416
with the money and technology
for nuclear weapons.

177
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:24,919
But…

178
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:31,634
what if you had a nuclear submarine,
Your Majesty?

179
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,388
Idisha would be unbeatable in any war.

180
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,640
Before the submarine is yours,

181
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:43,062
let the world know that you fear no one,

182
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:49,318
that you can press
the nuclear button at any time.

183
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,050
On August 13th, 2007, in Basel…

184
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,387
we were desperate.

185
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,473
The four-party talks for peace
on the Korean Peninsula

186
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:23,352
were going to break down the next day
without any concrete results.

187
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,982
Oh, sorry. I'm late.

188
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,067
Oh, not at all. We've only just started.

189
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,485
It's great to see you, Munju.

190
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,614
We were discussing my meeting
with Kim Jongkwan,

191
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,074
the North Korean representative,
last night.

192
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,076
Oh, I'm all ears.

193
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,495
Well, we met in the hotel lobby
at 10 o'clock.

194
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,247
<i>N'allez pas trop vite.</i>

195
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,625
Slow down.

196
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,418
I beg your pardon?

197
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,880
It's what Proust would've said,
Mr. Hughes.

198
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:57,637
Please slow down a bit. Otherwise,
we'll miss the most important things.

199
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,642
How he came to be there,
whether it was by chance or arrangement,

200
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,270
whether he came alone or with someone.

201
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,316
Hmm. Ah, yes.
Proust, the madeleine.

202
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,234
But I'm pretty sure he said, uh…

203
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,488
<i>Mais précise mon cher</i>
<i>monsieur n'allez pas trop vite.</i>

204
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,698
Wow,
that really, really takes me back

205
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,241
to my French lit graduate thesis.

206
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,910
Wow.

207
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,745
But, Munju,

208
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,124
Patrick is the representative
of the United States.

209
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,085
They are Hemingway fanatics.

210
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,211
Mmm.

211
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,674
They believe that the most important thing
is the one true sentence.

212
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,300
Didn't you know?

213
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,388
That is quite true. However, today,
in honor of Munju,

214
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,890
I shall attempt a Proustian explanation.

215
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,936
If you'll excuse me,
I need to go to the restroom.

216
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,480
As a Korean,
I'm not so patient.

217
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,023
Of course.

218
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,864
<i>China has</i>
<i>just persuaded North Korea.</i>

219
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,867
<i>They're asking us to get the US</i>
<i>to shift its position.</i>

220
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,662
<i>The US won't want</i>
<i>to be pressured three-against-one.</i>

221
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,580
<i>So tell him that</i>
<i>if they back off a little,</i>

222
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,501
<i>we can turn it around and</i>
<i>pressure North Korea three-against-one.</i>

223
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,961
<i>The plan succeeded.</i>

224
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,590
<i>And the next day, the four countries</i>
<i>agreed to issue a joint statement.</i>

225
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,509
<i>It was incredible…</i>

226
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,723
like watching four rivers,
each flowing in different directions,

227
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,059
finally come together as one.

228
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,814
So, did you bring me a message that
might change the course of the rivers?

229
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,484
But nothing anyone did changed our lives.

230
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:40,156
While politicians and diplomats
negotiated, issued statements,

231
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,993
held summits, and repeated cycles
of success and failure,

232
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,787
we starved, worked like dogs.

233
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,664
And we died

234
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,667
like it all meant nothing.

235
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,171
Nuclear missiles were built after all.

236
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,636
I'm not South Korean,
or North Korean, or American.

237
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,433
I came here to deliver a message
to make sure

238
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,103
no nuclear bombs fall on any land.

239
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,147
Madam President,

240
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,442
you have to make that happen.

241
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,325
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

242
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,204
Please hand over Paik Sanho now.

243
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,165
You're really crossing the line,
Madam President.

244
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,084
<i>You're the one who's crossing the line.</i>

245
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,339
What do you want?

246
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,217
I'm Kang Gyeongtae
from the Corruption Investigation Office.

247
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,304
Director Yu Unhak, you're under arrest
for fabricating six espionage cases.

248
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:46,931
Hold on, asshole.

249
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,645
When did you decide to come after me?

250
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,524
When you told me about your plan
to frame Seo Munju as a spy.

251
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:02,363
I couldn't let that kind of manipulation
happen under my administration.

252
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,866
What do you think a spy is,
Madam President?

253
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,037
A spy is someone that I…

254
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:14,583
that we have determined
does not belong to this country.

255
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,462
And now, the daughter of a spy returns
and tries to become president?

256
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,882
If the NIS can't
even stop that from happening,

257
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,553
then what reason is there for us to exist?

258
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,392
Thank you
for your statement, Director.

259
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,769
You can explain the rest in court.

260
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,944
You're under arrest.
You have the right to an attorney.

261
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,530
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you…

262
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,868
Once the submarine is delivered tonight…

263
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,915
…the King of Idisha will threaten
the United States.

264
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,043
He will claim that
Idisha's newest submarine

265
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,337
is sitting in the middle of the Pacific,

266
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,798
with sixteen missiles aimed at the US.

267
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,094
I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.

268
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,391
-What is that?
-I've always believed

269
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:17,104
the King of Idisha was a coward,
too scared to actually fire the missiles.

270
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:21,567
Now, it's been 80 years
since nuclear bombs were invented,

271
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,194
but they've only ever been launched once.

272
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,453
You're not planning
to launch it yourself, are you?

273
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,458
If I put the missile launch code in here
and fire the missiles right now,

274
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,421
how do you think today
will go down in history?

275
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:51,639
"The King of Idisha went mad and launched
nuclear missiles at the United States"?

276
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:55,768
Do you get it now?

277
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,771
I can commit the most destructive act
in human history

278
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,814
without ever leaving my name behind.

279
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,401
I told you.

280
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:10,532
Even when I sell a single bullet, I think
about the heart that it will pierce.

281
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,166
<i>We have received intelligence</i>

282
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,836
<i>that a submarine is currently headed</i>
<i>to the middle of the Pacific.</i>

283
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,757
By tomorrow,
the King of Idisha could announce

284
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,219
that he'll point a nuclear missile
at the United States.

285
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,806
With all due respect, Madam President,

286
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,517
you don't mind my asking,

287
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,978
what are you basing this on exactly?

288
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,818
<i>Do you believe</i>
<i>the King of Idisha's statement to be true?</i>

289
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:50,698
You're looking at the transaction records
for 38 accounts across five banks.

290
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,659
Camila, I can prove to you that
the one billion dollars transferred

291
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:58,664
over the last 72 hours is being used
to purchase weapons of mass destruction.

292
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,667
You need to freeze that money
before it reaches the North Koreans.

293
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,836
<i>Anderson, you need to calm down.</i>

294
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,297
<i>If this is true, of course, we're going to</i>
<i>freeze the accounts and impose sanctions.</i>

295
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,883
<i>But this is a tremendous amount of data,</i>

296
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,428
<i>and it's going to take time</i>
<i>to check everything.</i>

297
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,935
Understood.

298
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:23,689
The money is coming from Idisha
and going to Aseom Shipping.

299
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:29,528
<i>Wait. Are you trying to tell me</i>
<i>this has to do with that submarine?</i>

300
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,784
Okay. I'm sorry, Camila.
I know I'm putting you on the spot,

301
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,246
but you have to trust me
and freeze those accounts right now.

302
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,917
<i>Anderson, you know I'm taking a big risk</i>
<i>just by talking to you on the phone.</i>

303
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,378
<i>All I can promise you is that</i>
<i>I'm going to do my best.</i>

304
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,048
-Don't move!
-Freeze! On your knees!

305
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,674
Keep your hands up in the air!

306
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,518
<i>Anderson Miller.</i>

307
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,772
Mr. President?

308
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:08,025
<i>First, you claim that</i>
<i>this submarine doesn't exist,</i>

309
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,904
<i>and now, you're insisting that</i>
<i>it's heading out to the Pacific Ocean.</i>

310
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,408
<i>And tomorrow, it's going to have these</i>
<i>fair United States in its crosshairs.</i>

311
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,952
Do I have that right?

312
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,038
Yes, sir.

313
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,458
Initially, I didn't believe
there was a submarine.

314
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,545
There just wasn't enough evidence.

315
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,176
But something didn't add up.

316
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,888
<i>It was capability. They didn't have</i>
<i>the money or the materials.</i>

317
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,599
So to make up for that, their strategy was
to show off the weapons

318
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,392
that they did have
in order to make us think

319
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,603
that they could use them at any time.

320
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:48,690
<i>I mean, you expect me to believe that</i>
<i>North Korea built a nuclear submarine</i>

321
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,484
<i>but wanted to keep it a secret?</i>

322
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,529
<i>No. That doesn't track, sir.</i>

323
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,116
But what if they got the money
and the materials

324
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,827
from somewhere else?

325
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:04,915
Mr. President, I can show you five years
of financial transactions

326
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,793
<i>showing that Idisha is purchasing</i>

327
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,088
the submarine from North Korea.

328
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:14,967
Well then.

329
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:20,013
What exactly is it you expect us to do?

330
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:25,269
Freeze the funds
from Idisha to North Korea.

331
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,896
Stop the transfer from happening.

332
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:30,566
Sir.

333
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,193
You have the power

334
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:37,155
to take us back
to a world before this thing existed.

335
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,796
Madam President.

336
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,306
-Aseom Shipping.
-Hello? Who's calling?

337
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,642
-What do you mean?
-Which bank did you say?

338
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,397
Looks like our payment accounts
have all been frozen.

339
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,357
If we're gonna send
the payment up north by midnight,

340
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,526
we need to report to the chairwoman.

341
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,777
Yeah. I got it.

342
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:37,215
Junik was miserable
his whole life because of you.

343
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,801
What?

344
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:43,805
You were so opposed to our marriage
he considered cutting ties with you.

345
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,767
He wanted to understand
why you were acting that way.

346
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,812
And that was how he found out
he wasn't your biological son.

347
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,567
Junik? He knew about that?

348
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,654
And he knew about your childhood also.

349
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,989
<i>She was a poor kid.</i>

350
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:05,577
She grew up all alone near
a US military base, like a stray dog.

351
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:09,498
When she was nine, her mother ran off
with an American soldier.

352
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:14,878
So she fed herself by babysitting
for busy mothers and doing their chores.

353
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,013
- What is that?
<i>- When I married</i>

354
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,099
<i>into the salt merchant's family</i>
<i>as his second wife,</i>

355
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,936
I decided that I would marry her off

356
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,938
to the eldest son,

357
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,317
lying that she spoke good English
and went to university.

358
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,987
I wanted to have my own person
in the house.

359
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,824
I had no idea back then
how crazy she really was.

360
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:55,043
<i>When you were nine years old, no one knew.</i>

361
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:59,840
<i>Ever since then,</i>
<i>you've been throwing stones at them.</i>

362
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,141
<i>The stones became bigger and bigger,</i>

363
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,893
and now, they've become missiles.

364
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,026
I was born to the weakest woman
in a powerless, small country

365
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,863
that let other countries decide
its wars and fate.

366
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,866
And even that woman abandoned me.
Isn't it incredible?

367
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:30,328
That someone like me can now pay them
back for everything?

368
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:34,916
All those letters you sent to America
looking for your mother…

369
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,919
<i>Mom, please write back to me.</i>

370
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,921
<i>If you'd let me know where you are,</i>

371
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,716
<i>I'll send you a big Christmas present</i>
<i>one day.</i>

372
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,302
<i>I'm sending you a photo I took recently.</i>

373
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,389
<i>It was a beautiful day, and I spent</i>
<i>the whole day thinking about you.</i>

374
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,557
Come on, hurry.

375
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,392
"MAIL"

376
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:54,978
"RETURNED"

377
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,022
<i>They were returned as "recipient unknown."</i>

378
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,235
But missiles tend to find the recipient,
don't they?

379
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,993
You seem to think

380
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm some kind of child trying to fire
a nuclear missile at my own mother.

381
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:19,920
You're wrong.

382
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,841
I wanted to become
the most powerful person in the world.

383
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,135
And how would I make that happen?

384
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,890
By quietly pressing a button.

385
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,606
Some people brag about
having the world's strongest military,

386
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,651
about their territories, their resources,
and their weapons.

387
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,532
But I'm going to press the button.

388
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,284
No one will know.

389
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:54,788
And I'll be greater
than the President of the United States.

390
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,791
And why not?

391
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,587
America has no problem starting wars

392
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,298
that could kill millions of lives
in other nations

393
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:08,385
just to protect itself
from a potential threat.

394
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,264
You wasted your breath running around
trying to stop this war.

395
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:17,769
But it'll be me in the end
who truly brings peace.

396
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,316
Because when I press the button,

397
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,988
everyone in the world will forget about
some war on the Korean Peninsula.

398
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,865
They'll be thinking about one thing.

399
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,992
Peace, and nothing but peace.

400
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,785
And for the next thousand years,

401
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,163
humanity will remember tonight.

402
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,457
You think that you're a god or something,
don't you?

403
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:44,296
Yeah, I can see the thrill you're getting
from all this.

404
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,508
What could be more thrilling than this?

405
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:53,972
Tell me, Mother.

406
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:58,310
Has it ever occurred to you that
someone could try to stop you?

407
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,985
They're freezing
your shell company accounts.

408
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,404
Doesn't matter.

409
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,072
And, Mom,

410
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,701
I just received an arrest warrant
from the court.

411
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,209
"ARREST WARRANT
LIM OKSEON"

412
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,920
You're under arrest
on suspicion of Jang Junik's murder.

413
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,548
Shut up.

414
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,133
You don't know what you're talking about.

415
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,636
Just hold on until midnight.

416
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,726
You have the right to remain silent.
And you have the right to an attorney.

417
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,977
Are you insane?

418
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:44,814
The true source of the money you sent
under Yeo Miji's name to Kim Yongjun.

419
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,442
The list of illegally imported firearms

420
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:51,071
with the serial number
of the gun Kim Yongjun used.

421
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,490
I listened to every recording
from your room and Junik's

422
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,826
before and after the incident,
while I was in Germany.

423
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:58,912
<i>Set up an account</i>

424
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:02,249
under Munju's aide's name
and then send the money through it,

425
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:03,917
so we can use it as evidence later.

426
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,131
"YEO MIJI"

427
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,143
<i>The serial number</i>
<i>of the gun Kim Yongjun used</i>

428
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,855
<i>was found on your list</i>
<i>of illegally imported firearms.</i>

429
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,984
That's how
I was able to secure all the evidence.

430
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,904
You really think
that's enough to send me to prison?

431
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,579
That day…

432
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,210
you were crying when it happened.

433
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,509
<i>In Junik's room.</i>

434
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,352
Assemblyman Jang.

435
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,941
<i>Right up until the phone rang.</i>

436
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,251
You didn't murder him because of me.

437
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,506
Did you really think
I was that much of a scumbag?

438
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,301
Just once…

439
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:41,765
Just once, I wanted to have
a real conversation with you, Mom.

440
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,104
I guess we can speak
at the Prosecutors' Office.

441
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,618
There's a prosecutor here
who wants to arrest me.

442
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:05,288
He must think he's on dry land.
Come here and take care of it.

443
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,677
The Coast Guard is on our tail.
You should go. Try and escape.

444
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,020
Shots fired!
Hey, get over here. Quick!

445
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,271
Get over here! Move!

446
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,776
We are not running.

447
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:37,946
We fight.

448
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,127
<i>This is the Coast Guard.</i>
<i>You are surrounded.</i>

449
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,671
<i>Stop your vessel immediately and stand by.</i>

450
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,465
<i>I repeat, stop your vessel immediately</i>
<i>and stand by.</i>

451
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:02,262
<i>Attention, all hands.</i>

452
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,222
Come on, it's time to get up.

453
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,641
<i>All hands, man your battle stations.</i>

454
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,102
<i>We are being pursued.</i>

455
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,895
<i>All hands, man your battle…</i>

456
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,316
This ship has
two hotlines connected to North Korea.

457
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,610
One's in the control room we were just in,

458
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,529
and the other's up top,
in my mother's bedroom.

459
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,491
Let's call Kim Hansang from there
and tell him the accounts were frozen,

460
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,952
and try to convince him
to turn the submarine around.

461
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,496
"RESTRICTED AREA"

462
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,998
Let's go! Come on!

463
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,552
Requesting backup!

464
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,013
Crew members on the cargo ship
are resisting with heavy weapons!

465
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,266
Requesting backup!

466
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,439
Go get them.

467
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,941
Kill them if you have to.

468
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,026
Yes, ma'am.

469
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,809
Junsang.

470
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,143
I think I'll be okay.

471
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,149
Of course. You'll be fine.

472
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,194
Munju.

473
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,908
Go press one on the phone.
It'll connect you to him.

474
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,868
Go.

475
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,453
Turn this thing around.

476
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,748
When I was a kid…

477
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,669
Junik was all I had.

478
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:02,465
I always wanted to be at least
half as good as he was.

479
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,969
When he died,
that was the first thing I thought.

480
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,721
"Just be…"

481
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,976
"…half as good as he is."

482
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,521
Junsang, you're going to be okay.

483
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,898
I'll be back. Just hang in there.

484
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,317
I'll be back, okay.

485
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,520
<i>We've found the ship Seo Munju is on.</i>

486
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,355
<i>Find her and bring her back,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

487
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:02,775
However, you're still
going to be held accountable

488
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:06,487
for the abduction of the NIS director,
for bombing his home and the shootings.

489
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,323
Make sure you come back.

490
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,020
Get her!

491
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,907
No, this way.

492
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,536
Yeah. Here.

493
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,497
I thought I'd die before I saw you again.

494
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,545
I told you I'd be here.

495
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,947
Closing in at over 700 knots.

496
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,991
-Likely a fighter jet.
-I'll report the situation.

497
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,617
Connect me to the Control Room.

498
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,954
<i>Something's approaching</i>
<i>from the northeast. Likely a fighter jet.</i>

499
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,207
What do we do?

500
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,299
Air Force fighter jets are inbound.

501
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,093
You need to leave now.

502
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,943
Is the payment ready?

503
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,029
The payment won't be made.

504
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:39,242
The US has frozen all Aseom Shipping
accounts connected to Idisha.

505
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,037
Who is this?

506
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,039
This is Seo Munju.

507
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,749
I'm a former UN ambassador.

508
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,635
Huh, Chairwoman Lim's daughter-in-law.

509
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,179
You have to turn the submarine around.

510
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,432
<i>Lim Okseon is planning</i>
<i>to launch a nuclear missile</i>

511
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:04,934
<i>at the US on her own.</i>

512
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,978
<i>If she succeeds, Idisha and North Korea</i>

513
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,147
<i>will face indiscriminate retaliation.</i>

514
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,274
<i>The damage would be unimaginable.</i>

515
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,735
The nuclear briefcase is in Idisha.

516
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,738
It'll only be activated
once the payment is made.

517
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,866
Lim also has a briefcase.

518
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:21,701
<i>This was her plan from the start.</i>

519
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,452
Once the submarine is delivered,

520
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,663
she was going to push
the nuclear button herself.

521
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,652
We communicate with
the submarine every two hours.

522
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,404
And we can't reach them for another hour.

523
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,490
Is Lim already at sea,
heading into the Pacific Ocean?

524
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:02,575
That's right.

525
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,702
<i>We've deployed a surface ship</i>
<i>near the submarine.</i>

526
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,871
Once the submarine comes within range,

527
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,250
the command will be transmitted
in real-time.

528
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,211
You're transmitting commands
through the briefcase?

529
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,755
-<i>That's correct.</i>
-So if I destroy the briefcase,

530
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,673
the launch command won't go through?

531
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,759
<i>Yes, but you have to be careful.</i>

532
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,220
<i>If Lim has the briefcase,</i>

533
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,473
<i>she may have set it up</i>
<i>with a dead man's switch…</i>

534
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,768
Wait, what's that mean?

535
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,837
<i>Closing in on</i>
<i>the target's stern, maintaining speed,</i>

536
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,630
<i>radar is clear, preparing to engage.</i>

537
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:01,902
Drop your gun.

538
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,495
Step back now.

539
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,946
Are you okay?

540
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,532
She's up there.

541
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,603
It's all over, Mother.

542
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,613
The launch system

543
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:14,410
in the control room
will automatically activate if I die.

544
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:18,164
And the missile will
be fired at the United States.

545
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,708
"A dead man's switch."

546
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,213
Once the command is given,
the missile will launch in ten minutes.

547
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:32,887
To cancel it, you need to enter
this launch code in the control room.

548
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:41,812
And now it's gone.

549
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:06,253
Soon it'll all be over.

550
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:23,854
I've spent my life…

551
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,858
dreaming of this moment.

552
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,326
Ten minutes, Munju.

553
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,329
As soon as I'm dead.

554
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,214
There must be a device where
we can enter the launch code.

555
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,444
It's here.

556
00:51:58,949 --> 00:51:59,950
You should stay out here.

557
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:44,286
Lim Okseon is dead.
Give me the launch code.

558
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,497
<i>The launch code is</i>
<i>in the nuclear briefcase.</i>

559
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,416
The King of Idisha.

560
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,959
He has a briefcase, right?

561
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,504
Is the code the same?
We have to speak to him.

562
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,588
<i>Yes, it's the same code.</i>

563
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,465
<i>It has to match the one for the submarine.</i>

564
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,884
<i>Hello?</i>

565
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,067
<i>I received a call from Kim Hansang.</i>

566
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,694
<i>Are you prepared?</i>

567
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,445
Your Majesty.

568
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,162
Eight, seven…

569
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:34,378
<i>three, four, nine,</i>

570
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:38,006
<i>three, zero, two,</i>

571
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:44,096
<i>six, one, five, four.</i>

572
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,473
That's everything.

573
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:11,665
It's done.

574
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:13,709
Thank you.

575
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,086
Hope we talk again soon.

576
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,255
<i>Likewise.</i>

577
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,385
What's going on?

578
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:08,305
It's a pressure-release bomb.

579
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,974
There's also a timer set,
just like last time.

580
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:14,019
If I leave this booth,
then the bomb's going to explode.

581
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:18,065
-We can stop it if we get the code right…
-There's over 20 kilos of C-4.

582
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,442
So the whole ship is at risk.

583
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,406
We have to evacuate those people.

584
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:45,342
It's not working!

585
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,559
Go. Make them evacuate.

586
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:54,977
What about you?

587
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,939
I'll try to defuse the bomb.

588
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:00,816
I'm not leaving.

589
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,528
If I have eight minutes to live,

590
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,948
I want to spend all eight of them
with you.

591
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:38,937
The more urgent the mission is,
the more calmly I proceed.

592
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:42,941
We're having a normal conversation,
all right? Nothing out of the ordinary.

593
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,873
Do it just like before.

594
00:56:58,707 --> 00:56:59,791
Slowly,

595
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,085
like it's nothing special.

596
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,380
I can't. I want to be here.

597
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:07,799
There are too many people down there.

598
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,428
Peace. And everybody's safety.

599
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,848
Think about the things
you want to protect, Munju.

600
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,062
I don't need peace anymore.

601
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,273
If I leave now, I'll be

602
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,901
living in hell the rest of my life.

603
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:29,196
Munju, I need you to leave right now.

604
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,198
Give me a chance to defuse the bomb.

605
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,742
Last time, the bomb went off anyway.

606
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:38,205
But you weren't hurt.
And I still made it back to you safely.

607
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:44,169
Go to him. The head of the special forces.

608
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,506
Come back with a bomb technician.

609
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:55,305
Three minutes down,
and three minutes back.

610
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,350
Even if I get one minute with you,
I'll come back.

611
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,655
Stay down!

612
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:12,906
-Down!
-Don't move!

613
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,117
- Over here.
- I said don't move!

614
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,576
- No.
- Shut up!

615
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,332
Here!

616
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,086
Is there a bomb technician here?

617
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,463
There's explosives near the engine room.

618
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:31,133
-It's going to go off in four minutes!
-All units, evacuate.

619
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:33,719
- Evacuate!
- Evacuate immediately.

620
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:34,845
-Come on! Go, go!
-Move!

621
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:39,224
Is there a bomb technician here?
There's someone still inside!

622
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,059
- Move!
- Hey, hurry up! We gotta…

623
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:48,066
Let me go! Let me go! Now!

624
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:51,570
No, I have to go! Let me go!

625
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,904
We'll get you on a lifeboat.

626
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,866
No, I have to go back.

627
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,452
Let go of me!

628
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:01,705
- Let go of me right now! I have to go!
- Come on.

629
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,374
Let go of me! Let go!

630
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,376
I have to go back!

631
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,173
<i>Munju…</i>

632
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,426
<i>don't come back.</i>

633
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,227
I want you to keep going. Don't stop.

634
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:28,940
<i>Just keep going.</i>

635
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,279
<i>Keep moving forward.</i>

636
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:36,323
I can see you from here.

637
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,498
<i>Let me keep watching over you.</i>

638
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,001
<i>The path you'll be walking…</i>

639
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,296
<i>the people you'll meet.</i>

640
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:36,776
<i>Grandma.</i>

641
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,530
<i>I think I had a dream.</i>

642
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,535
<i>A dream</i>
<i>where I met a woman I could die for.</i>

643
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,914
<i>I wish I could stay asleep</i>

644
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,166
<i>forever.</i>

645
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:10,977
<i>Peace talks between the US</i>
<i>and Idisha have begun.</i>

646
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:15,106
<i>Anshar Nabu, the King of Idisha,</i>
<i>and UN ambassador Adele Zimmerman</i>

647
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,652
<i>met at Kirus Alaila Palace today</i>
<i>to sign a cease-fire agreement</i>

648
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,363
<i>as well as to discuss</i>
<i>the withdrawal of US troops…</i>

649
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:26,159
Is it true that your father was a spy?

650
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,704
My father, Seo Hyeongsik, was
falsely accused by the KCIA…

651
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:33,124
No, no. Just answer the question.
Is it true or not?

652
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,251
He was a spy.

653
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:38,588
You were recently accused
of espionage yourself, correct?

654
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:39,839
I was cleared of that

655
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:43,301
after Yu Unhak was arrested
for fabricating espionage charges.

656
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:46,763
You also were involved in an affair
with North Korean defector Paik Sanho,

657
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,974
an audio recording too disgraceful
to mention

658
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:51,768
played for the entire nation.
Was that fabricated, too?

659
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,229
Because of that, our party's name
was dragged through the mud.

660
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,106
Everyone in the country saw it
and heard it.

661
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,316
So how can you even show your face here?

662
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,943
Explain yourself and apologize!

663
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:09,035
We have all unanimously voted
to expel candidate Seo Munju

664
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,371
for disgracing the party's honor

665
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,707
and violating the duty to uphold dignity.

666
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,960
Oh, wait! Miss Seo Munju!

667
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:31,641
The rumors of my relationship
with Paik Sanho are real.

668
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,769
I don't believe that loving another person

669
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:37,397
is something that can ever diminish
anyone's dignity.

670
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,191
But if the party has judged

671
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:42,694
that my relationship has
blemished its reputation,

672
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,030
I will respect that.

673
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,324
However, I firmly believe that Paik Sanho

674
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:54,622
was more dignified than anyone
who sat on the ethics committee today.

675
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:56,249
No question.

676
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:07,052
You've been through so much.
And I'm sorry.

677
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,723
We've searched through the wreckage
and the surrounding area.

678
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:15,602
But we haven't found Paik Sanho's remains.

679
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,938
Even so, we'll find him no matter what.

680
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:20,565
I promise.

681
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,319
And I'd like to apologize.

682
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:29,282
It must've been so painful

683
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:34,662
having to make a choice between
handing over North Korean territory

684
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:37,540
or risking a war to achieve reunification.

685
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:44,798
I prayed for days, hoping
I wouldn't have to make that choice.

686
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:50,011
But it's the president's job
to make those kinds of hard decisions.

687
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,974
I'm so sorry.

688
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,392
I appreciate it.

689
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,020
Because of you, I made it back from hell,

690
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,981
but you lost too much.

691
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,484
All my decisions were my own.

692
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:11,032
The US has requested
you be sent as a special envoy.

693
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:14,786
They need your help mediating
with Idisha and North Korea

694
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,371
on the submarine's dismantlement.

695
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:19,874
And they also have some questions
about the Eagleton-Coldrain scandal.

696
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:23,920
If I speak out, won't it stir up
public opinion against you?

697
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:28,341
I'll take care of that.
There's a lot I want you to do.

698
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:36,307
WASHINGTON, D.C.

699
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:38,309
We're almost there. Um…

700
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:40,019
Remember,
keep it simple for the president.

701
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,563
North Korea built it,

702
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:45,608
Idisha bought it,
Aseom Shipping connected the two. Um…

703
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:49,404
Whenever you mention Eagleton,
mention Coldrain and Stella Young.

704
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,656
Um…

705
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:54,284
Be ready to discuss
dismantling the submarine,

706
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:55,660
but let him ask you.

707
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,203
Make him feel good, you know.

708
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,914
-Uh, hey.
-Hmm?

709
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,708
You got this.

710
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,668
You're not nervous, are you?

711
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,295
About this?

712
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:07,422
No.

713
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,468
Hey, I, um…

714
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,931
I never visited Korea because
I didn't feel like I had anybody,

715
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:20,560
but I guess I have you now.

716
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,437
Yeah.

717
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:24,314
You do have me.

718
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:29,694
Um…

719
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,322
I wanted to be the first to tell you

720
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:36,242
that the president is considering
giving the medal of honor to Paik Sanho.

721
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,077
That's right.

722
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:40,413
He was an American.

723
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:42,957
You know,

724
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,169
part of me believes

725
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,922
he's still alive somewhere.

726
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,758
I wish I could've met him.

727
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,511
The president will see you now.

728
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:09,651
Hey.

729
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,029
You're our only hope now.

730
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:17,033
I guess

731
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,661
we're in trouble then.

732
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,547
<i>"One of the greatest talks</i>
<i>I've had in years."</i>

733
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:33,758
<i>"A strong woman who brought peace</i>
<i>to the world."</i>

734
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,261
Did you see the poll results
from this morning?

735
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,846
Candidate… I mean, Ambassador,

736
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,307
even though you were disqualified
as a candidate,

737
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,559
you're still polling first
for the New Republican Party

738
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:46,312
at all eight polling agencies.
First place!

739
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,273
Calm down, Miji.

740
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,108
And remember. I'm not a candidate.

741
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:52,527
It's not just
within the New Republican Party.

742
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:55,238
Your approval rating
among all presidential candidates

743
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,532
has gone up significantly.

744
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:00,285
Presidential candidate registration
is open…

745
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:01,703
…until next week.

746
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,081
You can always still run
as an independent.

747
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:08,293
Miji, Changhee, I can't do it.

748
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:10,003
When I was running before,

749
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:14,215
it was only because I wanted
to find out why my husband died,

750
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,593
not because I thought
I deserved to be president.

751
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:20,138
Still though, Miss Seo.

752
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:23,808
If you ask me,

753
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:28,104
I don't believe that anyone
even comes close to being as qualified.

754
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,523
So just say the word, all right?

755
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:33,067
And I'll cancel my flight to the US.

756
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,945
You know, I've kept my schedule open
if you need anything.

757
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:39,782
Hey, listen.
Know when to stay in your own lane.

758
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,118
She's my ambassador.

759
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,619
She's my ambassador.

760
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,383
Hello?

761
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,260
<i>I'm leaving for Beijing.</i>

762
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,056
Madam President.

763
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,641
I did a lot of thinking last night.

764
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:09,645
<i>About how crucial the next few days,</i>

765
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:11,022
the next few months,

766
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:14,359
and the next few years will be
for the future of the Korean Peninsula.

767
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:18,196
And about how important
the subsequent leader's role will be

768
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,739
once my term ends.

769
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,077
I believe it should be you.

770
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:29,665
You know the strength it takes
to face the difficulties of our time.

771
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:35,546
<i>I'm thinking of leaving the party</i>
<i>and finding a way to support you</i>

772
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,131
<i>when I get back from Beijing.</i>

773
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:40,051
I don't think I can do it.

774
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:42,970
Why?

775
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:49,852
Because I'm still…

776
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:56,984
too heartbroken.

777
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,158
That's the type of president I want.

778
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,703
<i>Someone who's suffered deeply,</i>

779
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:11,040
<i>but still has the strength</i>
<i>to push through it,</i>

780
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:13,042
<i>and becomes stronger from it.</i>

781
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:15,795
<i>Even though you were a candidate</i>
<i>from the opposing party,</i>

782
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:19,215
if I endorse you,
it would send a message of unity.

783
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:23,678
A leader trying
to reunify the Korean Peninsula

784
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:26,055
should be capable of at least that much.

785
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:28,433
<i>Think about it carefully.</i>

786
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:31,894
<i>Not from your personal perspective…</i>

787
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,147
<i>…but from a historical perspective.</i>

788
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:54,625
<i>I had a dream. I was this woman.</i>

789
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,380
<i>I didn't believe in God,</i>

790
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,842
<i>but there was a church in my heart.</i>

791
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:06,554
<i>A place built with pillars</i>
<i>made from my father's bones,</i>

792
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,807
<i>walls plastered with my mother's flesh,</i>

793
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:13,686
<i>floors washed clean</i>
<i>with my husband's blood,</i>

794
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:19,275
<i>and where I sent the soul</i>
<i>of my precious little child up to heaven.</i>

795
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,612
<i>Before I came here,</i>

796
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:26,741
<i>I buried my love in the black hills</i>
<i>and prayed.</i>

797
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:32,663
<i>Take my place,</i>
<i>and bestow it upon this land.</i>

798
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,292
<i>And when there is enough peace</i>
<i>for everyone,</i>

799
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,586
<i>enough that no one needs it anymore,</i>

800
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:42,590
<i>then please,</i>
<i>return to me my poor, lost love.</i>

801
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:47,887
<i>Even though I don't believe in God,</i>
<i>the forgiveness of sins,</i>

802
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:52,892
<i>the resurrection of the body,</i>
<i>or life everlasting,</i>

803
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:57,021
<i>I know he will live inside me forever.</i>

804
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:11,721
<i>On, my Polaris.</i>

805
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:38,414
Seo Munju!
Seo Munju! Seo Munju!

806
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,546
"YOUR BATTLE IS OUR BATTLE,
SEO MUNJU"

807
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,839
"YOU GIVE GREAT STRENGTH TO US"

808
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:50,092
Seo Munju! Seo Munju!

809
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:05,691
Hello, citizens.

810
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,110
Welcome.

811
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:10,655
My name is Seo Munju.

812
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:18,204
I stand here today to officially announce
my candidacy

813
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:22,249
for the 22nd presidential election
of the Republic of Korea.

814
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:30,925
Seo Munju! Seo Munju!

815
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:49,986
TEMPEST
