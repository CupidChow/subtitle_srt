[Dujin] From the US perspective, the
reason that they see you as such a threat

99

is you capture the hearts and minds
of the public.

In an emergency,
I'd need to get through both doors.

172

173
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,292

for six bullets to be fired.

174
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,503

I approved this location.

175

176
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,718
I can't let you stay in a room with her,
especially if it locks from the inside.

177
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,348
[Miji] Okay. I'll let you figure this out.
Excuse me.

178
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,184
Here's hoping you two can
reach a fair agreement.

179
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,644
Ms. Seo, what do you think?

180
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,063
I'll sleep in here.
That solve the problem?

181
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,357
The two of you can share the big bed.

182
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,443
Mr. Paik, I'd like to speak to you.

183
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,861
Give us the room, please.

186
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,330
I appreciate your perfectionism
when it comes to security,

187
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,290
but your job is to protect me
so I can work.

188
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,584
I have more to do than just stay safe.

189
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,796
I always respect the opinions of my team.

190
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,882
And if you can't learn
to coordinate with them,

191
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,593
we can't work together.

192
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,679
You think I was aiming for perfection?

193
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,598
I wish that were possible.

194
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,850
There's no such thing as perfection here.

195
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,854
To achieve that, I'd have to lock you
in a room with no windows or doors.

196
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,940
And it still wouldn't be enough.

197
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,942
Someone could blow up the room.

213
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,853

214
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,941
I want you to keep a close eye
