Brother Zhuofeng,

27
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,890
these belonged to Lu Yi before she died.

28
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,300
What do you want them for?

29
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,130
Brother Zhuofeng,

30
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,850
is this Lu Yi's...

31
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,829
Code book.

32
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,820
The Thunder Gang colluded with One Heart

33
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,790
in trafficking girls.

34
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,610
After the Lu family fell,

35
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,760
your Uncle Yin Lei

36
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,470
was the first to kick us
when we were down.

37
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,460
I don't want to see him among the guests.

38
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,380
Maybe there's a misunderstanding

39
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,190
between the Lu family and Uncle Lei.

40
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,140
Yin Zhuofeng,

41
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,890
your Uncle Lei
controls the entire Thunder Gang.

42
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,290
Don't you know what kind of dirty business

43
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,730
he's been involved in?

44
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,050
Looks like Lu Yi
found out before the wedding

45
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,210
the Thunder Gang is the one
that has colluded with One Heart.

46
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,810
No wonder on the wedding day,

47
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,089
Yin Lei was desperate to rush in

48
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,200
and kill Lu Yi.

49
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,940
Uncle Lei.

50
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,510
Yin Zhuofeng, come here.

51
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,910
What kind of woman are you marrying?

52
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,210
See for yourself.

53
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,780
Priest is still alive?

54
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,550
Not just that.

55
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,180
He even sent this woman to the Yin family.

56
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,040
They're both

57
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,840
members of One Heart.

58
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,170
Zhuofeng,

59
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,050
is there some misunderstanding?

60
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,380
Uncle Lei,
this involves One Heart and Priest.

61
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,110
Let us interrogate Lu Yi first.

62
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,930
One Heart deliberately

63
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,610
planted her in the Yin family.

64
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,030
The evidence is solid.

65
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,900
Is it necessary to investigate?

66
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,920
Have you forgotten

67
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,780
how your mother died?

68
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,530
Of course I haven't forgotten.

69
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,580
Spies from One Heart must die!

70
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,900
Uncle Lei accused her
to cover for himself.

71
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,560
He killed Lu Yi to silence her.

72
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,960
Then he immediately fled Hai City.

73
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,530
He feared Bronze Leaf and Brother Zhuoyi
would investigate him at the same time.

74
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,460
Brother Zhuofeng,

75
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,140
Lu Ye wants the truth so badly.

76
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,930
Should we tell her?

77
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,560
No.

78
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,130
We still don't know

79
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,000
how serious the trouble is.

80
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,390
We'll tell her after we figure it out.

81
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,130
Yin Lei abducting those girls

82
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,590
must have something to do with One Heart.

83
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,890
Keep a close eye on Yin Huanyuan.

84
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,650
Got it.

85
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,640
Lu Ye?

86
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,360
Young Master Zhuoqian.

87
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,150
Thank you for your coat.

88
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,510
The coat...

89
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,850
Don't overthink it.

90
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,740
I just want to tell you

91
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,870
I'm not as weak as you think.

92
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,370
I'll show you

93
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,810
I won't be defeated.

94
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,040
I will become tougher

95
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,430
and stronger.

96
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,690
Thank you for helping me when I was alone

97
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,570
and helpless.

98
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,270
Don't mention it.

99
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,100
You're Lu Yi's younger sister.

100
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,760
Lu Yi...

101
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,140
Bronze Leaf isn't a place for you

102
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,710
to socialize or make friends.

103
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,840
Get to training now.

104
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,940
Okay, right away.

105
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,630
I need to find a way in.

106
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,410
There must be files
about my sister in that room.

107
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,600
Young Master Huanyuan,

108
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,740
do I look like
that young lady from the Lu family?

109
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,410
Your eyes have no soul.

110
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,360
Her eyes are bright.

111
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,159
Now you look alike.

112
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,090
Yes, yes. Like this.

113
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:39,960
Now you look like her.

114
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,640
Cry.

115
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,230
Continue to cry.

116
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,630
Yin Huanyuan,

117
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,430
how long are you going to keep playing?

118
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,550
Miss Jinzhi.

119
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:56,890
Get out.

120
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,000
Huanyuan,

121
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,000
your father and my father
built the Thunder Gang together.

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,240
My father died early.

123
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,050
Now your father is missing.

124
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,220
Looks like he's abandoned the gang.

125
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,250
You can take this opportunity

126
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,250
to gain control of the Thunder Gang.

127
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,450
Why waste so much effort

128
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,820
helping him traffic women?

129
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,000
Huanyuan, are you alone?

130
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,050
I've been dealing with some things,
lying low for now.

131
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,120
As for the Thunder Gang,

132
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,890
you handle it for the time being.

133
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,650
The matter of arranging dancing girls—

134
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,970
keep a close eye on it.

135
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,610
Father,

136
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,289
where are you?

137
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,980
Do you really think that old man

138
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,880
just wants dancing girls?

139
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,309
What do you mean?

140
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,910
The Thunder Gang is nothing.

141
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,060
My father has wanted
to take over the Yin family

142
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,400
for a long time.

143
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,710
Keep a close eye
on those dancing girls we've sent.

144
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,900
I'd like to see

145
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,900
who's really behind this.

146
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,420
This is how they fought.

147
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,330
If she keeps practicing like this,

148
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,760
she can never take revenge.

149
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,360
She'll just wreck her hands.

150
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:23,860
Go.

151
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,250
Teach her the basics.

152
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,210
Brother Zhuofeng,

153
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,850
why do you always ask me to do

154
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,260
what you want to do?

155
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,690
Just go when I tell you to.

156
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,390
Brother Zhuofeng,

157
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,610
no matter what you say this time...

158
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,330
I'll go.

159
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,430
Why are you still practicing at this hour?

160
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,560
No one's here at this hour.
It's more comfortable.

161
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,850
Relax your body when you throw punches.

162
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,160
When you practice,

163
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,240
remember to flex your wrists,

164
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,900
so you don't hurt yourself.

165
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,650
Follow me.

166
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,040
Get into stance.

167
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,740
Keep your fists tight, knuckles flat.

168
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,000
The power comes from your feet
to your waist,

169
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,510
from your waist to shoulders,

170
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,340
then from shoulders to arms.

171
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,440
From feet to the waist.

172
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,880
From the waist to shoulders.

173
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,060
Very good.

174
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,680
Come on, follow me.

175
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,640
Left straight.

176
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,140
Right straight.

177
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,780
Left hook.

178
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,890
Right hook.

179
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,350
Left uppercut.

180
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,580
Right uppercut.

181
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,090
Didn't you eat?

182
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,020
Can you put some strength into it?

183
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,330
So fierce.

184
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,730
Left straight.

185
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,070
Right straight.

186
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,300
Right uppercut.

187
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,640
Dodge.

188
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,630
Two.

189
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,380
Dodge.

190
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:04,880
Dodge.

191
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,160
I managed to hit you.

192
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,680
Did you do that on purpose?

193
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,240
Brother Zhuofeng.

194
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,220
Thank you, Young Master Zhuoqian.

195
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,700
Thank you, Young Master Zhuofeng.

196
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,010
Brother Zhuofeng,

197
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,830
is this intentional?

198
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,450
Eat. It's sweet.

199

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,720

Why are you here?

217
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,020
To get Zhuoqian's coat for him.

218
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,910
Wait.

219
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,230
These days...

220
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,360
I've improved a lot.

221
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,660
So?

222
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,780
So...

223
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,850
do you want to see

224
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,610
how effective my training was?

225
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:19,770
Come on.

226
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,380
This is how effective your training was?

227
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:03,850
Again.

228
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,140
You're too slow.

229
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,060
Again.

230
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,790
Again.

231
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,120
You're too fast.

232
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,710
You're too impatient.

233
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,410
No matter how hard you train,

234
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,300
your physical strength

235
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,040
can hardly surpass a man's.

236
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,050
So you need to learn to observe.

237
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,190
Stall.

238
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,440
Wear down their patience.

239
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Wait for the right moment to strike.

240
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,380
Use your own advantages

241
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,830
and be clever.

242
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,640
Target their weak spots.

243
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,090
The throat.

244
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,900
The temple.

245
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,260
You must wait for the right moment

246
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,500
and target their weak spots.

247
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,110
Your turn.

248
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,869
Are... Are you okay?

249
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,140
Remember,

250
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,300
never let your guard down

251
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,460
against your enemy.

252
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,470
That's enough training for today.

253
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,780
Go take a shower.

254
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,850
No need. I'll just wipe myself down.

255
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,780
No, no, no.

256
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,550
I'll stand guard.

257
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,340
Go ahead.

258
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,760
Who are you?

259
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,790
What do you want?

260
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,970
Sheriff Zhang,

261
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,240
take a good look at this woman.

262
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,420
Is she a wanted fugitive?
