00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,540
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,220
I didn't know she was your sister.

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,070
Please forgive me.

6
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,080
I've been looking for you all day.

7
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,660
Why have you been hiding?

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,470
Do you know
who was at the fighting ring today?

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,570
Are you blaming me

10
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,240
for hurting her sister?

11
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,900
Don't you forget that

12
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,770
the person who sent me up there

13
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,150
was you.

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,790
I sent you up there to compete.

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,060
To compete!

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,830
Using such tricks in front of Yin Zhuofeng

17
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,890
and my eldest brother

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,289
was asking for trouble. Do you understand?

19
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,730
Fine.

20
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,150
Ultimately,

21
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,390
it's my fault.

22
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,750
Before you met that woman,

23
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,950
you never taught me how to do things

24
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,390
or what rules to follow.

25
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,590
Why have you completely changed

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,700
after meeting that woman?

27
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,670
Even after I hurt her sister,

28
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,670
you're still feeling sorry for her.

29
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,910
Jinzhi.

30
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,259
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,450
I truly can't give you anything.

32
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,940
I know.

33
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,730
Sometimes, I just can't understand

34
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,950
why I love you so much,

35
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,620
and why I'm willing
to humble myself like this,

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,400
still hoping you might love me just once.

37
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,790
I'm a bastard.

38
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,740
I don't deserve to be loved.

39
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:29,740
Since your father has passed away,

40
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,910
you're free now.

41
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,590

44
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,210
Take it and enjoy your life.

Yin Huanyuan.

46
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,829
Remember this.

47
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,270
Today, it's not you
who are driving me away.

48
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,360
I, Xiao Jinzhi, am the one

49
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,640
who's going to

50
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,329
cut all ties with you.

[Episode 10: New Target]

53
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,510
Don't drink too much.

54
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,730
I can hold my liquor very well.

55
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,260
Isn't this the house I used to live in?

56
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,400
How did it suddenly become so beautiful?

57
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,470
This is still your house.

58
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,970
It's returned to its original owner.

59
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,790
Look at that star.

60
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,020
The brightest one.

61
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,430
That's my sister.

62
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:01,650
Because her eyes were so bright.

63
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,610
And that star,

64
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,260
the biggest one,

65
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
is my father.

66
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,530
When he passed away,

67
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,580
our house caught fire.

68
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,170
And that star

69
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,460
is my mother.

70
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,820
She's always circling around

71
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,380
my father and my sister.

72
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,090
Then that star...

73
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,990
That star is my mother.

74
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,180
The little stars around her

75
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,050
are the children

76
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,250
who were with her during the explosion.

77
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,090
Your mother is so beautiful and radiant.

78
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,500
Hello, Mrs. Yin!

79
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,409
Don't worry,

80
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,440
Yin Zhuofeng is doing well.

81
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,460
He's quite impressive now.

82
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,530
Yi!

83
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,580
You also don't need to worry.

84
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,610
Now I'm also

85
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,280

86
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,900
and quite impressive.

87
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,020
I miss you so much.

88
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,409
Do you remember this?

89
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,260
Your stars.

90
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,580
How come you have this?

91
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,290
I'm making stars appear for you.

92
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,460
Is it beautiful?

93
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,120
Yes, it is.

94
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,970
I can not only make stars appear
but also set off fireworks.

95
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,990
There are stars in the sky.

00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,950
I'm not smiling.

130
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,020
You're clearly smiling.

131
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,590
I'm really not smiling.

132
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,450
You've got serious issues.

133
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,410
Stop talking nonsense.

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,340

136
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,980
That man.

137
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,970
The information he gave is true.

138
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,970
We did find

139
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,380
traces of Yin Lei in Tang City.

140
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,910
But we still need to confirm

141
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,170
where he's hiding exactly.

142
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,100
That guy

143
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,450
is extremely cunning.

144
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,380
Besides Yin Lei,

145
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,510
do you have any news from Hai City?

146
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,580
Recently, there have been many officials
from Hai City going to Tang City.

147
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,460
But strangely,

148
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,810
their purpose was not for
official business.

149
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,140
And they traveled

150
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,220
in private vehicles.

151
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,900

One Heart.

155
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,220
Yin Lei is using dancers

156
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,990
to help One Heart

157
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,860
bribe Hai City's officials.

158
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,650
One Heart is colluding
with the Thunder Gang

159
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,810
to smuggle opium

160
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,570
into Hai City.

161
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,780
I've made some breakfast.

162
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,140
Come here and eat.

163
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,530
Thank you, Zhuofeng.

164
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,810
It's sweet.

165
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,020
Lu Ye.

166
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,620
Is this

167
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,110
your way of making up for

168
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,470
what you did last night?

169
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,260
What did I do

170
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,690
last night?

171
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,100
I can't remember anything.

172
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,420
I saw everything.

173
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,140
You were drunk and acting wildly.

174
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,980
You slept leaning on Zhuofeng all night.

175
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,530
It's not a big deal.

176
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,760
Something else happened, too.

177
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,890
What else happened?

178
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,690
You also...

179
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,470
You also smashed wine bottles everywhere.

180
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,800
Then I had to clean up
the mess all morning.

181
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,450
By the way, Lu Ye,

182
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,610
after my brother bought back

183
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,570
this Lu family's old house,

184
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,980
I've always been the one who cleans it.

185
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,710
I finally got it all cleaned up,

186
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,420
but you won't be staying long,

187
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,950
and you'll be leaving soon.

188
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,810
What's my next mission?

189
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,530
This time, One Heart is making a comeback

190
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,420
to smuggle opium into Hai City.

191
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,020
For this purpose, they're colluding
with Yin Lei

192
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,329
to bribe Hai City's officials
with dancers.

193
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,260
The location is

194
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,570
the Golden Pleasure Club in Tang City.

195
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,180
So my mission is to

196
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,740
pretend to be a dancer

197
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,130
and infiltrate the Golden Pleasure Club?

198
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:35,930
That's right.

199
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,660
We need to use these corrupt officials

200
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,810
to get the exact plan of smuggling opium

201
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,810
and wait for the chance
to kill the leader of One Heart,

202
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:44,940
the Priest.

203
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,290
Lu Ye.

204
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,660
This mission

205
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,530
isn't like a battle in the fighting ring.

206
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,730
There are no referees

207
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,090
and no rules.

208
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,810
Once you enter there,

209
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,510
you won't even have a chance to surrender.

210
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,330
At worst,

211
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,810
I'll end up like my sister.

212
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,460
Right?

213
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,420
There are such paths.

214
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,540
Once you start the journey on them,

215
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,470
there will be no turning back.

216
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,000
I won't look back.

217
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,850
Because I have you guys

218
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,460
behind me.

219
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,780
It's time for me to become

220
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,130
a real dancer.

221
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,890
Lu Ye.

222
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,700
With your great talent,

223
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,340
there won't be any problems.

224
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,420
Before you become a dancer,

225
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,270
forget about all the missions

226
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,130
and just be yourself for a day.
