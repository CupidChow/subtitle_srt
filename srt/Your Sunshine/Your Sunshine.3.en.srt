00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,670
What tasks does Bronze Leaf usually do?

2
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,230
All the things that the Yin family
can't do openly

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,540
are handled by Bronze Leaf.

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,740
Few outsiders know my brother's existence.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,600
But Bronze Leaf, led by my brother,

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,660
is the Yin family's

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,590
secret blade.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,920
So what does this secret blade usually do?

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,240
-Master Zhuofeng! Master Zhuoqian!
-Master Zhuoqian!

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,240

Continue with the training.

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:36,790
Okay.

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,080
The Yin family's position
in Hai City is as solid as rocks.

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,840
But there are always people
trying to to undermine it.

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,640
Bronze Leaf is quite clear about

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,700
who they are and how they'll do that.

17
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,580
I see.

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,750
So it's about gathering information.

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,950
Why are you making it sound so ordinary?

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,610
Has Uncle Lei's driver confessed yet?

21
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,900
Not yet.

22
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,970
Wu is still interrogating him.

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,950
Master Zhuofeng,

24
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,170
when the Action Team caught him,

25
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,980
they said he swallowed a piece of paper.

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,780
He still refuses to tell us

27
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,510
what was written on that paper.

28
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,710
When Bronze Leaf
tries to figure out the truth,

29
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,110
in extremely rare cases,

30
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:16,539
we'll use certain special methods.

31
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,260
Most of the time,

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,180
we're quite gentle in our interrogation.

33
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,780
Either you tell me yourself,

34
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,110
or I'll take it out to have a look myself.

35
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,390
Tell me.

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:33,979
I'll tell you.

37
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,100
This is...

38
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,780
a special case.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,630
Continue with the interrogation.

40
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,270
Yes.

41
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,370
The exit is over there.

42
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,670
Make your choice.

43
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,620
What kind of people

44
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,630
would come to this place?

45
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,110
The exiles who have abandoned

46
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,300
their original identities.

47
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,419
If you stay,

48
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,449
you'll be the only woman here.

49
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,620
But you won't receive
any special treatment due to your gender.

50

Though I'm a woman,

51
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,130
it has nothing to do with
whether I'll stay or not.

52

This place

54
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,670

There's an empty room over there.

00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,500
You can go in first.

190
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,980
Sister, I want to see the stars.

191
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,560
Alright.

Three.

195
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,700
Two.

196
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,220
One.

197
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:20,150
♪ I'll count to three

198
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,370

It looks so good.

202

♪ Then let's evade the stars

204
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,220

I've searched...

223
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,400
It's already cold at night.

224
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,620
Why is she...

225
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,430
sleeping here?

226
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Give me your coat.

227
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,670
Why should I take off my coat?

228
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,720
It's freezing.

229
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,750
I'll do it myself.

230
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,770
Hurry up.

231
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,630
How confusing.

232
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,260
Zhuofeng.

233
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,520
You're always so thoughtful.

234
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,190
However,

235
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,020
why didn't you use your own coat?

236
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,220
I'm afraid of the cold.

237
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,550
You're afraid of the cold?

238
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,380
You're someone who can swim in winter.

239
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,190
In my opinion,

240
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,190
you just don't want her to know, huh?

241
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,920
You're talking too much today.

242
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,730
I'm just afraid she'll misunderstand.

243
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,370
What if she falls for me?

244
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,930
She once held this hand of mine
when we ran together.

245
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,490
Get an oil lamp

246
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,690
and put it beside her.

247
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,150
Got it.

248
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,330
It's 9 o'clock.

249
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,050
Lu Ye.

250
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,330
You finally showed up.

251
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,630
Is this...

252
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,900
the place where everyone usually trains?

253
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,700
That's right.

254
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,620
This is the public training area.

255
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,680
Bronze Leaf operates on a bounty system.

256
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,050
Our missions are linked to rewards.

257
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,220
Jia Fan has always been at the top
of the rankings.

258
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,270
If you see him,

259
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,190
you'd better stay away from him.

260
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,990
Are you okay?

261
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,200
What is a woman like you
doing in Bronze Leaf?

262
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,260
I'm doing exactly what you're doing.

263
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,660
I understand.

264
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,990
Some missions require lying down,

265
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,530
and you're suitable for those missions.

266
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:44,860
Come on.

267
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,370
Jia Fan, she's new here

268
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,070
and doesn't know
this punching bag is yours.

269
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,050
She was brought here by Master Zhuofeng.

270
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,210
Let's all get along well from now on.

271
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,900
I apologize to you on her behalf.

272
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,840
Jia Fan.

273
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,190
I'm sor...

274
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,470
Qiu Cheng.

275
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,230
As a member of the Intelligence Team,

276
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,490
you always sit indoors

277
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,940
and never get hurt or be exposed to rain.

278
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,010
Why are you doing the training here?

279
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,070
The exit is right there.

280
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,070
Make your choice.

281
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,380
If you stay,

282
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,150
you'll be the only woman here.

283
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,460
But you won't receive
any special treatment due to your gender.

284
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,260
To improve myself in this place,

285
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,180
I have to be tougher and more fearless

286
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,390
than everyone else.

287
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,570
You...

288
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,990
What?

289
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,010
Bronze Leaf is a place
where we earn our living with skills,

290
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,670
not with fists or brute force.

291
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,310
As for what I'm going to do,

292
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,450
just wait and see.

293
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,470
Qiu Cheng.

294
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,810
Let's go.

295
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,170
What are you looking at? Do the training!

296
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,370
Master Zhuofeng, Master Zhuoqian.

297
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,440
If you're not able to stay here,

298
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,380
just get lost.

299
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,480
I'm not scared.

300
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,099
It's just my first day.

301
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,750
I want to get familiar
with the environment first.

302
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,040
Since you're not training,

303
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,640
go clean up the storage room.

304
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,849
I'm sorry, Master Zhuofeng.

305
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,420
You asked me to take better care of her.

306
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,270
But I...

307
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,400
It's alright.

308
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,730
Go ahead with your work.

309
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,150
Impressive.

310
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,140
You rank first again this month.

311
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,140
Ranking first

312
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,790
is nothing special.

313
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,580
Come on. Let's practice.

314
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,160
What are the rules?

315
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,240
There are no rules.

316
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,420
You're indeed the top one of Bronze Leaf.

317
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,680
Only you can exchange a few blows with me.

318
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,080
Practice more.

319
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,420
Come on, Jia Fan,

320
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Practice with me.

321
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,240
So you're going all out?

322
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,660
Jia Fan.

323
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,990
Lu Ye didn't mean to go against you.

324
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,160
She also hopes to get along well with you.

325
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,960
I understand.

326
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,830
I'll get along well with her.

327
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:05,930
This...

328
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,470
is the smell of blood.

329
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,800
Can you feel it?
