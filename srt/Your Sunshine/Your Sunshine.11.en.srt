You're pushing her into danger!

190
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,060
I should have stopped Lu Yi
from marrying you.

191
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,660
You were never worthy of her!

192
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,020
Can you men

193
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,810
talk more and fight less?

194
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,020
I have my own way of protecting Lu Ye.

195
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,130
I don't need you, Yin Huanyuan,
to lecture me.

196
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,480
Anyway, I, a scumbag, won't help you.

197
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,460
Go ask for someone else's help.

198
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,980
It's okay.

199
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
I've received

200
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,350
your apology.

201
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,380
You'll probably never understand

202
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,070
my sister's dream or mine.

203
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,860
Let's go.

204
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,880
Okay.

205
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,770
Young Master, Master Yin just called.

206
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,270
He said they'd make a move
against Young Master Zhuofeng today,

207
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,270
and asked you to handle the cleanup.

208
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,400
Dealing with Yin Zhuofeng at this time?

209
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,200
What on earth is the old man up to?

210
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,800
What's wrong?

211
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,150
Looks like someone tampered with the car.

212
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,730
Who are those people?

213
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,980
What are you doing?

214
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,930
Stay in the car

215
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,740
until I take care of them.

216
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,730
There's a gun inside.

217
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,790
Protect yourself.

218
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,220
Yin Zhuofeng!

219
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,610
Open the door!

220
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,290
Yin Zhuofeng!
