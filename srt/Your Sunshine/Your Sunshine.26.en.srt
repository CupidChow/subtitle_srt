1
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,980
Sir, a pot of tea please.

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,700
Okay.

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,500
Please enjoy it.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,370
That Xinghua Village isn't small.

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,580
There are at least six warehouses

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,580
where they could store the goods.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,660
I've already asked some people
to stay there

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,260
to check the goods one by one.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,050
There are just too many ships at the dock.

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,400
We can't confirm it in such a short time.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,930
But we're still searching.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,370
I have a feeling

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,490
that Xiao Jinzhi is up to something.

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,850
She gave us the clues in this way

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,650
just to play tricks, didn't she?

16
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,350
Just make sure we won't be tricked by her.

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,490
There's still time.

18
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,750
Let's keep searching.

19
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,610
Why didn't you watch carefully
while walking?

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,500
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,020
Ye,

22
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,390
why are you standing here in a daze?

23
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,870
The show in the theater is about to start.

24
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,130
Yi.

25
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,410
I miss you so much.

26
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,940
It's time.

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,530
Let's go now.

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,510
[Your Sunshine]

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,420
[Episode 26: The Final Battle]

30
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,140
You're awake.

31
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,780
Why did you abduct me and bring me here?

32
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,110
For revenge, of course.

33
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,290
Don't worry.

34
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,450
I've already sent someone
to inform Yin Zhuofeng

35
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,250
about your abduction.

36
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,450
There's still half an hour left.

37
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,110
If he doesn't come to save you,

38
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,170
he'll have to collect your corpse.

39
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,180
And of course,

40
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,970
after he collects your corpse,

41
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,940
I'll send his corpse

42
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,290
to Yin Zhuoyi.

43
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,010
They can all

44
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,530
be brothers in the netherworld.

45
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,220
The Yin brothers
don't have any deep grudges against you.

46
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,730
Do I need some deep grudges

47
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,130
to deal with them?

48
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,130
The Yin brothers

49
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,180
have all bullied and humiliated me.

50
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,230
During that competition at Bronze Leaf,

51
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,530
Yin Zhuofeng forced Yin Huanyuan

52
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,850
to stab himself.

53
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,210
It was Yin Zhuoyi who pressured everyone
to drive me away.

54
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,290
What's more,

55
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,570
Yin Huanyuan...

56
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,780
I followed him with absolute loyalty

57
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,970
and loved him wholeheartedly,

58
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,690
but he just trampled over my sincerity.

59
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,470
Does he really think
it's so easy to bully me?

60
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,850
Maybe your approach is wrong.

61
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,220
Shut up.

62
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,940
You got what you wanted,

63
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,150
so don't act high and mighty

64
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,250
to tell me whether my methods

65
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,730
are right or wrong.

66
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,940
Oh, right.

67
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,290
And Yin Lei, too.

68
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,550
I don't quite like him, either.

69
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,820
But the correctest thing he has ever done

70
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,300
is killing your sister.

71
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,620
Now I finally understand

72
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,650
why Yin Huanyuan looks down on you.

73
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,210
Xiao Jinzhi.

74
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,930
During that competition at Bronze Leaf,

75
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,010
Yin Huanyuan had high hopes for you,

76
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,750
but you still lost to me

77
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,890
and were defeated by me.

78
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,740
You can't even defeat me.

79
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,510
How dare you
compare yourself with my sister?

80
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,250
You don't deserve it.

81
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,100
So you're trying to provoke me?

82
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,420
Even if we competed ten more times,

83
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,940
you still couldn't defeat me.

84
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,100
Young Master Zhuofeng.

85
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,930
Miss Kawashima knew
you would find this place.

86
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,060
She asked me to show you something.

87
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,570
What does Xiao Jinzhi want to do?

88
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,040
Miss Kawashima has said that

89
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,170
you'll have half an hour to go save her.

90
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,010
Or

91
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,420
you can choose to

92
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,040
stay here and fight against us
to get the goods.

93
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,820
She thinks too highly of herself.

94
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,610
Lu Ye doesn't need me to save her at all.

95
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,930
Come on.

96
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,230
I'm giving you a chance.

97
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,710
Let's see whose knife
will drop first today.

98
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,620
Anyway, you'll die in the end.

99
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,110
I'll just let you die knowing why.

100
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,490
Put them down!

101
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,290
Put the guns down!

102
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,330
Time's almost up.

103
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,860
Let's finish this quickly.

104
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,980
Zhuofeng, the flashlight!

105
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,940
It looks like the address
Huanyuan gave us is real.

106
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,780
This note

107
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,670
is all about some undestroyed opium.

108
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,850
Our people will come here
to deal with the goods soon.

109
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,090
Stay here and guard this place.

110
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,980
I'll go find Lu Ye.

111
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,310
Don't worry, Zhuofeng.

112
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,850
Put the guns down.

113
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,980
Put them down!

114
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,370
Step back.

115
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,370
You lost again.

116
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,210
It's fine.

117
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,510
You won't be able to get out
of here today anyway.

118
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,600
I have conflicts with you,

119
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,080
but no real grudge.

120
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,830
I won't stab you this time.

121
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,320
If you continue to work for One Heart,

122
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,260
I will definitely kill you.

123
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,450
Xiao Jinzhi,

124
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,780
you don't play by the rules.

125
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,240
Have we ever set any rules?

126
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,780
I told you very clearly

127
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,370
that within half an hour,

128
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,090
if Yin Zhuofeng didn't come to save you,

129
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,020
he would have to collect your corpse.

130
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,450
Half an hour has passed,

131
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,620
but he still hasn't shown up.

132
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,420
It looks like

133
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,090
he has made his choice.

134
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,690
Or perhaps

135
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,490
he's already dead.

136
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,020
He'll be fine.

137
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,280
Don't move.

138
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,260
You really came.

139
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,260
Let her go.

140
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,390
We'll settle this between us.

141
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,970
Yin Zhuofeng is waiting for you.

142
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,820
You go first.

143
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,410
Take care.

144
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,420
Qiao Lin.

145
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,350
He's yours now.

146
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,350
Yes!

147
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,000
Stop!

148
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,270
Get out of here.

149
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,780
What were you doing just now?

150
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,660
I don't know, either.

151
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,420
Perhaps

152
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,710
this is just my instinct.

153
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,810
That's ridiculous, huh?

154
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,420
What are you doing?

155
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,620
Every time you get injured for me,
I'll repay you for your favor.

156
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,690
This cut

157
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,960
is to repay you for shielding me
from the knief just now.

158
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,730
No!

159
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,240
I've owed you this cut, too.

160
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,140
We grew up together.

161
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,570
I should've looked after you

162
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,610
like my own sister, but I failed.

163
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,750
I owe that to you.

164
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,140
I don't want you to repay me.

165
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,490
Did you hear that clearly?

166
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,370
Jinzhi.

167
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,010
I have to repay you.

168
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,070
Huanyuan!

169
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,020
Huanyuan!

170
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,450
Huanyuan!

171
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,300
This cut is due to
what I feel the guiltiest about.

172
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,200
You've made so many mistakes

173
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,530
all because of me.

174
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,960

Yin Huanyuan.

196
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,690
All the One Heart members outside
have been killed.

197
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,220
The opium they manufactured

198
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,880
have all been destroyed, too.

199
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,300
Peach.

200
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,480
She has realized her own mistakes

201
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,050
and is also willing to help us
eliminate One Heart.

202
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,420
Please spare her life.

203
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,569
Huanyuan.

204
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,329
Since I was a kid,

205
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,130
I've been so willful.

206
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,570
Just like a child craving candy,

207
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,100
I'm so eager to get your attention.

208
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,570
Today is the most carefree day

209
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,630
I've ever experienced.

210
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,230
I finally got my candy.

211
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,330
Some mistakes

212
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,100
are just mistakes with no excuses.

213
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,720
Now I should bear the consequences
of my own actions.
