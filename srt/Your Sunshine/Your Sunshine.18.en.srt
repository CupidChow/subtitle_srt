1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,660
Tonight,

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Ye is on an urgent mission
at the Golden Pleasure Club.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,910
We need to be ready
to assist her at any moment

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,110
to ensure her safety.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,060
Everyone, stay here.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,030
Before I give you the order,

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,660
don't act rashly.

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,640
Don't worry, Zhuofeng.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,450
I'll keep an eye on everything.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,750
[Your Sunshine]

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,710
[Episode 18: Run for Love]

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,470
Come on.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,800
Cut me,

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,720
but not too deep.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,200
Cut me.

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,830
Cut me!

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,180
The official you'll be receiving tomorrow

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,940
is the director
of Hai City Water Resources Bureau,

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,980
Zhang Chongzheng.

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,230
There's nothing wrong with his background.

21
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,570
But his medical examination report

22
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,670
shows some abnormalities.

23
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,750
Every once in a while,

24
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,750
new wounds would appear on his body.

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,670
I suspect...

26
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,780
Cut me!

27
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,810
He must have some unusual fetishes.

28
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,150
Another one with no sense of fun.

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,530
Where's the gun?

30
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,590
Very good.

31
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,870
Very good.

32
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,600
Come on. Come on.

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,780
Cut me again.

34
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,220
Cut me again.

35
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,880
It turns out that he's a pervert.

36
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,190
Director Zhang,
does your wound still hurt?

37
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,350
It doesn't hurt.

38
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,260
It's fine.

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
Director Zhang.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,800
What about your collaboration
with our boss lady?

41
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,010
Tell the Priest to come see me

42
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,860
next Monday.

43
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,550
We'll sign the contract.

44
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,079
Thank you, Director Zhang.

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,400
I finally got a lead on the Priest.

46
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,190
Don't be afraid.

47
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,240
Everything's fine now.

48
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,190
Come on.

49
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,650
Try this on.

50
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,110
It looks so good on you.

51
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,060
I was right about you indeed.

52
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,970
These are all your rewards.

53
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,700
Thank you, Miss Ding.

54
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,910
Mr. Zhang will stay in Tang City
for five more days,

55
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,970
so during these five days,

56
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,860
please spend more time with him.

57
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,390
Miss Ding.

58
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,420
I might be too nervous just now,

59
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,450
and I haven't calmed down yet.

60
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,670
I want to...

61
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,230
I want to go out to get some fresh air.

62
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,300
20 minutes.

63
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,830

I'm here

because firstly, I want to tell you

86
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,660
that I finished the mission successfully.

87
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,310
Secondly...

88
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,990
Secondly, I want to ask you a question.

89
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,830
That day, at the Golden Pleasure Club,

90
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,890
when you mentioned

91
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,100
that you liked the girl

92
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,700
who made stars appear
for you on the dark night,

93
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,760
what exactly did you mean by that?

94
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,140
I...

95
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,720
What I meant was...

96
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,670
I like you.

97
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,750
Three years ago,

98
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,830
when you protected me and saved me

99
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,560
at the Lu family residence,
I started to like you.

100
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,350
However, back then,

101
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,260
you were going to marry my sister.

102
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,560
So I told myself
I couldn't like you anymore.

103
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,950
Three years later,

104
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,670
I met you again.

105
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,690
We've been through so much together.

106
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,190
Just now,

107
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,460
I thought I was going to die.

108
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,880
I thought I could never see you again.

109
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:29,860
Yin Zhuofeng.

110
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,180
I like you.

111
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,760
What about you?

112
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,659
I...

113
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,320
I like...

114
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,400
Zhuofeng, something happened
at the Golden Pleasure Club!

115
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,890
There's no sign of activity.

116
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,310
As long as you give us the order,

117
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,910
I'll immediately lead our men
to break into...

118
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,250
Lu Ye.

119
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,460
Did you escape from there,

120
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,920
or did you finish the mission
successfully?

121
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,950
What do you think?

122
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,900
Lu Ye, you're really amazing.

123
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,500
Zhuofeng,

124
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,220
I told you Lu Ye
would handle it perfectly, huh?

125
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,330
Why are you glaring at me?

126
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,630
One Heart and Zhang Chongzheng

127
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,990
have reached an agreement.

128
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,870
Next Monday,

129
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,620
Zhang Chongzheng will sign the contract
with the Priest personally.

130
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,460
That's great.

131
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,830
The leader of One Heart

132
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,070
is finally going to show up.

133
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,200
When the time comes,

134
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,909
I'll use the excuse
of broadening my horizons

135
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,570
to persuade Zhang Chongzheng

136
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,440
into taking me to meet the Priest.

137
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,470
By that time,

138
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,100
I'll make the mantel clock fall
to give you the signal.

139
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,790
Okay.

140
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,220
Once the signal is given,

141
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,280
I'll rush upstairs

142
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,790
and capture the Priest.

143
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,270
I can only be out for 20 minutes.

144
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,070
I have to go now.

145
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,860
So soon?

146
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,890
Remember my question.

147
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,150
When we meet next time,

148
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,690
remember to give me an answer.

149
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,750
What question is it?

150
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,790
Zhuofeng.

151
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
What answer is it?

152
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,830
Zhuofeng.

153
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,400
Priest.

154
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,780
Zhang Chongzheng has agreed
to collaborate.

155
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,880
Now we just need to
sign the contract with him.

156
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,970
How's it going with Yin Zhuoyi?

157
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,640
How's the progress?

158
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,860
He...

159
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,350
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,550
I've really done my best to deal with him.

161
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,950
I've tried every way
I could think of, but he...

162
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,860
I understand.

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,700
You did your best, and that's fine.

164
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,750
I won't force you.

165
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,480
Then what about my younger sister?

166
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,560
How is she?

167
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,500
Don't worry.

168
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,110
We'll do our best to save Ding Le.

169
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,100
We won't let her die
on the operating table.

170
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,430
What do you mean by that?

171
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,750
Apart from Zhang Chongzheng,

172
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,950
I can still find ways to convince

173
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,310
other officials in Hai City.

174
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,910
I can make them all used by me.

175
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,400
But my sister...

176
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,730
I beg you.

177
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,300
Your sister's life or death

178
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,660
is up to you.

179
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,520
Whether she can leave
the operating table alive

180
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,500
depends on

181
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,430
whether you can make Yin Zhuoyi

182
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,210
sign this railway transport contract.

183
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,860
Ding Xi.

184
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,750
I'm looking forward to your good news.

185
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,650
Commander.

186
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,910
Are we really going back
to Hai City like this?

187
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,670
Have you prepared the car
for our return to Hai City?

188
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,830
Commander.

189
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,310
Xu Hai!

190
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,700
How about I let you
be the Commander of Hai City?

191
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,650
I've scheduled meetings with the Chairman
of Hai City Chamber of Commerce

192
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,650
and the President of Fenglong Bank.

193
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,960
We need to go back as soon as possible.

194
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
But those two people have always...

195
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,610
I'll go prepare the car.

196
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,620
Lieutenant Xu.

197
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,770
Why are you here again?

198
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,550
Are you leaving?

199
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,450
Can you please

200
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,760
not leave?

201
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,070
Yin Zhuoyi,

202
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,970
are you trying to run away?

203
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,220
You're such a useless and pathetic man.

204
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,630
There's a great opportunity for you
to make a fortune, but you don't want it.

205
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,160
Now you're going back
to Hai City in disgrace.

206
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,380
No wonder you have a financial crisis!

207
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,460
Take care.

208
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
Ding Xi.

209
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,520
You think now that you're the boss lady
of Golden Pleasure,

210
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,780
the people of One Heart

211
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,770
will actually respect you?

212
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,210
In my eyes,

213
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,850
you're just like a caged bird,

214
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,920
being servile and obsequious

215
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,250
with no self-respect.

216
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,340
Yin Zhuoyi.

217
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,910
I never thought that one day,

218
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,040
you would actually point a knife at me.

219
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,760

All these years...

245
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,290
Why didn't you tell me

246
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,820
about your sister earlier?

247
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,480
Someone like me

248
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,720
has lived in misery since childhood.

249
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,910
Those who are nice to me

250
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,340
are either plotting against me
or using me.

251
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,950
I don't trust anyone.

252
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,870
So I can't say anything to yield,

253
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,990
especially to the one I love.

254
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,430
Besides,

255
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,660
when One Heart used my sister's illness

256
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,990
to approach me,

257
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,010
your father had just passed away.

258
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,830
All the burdens fell on your shoulders.

259
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,340
About One Heart,

260
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,030
I promise you.

261
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,340
No.

262
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,420
I'm not saying this to make you pity me.

263
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,140
No.

264
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,740
I'll just consider it
as helping myself this time.

265
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,660
Zhuofeng.

266
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,040
Today's operation

267
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,970
was both exciting and successful.

268
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,420
The Priest wants to use Zhang Chongzheng
from the Water Resources Bureau

269
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,150
to smuggle opium into Hai City.

270
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,390
Next Monday,

271
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,750
as soon as he appears,

272
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,500
we'll assassinate him at once

273
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,100
when he's totally off guard.

274
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,620
Zhuofeng.

275
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,100
Why aren't you letting me eat?

276
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,900
In terms of your performance today,

277
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,830
you only deserve to eat plain rice.

278
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,420
I waited outside the Golden Pleasure Club

279
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,070
for totally five hours today.

280
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,470
I didn't slack off at all.

281
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,940
Without your order,

282
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,060
I rushed back immediately.

283
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,140
It was good that you rushed back.
