but both the Intelligence Team
and the Action Team

65
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,760
have been deployed.

71
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,710

72
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,120

73
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,310

81
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,000
Ding Xi is probably with Zhuoyi.

Why did you come to my place
looking for Ding Xi?

86
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,160
What you should be asking is

87
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,740
who Ding Xi is.

88
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,540
What exactly is your relationship
with Ding Xi?

89
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,120
Ding Xi and I

90
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,550
do share

91
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,260
a past romance,

92
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,050
and I have indeed

93
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,830
gone to Tang City to see her.

94
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,360
But as for her whereabouts,

95
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,350
I have no idea.

96
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,370
So, Zhuoyi, you're saying

97
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,410
you went to Golden Pleasure
just to meet an old flame?

98
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,050
Ding Xi's a member of One Heart.

99
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,030
Surely you know that.

100
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,340
Ding Xi is indeed a member of One Heart.

101
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,480
But do you know

102
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,320
who the leader of One Heart,

103
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,240
the Priest, really is?

104
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,520
He's the father of your beloved

105
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,210
Lu Ye,

106
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,150
and also the sworn enemy
of our Yin family,

107
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,480
Lu Weinian.

108
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,710
A sworn enemy of the Yin family?

109
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,390
How can this be?

110
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,880
Now you know the truth.

111
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,370
Years ago, the Yin family

112
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,290
committed murder and arson

113
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,980
to seize
our Lu family's pharmaceutical business.

114
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,430
I was lucky enough

115
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,080
to have escaped alive.

116
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,630
All I've done

117
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,270
is make the Yin family
pay for what they did

118
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,750
and take back everything
that belongs to our Lu family.

119
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,840
But what about Yi?

120
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,670
What's the story with Yi?

121
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,750
Yi...

122
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,630
I failed Yi.

123
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,650
Back then, when I returned to the country,

124
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,600
I found Yi and told her the whole story.

125
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
She originally agreed to fight against
the Yin family with me,

126
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,730
and she could have used the engagement

127
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,430
to infiltrate the Yin family.

128
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,910
But Yin Lei killed her.

129
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,860
Yin Lei worked for you!

130
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,120
It was the Yin family
who's responsible for Yi's death.

131
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,320
Back then, Yin Zhuoyi

132
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,880
learned from her that I was still alive

133
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,540
and feared his dirty deeds
would be exposed,

134
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,000
so he ordered Yin Lei

135
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,720
to kill Yi.

136
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,220
That's not true.

137
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,900
That's not what Yin Zhuofeng told me.

138
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,550
My silly girl.

139
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,390
What you know

140
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,430
is only what he wants you to know.

141
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,320
He wouldn't lie to me.

142
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,960
Why wouldn't he?

143
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,480
Don't forget,

144
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,520
he's a member of the Yin family.

145
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,240
He seems nice to you on the surface,

146
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,630
but he's just using you.

147
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,150
Once he's done,

148
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,510
he'll discard you like worn-out shoes.

149
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,430
Impossible!

150
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,540
That's impossible.

151
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,480
That's absolutely impossible.

152
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,550
If Yin Zhuofeng truly cared for you,

153
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,840
he wouldn't

154
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,750
have trained you to be

155
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,750
a sharp blade in his hands,

156
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,130
wouldn't have let your hands
be stained with blood,

157
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,120
and certainly wouldn't have abandoned you.

158
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,250
Just think about it.

159
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,600
What decent man

160
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,950
would let the woman he loves

161
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,120
go through hell and high water for him?

162
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,620
It can't be.

163
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,030
It can't be.

164
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,420
He wouldn't lie to me.

165
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,770
How ridiculous.

166
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,580
I've hated One Heart

167
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,670
and the Priest so deeply

168
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,530
and been on this path for 15 years,

169
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,280
and now you're telling me

170
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,300
it all started because of Father?

171
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,610
Father carried his own burdens.

172
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,400
The reason why Hai City

173
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,200
has managed to stay safe

174
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,360
amidst the chaos,

175
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,150
allowing the people
to live peaceful lives,

176
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,510
is entirely due to the prestige
of the Yin Army.

177
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,480
But in fact,

178
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,270
with military funds running low
year after year,

179
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,200
even the Yin Army
can't hold on much longer.

180
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,120
So you

181
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,270
just resort to plundering?

182
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,870
How is that any different from
what bandits do?

183
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,320
I'm telling you about the history

184
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,720
of our Yin family because

185
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,000
I know

186
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,750
you're deeply attached to

187
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,880
Lu Ye.

188
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,960
At present,

189
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,790
she's not only the daughter
of our sworn enemy,

190
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,120
but also the daughter of the Priest,
the leader of One Heart.

191
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,690
Your relationship is too sensitive.

192
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,620
Regarding matters with One Heart,

193
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,670
you're not really suited to continue
handling them anymore.

194
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,480
Zhuoyi.

195
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,490
At this point, I just want
to ask you one thing:

196
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,170
are you still that big brother of mine,

197
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,360
upright and incorruptible,
who stays true to his principles,

198
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,290
and loves and protects the people?

199
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,330
Yin Zhuofeng.

200
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,390
Are you planning
to defy the military orders?

201
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,850
As for unjust and tyrannical orders,

202
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,040
so what if I do defy them?

203
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,240
If you remain stubborn and unyielding,

204
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,870
I'll have no choice but

205
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,830
to consider taking back Bronze Leaf.

206
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,720
Regarding One Heart's affairs,

207
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,640
I'll see them through to the end.

208
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,240
Everything I've done has been

209
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,720
to facilitate the collaboration
between Yin Zhuoyi

210
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,270
and One Heart,

211
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,000
making them fight over profit
until they destroy each other.

212
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,960
Only when

213
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,960
both sides' forces have been wiped out

214
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,290
will the feud between us and
the Yin family truly be settled.

215
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:43,930
Ye.

216
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,160
I remember when you were little,

217
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,820
you loved apples the most.

218
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,520
I stopped liking them long ago.

219
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,750
After you left,

220
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,630
creditors came knocking at our door
every day.

221
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,080
We never had a full meal.

222
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,810
All these years,

223
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,050
it was Yi who kept the Lu family going

224
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,930
and held me up.

225
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,030
I've long forgotten that
I even had a father.

226
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,790
But I've

227
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,660
never forgotten about you and Yi.

228
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,490
Ye.

229
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,840
You and your sister

230
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,790
are the most precious people

231
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,030
to me.

232
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,700
If it weren't for my concern for you,

233
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,550
this broken body of mine

234
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,060
would have been gone long ago.

235
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,720
I remember

236
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,160
how you always begged

237
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,240
to ride on my shoulders

238
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,240
when you were little.

239
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,360
Whenever I lifted you up high,

240
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,480
you'd laugh with such joy.

241
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,990
Who would've thought that now,

242
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,200
it's you who has to

243
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,840
hold up the Lu family,

244
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,150
and me as well?

245
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,670
I'm not telling you this

246
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,030
to make you take my side,

247
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,630
nor to involve you

248
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,270
in any of my affairs,

249
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,200
but only to tell you

250
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
the truth.

251
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,000
Isn't there any other way

252
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,210
to resolve the feud between our family
and the Yin family?

253
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,030
I'm already

254
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,079
a man who has died once.

255
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,599
The only reason

256
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,839
I've been hanging on to life

257
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,040
is because of this one obsession.

258
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,990
As for you,

259
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,030
my daughter,

260
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,319
I only want you

261
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,000
to live a peaceful life.

262
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,319
That's the only way

263
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,400
to honor your late mother

264
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,390
and Yi.

265
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,230
Father.

266
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,090
You've suffered so much

267
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,870
in this lifetime.

268
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,310
But I've grown up now

269
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,380
and am able to tell right from wrong.

270
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,000
I've said that family is my bottom line.

271
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,080
In our deal,

272
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,080
there was never any agreement
to harm family members.

273
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,950
Commander Yin.

274
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,520
But your dear brother Yin Zhuofeng

275
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,080
did go on a killing spree
at Golden Pleasure.

276
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,470
He's a threat to both of us.

277
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,600
What about your daughter, Lu Ye?

278
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,490
She was also once a member of Bronze Leaf.

279
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,620
In the Golden Pleasure incident,

280
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,530
she contributed significantly.

281
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,400
I understand.

282
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,880
Commander Yin.

283
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,520
They are both family to us.

284
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,320
Of course I won't force you

285
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,400
to kill your own brother, Commander.

286
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,670
But the existence of Bronze Leaf

287
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,280
is a major trouble for both of us.

288
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,890
Taking back Bronze Leaf

289
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,360
won't be an easy task.

290
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,820
My second brother is a tough nut to crack.

291
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,040
Perhaps

292
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
my daughter

293
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,970
might just give you a pleasant surprise.

294
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,970
I'm here on behalf of my father,

295
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,670
specifically to help ease your burden,
Commander.
