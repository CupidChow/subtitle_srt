1
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,210
There are totally two floors
in Golden Pleasure's building.

2
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,660
The first floor is accessible to

3
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,700
ordinary guests and celebrities.

4
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,490
By that time, I'll enter there first
as Young Master Zhuofeng

5
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,750
to gather information

6
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,670
and help you pass the test safely.

7
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,060
There's a staircase
between the first and second floors.

8
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,660
It's constantly guarded by sentries.

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,170
Even Golden Pleasure's dancers
can't enter there.

10
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,890
I guess

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,620
this must be the place

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,100
where they entertain government officials.

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,930
But obviously,

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,060
they don't use the main entrance
and stairs to go up.

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,060
After entering Golden Pleasure's building,

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,250
you need to pay special attention
to two people.

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:57,930
One

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,350
is Ji Sen, the manager of Golden Pleasure.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,580
Everyone, welcome to Golden Pleasure.

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,210
This man is reserved and cautious.

21
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,290
Try to avoid him if possible

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,620
to prevent exposing yourself.

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,570
Red Camellia.

24
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,210
Parrot.

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,210
Snow Blossom.

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,620
Lilac.

27
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,170
Spring Cotton.

28
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,130
Daisy Wild.

29
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,360
What a beautiful name.

30
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,220
There's one more thing.

31
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,490
Regarding Ding Xi, the boss lady
of Golden Pleasure,

32
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,180
all we know now

33
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,090
is that she once spent some time in Japan.

34
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,930
We're not sure

35
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,460
about anything else yet.

36
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,180
Move this over there.

37
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:31,860
Okay.

38
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,020
This is our boss, Miss Ding.

39
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,060
These are the new dancers

40
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,360
for your approval.

41
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,410
Just call me Miss Ding.

42
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,290
I think I've seen her before.

43
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,170
It's you.

44
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,290
The orange-flavored popsicle.

45
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,579
This is for you.

46
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,930
It's you. We met again.

47
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,820
The orange-flavored popsicle
was delicious.

48
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,150
Thank you for last time.

49
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,970
Daisy Wild.

50
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:21,220
Come here.

51
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,410
I'm curious about something.

52
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,390
It is said that

53
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,020
these dancers only arrived in our city
the day before yesterday, right?

54
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,780
Yes.

55
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,530
Then why did I

56
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,900
run into you on the street seven days ago?

57
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,460
Are you

58
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,650
trying to get close to me?

59
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,810
I...

60
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,370
A few days ago...

61
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,340
Don't be nervous.

62
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,060
After all, you once helped me,

63
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,790
so I should thank you properly.

64
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,920
How about this?

65
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,530
Let's talk during our meal.

66
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,090
Come with me.

67
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,170
Daisy Wild.

68
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,240
My most popular club girl.

69
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,530
I brought you to Tang City
to broaden your horizons.

70
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,500
But in the blink of an eye, my father

71
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,560
sold you to the Golden Pleasure Club.

72
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,730
This man

73
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,050
is Yin Lei's son.

74
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,210
Young Master Huanyuan.

75
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,590
I'm grateful for your affection.

76
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,900
I've accompanied you
in Tang City for seven days.

77
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,500
Are you still not satisfied?

78
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,210
Women are so unreliable.

79
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,790
Young Master Huanyuan,
if you really can't bear to part with her,

80
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,250
I wouldn't feel right
making you give her up.

81
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,720
However, your father...

82
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,420
Alright. Forget it.

83
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,810
It's embarrassing to tell others about it.

84
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,980
How about this? To make it up to you,

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,230
let me treat you to a cup of wine.

86
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,980
Two cups of wine.

87
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,940
Daisy Wild.

88
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,780
I guess we were destined
to meet each other.

89
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,580
Let's get along well from now on.

90
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,490
Make some arrangements.

91
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,700
Young Master Huanyuan,

92
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,630
this way please.

93
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,350
Let's go,

94
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,780
Daisy Wild.

95
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,340
After you successfully join
the Golden Pleasure Club,

96
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,610
establish your position first
and then gain recognition.

97
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,380
You have to stand out
among the ordinary dancers

98
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,020
and get the opportunity
to go to the second floor.

99
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,900
If you can make contact
with the officials they've bribed,

100
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,650
then we'll be able to get
their opium trafficking plan

101
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,110
and prepare our next move.

102
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,580
Got it.

103
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,680
[Your Sunshine]

104
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,730
[Episode 14: On the Verge of Breaking Out]

105
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:33,850
Zhuofeng,

106
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,780
How is it going with Lu Ye?

107
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,780
I wonder if she has passed
the test successfully.

108
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,820
With me there,

109
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,370
how would there be any problems?

110
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,940
Yin Huanyuan, were you born
in the Year of the Rat?

111
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,800
Did you hide here to scare people?

112
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:47,340
Yin Zhuofeng.

113
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,650
Tell him what I did.

114
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,820
Lu Ye's identity
was almost exposed just now.

115
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,340
But he suddenly appeared

116
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,380
and solved the crisis.

117
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,090
He?

118
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,580
Yin Huanyuan?

119
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,970
I can't believe you actually did
something so helpful.

120
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,170
I owe you one.

121
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,700
You can ask me to repay you anytime,

122
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,580
and I'll do it.

123
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,940
After all these years, I can't believe

124
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,140
these words are coming from your mouth.

125
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,830
I want the Thunder Gang.

126
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,860
The whole Thunder Gang.

127
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,210
Got it.

128
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,700
Come on.

129
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,630
Are you jealous?

130
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,740
Your silence means yes, huh?

131
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,020
I had no choice in that situation.

132
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,340
If I had not helped her...

133
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,870
-That bastard...
-Go away.

134
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,340
Zhuofeng.

135
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,940
What exactly happened just now?

136
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,070
Kids shouldn't ask about such things.

137
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,020
Commander,

138
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,090
the latest military report has arrived.

139
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,940
We'll run out of our military funds
in less than half a month.

140
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,470
Yet you're still in the mood
to play the piano?

141
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,380
In Tang City,

142
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,460
have you found
Yin Lei's whereabouts?

143
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,190
It seems that someone
is helping him hide from us.

144
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,930
Keep looking for him.

145
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,590
As long as he's still alive,

146
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,610
we still have a chance
to get that land back.

147
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,450
Commander,

148
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,929
regarding Miss Ding's invitation for you,

149
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:40,740
I think

150
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,330
you can discuss things with her properly.

151
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,620
After all, smuggling happens
in many other cities.

152
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,220
This might be a way out for us.

153
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,150
I don't want to discuss
this matter with you.

154
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,380
Alright.

155
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,140
Mr. Shen, it looks like

156
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,930
our Golden Pleasure's wine
isn't the only thing you're interested in.

157
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,860
What else would I be interested in?

158
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,100
Of course I'm interested in a smile
from a beautiful lady.

159
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,650
Mr. Shen, hearing what you've said,

160
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,100
I'm quite embarrassed.

161
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,410
Don't worry.

162
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,860
I'll ask someone to draft the contract

163
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,390
and send it directly to you.

164
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,220
No problem at all.

165
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,740
Even so,

166
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,320
I still need to handle
this matter properly.

167
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,980
Do you

168
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,620
not trust me?

169
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,330
You can trust me on this.

170
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,260
Mr. Shen, of course I trust you
in our collaboration.

171
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,650
Well,

172
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,780
then I'll be waiting for you

173
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,100
to spend a fortune for me.

174
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,620
Of course.

175
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,740
Xu Hai!

176
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,770
Give me the gun.

177
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,570
How about this, Mr. Shen?

178
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,320
Give me the gun!

179
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,720
Go out and have fun first.

180
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,200
I'll come find you later.

181
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,020
Alright, Miss Ding.

182
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,140
See you soon.

183
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:17,930
See you soon.

184
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:42,860
What's wrong?

185
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,740
You've been waiting for me
for just two hours,

186
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,450
and you're already impatient?

187
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,220
Ding Xi,

188
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,780
you think you've got me
under control, huh?

189
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,050
Then just pull the trigger.

190
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,420
You're just betting
that I haven't forgotten you.

191
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,900
But do you know

192
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,880
if you play with fire, you'll get burned?

193
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,780
Don't point that gun at me.

194
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,170
I'm sorry about

195
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,430
what happened just now.

196
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,750
I kept you waiting too long.

197
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,780
Xu Hai.

198
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,650
Let's go.

199
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,500
Do you want to

200
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,020
stay a little longer?

201
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,650
Miss Ding.

202
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,900
Mr. Shen.

203
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Please take care.

204
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,780
I'll ask someone to deliver the contract
to your residence later.

205
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,170
No problem.

206
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,990
What a naughty girl.

207
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,570
I'm leaving.

208
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,260
Go.

209
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,810
Break his legs.

210
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,150
Got it.

211
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,580
What else do you need?

212
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,620
It's raining so heavily.

213
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,290
Won't you share the umbrella with me?

214
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,810
You asked me

215
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,640
whether I was betting
that you hadn't forgotten me.

216
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,390
To be honest, I'm not sure.

217
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,990
But what I'm sure about is,

218
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,580
Zhuoyi,

219
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,020
I haven't forgotten you.

220
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,850
♪ You overturned the ending of our story ♪

221
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,850

♪ It rained all night long,
without your company ♪

224
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,570
I've told you my thoughts.

225
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,500
Then...

226
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,450
♪ I'm really not used to nights
without your goodnight ♪

227
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,650

♪ I cry while remembering the past ♪

241
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,570

242
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,770

had been broken by someone else.

♪ Suppressing my longing to see you ♪

244
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,980
Should we investigate this matter?

245
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,070
No need to investigate it.

246
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,860
♪ Tears grow too wild,
spreading into invisible wounds ♪

247
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,810
I know who did it.

248
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Ding Xi did it.

249
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,620
Oh, by the way,

250
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,290
just now, Miss Ding

251
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,530
asked someone to deliver this document,

252
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:14,720
saying that your visit wouldn't be wasted.

253
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,810
♪ Dreams hang halfway in the air,
through the window, I imagine ♪

254
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,380
Whether it would be wasted or not,

255
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,380
I'm already here.

256
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,980
♪ The way you'd look coming back to me ♪

257
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,510
We still need to find
Yin Lei's whereabouts as soon as possible.

258
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,220
From today onwards,

259
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,020
this is the place

260
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,150
where you can fully show your talents.

261
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,620
Peach.

262
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,690
So we can only dance here?

263
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,590
This doesn't look like

264
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,780
a place where we can
become successful people.

265
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,840
Watch your tongue.

266
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,820
Here's yours.

267
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,290
Exactly.

268
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,250
How is this any different

269
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,490
from Hai City?

270
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,500
That's right.

271
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,980
Your stage

272
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,450
isn't just here.

273
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,900
The entire Golden Pleasure Club
is full of opportunities.

274
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,360
Whether you can seize them

275
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,810
is entirely up to you.

276
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,140
Peach.

277
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,849
I have a question for you.

278
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,180
Go ahead.

279
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,410
At the Golden Pleasure Club,

280
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,839
are there any rules we need to follow?

281
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,609
The rule of the Golden Pleasure Club

282
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,050
is to keep your legs under control

283
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,780
and not to go upstairs without permission.

284
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,260
Can we go around freely?

285
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,260
What I mean is...

286
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,780
Can we go outside?

287
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,620
There are 30 minutes for you
to be out every day.

288
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,570
When you go out,

289
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,820
report your destination to me,

290
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,420
and someone will accompany you.

291
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,740
It looks like entering here is easy,
but going out is hard.

292
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,180
Even when I'm out,
I won't be able to act freely.

293
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,560
If there are no other questions,

294
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,820
you're all dismissed.

295
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,850
Just do as I said.

296
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,030
The man who killed my sister?

297
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,780
My Second Uncle,

298
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,970
Yin Lei.

299
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,330
Wait.

300
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,830
Raise your head.

301
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,940
Where do you come from?

302
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,940
I haven't seen you before.

303
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Young Master Huanyuan selected me.

304
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,140
She has just arrived.

305
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,330
Young Master Huanyuan,
so this is your taste?

306
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:57,960
Come on.

307
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,460
I'll go arrange the car first.
