1
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,540
Lieutenant Xu.

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,040
What do you want to do?

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,570
This is Bronze Leaf's camp.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,080
The commander told us

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,470
to reclaim Bronze Leaf today.

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,670
The representative is ready.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,550
An easy way or a hard way,

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,320
Young Master Zhuofeng,

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,520
it's your choice.

10
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,690
Lu Ye.

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,930
Lu Ye, it's good that you're fine.

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,340
Why are you with them?

13
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm representing One Heart.

14
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,380
Lu Ye.

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,650
What are you talking about?

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,040
Yin Zhuofeng.

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,030
You gave me two options back then.

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,480
Now I'm giving you two options, too.

19
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,390
The first one

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,430
is to disband Bronze Leaf

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,920
and go home to be

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,720
the second young master of the Yin family.

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,090
What about the second option?

24
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,490
As for the second option,

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,660
if you refuse to hand it over to us,

26
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,730
you'll be executed on the spot
according to the military law.

27
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,850
Lu Ye, are you joking?

28
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,120
I'm not joking.

29
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,840
Which path will you choose?

30
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,479
Make your own decision.

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,300
No one is allowed
to fire guns in Bronze Leaf's camp.

32
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,860
The commander has said that

33
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,860
if anyone causes trouble
in Bronze Leaf's camp today,

34
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,590
he'll be severely punished.

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,580
Do you even know what you're doing?

36
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,910
Then what did you do?

37
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,860
You knew he was my father.

38
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,040
But you still used me to deal with him.

39
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,480
What you asked me to do

40
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,680
was the unforgivable act
of killing my own father.

41
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,960
Only until later

42
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,590
did I find out about your father.

43
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,720
Then how do you explain that

44
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,720
you betrayed my trust
and humiliated me arbitrarily?

45
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,260
This...

46
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,610
is far from enough.

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,890
Lu Ye, you...

48
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,940
Are you trying to kill my brother?

49
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,440
Enough!

50
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,290
The commander doesn't want
anyone to be killed.

51
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,580
Yin Zhuofeng.

52
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,890
Think it through.

53
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,620
Are you going to

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,399
hand Bronze Leaf

55
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,060
over to us or not?

56
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,920
Zhuofeng.

57
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,270
As long as you give us the order,

58
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,270
our men

59
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,680
will take action immediately.

60
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,400
From today onwards,

61
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,200
Bronze Leaf

62
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,750
will be disbanded.

63
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,270
What?

64
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,280
Why?

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,360
Zhuofeng.

66
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,000
Zhuofeng, what are you talking about?

67
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,090
Bronze Leaf has existed for 10 years

68
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,680
since its establishment.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,350
With all of you standing by me

70
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,680
through thick and thin,

71
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,220
I am truly blessed.

72
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,240
Though Bronze Leaf is disbanded today,

73
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,550
our brotherhood remains.

74
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,450
If we meet again someday,

75
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,020
I'll still stand with you all
through thick and thin.

76
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,830
From now on,

77
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,340
Bronze Leaf will no longer exist.

78
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,660
Lieutenant Xu.

79
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,450
Let's go.

80
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,640
[Your Sunshine]

81
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,600
[Episode 22: Our Code]

82
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,450
Zhuoyi has gone too far to turn back now.

83
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,610
Reclaiming Bronze Leaf
is just the first step.

84
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,460
Next,

85
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,730
he'll probably deal with the Thunder Gang.

86
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,880
What are you trying to say?

87
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,680
If he really collaborates with One Heart

88
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,409
to smuggle opium into Hai City,

89
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,740
he will inevitably go through
Thunder Gang's entertainment venues.

90
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,000
Whether it's for pleasure and attention

91
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,070
or for other arrangements,

92
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,070
you need to get prepared in advance.

93
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:01,040
You're quite the schemer, aren't you?

94
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,080
Zhuofeng.

95
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,150
But what about Lu Ye?

96
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,330
Will she become our enemy?

97
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,480
Think it through.

98
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,040
I just feel that her appearance this time

99
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,700
wasn't as simple as it seemed.

100
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,100
With that gesture,

101
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,790
she was trying to remind me of something.

102
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,360
If I miss you,

103
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,990
this means that

104
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,840
it's not convenient at this moment,

105
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,750
but...

106
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,850
I want to see you.

107
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,409
That must be her signal to me.

108
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,170
Zhuofeng.

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,060
Are you saying that

110
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,390
you gave up Bronze Leaf so easily

111
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,950
just to cooperate with her?

112
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,920
Yin Zhuofeng.

113
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,290
Is it possible that

114
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,020
your eyesight was so poor
that you saw it wrongly?

115
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,750
There was no hint at all,
and you misunderstood.

116
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,800
Don't forget that she was the one

117
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,540
who hurt your arm with a knife.

118
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,030
Now that Bronze Leaf is disbanded,

119
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,960
it's like cutting off both your arms.

120
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,560
And her father is the Priest.

121
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,340
If you make one wrong move in the future,

122
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,900
you'll be killed by her.

123
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,340
Be careful. Perhaps she has been
thoroughly brainwashed by her father

124
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,740
and has joined One Heart.

125
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,150
She has always been a girl
who can tell right from wrong

126
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,710
and has her own mind.

127
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,770
I absolutely don't believe
that she would join One Heart,

128
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,830

00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,690
How did you...

188
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,820
I noticed that your state
didn't seem right,

189
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,080
so I followed you here.

190
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,840
Thank you, Peach.

191
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,250
What?

192
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,550
My father isn't dead?

193
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,840
He's the Priest of One Heart?

194
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
That's impossible.

195
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,010
One Heart

196
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,520
is a puppet and outpost of foreign powers.

197
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,130
Their return this time

198
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,850
isn't just about opium trafficking

199
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,870
but also about finding

200
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,610
a suitable puppet spokesperson

201
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,810
to completely infiltrate our country.

202
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,970
Your sister

203
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,120
was also a member of our organization.

204
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,700
After reading this handwritten letter,

205
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,860
you should understand

206
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,460
why she sacrificed herself.

207
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,320
What do you need me to do?

208
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,410
To break up with Yin Zhuofeng,

209
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,270
when you stabbed him,

210
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,490
you were quite heartbroken, huh?

211
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,810
At that moment,

212
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I had to stab him ruthlessly.

213
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Only by doing that

214
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,340
would my father trust me.

215
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,710
By the way,

216
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,280
we've just got some news.

217
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,130
One Heart has manufactured
a batch of opium.

218
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,580
Its whereabouts are currently unknown.

219
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,100
Once Yin Zhuoyi
reaches an agreement with them,

220
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,830
this batch of goods
will be transported to Hai City.

221
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,560
By that time,

222
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,090
we can take the opportunity to find it

223
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:12,950
and destroy it.

224
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,580
Yin Zhuofeng

225
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,550
has already got ready to fight against

226
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,750
Yin Zhuoyi and One Heart to the end.

227
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,720
We've also been secretly
providing clues for him

228
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,390
to see whether he would collude
with Yin Zhuoyi.

229
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,070
It looks like

230
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,730
he has stayed true to his core values.

231
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,340
If someone like him

232
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,960
takes our side,

233
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,200
it'll be extremely helpful

234
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,110
for us.

235
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,970
I've already given him a signal

236
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,810
and arranged to meet him.

237
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,320
Let's hope that

238
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,950
tomorrow will be a new beginning.

239
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,580
I'll wait for your news.

240
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,520
Take care.

241
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,040
Thank you.

242
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,040
Now that Bronze Leaf
is no longer an obstacle,

243
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,000
your goods

244
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,320
can enter Hai City safely.

245
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,960
You've done an excellent job.

246
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,560
I was really right about you.

247
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,240
I'll make some arrangements later.

248
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,550
Half of the goods
will be delivered to you first.

249
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,430
This doesn't match
the quantity we agreed upon.

250
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,630
Why will you deliver only half of them?

251
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,840
Commander Yin,

252
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,690
this is your first time doing
this kind of business in our circle.

253
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,500
Your distribution channels
are not complete yet. Don't be too hasty.

254
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,700
Once this batch of goods is sold safely,

255
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,890
I'll surely supply the rest
of them to you as promised.

256
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,340
Zhuoyi.

257
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,040
The Priest was so eager
to win you over previously.

258
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,360
But now he's only giving you
half of the goods.

259
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,480
Are there

260
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,500
any conspiracies behind this?

261
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,860
It doesn't matter.

262
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,310
He simply wants to

263
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,300
use the remaining half of the goods

264
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,320
to make me keep working with him.

265
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,630
I believe you can solve the problem.

266
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,490
Commander.

267
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,470
How's it going

268
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,780
with Bronze Leaf?

269
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,790
In terms of

270
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,760
Bronze Leaf's dissolution yesterday,

271
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,540
Lu Ye had been deeply hurt
by Young Master Zhuofeng indeed.

272
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,460
She stabbed him with no mercy.

273
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,980
Just let it be.

274
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,020
Only after Zhuofeng feels some pain

275
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,140
will he let go.

276
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,670
I'm just afraid that

277
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,480
he won't be able to let go.

278
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,790
What's that?

279
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,000
[Ding Le, Chronic Myocarditis]

280
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,370
Ding Xi.

281
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,710
I'm a bit hungry.

282
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,130
Could you get me something to eat?

283
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,780
Wait for me then.

284
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,430
A month ago,

285
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,660
her sister, Ding Le,

286
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,110
had a failed surgery.

287
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,080
The hospital

288
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,620
kept it confidential.

289
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,990
They must have been bought off long ago.

290
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,790
Don't tell her

291
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,290
about this matter yet.

292
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
What about our deal with Lu Weinian?

293
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,540
What's your plan?

294
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,240
Proceed with everything as usual.

295
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,770
Go on keeping an eye on Lu Ye.

296
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,630
She's Lu Weinian's daughter.

297
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,720
I'd like to see

298
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,460
what this father and daughter

299
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,770
are really up to.

300
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,590
Haven't we cut ties with each other?

301
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,880
Why are you here to see me?

302
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,520
I...

303
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,120
Beware of eavesdroppers.

304
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,150
Yin Zhuofeng.

305
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,090
It's not that easy
to settle the score between us.

306
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,490
So you won't be satisfied
until you kill me?

307
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,100
Xu Hai has already left.

308
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,170
We don't need to fight anymore.

309
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,430
So I have to stop as you said?

310
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,560
I can't stop!
