[Yin's Command Center]

2
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,250
Zhuoyi.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,510
Recently, Bronze Leaf has raided

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,650
several smugglers' dens.

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,450
The confiscated money
has been added to the treasury.

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,820
I think it can help to solve
part of the military provisions issue.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,690
This money

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,620
won't solve the fundamental problem.

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,880
You should take it back

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,530
and give it to Bronze Leaf.

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,860
There's one more thing.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,560
This gold piece

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,030
was found on Lu Yi.

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,060
She reported that the Thunder Gang
was colluding with One Heart.

15
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,720
Uncle Lei tried to kill Lu Yi back then

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,050
in order to silence her.

17
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,330
Our Yin family has to clear her name.

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,260
How much do you know about Lu Yi?

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,850
Not much.

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,290
If you don't know her well,

21
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,780
then how can you determine
whether the coded message

22
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,710
on this gold bullion is true or not?

23
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,530
Lu Yi's death is full of
suspicious points.

24
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,060
It's a human life after all.

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,390
We have to investigate it thoroughly.

26
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,350
Yes.

27
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,990
We should investigate it.

28
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,080
Uncle Lei rushed into
the wedding venue to kill people.

29
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,250
Now he's still missing,
and that's certainly suspicious.

30
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,180
What about Lu Yi?

31
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,050
What about those photos of her meeting

32
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,410
with the people of One Heart?

33
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,340
Three years ago,

34
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,460
why did she replace her fiancé
with another one?

35
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,220
These are all suspicious points.

36
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,020
We need to investigate them all.

37
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,550
Lu Yi wouldn't be a member of One Heart.

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,610
Zhuofeng,

39
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,020
I'm only one year older than you.

40
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm not trying to pull rank
as your eldest brother.

41
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,170
If Lu Yi is innocent,

42
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,380
I'll definitely uphold justice for her.

43
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,220
If Uncle Lei

44
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,500
is really a member of One Heart,

45
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,630
I'll definitely deal with him
according to the law, too.

46
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,020
You've always worked hard
for the Yin family

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,050
and been impartial in all matters.

48
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,510
Hearing what you've said,

49
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,460
I can finally put my mind at ease.

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,730
Zhuofeng.

51
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,040
I heard everything you guys said.

52
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,250
If there's really something wrong
with Lu Yi,

53
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,780
then Lu Ye...

54
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,850
I'm sure the two sisters are innocent.

55
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,310
Don't let Zhuoyi know that

56
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,000
Lu Ye is in Bronze Leaf's camp.

57
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,220
Got it.

59
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,380

60
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,180
is out.

61
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,940
In addition,

62
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,820
that foreign tobacco company
keeps contacting me.

63
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,680
Lieutenant Xu.

64
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,410
No matter how desperate we are for money,

65
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,270
we absolutely cannot do things
that cross the line.

66
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,340
I'll keep figuring out a solution
to our financial problem.

67
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,180
Alright.

68
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,220
Got it.

69
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,820
Is there any news from Yin Lei?

70
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,610
Not yet.

71
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,410
We're still searching everywhere.

72
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,780
We need to find him quickly

73
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,350
and retrieve that piece of land he has.

74
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,480
Then it might help to

75
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,950
relieve our financial stress.

Come with me obediently

81

what the consequences will be?

89
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,290
What?

90
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,690
You want to save her?

Take him away.

100
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,910
Tell me.

101
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,400
Who asked you to take her away from here?

102
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,130
No one asked me to take her away.

103
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,690
I just thought she was such an eyesore,

104
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,330
so I wanted to capture her and sell her.

105
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,460

Is it Yin Huanyuan?

110
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,100
No one ordered me to do this.

111
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,400
You're so loyal to the mastermind.

112
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,960
Does it look familiar?

113
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,450
All these years, you've earned

114
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,060
quite many bounties outside
behind Bronze Leaf's back.

115
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,660
I don't even care about that.

116
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,130
But today, you tried to hurt
your own fellows from Bronze Leaf.

117
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,260
We need to settle this score properly.

118
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,940
Don't hurt women and children.

119
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,590
Don't kill our own fellows.

120

Don't let traitors stay alive.

121
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,190
Take it.

123
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,640
No matter how you treat me,

124
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,500
I can even not care.

125
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,770
But Qiu Cheng...

126
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,580
What did he do wrong?

127
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,820
He did nothing wrong.

128
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,820
He's a loser,

129
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,940
so he deserves to die.

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,570
Shut up, you devil!

00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,680
Fear is your greatest enemy.

189
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,880
Have you ever been afraid?

190
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,140
I found the people
who had helped One Heart

191
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,260
blow up the school.

192
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,260
Though they had committed serious crimes,

193
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,190
I still couldn't bear to kill them.

194
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,570
Weakness,

195
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,990
incompetence and fear

196
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,860
were suffocating me.

197
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,020
In the end, only with my survival instinct

198
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,680
did I manage to fire that shot.

199
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,630
Since that day, I've sworn that

200
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,260
I'll never be afraid again.

201
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,900
I have to be more ruthless

202
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,820
and more fearless than others.

203
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,970
Only in this way can I go further

204
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,430
on this path through hell.

205
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,490
Later,

206
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,950
shooting guns became my instinct,

207
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,280
and I could even do it without thinking.

208
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,570
Now I can't even remember

209
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,620
how many people I've killed

210
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,260
with these hands of mine.

211
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,820
How did you

212
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
become like this?

213
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,450
Like a monster.

214
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,330
Right?

215
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,020
That's not what I mean.

216
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,730
Just like you,

217
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,900
it's for my closest ones whom I love

218
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,370
and for those over 100 people

219
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,060
who died in that explosion.

220
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,680
To hell with weakness!

221
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,780
To hell with incompetence!

222
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,930
To hell with fear!

223
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,310
This is for you.

224
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,530
From now on, use it to protect yourself.

225
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,060
Yin Zhuofeng.

226
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,020
I'll be like you,

227
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,140
holding the knife in my hand firmly

228
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,340
and taking control of

229
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,020
my own destiny.

230
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,930
[The next day]

231
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,220
[Moonrise Tavern]

232
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,540
Who are you?

233
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,670
What are you doing?

234
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,300
Yin Zhuofeng!

235
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,020
Why are you venting your anger
in my place?

236
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,480
Don't you know what you did

237
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,760
in Bronze Leaf's camp?

238
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,500
This is the affair of our Yin family.

239
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,849
You have no right to interfere.

240
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:22,510
Get lost.

241
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,900
Zhuofeng!

242
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,130
Stop it!

243
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,090
Zhuoyi.

244
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,270
I have to teach him a lesson today.

245
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,970
While Yin Zhuofeng is here,

246
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,170
take some men to Bronze Leaf to find her.

247
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,180
Go now.

248
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,330
Zhuoyi.

249
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,670
You have no idea how many dirty things

250
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,800
Yin Huanyuan, that bastard, has done.

251
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,900
What are you doing here?

252
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,540
We're here to capture
a member of One Heart.

253
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,740
Have you seen a woman?

254
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,740
A woman?

255
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,360
No.

256
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,240
This voice sounds a bit familiar.

257
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,130
It's her!

258
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,940
Stop!

259
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,380
I'm asking you to stop right there!
