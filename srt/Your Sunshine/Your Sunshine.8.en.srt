1
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,070
I remember once,

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,420
you used returning
Zhuoqian's clothes as an excuse

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,660
to secretly check what was on this board.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,990
So you had already noticed.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,650
The truth is right here.

6
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,920
The one who killed my sister...

7
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,270
It was him.

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,410
My second uncle,

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,890
Yin Lei.

10
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,440
Everything happened too fast.

11
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,120
I failed to protect her.

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,130
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,260
So

14
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,450
you kept it from me all this time

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,220
because Yin Lei is part of the Yin family?

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,629
It has nothing to do
with whether he's from the Yin family.

17
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,150
First,

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,800
you didn't even have
the ability to protect yourself back then.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,880
Second,

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,580
Yin Lei had disappeared.

21
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,750
The entire Yin family was looking for him.

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,010
I had planned
to tell you once I found him.

23
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,150
Now you believe

24
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,320
my sister wasn't
part of One Heart, right?

25
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,100
Although we don't
know Lu Yi's real identity,

26
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:30,990
I think

27
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,870
she infiltrated One Heart

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,380
for something righteous.

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,060
In the end, she was exposed

30
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,060
and sacrificed herself.

31
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,710
Yin Lei most likely helped One Heart

32
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,940
silence her.

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,940
Yin Zhuofeng,

34
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,280
before you told me the truth,

35
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,150
I only wanted revenge for my sister.

36
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,430
But now,

37
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,009
more than revenge,

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,660
I want to finish

39
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,300
what she left unfinished.

40
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,620
I must win my match against Xiao Jinzhi.

41
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,740
That mission

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,150
has to be done by me.

43
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,530
This entire setup is filled with danger.

44
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,550
It's not something you can control.

45
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,200
The mission of Bronze Leaf

46
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,010
has nothing to do with you.

47

[Episode 8: Master]

49
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,900
This mission is more dangerous than usual.

50

Volunteers only.

51
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,490

52
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,390
come with me.

53
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,730
Wait, I'm not done.

54
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,230
Yin Zhuoqian,

55
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,460
in your eyes,

56
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,280
what exactly is the relationship
between me and your brother?

57
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,730
What relationship?

58
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,730
You two…

59

Lu Ye.

60
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,150
I've already explained everything to you.

61
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,610
Explained what, exactly?

62
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,150
I bet everyone's curious

63
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,340
about what kind of relationship
I have with Master Zhuofeng, right?

64
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:01,990
Lu Ye.

65
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,500
What is it?

66
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,640
What kind of relationship?

67
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,160
-No idea.
-Yeah.

68
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,750
Yin Zhuofeng,

69
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,000
you brought me to Bronze Leaf.

70
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,890
I didn't even know
how to hit a sandbag back then.

71
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,230
When Xiao Jinzhi stormed into Bronze Leaf,

72
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,870
every move I used against her
was learned from you.

73
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,110
You taught me things

74
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,579
you never taught anyone else.

75
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,900
Since ancient times,

76
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,930
what have we called people like this?

77
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,870
Master.

78
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,010
What exactly are you trying to do?

79
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,760
If you support me,

80
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,180

81

84
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,060
Bronze Leaf has its pride.

85
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,310
Bronze Leaf only follows Yin Zhuofeng.

86
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,040
We don't want to be bossed
around by Thunder Gang.

87
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,320
Right, exactly! Well said.

188
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,720
the other is declared the winner.

189
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,530
If either raises a white flag,

190
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,010
the match ends.

191
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,030
If neither side has objections,

192
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,480
the match begins now.

193
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,780
[One day before the match]

194
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,540
Anything else you want

195
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,010
to ask about your sister?

196
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,170
Did you and my sister decide

197
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,030
to marry out of love?

198
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,420
No.

199
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,990
Lu Yi and I

200
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,710
married to fulfill an arrangement

201
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,040
made by our two families generations ago.

202
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,020
So

203
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,600
my sister never loved you.

204
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,710
Why would you think

205
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,890
someone like her
would fall for someone like me?

206
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,190
Before the wedding, she made it clear

207
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,870
she wanted to use the Yin family's name

208
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,690
to protect the Lu estate.

209
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,210
And you? Did you love her?

210
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,820
No.
