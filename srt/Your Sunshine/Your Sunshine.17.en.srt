1
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,030
Now that Yin Lei is dead,

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,760
there's one less danger

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,900
in our operation.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,110
Or perhaps the danger has escalated.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,820
Why?

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,390
At first,

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,300
we just thought

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,630
Ding Xi was an unusually shrewd boss lady.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,660
But after Yin Lei died, she
rushed over here,

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,590
and it was also her

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,190
who personally picked Lu Ye.

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,270
It seems...

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,900
She's a member of One Heart,

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,760
and not a low-ranking one at that.

15
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,710
Zhuoqian.

16
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,310
Starting today, keep a close eye
on Ding Xi.

17
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,430
See where she goes

18
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,710
and who she associates with.

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,460
Understood.

20
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,030
[Your Sunshine]

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,070
[Episode 17
Everyone's Choice]

22
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,390
Commander.

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,510
Yin Lei is dead.

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,069
What happened?

25
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,910
He changed his identity and
had been hiding in Tang City.

26
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,710
I heard it was Young Master Huanyuan
who found him,

27
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,550
all for the sake of seizing power
and killing his father.

28
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,070
After the incident, he immediately
rushed back to Hai City

29
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,880
and reorganized the Thunder Gang.

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,610
Huanyuan has always been
at odds with his father,

31
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,550
with a deep-seated hatred.

32
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,750
Why did he choose this critical moment?

33
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,350
How did our Yin family

34
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,830
end up falling to this point step by step?

35
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,380
Commander.

36
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,750
Although Yin Lei is dead,

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,990
you should still take a look at
this document

38
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,140
that Miss Ding sent.

39
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,550
I've already gone through it a while ago.

40
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,100
It's nothing more than
records of Yin Lei's

41
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,660
illicit money-making activities

42
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,660
in Yunzhou.

43
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,380
Lieutenant Xu.

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,759
If you were in my position,

45
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,500
what would you do?

46
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,580
I served under Commander Yin Senior
for 20 years.

47
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,350
I know

48
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,200
he dedicated his entire life to Hai City.

49
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,690
I also understand that

50
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,020
you've been carrying the heavy burden
of leading the Yin Army

51
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,940
all these years,
and it hasn't been easy at all.

52
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,220
But if I were you,

53
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,979
I would never forget

54
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,630
Commander Yin Senior's last instructions.

55
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:24,100
[Five years ago]

56
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,600
Father.

57
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,420
I made you some chicken soup.

58
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,630
Zhuoyi.

59
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,980
I know that

60
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,490
you've never cared for
military or political affairs

61
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,700
since childhood,
nor sought fame or fortune,

62
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,360
but is brewing tea and cooking

63
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,660
what you're supposed to do?

64
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,500
Besides,

65
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,280
you're the legitimate eldest son
of the Yin family,

66
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,940
and you're meant to be
the future commander.

67
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,630
Father.

68
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,210
Even if I don't become
the Commander of Hai City,

69
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,590
I can still lead my brothers

70
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,500
and maintain our Yin family's legacy.

71
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,540
What about the Yin Army that has fought
alongside us through life and death?

72
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,600
Are you going to hand them over to others
just like that?

73
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,590
Father.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,470
Father, what are you doing?

75
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,270
Please get up!

76
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,420
If you don't give me your promise today,

77
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,470
I won't get up.

78
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:36,980
Father.

79
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,420
I promise you.

80
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,810
Come on, get up now.

81
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,420
Remember.

82
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,980
From now on,

83
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,350
you're not just Yin Zhuoyi.

84
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,070
You're the legitimate eldest son
of the Yin family,

85
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,870
and the Commander of Hai City.

86
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,190
No matter the cost,

87
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,630
you must take on this legacy.

88
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,660
Commander.

89
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,700
Yin Lei made a fortune
selling opium secretly

90
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,260
in Yunzhou,

91
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,590
making the Thunder Gang thrive.

92
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,420
If this deal goes through,

93
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,390
it'll be enough to cover
half a year's military expenses.

94
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,589
But you have ideals,

95
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,180
morals,

96
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,060
and dignity.

97
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,220
Say no more.

98
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,480
I'll figure something out.

99
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,360
You don't need to give me
Yin Lei's things.

100
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,550
I don't need these crooked ways
to make money and profit.

101
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,830
Zhuoyi.

102
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,540
If you really don't need

103
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,940
these ways to make money,

104
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,030
why did you go to Golden Pleasure

105
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,220
to see Mr. Ji?

106
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,910
What he wanted to fix you with

107
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,240
wasn't some legitimate business either.

108
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,850
Yin Lei made his fortune
through this very thing.

109
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,100
One Heart's opium?

110
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,900
You're a member of One Heart?

111
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,510
Yes.

112
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,590
It was you who used

113
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,180
the tobacco company

114
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,730
to lure me to Golden Pleasure to meet you?

115
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,030
Yes.

116
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,060
You want to use me

117
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,270
to smuggle opium into Hai City?

118
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,790
All correct.

119
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,100
Zhuoyi.

120
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,100
I'm the only one who can help you
with your urgent problems right now.

121
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,470
Let's cooperate.

122
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,330
Cooperate on what!

123
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,300
Smuggling opium and
poisoning the people of Hai City?

124
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,710
Without money,

125
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,030
you'll soon have no army left,

126
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,630
so what's the point of
caring about the people?

127
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,620
One Heart

128
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,900
sent you to use these tactics of baiting

129
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,250
and pretending on me.

130
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,970
Don't tell me you actually think
I still have feelings for you.

131
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:14,950
To me,

132
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,060
you're nothing but

133
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,860
a greedy opportunist now.

134
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,100
Right.

135
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,270
I approached you

136
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,980
to take advantage of you.

137
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,830
But my feelings for you

138
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,030
have always been

139
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,420
genuine.

140
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,740
So five years ago,

141
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,640
breaking my heart
was your genuine feeling.

142
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,560
You knew very well that One Heart

143
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,909
killed my family,

144
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,540
yet you still chose to join them.

145
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,670
It was also your genuine feeling, huh?

146
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,180
I... I have my reasons.

147
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,330
What reasons could you possibly have?

148
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,950
In this chaotic world,

149
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,200
everyone has moments when they're not
in control of their own fate.

150
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,320
Haven't you ever felt that way?

151
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,870
I know

152
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,789
you've been shouldering the heavy burden
of the Yin family all these years,

153
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,650
along with the glory of this city.

154
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,190
You've been weary and exhausted
all these years,

155
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,270
unable to move forward.

156
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,870
Why not join me on

157
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,820
One Heart's ship?

158
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,480
We can go further together.

159
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,630
If you still don't believe me,

160
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,470
then go ahead and kill me now.

161
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,540
These three shots

162
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,790
are the last bit of sentiment
I have for you in this lifetime.

163
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,510
If you ever approach me again
for One Heart,

164
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,420
I will show no mercy.

Are you nervous?

193

You're now

194
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,820
my only hope.

195
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,700
Miss Ding, have you

196
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,660
been crying?

197
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,270
Yes.

198
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,300
I shed tears

199
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,660
for a man.

200
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,390
Did he hurt you?

201
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,030
He loves me.

202
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,790
When a man loves you
in a simple, ordinary way,

203
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,990
he might promise you the moon and stars.

204
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,110
But when a man

205
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,630
truly loves you...

206
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,540
What happens?

207
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,940
He becomes

208
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,730
tongue-tied, unable to express
his true feelings.

209
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,110
I like a girl who can

210
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,400
bring out the stars for me
in the dark of night.

211
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,630
What did he

212
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,580
mean by that?

213
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,700
By the way,

214
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,540
I heard there's a guest

215
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,700
who's been treating you badly lately.

216
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,960
Should I have someone chop his hands off?

217
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,820
No.

218
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,340
My mission is to please Mr. Zhang.

219
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,630
You don't need to

220
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,790
get yourself into unnecessary trouble
because of me.

221
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,280
You're so sensible,

222
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,790
and I believe you can

223
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,120
complete your mission.

224
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,940
However,

225
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,460
this thing

226
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,390
cannot be taken inside.

227
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,790
Miss Ding,

228
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:20,870
I...

229
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,240
Life and death are destined,
and wealth is up to the heavens.

230
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,790
Daisy Wild.

231
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,700
It's time for you to go.

232
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,760
Zhuofeng, something's up!

233
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,060
What did you find?

234
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,150
You asked me to investigate

235
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,390
the whereabouts of those dancers

236
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,230
who were sent in for entertainment.

237
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,790
At first, I thought they just...

238
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,910
Get to the point!

239
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,990
All the 18 dancers

240
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,030
are dead.

241
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,420
Golden Pleasure disposed of
the bodies very discreetly.

242
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,540
They used the slop buckets

243
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,270
to dispose of all the bodies...

244
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,870
Gather all Bronze Leaf members
in Tang City

245
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,230
and have them stand guard
at the entrance of Golden Pleasure.

246
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,460
I'll go stop Lu Ye now

247
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,540
and bring her out.

248
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,830
If I can't get her out,

249
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,310
fight your way in and take her by force.

250
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,550
Have you seen Daisy Wild?

251
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,910
No.

252
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,650
Excuse me for a moment.

253
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,390
Sir,

254
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,570
please have a seat.

255
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,790
You know where Daisy Wild is?

256
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,660
Daisy Wild

257
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,050
has important guests to attend to today.

258
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,150
Sir,

259
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,870
if you go disturb Daisy Wild now,

260
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,250
I'm afraid she'll be in serious trouble.

261
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,930
Let's go upstairs.

262
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,940
Daisy Wild.

263
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,150
Are you okay?

264
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,360
Everything's going smoothly.

265
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,200
Call for help if anything happens.

266
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,420
Got it.

267
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,390
Distinguished guests,

268
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,030
due to electrical issues
at Golden Pleasure,

269
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,579
we are closed for tonight.

270
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,579
Please proceed to our other venue,

271
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,910
where all drinks are on the house tonight.

272
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,630
Young Master Zhuofeng.

273
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,540
This way, please.

274
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,600
What a disappointment.

275
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,950
Come in.

276
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,060
Hello, Director Zhang.

277
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,620
I've heard

278
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,270
you're the fiercest Daisy Wild here.

279
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,700
You flatter me, Director Zhang.

280
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,950
Dance for me.

281
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,280
Show me what you've got.

282
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,790
Are you messing with me?

283
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,540
I'm sorry, Director Zhang,

284
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,580
I accidentally tripped just now.

285
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,380
Come here.

286
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,030
Come here.

287
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,710
Come a bit closer.

288
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,670
Come on.

289
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,990
Give me a cut,

290
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,900
but don't make it too deep.
