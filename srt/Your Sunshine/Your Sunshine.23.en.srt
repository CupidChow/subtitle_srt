I'm sorry.

I know I'm a jerk.

I did something that hurt you deeply.

I also know that some things

can never be undone.

If you truly hate me,

I'll accept whatever you do to me.

[Episode 23: The depths of the abyss]

37
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,550
So you were by your father's side—

38
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,900
including helping Zhuoyi
take back Bronze Leaf—

39
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,490
just to wait for the moment
they made the deal

40
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,090
and find that batch of opium?

41
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,600
Does it still hurt?

42
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,970
It stopped hurting long ago.

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,400
A little blow and the pain's gone.

44
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,770
There's someone

00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,090
I want to introduce to you.

where she's from.

49
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,260
We met at Golden Pleasure.

Thank you, Young Master Zhuofeng.

While undercover at Golden Pleasure,

53

she discovered our operation

54
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,530
and secretly helped us many times.

The photos of Zhuoyi and Ding Xi—

56

According to our intel,

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,240
your Brother Zhuoyi
has transported the first batch of opium

59
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,360
into Hai City.

60
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,850
Before it spreads and harms the people,

61
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,210
we need to find the warehouse

62
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,270
and destroy it all.

63
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,140
This batch of opium—

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,330
we can't destroy it just yet.

Do you have another idea?

One Heart went through all that trouble
to cozy up to Zhang Chongzheng

68
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,890
and win over Brother Zhuoyi.

69
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,950
Now that the deal's finally in place,

70
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,750
given their ambition,

71
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,550
there's no way
they'd only ship this small amount.

72
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,350
This quantity

73
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,300
is far from enough for Hai City to absorb.

74
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,170
One Heart is either trying

75
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,300
to lure us out,

76
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,870
or they don't trust your Brother Zhuoyi

77
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,000
and are testing him.

78
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,990
So,

79
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,360
this is just the appetizer.

80
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,160
Exactly.

81
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,120
We shouldn't

82
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,970
rush to destroy this batch.

83
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,330
Instead, we should help them

84
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,640
and make them believe
the Hai City trial run is a success,

85
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,570
so they'll expose all their goods.

86
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,490
Then we take them down in one sweep.

what you mean.

179
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,920
I searched every single warehouse

There wasn't a single crate of goods.

You transported the goods.

183
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,100
I handled the storage.

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,330
How could there be nothing?

185
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,880
Then perhaps we should ask you, Priest,

186
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,450
what exactly you mean.

187
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,240
Did you empty the warehouse yourself,

188
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,000
and now you're trying

189
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,640
to pin the theft on me?

190
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,480
The joke's not funny.

191
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,480
Clever move—

192
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,070
the thief crying thief.

193
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,020
Ding Xi, if you want your sister to live,

194
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,750
you should know what to do.

195
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,010
Priest,

196
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,800
thank you for the reminder.
I almost forgot.

197
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,010
My sister

198
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,930
died a month ago, didn't she?

199
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,210
The guards outside

200
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,550
have all been subdued by us.

201
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,910
Now it's just us.

202
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,700
Two against one.

203
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,970
You don't stand a chance.

204
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,900
Where's the rest of the goods?

205
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I have two things to tell you.

206
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
First,

207
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,480
the remaining half of the goods

208
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,690
isn't in the warehouse.

209
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,720
Someone stole

210
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,290
and

211
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,710
transported them elsewhere.

212
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,850
Second.

213
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,150
Lieutenant Xu, you...

214
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,960
The second thing—

215
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,100
did you really think I'd only

216
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,790
plant your lover at your side?

217
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,500
Commander,

218
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,130
a wise man adapts to the times.

219
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,730
The eldest young master of the Yin family—

220
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,490
you've really opened my eyes.

221
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,310
You were seduced by a woman

222
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,440
and unable
to see through those around you.

223
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,300
Your father was always cunning,

224
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,100
only to entrust everything to you,

225
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360

The remaining goods in Priest's hands—

257
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,120
we've already moved them elsewhere,

258
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,450
just as you instructed.

259
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,350
So brutal?

260
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,180
Take care of them.

261
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,470
Help me.

262
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,210
According to the intel from Peach

263
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,010
and the quantities

264
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,490
listed in the documents,

265
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,570
all the opium produced by One Heart

266
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,500
should have already been transported
into Hai City.

267
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,570
Yin Huanyuan has taken care of part of it,

268
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,770
but there's still another portion.

269
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,520
I snuck a look at the warehouse.

270
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,470
Strangely,

271
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,110
it was empty.

272
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,390
Could it be your father found out
what you were doing

273
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,530
and secretly moved it?

274
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,590
Brother Zhuofeng!

275
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,160
Priest...

276
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,130
died.
