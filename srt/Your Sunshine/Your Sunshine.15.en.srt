1
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,590
What...

2
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,740
are you doing?

3
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,720
Sir,

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,010
a knife just fell.

5
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,460
I just picked it up.

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,700
I'm putting it back now.

7
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,229
I need to find an excuse
to go back to the clothing store.

8
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,509
[Your Sunshine]

9
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,430
[Episode 15: Blinded by rage]

10
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,860
It seems he still

11
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,220
has feelings for you.

12
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,660
He's not as affectionate as you think,

13
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,180
and not as easy to deal with as you think.

14
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,100
If we want him on our side,

15
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,750
it's gonna take a lot more effort.

16
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,560
How you make the effort is your business.

17
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,550
Priest is willing to wait.

18
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,670
If your younger sister

19
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,920
can wait,

20
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,340
that's fine.

21
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,890
I don't need your reminder!

22
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,800
What's the situation with Yin Lei?

23
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,170
Don't let Yin Zhuoyi find him.

24
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,690
He's been working so hard for so long

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,040
without getting any benefits.

26
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,440
He's getting more impatient

27
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,940
and pushing for the goods.

28
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,650
Then give him some benefits.

29
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,210
We have

30
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,020
a batch of defective goods, right?

31
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Let him try those.

32
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,090
See if he can sell them.

33
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,530
No problem.

34
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,730
I wonder how things are going with Lu Ye.

35
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,020
No matter what,

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,010
it's good as long as she's safe.

37
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,690
Girls,

38
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,320
let's do some serious shopping today.

39
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,410
Take whatever you like.

40
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,600
Sounds good. Let's splurge today.

41
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,769
Young man, any new arrivals lately?

42
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Our store just opened.
We have plenty of new products.

43
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,760
I almost didn't recognize you.

44
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,970
Excuse me,

45
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,650
don't you have any manners?

46
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,890
I'm a customer too.

47
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,360
Qian.

48
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,030
Bring out our best pieces.

49
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,070
Let the ladies choose properly.

50
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,409
Sure.

51
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,770
Ladies, this way.

52
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,500
These are all our new arrivals.

53
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,650
Come, take a look.

54
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,040
This one. This one is especially nice.

55
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,800
Sir,

56
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,850
I'd like to try this one on.

57
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,810
Sure, coming.

58
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,420
Let me pack this one for her first.

59
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,920
Come.

60
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
This one might be a bit large.

61
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,800
Let me measure you.

62
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,750
Okay.

63
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,100
One at a time, ladies.

64
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,090
How are things at Golden Pleasure?

65
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,350
Everything's normal.

66
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
Ding Xi doesn't suspect a thing.

67
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,310
I'll find a way to gain her trust

68
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,800
and look for a chance
to get to the second floor.

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Just do your best.

70
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
If there's danger, retreat immediately.

71
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,850
Don't gamble with your life.

72
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,190
Don't worry.

73
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,570
By the way,

74
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,660
a few days ago, I...

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,830
What is it?

76
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,210
I saw Yin Lei.

77
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,590
I wish I could kill him right now.

78
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,090
But you still held back

79
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,570
for the bigger picture,

80
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,100
right?

81
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,720
You've grown.

82
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,770
Hurry up!

83
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,030
Don't dawdle!

84
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,680
This one should fit.

85
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,000
Do you want to try it on?

86
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,670
Okay.

87
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,670
I'll give you this one.

88
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,680
I'll put it here for you. Here.

89
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,740
-Hurry up.
-Don't.

90
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,600
Okay.

91
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,159
Sir,
the zipper on this cheongsam is stuck.

92
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,090
I can't zip it up.

93
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,020
Let me help you.

94
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,720
Let me help you. Don't touch me.

95
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,450
Don't. Hands off, lady.

96
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,920
This one. I want this one.

97
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,650
Sure, no problem.

98
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,770
No problem. Okay.

99
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,409
Ji Sen

100
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,470
gave this note to Yin Lei.

101
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,159
I don't know what he said.

102
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,070
But judging from his lip movements,
it looked like

103
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,070
"it's yours now."

104
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,710
Yin Lei's been hiding all over the place.

105
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,520
This might be our breakthrough.

106
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,800
By the way,

107
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,720
it seems they have roped in an official

108
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
surnamed Zhang.

109
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,850
But I haven't figured out

110
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,120
who it is yet.

111
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,850
Leave the identity check to me.

112
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,480
Be careful.

113
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,860
Take this,

114
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,480
just in case.

115
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,270
What is this?

116
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,370
Yin Lei's sudden appearance
at Golden Pleasure

117
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,500
has complicated things for both of us.

118
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,800
We need to find a chance
to get rid of him.

119
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Do you have a plan?

120
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,390
I'll spread rumors

121
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,830
to make him suspicious of you girls.

122
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,210
When he takes action,

123
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,530
we'll be waiting in the wings.

124
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,040
Take a look.

125
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,480
Okay. I'll take a look.

126
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,680
It suits you perfectly. It's great.

127
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,720
My... Don't touch me.

128
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,180
Don't touch me. Hands off.

129
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,740
Don't touch me, ladies.

130
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,190
It suits you perfectly.

131
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,320
This one suits you. I'll get it for you.

132
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,410
Don't.

133
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,730
Stop pulling me, ladies.

134
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,050
What's taking so long with the zipper?

135
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,180
Are you doing something else in there?

136
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,800
This...

137
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,530
Lady, let me get you an accessory.

138
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,410
Spring Cotton,

139
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,380
don't tease me
just because the boss is handsome.

140
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,230
Don't touch me.

141
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,680
This... this is a men's style.

142
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,610
We don't have your size in this one.

143
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,280
-These beads are gorgeous.
-Sir.

144
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,720
I'll go...

145
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,890
I'll take this one.

146
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,940
Okay, let me help you.

147
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,800
I'll pack it for you.

148
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,450
Let's take a look around ourselves.

149
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,690
Sir, do you have this dress in my size?

150
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,360
Just a moment, let me check.

151
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,220
Spring Cotton,

152
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,760
we only have half an hour.

153
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,100
If we go back late, we'll be in trouble.

154
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,520
Let's go then.

155
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,770
Take care on your way.

156
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,600
Lu Ye,

157
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,720
protect yourself.

158
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,720
Seeing you today

159
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,090
makes me so happy.

160
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,450
Geez.

161
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,780
Dealing with women

162
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,270
is harder than dealing with enemies.

163
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,320
In spring,
the city's beauty shines so bright.

164
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,780
The east wind stirs blossoms into flight.

165
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,670
Paired butterflies dance, then drift afar.

166
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,650
In the courtyard,
hope lingers where windows are.

167
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,950
Brother Zhuofeng,

168
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,180
what does this mean?

169
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,200
Zhuoqian,

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
get ready to lay the bait.

171
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,960
Sir, the goods are fine.

172
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,930
The goods are fine,

173
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,290
but the people aren't.

174
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Since this batch of dancers
came to Golden Pleasure,

175
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,810
there's been a lot more eyes
watching the place.

176
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,330
If

177
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
there's something wrong with them,

178
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,600
all our efforts will be wasted.

179
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,330
Go tell that old man Ji Sen,

180
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,920
I'll personally take this batch of dancers

181
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,540
to enjoy the opera.

182
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,150
Brother Zhuofeng!

183
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,290
Brother Zhuofeng! Brother Zhuofeng!

184
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,850
Something happened at Golden Pleasure.

185
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,880
Lu Ye and the newly arrived dancers

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,240
have been taken away.

187
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,640
Did you follow them
to where they were going?

188
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,480
They must've known we were tailing them.

189
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,400
We lost them

190
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,750
halfway.

191
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,320
Why did they move
so much earlier than planned?

192
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,240
Don't worry, Priest.

193
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,890
Everything's proceeding
according to the plan.

194
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,730
I will deal with Zhang Chongzheng.

195
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,190
The opium smuggling
through the water route won't be delayed.

196
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,910
Don't worry, Lele.

197
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,760
When you get better,

198
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,940
I'll take you to get orange popsicles.

199
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,170
A new batch of dancers has arrived.

200
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,230
Please take a look.

201
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,850
Another new batch?

202
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,600
What about the last one?

203
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,640
Yin Lei sent a message,

204
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,440
saying there is a spy among them.

205
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,240
They've all been sent for investigation.

206
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,090
Perhaps

207
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,360
he'll kill them all.

208
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,550
Where are they?

209
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,290
Weren't we supposed to watch an opera?

210
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,690
Why did you bring us here?

211
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,690
Yeah. This is so scary.

212
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,480
Shut up.

213
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,970
Stand still, everyone!

214
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,930
Stop crying.

215
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,660
If anyone cries again,

216
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,310
I'll kill you all.

217
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,870
There's a spy

218
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,170
among you.

219
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,450
Who is it?

220
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,410
Step forward yourself.

221
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,480
Consider it a good deed—

222
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,810
save everyone else.

223
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,000
If no one confesses,

224
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,050
then...

225
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,570
don't blame me for not showing mercy.

226
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,210
I'll slaughter

227
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,900
every one of you.

228
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,570
Sir,

229
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,270
how could there be a spy among us?

230
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,920
Sir, we were picked
by Young Master Huanyuan.

231
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,580
Are you mistaken?

232
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,900
Mistaken?

233
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,720
We'll see soon enough.

234
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,580
Come here.

235
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,160
Don't move. Stand still.

236
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,760
Real dancers

237
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,410
are stamped.

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,080
If you don't have the stamp,

239
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,640
you're not the real deal.

240
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,360
Next one.

241
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,520
Your turn.

242
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,030
What's going on? Go check!

243
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,840
The owl's call is the signal.

244
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,170
Two hoots—

245
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,250
it means I'm nearby to back you up.

246
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,090
Yin Zhuofeng!

247
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,730
I thought you were dying!

248
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,090
Stop him!

249
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,680
Who on earth are you?

250
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,359
You want to know who I am?

251
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,930
You...

252
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,050
You used this gun

253
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,710
to kill my sister, didn't you?

254
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,810
Today...

255
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,560
Today, I'm going to make you
pay with your life!

256
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,850
Give him to me.

257
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,170
Let me deal with him.

258
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,310
No one would know I killed him here.

259
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,460
This is the perfect opportunity.
I can't miss it!

260
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,770
Listen to me.

261
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,540
I promise I'll avenge your sister.

262
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,200
You don't have to dirty your hands
because of him.

263
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,330
They'll get dirtied eventually!

264
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,050
Why are you stopping me?

265
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,200
Leave the killing

266
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,770
to me.

267
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,010
He's getting away!

268
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,470
He won't be able to escape.

269
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,360
Let's make sure of that.
