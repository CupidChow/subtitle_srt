1
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,730
Why are we back?

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,730
Weren't we in Tang City?

3
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,410
We still have so much unfinished business.

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,770
We caused too much
commotion at Golden Pleasure,

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,030
staying in Tang City would be dangerous,

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,190
we had to come back.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,360
I understand.

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,660
Go get some rest.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,090
I saw Zhang Chongzheng die.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,730
But the details...

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,860
I can't remember.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,930
He was killed by Priest.

13
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,870
What about Priest?

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,200
Did you catch him?

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,450
Priest isn't dead,

16
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,680
is he?

17
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:16,210
It's okay,

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,100
he just got away temporarily.

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,240
If you hadn't come to save me,

20
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,730
he wouldn't have escaped.

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,060
If I had found a chance to grab him

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,500
when we were in the room,

23
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,370
he wouldn't have gotten away.

24
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:28,810
Lu Ye.

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,520
He wouldn't have gotten away.

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,160
Lu Ye.

27
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,009
Lu Ye, look at me.

28
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,320
Lu Ye.

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,570
Look at me.

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,450
Our mission was a success.

31
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,930
We destroyed One Heart's

32
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,330
base at Golden Pleasure.

33
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,390
Don't think about anything right now,

34
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,259
just look at me,

35
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,570
okay?

36
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,490
In the alley,

37
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,120
why were you crying?

38
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,240
It's nothing.

39
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,420
Just at that moment,

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,329
I felt like such a failure.

41
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,380
Go take a shower and get some rest.

42
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,950
What about you?

43
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,900
I need to go back to Bronze Leaf,

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,770
I've been away for too long,

45
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:52,030
there are some matters I need to handle.

46
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,760
I'm going now.

47
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,200
Yin Zhuofeng.

[Episode 20: Tempest Unleashed]

50
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,280
Zhuofeng.

51
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,080
You haven't been yourself
since you returned from Tang City.

52
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,210
We failed this time,

53
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,850
but we can find another way.

54
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,010
Zhuoqian,

55
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,640
have a drink with me.

56
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,360
Let me tell you something funny.

57
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
Priest

58
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,050
is Lu Ye's father.

59
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,330
What?

60
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,870
Zhuofeng, don't joke about this.

61
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,840
Lu Ye's father died in a fire.

62
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,220
Priest also has burn scars on his face.

63
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,200
Lu Ye's father

64
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,980
had a birthmark.

65
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,860
Priest has one too.

66
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,780
I saw it with my own eyes.

67
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,280
What are we going to do now?

68
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,530
Who's still practicing

69
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,950
punches at this hour?

70
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,840
Judging by the rhythm of those punches,

71
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,730
it's her.

72
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,530
Zhuofeng.

73
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,730
What should we do about Lu Ye?

74
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,460
Should we tell her

75
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,170
about Priest?

76
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,170
Everything regarding Lu Ye

77
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,159
needs to end now.

78
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,880
Commander,

79
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,880
Priest has followed your orders

80
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,790
and abandoned Zhang Chongzheng.

81
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,130
The contract is fine,

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,430
but I have two conditions.

83
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,140
Commander, don't push your luck.

84
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,460
You eliminated Zhang Chongzheng,

85
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,200
whether because of his greed

86
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,150
or your so-called sincerity,

87
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,170
I think you know very well.

88
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,070
As your only option right now,

89
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,950
my conditions aren't harsh.

90
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,240
Please proceed.

91
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,169
First,

92
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,080
I want this woman

93
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,610
to belong to me completely.

94
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
I don't want

95
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,870
her lying beside me in bed

96
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,929
while working for you.

97
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,840
Commander,

98
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,760
you're hurting me.

99
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,140
And the second condition?

100
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,910
Second,

101
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,480
her sister Ding Le

102
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,500
must be safely delivered to me.

103
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,100
If anything happens to her during transit,

104
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
our cooperation ends immediately.

105
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,650
The Commander is just concerned about me

106
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,110
being away from my family,

107
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,840
that's why he made this request.

108
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,200
Right now,

109
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,050
the Commander is your only option, Priest,

110
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,450
but we're also the best option for him.

111
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,750
What matters most is reaching an agreement

112
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,150
so everyone wins, right?

113
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,130
I can agree

114
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,720
to both conditions.

115
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,200
But her sister

116
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,060
is too weak to be moved right now.

117
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,440
I think it's better

118
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,370
to wait until after her surgery,

119
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,130
complete our first deal,

120
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,120
and then I'll bring her back.

121
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,850
Then it's settled.

122
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,410
In seven days,

123
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,770
Hai City's railways

124
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,530
will be open to One Heart.

125
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,440
Our cooperation has been so pleasant.

126
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,700
Priest, I wonder if you

127
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,720
should also show his true face

128
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,590
and be honest with me now?

129
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,440
It really is you.

130
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,410
You've been

131
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,100
so quiet the whole way.

132
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,720
Is it worth it?

133
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,460
What are you referring to?

134
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,770
I mean,

135
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,510
for someone as wicked as me,

136
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,470
going this far,

137
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,940
dragging yourself into the abyss,

138
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,680
is it really worth it?

139
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,930
Answer me, is it worth it or not?

140
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,200
Ding Xi.

141
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,610
Five years ago when we fell in love,

142
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,210
I didn't understand you enough,

143
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
didn't understand your situation,

144
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,590
didn't understand your pain.

145
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,440
You're not a wicked woman,

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,360
you're just

just so you can carry me.

191
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,900
Why did you suddenly

192
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,330
bring me to the Lu family?

193
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,360
This is your own home,

194
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,660
you would have to return eventually.

195
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,810
Isn't this

196
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,530
what I gave you before?

197
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,440
Didn't I

198
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,680
throw it at you and break it?

199
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,560
You fixed it?

200
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,600
Yes.

201
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,130
This belongs to you,

202
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,130
I'm returning it now.

203
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,930
Returning it?

204
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,210
What do you mean?

205
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,810
This is your new identity.

206
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,960
No one will know who you used to be.

207
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,780
I've enrolled you in a girls' school.

208
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,190
You can go study there.

209
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,900
Yin Zhuofeng,

210
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,960
what are you talking about?

211
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,620
Your sister has been avenged.

212
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,770
Bronze Leaf's target, Zhang Chongzheng,

213
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,700
is already dead.

214
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,080
Golden Pleasure has been shut down.

215
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,320
One Heart's stronghold in Tang City

216
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,720
has also been destroyed.

217
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,540
You can start a new life now.

218
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,360
But Priest isn't dead yet.

219
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,160
One Heart hasn't been
completely eliminated yet.

220
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,850
They...

221
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,380
If you don't want to stay here,

222
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,650
you can choose the second option:

223
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,680
leave Hai City

224
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,580
and go to Southeast Asia.

225
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,960
I have a friend there

226
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,090
who can help you settle everything.

227
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,780
You want me to leave?

228
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,500
Your mission is over.

229
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,320
From today on,

230
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,370
Bronze Leaf has no more ties with you.

231
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,870
You're free now.

232
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,900
What about us?

233
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,490
What are we

234
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,850
to each other now?

235
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,570
Yin Zhuofeng, I'm asking you,

236
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,170
what are we to each other now?

237
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,990
What are we?

238
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,380
Are you referring to
that kiss on the rainy night?

239
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,410
Or are you talking about

240
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,190
all those things I said to you before?

241
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,430
Maybe you're still too young,

242
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,630
inexperienced,

243
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,220
and don't understand men yet.

244
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,540
Men

245
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,350
sometimes lose their minds.

246
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,440
Sometimes you have to try

247
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,280
to know if there's any feeling.

248
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,910
To be honest, that kiss was

249
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,310
somewhat disappointing.

250
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,210
I thought...

251
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,560
Thought what?

252
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,250
I thought I could see you
as more than a little sister.

253
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,920
But I realized that

254
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,270
a little girl is still just a little girl.

255
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,290
Liar!

256
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,540
Then why have you been
treating me so specially?

257
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,490
I've already told you
you're like a little sister to me,

258
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,690
what can I do about it?

259
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,120
Then what about this?

260
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,250
Why have you kept

261
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,210
this worthless thing all this time?

262
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,050
Why, when it broke,

263
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,580
did you still want to fix it?

264
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,330
I shouldn't have fixed it.

265
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,360
Now it's gone.
