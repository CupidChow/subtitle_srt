Your ears aren't pierced.

3
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,000
I've never had my ears pierced.

Will the first time

be painful?

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,040
This step is necessary.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,080
First, rub the earlobe with a pearl
until it's numb,

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,160
then pierce it,

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,950
and it won't hurt as much.

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,390
All dancers have pierced ears,

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,540
so you should too.

12
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,990
Never mind,

00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,380
you'd better not look.

Don't be afraid.

15
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,840

Miss, would you like a popsicle?

32
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,430
-Do you have any in orange flavor?
-Yes.

33

I'll take one then.

34
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,030
Certainly.

We've sent her to a safe place.

is a signature performance
exclusive to Golden Pleasure.

So

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,590
every dancer must master it.

97
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,910
So this must be what they use

98
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,350
to bribe officials.

99

long hair pinned up, with a pin

to set the elegance.

115
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,070
Dancing is

116
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,440
completely different

117
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,400
from playing the piano, painting,
or anything else.

118
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,630
Dancing is about the communication

119
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,320
between your body and your soul.

120
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,799

your body

122
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,200
will naturally relax.

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,390
The first move.

Let me see you try it.

128
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,590
You need to stick

129
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,930
your butt out at the same time.

130
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,870
Move it here.

131
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,090
At this point,

132
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,160
you need to snap your fingers.

133
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,390
Next, push your hips to the left.

134
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,180
And here, you need to make a full turn
with your hips.

135
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,960
Hold.

136
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,270

137
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,670
Then to the left again.

138
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,710
After that's done,

139
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,160
you need to bite the fan,

140
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,450
and move from below

141
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,710
all the way to the top.

142
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,080

And the excellent students
become great teachers.

181

Since the dance practice is almost done

182
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,160

consider me as your patron.

191
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,390
Wait.

192
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,540
Let me do it.

193
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,480
I mean,

194
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,390
I don't understand any of this anyway,

195
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,700
and if you're on the side,

196
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,100
you can see more clearly.

197
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,720
Like... This?

198
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,630
Wait.

199
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,680
We're not going to dance.

200
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,710
-Forget it then.
-No need to practice dancing,

201
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,240
but she needs
to practice the seductive gaze.

202
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,830
There's a popular actress who claims

203
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,650
that if any man

204
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,830
maintains eye contact with her
for 15 seconds,

205
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,160
he won't be able to resist

206
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,600
the urge to kiss her.

207
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,780
Lu Ye.

208
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,950
What you need to practice today

209
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,080
is exactly this.

210
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,840
However,

211
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,750
since you're a beginner,

212
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,150
I'll give you 30 seconds.

213
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,390
Within 30 seconds,

214
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,200
if you can make Zhuofeng want to kiss you,

215
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,660
I'll consider you passed.

216
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,440
Yin Zhuoqian, are you looking for trouble?

217
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,460
Timer

218
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,850
starts now.

219
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,990
Lu Ye.

220
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,390
Look up at Zhuofeng.

221
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,440
Zhuofeng.

222
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,560
Tell me the truth,

223
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,870
do you feel like kissing her?

224
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,990
Zhuofeng.

225
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,160
Your ears are turning red.

226
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,280
You're sweating.

227
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,160
Are you feeling something now?

228
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,030
Move a bit closer.

229
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,470
Daisy Wild.

230
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,100
Press your advantage.

231
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,800
Keep your gaze focused.

232
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,390
Look at him.

233
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,350
Stare at him.

234
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,800
Drown him!

235
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,930
Zhuofeng,

236
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,740
why did you kick me?

237
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,510
[Golden Pleasure]

238
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,320
Looks like the situation isn't
looking too good.

239
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,210
We came in right after
Zhang Chongzheng left.

240
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,750
By the time we got in,

241
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,920
she was already dead.

242
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,150
How many are there so far?

243
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,420
She's the eighteenth.

244
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,110
We'll dispose of

245
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,030
these women's bodies properly,

246
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,390
so no one will know

247
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,510
how they actually died.

248
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,560
What kind of woman

249
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,470
does Zhang Chongzheng
actually like?

250
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,630
No matter how many more dancers die,

251
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,280
before you win Yin Zhuoyi over,

252
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,920
Zhang Chongzheng

253
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,230
remains the Priest's essential partner.

254
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,250
Alright then.

255
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,680
Have Yin Lei arrange

256
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,940
for the next group of dancers to come in
as soon as possible.

257
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,110
Have you remembered all the secret signals
I taught you?

258
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,040
This

259
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,310
means everything's going smoothly.

260
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,520
This

261
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,710
means an emergency—call for help.

262
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,070
I've remembered them all.

263
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,320
What's wrong?

264
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,760
Is there a problem?

265
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,080
What if I miss you?

266
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,680
You...

267
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,750
Miss me?

268
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,860
I mean,

269
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:48,720
