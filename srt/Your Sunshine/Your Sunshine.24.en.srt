1
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,550
Lu Ye.

2
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,190
Don't worry,

3
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,400
I'm fine.

4
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,340
He was your father after all.

5
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,640
Since I returned to him

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,470
with ulterior motives,

7
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,550
I already anticipated

8
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,080
it would end this way.

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,840
I've actually imagined many scenarios

10
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,000
for how things would end for him.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,660
If only someone had helped him

12
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,680
after he survived that ordeal,

13
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,080
reached out to him,

14
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,680
told him not to take the wrong path,

15
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,930
perhaps he wouldn't be

16
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,680
beyond redemption now.

17
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,860
Then let's stay here

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,229
and keep him company.

19
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,500
Okay.

20
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,590
[Your Sunshine]

21
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,520
[Episode 24 Sunrise]

22
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,320
Commander,

23
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,950
we've done everything we could,

24
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,410
but Miss Ding might not...

25
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,510
You may leave now.

26
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,360
Zhuoyi.

27
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:35,800
Zhuoyi.

28
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,220
Why the long face?

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,800
I love to see you smile.

30
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,829
The doctors in Hai City
aren't good enough.

31
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,900
I'll find a better hospital

32
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,220
and better doctors to save you.

33
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,550
I heard what the doctor said

34
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,960
just now.

35
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,079
Zhuoyi.

36
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,430
I'm afraid of hospitals

37
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,920
and even more afraid of surgery,
you know that.

38
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,200
Please don't take me there, okay?

39
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:32,920
Ding Xi.

40
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,410
You're going to be fine.

41
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,450
I suddenly

42
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,390
want to see the sunset.

43
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,070
Take me there.

44
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,710
Okay?

45
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,950
Alright.

46
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,130
Ding Xi,

47
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,670
didn't you say

48
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,960
you wanted to see the sunset?

49
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,880
Hold on a little longer.

50
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,200
We're almost there.

51
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,930
Okay.

52
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,800
We'll see it soon.

53
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,630
Last time you said

54
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,890
when I get old,

55
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,480
you'd help me walk.

56
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,490
Look at you now,

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,560
making me carry you instead.

58
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,790
Are we there yet?

59
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,070
Where is

60
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,840
the sun?

61
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,980
The sun

62
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,670
is about to set.

63
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,450
It's beautiful.

64
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,110
Zhuoyi,

65
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,840
let's make a promise.

66
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,800
In our next life,

67
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,360
if I meet you again,

68
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,990
we'll

69
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,040
watch the sunrise together.

70
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,070
Then I won't

71
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,040
need you to carry me anymore.

72
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,350
I'll go with you,

73
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,870
climbing up step by step,

74
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,920
to watch the sun rise.

75
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,220
Okay? Promise?

76
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,870
You're holding me like this now,

77
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,480
but what will you do when I'm old?

78
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,550
What else can I do?

79
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,240
I'll carry you on my back.

80
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,310
Okay.

81
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,400
Then I want to
watch the sunrise from the mountain,

82
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,430
and you'll carry me up step by step.

83
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,840
What if when I'm old

84
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,040
and my legs don't work well anymore?

85
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,360
What can I do?

86
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,080
I'll support you, of course.

87
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,750
Alright.

88
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,530
I'll do as you say.

89
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,110
Huanyuan.

90
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,960
All the goods Zhuoyi supplied
to the Thunder Gang,

91
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,600
the taverns, inns, gambling houses,

92
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,200
I've checked everything...

93
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,480
What do you mean? Checking what?

94
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,990
Are you worried
I might be skimming off the top?

95
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,280
I wasn't finished.

96
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,310
The goods for the taverns,
inns, and gambling houses

97
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,770
were all destroyed by you.

98
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,060
And you bought back
at a premium the batch

99
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,800
that didn’t go through the Thunder Gang.

100
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,230
When I check all these details,

101
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,480
they match the quantity that Lu Ye

102
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,430
received from Priest.

103
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,659
We didn't let the opium

104
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:01,040
flow into
the pipes of Hai City's citizens.

105
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,800
Next,

106
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,360
we need to find
the remaining half

107
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,280
of the goods

108
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,670
and destroy them.

109
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,350
Can't wait, can you? Come on.

110
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Yin Huanyuan, honestly,

111
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,250
you're really something.

112
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,860
If you hadn't gone down
the wrong path years ago,

113
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,690
who knows

114
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,630
how much good you could have done.

115
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,990
Put your hand down. Show some respect,

116
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,110
I'm older than you.

117
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,300
I'm just treating you
like my brother, aren't I?

118
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,500
Don't be ungrateful.

119
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,950
That day, in that situation,

120
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,640
not only Lu Ye's father,

121
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,429
but Ding Xi also died.

122
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,760
Has Zhuoyi contacted you?

123
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,570
When Lu Ye and I
arrived at that clubhouse,

124
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,010
Zhuoyi had already left with Ding Xi.

125
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,090
There was also trouble
at our Commander's Mansion.

126
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,590
Actually, lately,

127
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,240
I really miss the days
when Zhuoyi would call us

128
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,260
to come home for dinner together.

129
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
I'm hungry anyway,

130
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,550
let's eat something.

131
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,750
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

132
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,450
Get him!

133
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,080
Excuse me.

134
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,940
Nice watch you got there. Let me see it.

135
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,700
Let go!

136
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,950
Don't run!

137
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,800
You dare hit me? Get back here!

138
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,920
Darn you!

139
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,920
Zhuofeng.

140
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,000
Huanyuan.

141
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,600
Look over there.

142
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,000
Is that Zhuoyi?

143
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,760
Quick, check if
he has anything else valuable.

144
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,520
Who are you people?

145
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,840
Get them!

146
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,300
Zhuoyi! Zhuoyi!

147
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,400
Zhuoyi!

148
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,760
Get away! Leave me alone!

149
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,190
Yin Zhuoyi.

150
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,430
You're only one year older than me,

151
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,890
why act so high and mighty?

152
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,470
If you want to drink,

153
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,520
come back with us.

154
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,190
Right.

155
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,920
Let's drink at Moonrise Tavern.

156
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,760
But...

157
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,550
I want to eat

158
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,980
the food you cook, Zhuoyi.

159
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,680
Zhuofeng,

160
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,520
Zhuoqian,

161
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,580
Huanyuan.

162
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,050
I don't deserve to be called brother.

163
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,350
Alright,

164
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,140
the four of us brothers

165
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,230
will go home for dinner.

166
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:07,700
Let's go.

167
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,250
The Yin family brothers

168
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,470
stand united.

169
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,460
Together we're unstoppable!

170
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,940
Zhuoyi, you have no idea

171
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,290
that Zhuoqian now
calls Huanyuan "Third Brother."

172
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,740
Zhuoyi.

173
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,640
Zhuoyi!

174
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,890
Zhuofeng.

175
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,400
Zhuoqian.

176
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,240
Huanyuan.

177
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,710
I've made too many mistakes

178
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,700
and can't face you all anymore.

179
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,350
I must take responsibility

180
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,040
for what I've done.

181
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,290
All of you have followed
Commander Yin Senior

182
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,740
through thick and thin.

183
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,300
We don't need fine clothes or fancy food.

184
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,760
We don't need to enter the wider world,

185
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,710
or afford any delicacies.

186
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,200
We only need to be worthy
of our wives and children,

187
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,090
and of our own lives.

188
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,950
But what has Yin Zhuoyi
given us in return?

189
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,030
This is what we get,

190
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,690
betrayal and ingratitude.

191
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,880
If he remains the Commander of Hai City
for one more day,

192
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,040
my fate today

193
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,070
will be yours tomorrow.

194
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,880
From today on,

195
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,670
Hai City

196
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,640
needs no commander

197
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,640
and Yin Zhuoyi will no longer exist
in the Commander's Mansion.

198
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,350
All of you can join me

199
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,670
to share in the wealth and glory.

200
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,130
Lieutenant Xu,
you've given me quite a surprise,

201
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,010
not only providing
better distribution channels,

202
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,470
but also showing
more skill than Yin Zhuoyi

203
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,520
in winning people over.

204
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,160
The surprise you gave me
was even bigger,

205
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,040
wasn’t it, Miss Kawashima?

206
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,800
Now that

207
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,310
you're the new agent for One Heart,

208
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,520
I hope for

209
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,990
a pleasant cooperation.

210
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,880
Looking forward to working together.

211
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,670
Young Master Huanyuan,
Miss Jinzhi just sent someone

212
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,950
to give you this.

213
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,240
Opium from One Heart.

214
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,970
Xiao Jinzhi suddenly appears

215
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,910
and sends more opium.

216
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,870
Could she be working for One Heart now?

217
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,400
Is the rest of the shipment
in her possession?

218
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,280
Why are you looking at me like that?

219
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,710
Everyone knows how Xiao Jinzhi feels

220
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,830
about you.

221
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,980
My instinct tells me

222
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,300
she's coming for you.

223
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,560
What if

224
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,190
she's really coming for you?

225
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,020
What if

226
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,070
she really is with One Heart?

227
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,590
What must be faced

228
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,430
can't be avoided.

229
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,710
Xiao Jinzhi,

230
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,170
where have you been lately?

231
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,770
Spotlessly clean,

232
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,670
it's somewhat touching.

233
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,830
Don't touch it!

234
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,630
Fine,

235
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,970
I won't touch anything.

236
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,030
I've always listened to you.

237
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,800
I'm waiting for the day

238
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,560
when you'll listen to me too.

239
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,400
Tell me where

240
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,670
this opium came from.

241
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,190
Huanyuan,

242
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,870
stop pretending you don't know.

243
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,950
You know

244
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,950
this belongs to One Heart.

245
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,880
So you're with One Heart now,

246
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,410
just like Priest?

247
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,880
"Priest"?

248
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,869
Just a pretentious title.

249
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,910
As for me,

250
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,200
I am the wife of

251
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,849
One Heart's leader,

252
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,900
Kawashima Jinzhi.

253
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,280
I don't care what your name is

254
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,680
or what your identity is.

255
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Tell me

256
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,720
where the other half of the opium
bound for Hai City is.

257
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,680
The remaining half of the opium...

258
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,870
Let me think.

259
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,350
Some might have been
mixed into ordinary tobacco.

260
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,070
Some of it

261
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,980
might have accidentally
fallen into tea leaves.

262
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,870
And then,

263
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,200
perhaps some was mixed into

264
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,470
the incense
burned by common people.

265
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,850
I want everyone in Hai City

266
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,000
to taste the opium.

267
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,300
Once the taste

268
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,800
seeps into their blood,

269
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,110
I'll make

270
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,430
a fortune selling it.

271
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,530
You've truly gone mad.

272
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,180
You really want to
stop this from happening,

273
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,300
don't you?

274
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,170
I'll make you kiss me

275
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,070
in front of her.

276
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,860
If you kiss me now,

277
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,750
I'll give you all

278
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,670
the opium.

279
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,150
I don't have

280
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,550
what you want.

281
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,090
Even if I kissed you,

282
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,470
there would be no love between us.

283
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,110
I don't need love at all.

284
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,690
I want you to submit to me,

285
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,930
look at me seriously

286
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,030
and please me.

287
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,630
You'll come to me sooner or later.
