71
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,920

on the ring was?

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,770
I didn't know before,

77
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,460
but I do now.

78
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,560
So do you think there's something wrong
with her?

79
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,960
I used to think so,

80
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,080
but not anymore.

81
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,920
Zhuoyi.

82
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,480
You said it yourself that

83
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,610
brothers shouldn't fight each other.

84
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,650
Having Xiao Jinzhi around you

85
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,920
isn't a good thing.

86
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,750
You know what I'm talking about, right?

87
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,990
I'll take care of it.

88
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,570
Zhuoyi.

89
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,590
Zhuofeng.

90
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,440
You've been hiding this from me
for quite a while.

91
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,570
I've thoroughly investigated
Lu Ye's background

92
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,750
and found no issues whatsoever.

93
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,350
Tomorrow, I'll

94
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,810
send all information related to her

95
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,740
to your office in complete detail.

96
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,290
Yin Lei

97
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,360
is her enemy,
the one who killed her sister.

98
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,410
She's not the little girl
from three years ago anymore.

99
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,740
I have only one request:

100
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,290
don't let emotions cloud your judgment.

101
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,530
I want Yin Lei alive.

102
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,330
One more thing.

103
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,140
Huanyuan is one of our own.

104
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,190
I know what I'm doing.

105
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,560
The men of the Yin family

106
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,090
are all such hopeless romantics.

107
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,470
Yin Zhuofeng.

108
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,230
You've won.

109
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,340
We're leaving now.

110
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,990
Not before we settle the score
between us.

111
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,920
There's no rush.

112
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,960
Your people

113
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,560
broke the rules.

114
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,670
I'll deal with my people myself.

115
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,460
If you handle it,

116
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,760
I only want one of her fingers.

117
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,270
But if I handle it myself,

118
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,210
I'll take her life.

119
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,030
Yin Zhuofeng!

120
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,830
Rather than letting him do it,

121
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,060
you might as well just kill me.

122
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,420
Is this enough?

123
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,780
If not, you can have this arm of mine.

124
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,390
I'll handle what I've started myself!

125
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,440
I'll take whole responsibility
for my own actions.

126
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,560
Must this end in death today?

127
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,810
Take whole responsibility
for your own actions?

128
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,400
Don't let me see you again.

129
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,160
Get lost.

130
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,040
Master.

131
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,560
Why did you suddenly decide
to bring me here for noodles?

132
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,110
From now on, no one will suspect

133
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,590
that you're a member of One Heart anymore.

134
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,790
You don't need to hide anymore, either.

135
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,560
Freedom feels

136
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,200
so good.

137
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,570
Master.

138
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,800
Are you worried that

139
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,370
since the match is over

140
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,530
and I've won,
I'll have to go on missions again?

141
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,740
You're not

142
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,570
changing your mind again

143
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,430
and wanting me to give up, are you?

144
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,080
Let's not talk about this today.

145
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,100
You won the match today.

146
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,300
We should celebrate properly.

147
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,940
Is there any way you'd like to celebrate?

148
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,200
I want to drink this.

149
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,970
You're injured. You can't drink this.

150
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,680
I insist.

151
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,960
Then let's

152
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,750
settle it according to
the rules of Bronze Leaf

153
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,510
and have an arm wrestling match.

154
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,560
If I win,

155
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,870
let me drink.

156
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,280
You want to compete with me?

157
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,010
What,

158
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,260
are you scared, Master Zhuofeng?

159
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,330
Don't cry when you lose.

160
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,380
I won't.

161
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,160
One,

go!

165
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,520
Hey, you're cheating.

166
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,280
You're not following the rules.

167
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,040
