1
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,020
I have a feeling that

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,870
Xiao Jinzhi didn't mean it.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,670
If things are really as she said,

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,210
once the opium spreads,

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,060
it'll be beyond our control.

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,240
Xiao Jinzhi's plan

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,300
is truly vicious.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,570
Huanyuan.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,620
If she wants to kiss you, just let her.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,490
One kiss from you

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,420
and all our problems would be gone.

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,670
Yin Huanyuan, are you crazy?

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,350
If you want to kiss her, go ahead.

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,150
But she didn't ask me to kiss her.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,560
Zhuofeng.

16
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,680
He kissed me!

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,370
Little brat, what do you know?

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,850
Yin Zhuofeng, let me ask you.

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,930
If you were in this kind of situation,

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,990
would you kiss her?

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,780
That situation...

22
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,740
I wouldn't find myself in that situation.

23
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,930
She fell in love with someone

24
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,590
who could never love her back.

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,620
After being humble in love for too long,

26
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,700
what she wants

27
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,360
might be your compromise,

28
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,490
making you give in step by step.

29
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,990
Or perhaps,

30
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,650
what she wants is your understanding

31
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,620
and attention.

32
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,550
Love is way too complicated.

33
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,780
Huanyuan.

34
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,420
I think

35
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,170
sometimes,

36
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,670
for certain things,

37
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,320
you just have to go all out.

38
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,980
Put down your glass.

39
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,650
You want me to go all out, huh?

40
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,770
Going all out, huh?

41
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,220
Come on, let's go all out!

42
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,230
Don't dodge! Come on!

43
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,060
Let go of me!

44
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:19,980
I...

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,380
-I won't say that again!
-Talking about going all out!

46
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,380
I'm going all out!

47
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,630
-Come on!
-Go away.

48
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,240
[Your Sunshine]

49
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,130
[Episode 25: His Motto]

50
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,350
Miss Kawashima.

51
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,620
Yin Huanyuan is here.

52
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,380
Let him in.

53
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,810
I knew you would come to see me,

54
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,100
but I didn't expect it to be so soon.

55
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,010
What,

56
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,380
have you and your dear brothers decided on

57
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,570
how to deal with me?

58
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:02,980
Jinzhi.

59
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,570
Your return this time has truly forced

60
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,970
all of us to confront you.

61
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,350
I can submit to you,

62
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,940
if that's...

63
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,230
If that's what you want.

64
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,090
How would you submit?

65
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,890
My eyes, nose, and mouth...

66
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,980
Which part do you long for the most?

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,280
When you take the initiative...

68
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,329
So impish.

69
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,210
So what would you like me to do?

70
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,220
First, help me bathe and get changed.

71
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,310
Done changing.

72
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,470
Huanyuan, smell this.

73
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,050
My bathwater.

74
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,140
Is it fragrant?

75
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,460
A rose bath

76
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,170
is only enjoyable with wine.

77
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,460
Got it.

78
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,340
Did you find it?

79
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,710
The glass broke. I'll get another one.

80
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,420
I mean,

81
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,640
did you find what you were looking for?

82
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,260
The thing you want is right here.

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,720
The address where
the rest of the goods are stored.

84
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,580
Want it?

85
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:48,620
You...

86
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,890
If you spend more time looking,

87
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,090
the writing will be ruined by the water.

88
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,340
Keep looking.

89
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,370
I did give you the right information,
didn't I?

90
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,810
A red wine bath

91
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,110
is good for health.

92
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,600
It suits you better.

93
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,790
Take your time bathing.

94
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,780
Xiao Jinzhi was even willing

95
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,420
to give you the warehouse address.

96
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,750
How did you end up dropping it
in the water?

97
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,500
I fished this out of her bathtub.

98
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,190
W-What did you say?

99
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,070
So you... Put your hand into her bathtub?

100
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:51,690
If you're so interested,

101
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,970
why don't you go write a column
for "Hai City Daily"?

102
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,500
That would suit you better.

103
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,930
Well, I'm still more interested in

104
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,690
your bathtub-searching skills.

105
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,950
Should I say thank you?

106
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,580
Yin Zhuofeng.

107
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,690
If you can't decode this,

108
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,890
it would really be a waste of my efforts.

109
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,780
"Outside Gusu City stands Hanshan Temple,"

110
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,930
"where midnight bells
reach boats at anchor."

111
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,930
"I ask where I might find a tavern,"

112
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,020
"and a shepherd boy points to...

113
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,950
Xinghua Village in the distance."

114
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,860
The goods are likely in
one of these three places:

115
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,980
on a certain ship at the dock
outside the city,

116
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,540
in Xinghua Village within the city,

117
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,050
or at the brewery on the outskirts.

118
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,860
It seems

119
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,420
we'll need to split up.

120
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,390
I'll go to the brewery.

121
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,500
I'll go to Xinghua Village then.

122
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,860
I'll head to the dock outside the city.

123
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,650
Okay.

124
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,610
What about me?

125
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,820
You still need to keep

126
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,460
a close eye on Xiao Jinzhi.

127
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,920
As if you needed to tell me.

128
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,330
If there's any news from Zhuoyi,

129
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,020
we'll be counting on you to let us know.

130
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,850
Also,

131
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,530
there's one more person
you need to watch closely.

132
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,340
Who is it?

133
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,620
Xu Hai.

134
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,060
Miss Kawashima, please rest assured.

135
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,700
The goods are safe with me.

136
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,450
They're not going anywhere.

137
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,730
Commander.

138
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,670
You're not supposed to be here.

139
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,040
I remember you.

140
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,300
Back when

141
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,460
you joined the Yin Army,

142
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,650
you said,

143
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,110
"staying alive is nothing;

144
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,890
making it out of

145
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,510
the underworld alive,

146
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,220
that's true skill."

147
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,820
I just never thought

148
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,830
those words would apply to me.

149
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,250
Thanks, men.

150
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,590
I'll just go in for a while.

151
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,530
If I make it out alive,

152
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,700
you'll get

153
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,500
everything you want.

154
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,060
You're here.

155
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:49,770
Xu Hai.

156
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,180
You're sitting in the wrong seat.

157
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,040
Just trying out a different seat.

158
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,460
Nothing is permanent.

159
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,980
Sit down.

160
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,830
Want a drink?

161
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,820
Sure.

162
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,410
Yin Zhuoyi, we've practiced shooting
together since we were kids.

163
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,220
I know

164
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,560
when it comes to shooting,

165
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,960
you're not as fast as I am.

166
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,220
Xu Hai.

167
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,930
For over a decade,

168
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,580
we've been both
teacher and friend to each other.

169
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,580
These four shots

170
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,610
are to repay your care for me.

171
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,240
I've truly owed you over these years.

172
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,670
These three shots

173
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,620
are to make up for what I owe you.

174
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,130
Now,

175
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,130
it's time to settle

176
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,220
the score between us.

177
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,490
Yin Zhuoyi.

178
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,490
You can't even
count your bullets properly.

179
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,230
How do you plan to settle the score
with me?

180
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,260
You just fired seven shots.

181
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,460
You're out of bullets.

182
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,870
Xu Hai.

183
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,810
I've told you

184
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,110
you're sitting in the wrong seat.

185
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,940
Where are the rest of the goods?

186
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,660
We

187
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,590
wish to continue following you, Commander.

188
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,580
From today on,

189
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,860
there'll be no

190
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,160
Commander Yin in Hai City,

191
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,160
nor Commander's Mansion.

192
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,620
This is the last of
the Yin family's possessions,

193
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,940
a humble gift to you all.

194
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,940
Farewell

195
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,770
on the road ahead,

196
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,140
and may you each find peace.

197
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,000
Zhuoyi.

198
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:57,890
Zhuoyi.

199
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,890
Huanyuan.

200
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,650
You're back.

201
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,180
Zhuoyi, I'm glad you're okay.

202
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,220
Come with me now.

203
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,369
Huanyuan. Those goods

204
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,500
were brought in by me.

205
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,369
I was supposed to

206
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,000
dispose of them myself.

207
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,790
But this family is falling apart.

208
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,250
I want to see it one more time.

209
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,540
Please

210
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,500
hand this over to Zhuofeng.

211
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,370
Zhuoyi...

212
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,210
Don't worry.

213
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,000
I won't run away this time.

214
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,740
After you've taken care of everything,

215
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,360
the four of us brothers

216
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,240
will have a meal together.

217
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,500
Hurry up and go.

218
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,370
