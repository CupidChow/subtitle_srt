why he would bring a woman here?

188
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,470
Also,

189
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,860
Bronze Leaf

190
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,440
is run by Yin Zhuofeng.

191
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,060
If anything happens to me,

192
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,420
you won't get away with it.

193
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,050
If I get even a scratch,

194
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,170
he'll tear you apart.

195
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,680
Qiu Cheng.

196
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,480
Are you okay?

197
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,200
I'm fine, Lu Ye.

198
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,090
It's nothing.

199
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,660
I'm Yin Zhuofeng's person.

200
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,170
If I got a scratch,

201
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,650
he'll tear you apart.

202
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,390
Whether it's honorable or not,

203
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,990
winning is all that matters.

204
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,250
Every place has its own rules.

205
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,060
Your job is to follow them,

206
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,330
not to change them.

207
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,560
Okay,

208
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
I understand.

209
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,870
Pack your things
and go to the Commander's mansion.

210
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,400
Lu Ye.

211
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,290
Jia Fan.

212
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,010
The Intelligence Team
is not a place for you,

213
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,010
please leave now.

214
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,720
I just saw the door was open,

215
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,680
so I came in for a look around.

216
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,400
By the way, Qiu Cheng,

217
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,680
do you know where Master Zhuofeng went?

218
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,320
I heard Master Zhuofeng
went out on business today.

219
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,290
I don't know

220
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,770
where he went.

221
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,050
Alright,

222
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,540
I'll go look for him.

223
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,840
Jia Fan.

224
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,960
Lu Ye isn't deliberately
trying to oppose you.

225
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,220
She also hopes to get along well with you.

226
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,690
I understand,

227
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,460
I'll get along with her.

228
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,849
Your room is nicely decorated.

229
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,400
Come with me quietly,

230
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,930
so I don't have to use force.

231
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,839
Zhuofeng.

232
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,450
The official competition is in two weeks,

233
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,210
with Lu Ye's current abilities.

234
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,339
Meeting Xiao Jinzhi

235
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,770
is like asking for death.

236
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,010
I still don't know the name

237
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,490
of my opponent from Bronze Leaf today.

238
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,770
You'll find out

239
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,780
after our match.
