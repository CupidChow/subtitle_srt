1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,200
He's about to escape.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,450
He won't get away.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,580
Let's keep him here.

4
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,290
Two knives are stuck in his arteries.

5
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,750
He won't live much longer.

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,470
Someone's coming. Come with me.

7
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,120
No.

8
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,910
I haven't completed my mission.

9
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,530
I can't leave.

10
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,660
You can't explain what happened here.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,190
You're the one who needs to go.

12
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,920
You can't let them see you here.

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
He's my father.

14
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,320
Leave him to me.

15
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,650
Ding Xi is coming.

16
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,640
Go now.

17
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,220
[Your Sunshine]

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,190
[Episode 16 Enter the Tiger's Gate]

19
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,070
Well, if it isn't
the heir of the Thunder Gang.

20
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,850
What kind of

21
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,790
patricide drama are you performing today?

22
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,780
Just some family disgrace
best kept private.

23
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,470
Miss Ding,

24
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,579
please don't take offense.

25
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,680
I initially approached
you for cooperation.

26
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,250
Only after you refused did I turn to your father.

27
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,360
Now that things have come to this,

28
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,020
how am I supposed to handle it?

29
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,680
Missed opportunities can always be rekindled.

30
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,410
True enough.

31
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,450
Actually, I don't really care

32
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,200
who's in charge of the Thunder Gang.

33
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
What matters most is that the person

34
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,520
is obedient

35
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,570
and reliable.

36
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,030
I apologize for today's abruptness.

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,580
Once I return and reorganize things,

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,700
I'll personally come to make amends.

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,690
Very well.

40
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,080
But those girls

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,210
your father suddenly took away today,

42
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,440
will you take over that business too?

43
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,760
She is right here.

44
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,170
Do as you please.

45
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,329
Miss Ding.

46
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,600
Daisy Wild?

47
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,150
Don't be afraid,

48
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,630
I'm here with you.

49
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,410
Zhuofeng.

50
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,079
You should treat

51
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,910
those wounds on your body.

52
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,040
No need.

53
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,550
The pain feels right.

54
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,080
I know.

55
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,320
You feel that what happened today

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,390
was unfair to Lu Ye.

57
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,930
But this plan to draw out Yin Lei

58
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,520
was agreed upon by all three of us,

59
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,570
including Lu Ye herself.

60
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,760
Zhuofeng.

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,050
Zhuofeng.

62
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,409
I was part of today's events too,

63
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,810
count me in.

64
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,260
What happened to your father later?

65
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,580
He passed away.

66
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,720
I put a knife in Yin Lei.

67
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,910
He was your father.

68
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,530
I'll repay you.

69
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,390
Zhuofeng.

70
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,340
You really want to make it up to me?

71
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,470
Fine.

72
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,730
Just try to touch him,
Yin Huanyuan!

73
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,180
One joke for each cut.

74
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,520
Fair enough.

75
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,659
Yin Lei.

76
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,840
He tricked my mother into smoking opium,

77
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,300
conspired with One Heart,

78
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,510
and killed Lu Yi.

79
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,280
In my heart, he's no longer my father.

80
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,600
Come on, if you
really want to make it up to me,

81
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,490
drink this whole bottle,

82
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,010
and we'll call it even.

83
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,140
That's a whole bottle, Zhuofeng.

84
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,670
Fine.

85
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,590
We'll call it even.

86
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,380
What are you staring at?

87
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,990
You have some too.

88
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,960
I won't let you look down on me.

89
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,220
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

90
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,830
Huanyuan.

91
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,100
With your father's death,

92
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,200
the Thunder Gang
will likely face some turmoil.

93
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,770
What are your plans?

94
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,930
I need to return to Hai City
to reorganize my forces,

95
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,240
to become someone

96
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,810
Lu Yi truly wanted me to be.

97
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,750
Here.

98
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,409
To your success,

99
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,810
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

100
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,400
Miss Ding.

101
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,890
Daisy Wild.

102
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,640
We didn’t get to chat

103
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
after coming back from the theater.

104
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,480
Have a seat.

105
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Why did you come to work
as a dancer at Golden Pleasure?

106
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,160
Since I was young,

107
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,190
I lost both my parents,

108
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,450
and my only sister also died tragically.

109
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,830
In these chaotic times,

110
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,920
I've lived hand to mouth for a long time.

111
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,060
Had enough of that.

112
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,020
I want to make something of myself,

113
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,300
to associate with
the powerful and wealthy,

114
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,440
to have a place
where I can establish myself.

115
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,630
Miss Ding, what are you doing?

116
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,050
I asked those dancers from this afternoon.

117
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,400
They said there was poisonous smoke,

118
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,340
and everyone passed out.

119
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,650
How come you alone were fine?

120
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,130
At that time, they all fainted.

121
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,440
I saw them collapse,

122
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,990
so I covered my mouth
and nose and tried to run.

123
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,660
I just wanted to survive.

124
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,110
So Yin Lei's death

125
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,930
had nothing to do with you?

126
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,980
When the poisonous smoke rose,

127
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,210
I also passed out.

128
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
When I woke up,

129
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,730
Yin Lei was already dead.

130
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,990
I only saw Yin Huanyuan

131
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,570
kneeling on the ground, kowtowing to him.

132
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,170
I truly don't know anything.

133
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,180
Have an orange.

134
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,150
Daisy Wild.

135
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,920
Actually, from the first time I saw you,

136
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,160
I liked you.

137
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,070
I can offer you two paths to choose from.

138
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,870
The first is freedom.

139
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,630
You can leave Golden Pleasure right now.

140
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,460
However,

141
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,490
your future days

142
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,060
might be filled with uncertainty.

143
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,980
The second path

144
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,090
could bring you immediate success

145
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,300
and financial security.

146
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,230
But there's also a possibility...

147
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,280
What possibility?

148
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,610
You might

149
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,370
end up completely destroyed.

150
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,300
No need to answer me right away.

151
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,760
Think about it and let me know...

152
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,160
I choose the second path.

153
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,730
People always strive for better things,

154
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,730
and life and death

155
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,290
are in my own hands.

156
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,310
Good,

157
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,560
congratulations.

158
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,010
Tomorrow at 6 p.m.,

159
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,900
I'll come pick you up myself.

160
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,260
Okay.

161
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,950
By the way,

162
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,000
after what happened at the theater,

163
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,490
Golden Pleasure now has a curfew.

164
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,280
You can't just

165
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,850
wander around anymore.

166
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,250
Otherwise,

167
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,920
watch out or they might break your legs.

168
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,130
I understand.

169
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,760
That outfit on the table

170
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,690
is a gift for you.

171
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,800
Thank you, Miss Ding.

172
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,920
So Yin Lei's death

173
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,010
had nothing to do with you?

174
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,540
No one would know if I killed him here.

175
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,270
This is the perfect opportunity.
I can't miss it.

176
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,160
Yin Lei is dead.

177
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,730
I've finally avenged my sister.

178
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,010
Who are you really?

179
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,730
You used this gun...

180
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,090
My second uncle, Yin Lei.

181
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,850
To kill my sister, didn't you?

182
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,200
Tell me.

183
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,630
How do you plan to get your revenge?

184
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,920
Whoever killed her...

185
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,820
I'll make you pay with your life today.

186
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,460
I'll kill whoever did it.

187
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,300
You need this to kill someone.

188
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,500
-Let go of me!
-Lu Ye.

189
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,050
Lu Ye.

190
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,270
Lu Ye, it's me.

191
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,660
It's me.

192
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,410
Why are you here?

193
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,540
Have you been drinking?

194
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,410
I wanted to keep you company.

195
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,250
I avenged my sister,

196
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,920
♪ It's late, the street
suddenly feels strange ♪

197
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,330
Yin Lei is dead too,

198
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,480
but why can't I feel happy?

199
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,090
♪ Your room light's still on ♪

200
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,440
Why can't I just feel happy?

201
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:46,430

202
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:56,180

♪ Don't ask, how can I know what to do ♪

205
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,850
Alright.

206
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:15,480

207
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,600

♪ After drifting half a life,

210
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,210
It's all over now.

211

Don't worry,

212
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,040
♪ And when I turn around,
I find you're also waiting ♪

213
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,370
I'm still here with you.

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,170

♪ That's the way you look at me gently ♪

217
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,980
After Yin Lei's death,

218
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,650
what are your plans for the Thunder Gang?

219
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,680
A man like Yin Lei is no loss

220
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,930
when he's gone.

221
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,390
The Thunder Gang is still in Hai City.

222
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,090
I advise you not to

223
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,280
rock the boat at this time.

224
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,910
You need to move faster with Yin Zhuoyi.

225
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,920
Priest's patience

226
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,450
is running thin.

227
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,080
Once Daisy Wild handles Zhang Chongzheng,

228
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,040
our plan will be halfway complete.

229
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,440
Ding Xi,

230
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,200
Priest wants more than just half.

231
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,170
Ji Sen.

232
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,490
Go tell Daisy Wild

233
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,890
to prepare for receiving guests tomorrow.

234
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,210
Sure.

235
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,579
Have you seen Daisy Wild?

236
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,490
No.

237
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,780
Mr. Ji.

238
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,220
I heard the boss lady chose Daisy Wild.

239
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,980
Why was she selected?

240
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,230
Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

241
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,030
If there's any danger tomorrow,

242
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,640
send me a signal immediately.

243
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll be waiting for you in the hall.

244
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,680
Remember,

245
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,530
safety comes first.

246
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,290
Okay,

247
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,590
don't worry.

248
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,330
What's wrong?

249
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,560
Someone's coming.

250
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,390
Let go of me, Sir.

251
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,220
Let me go.

252
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,080
Sir.

253
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,960
Sir, let go of me.

254
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,700
Sir.

255
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,380
Sir.

256
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,310
Sir, please don't do this.

257
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,610
Sir.

258
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,280
Dear guest...

259
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,010
-Let go of her.
-Hit me.

260
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,150
Mr. Ji,

261
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,020
he's had too much to drink.

262
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,310
I'm not drunk.

263
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,240
I just like you.

264
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,320
Dear guest,

265
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,640
what kind of girl would you prefer?

266
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,810
I can find someone to entertain you.

267
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,530
I like a girl who can

268
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,330
conjure stars for me in the darkness.

269
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,580
Can you find me one?

270
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,570
You're quite the joker.

271
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,590
There's no such girl.

272
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,100
Daisy Wild.

273
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,450
I'll come back for you.
