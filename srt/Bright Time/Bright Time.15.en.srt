[The last-2-minute twist]
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,990
What are you doing here?

4
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,750
Mr. Zhao asked you here?

5
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,630
Mr. Zhao also invited you, huh

6
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,790
What's it to you?

7
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,350
Do you have any say in this?

8
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,030
I don't wanna argue with you

9
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,030
It was me who asked Zhao Yun to ask you all

10
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,750
Who are you?

11
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,550
Let me introduce myself

12
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,910
My surname is Wu

13
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,630
I'm the coach of Hengyuan team

14
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,070
Coach Wu Xuan

15
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,990
So why did you come to us?

16
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,150
Are you interested in

17
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,750
a trial opportunity with Hengyuan team?

18
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,750
Are you saying we can participate

19
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,870
in the trial for Hengyuan team?

20
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,350
Not all of you

21
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,150
Only one spot available

22
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,830
I only need the strongest player

23
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,990
I'll be closely watching

24
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,790
the upcoming matches

25
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,870
Looking forward to

26
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,030
your performance on the field

27
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,830
Brother Hui

28
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,390
What happened?

29
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:04,870
Nothing

30
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,510
Let's go to class

31
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:06,910
Okay

32
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,390
The power of Chinese culture

33
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,750
is concentrated in

34
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,950
the power of national spirit

35
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,270
So what's the core of national spirit?

36
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,750
We've discussed this before

37
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,790
Lan Jinghui

38
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,190
Lan Jinghui

39
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,270
Answer this question

40
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,030
National spirit

41
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:31,950
Take a seat

42
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,270
Pay attention and don't get distracted

43
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,350
We discussed

44
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,310
the core of national spirit before

45
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,350
It's patriotism

46
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,870
Patriotism is not abstract,

47
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,310
but concrete

48
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,150
In different periods,

49
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,550
it has different specific meanings

50
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,990
In today's China,

51
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,830
loving the country and loving socialism

52
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,990
are essentially the same

53
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,550
Well...

54
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,310
Our school basketball team...

55
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,190
What basketball team?

56
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,790
Look at the time on the clock

57
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,710
Where have you been?

58
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,310
Why are you back so late?

59
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,150
You're not studying properly all day long,

60
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,510
always doing useless things

61
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,950
What did you wanna tell me just now?

62
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,990
Nothing

63
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,830
Do you know

64
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,990
what this opportunity means for you?

65
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,390
It means that you've already

66
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,550
stepped into

67
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,510
the door of Hengyuan team

68
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,150
It's no longer a dream

69
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,470
to enter the national team in the future

70
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,830
It's no longer only a dream

71
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
entering the national team

72
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,550
Hey

73
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,670
Brother Hui

74
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,310
Why are you here?

75
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,030
Isn't it the basketball finals today?

76
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,310
I came here to warm up

77
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,470
You...

78
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,070
This is not right

79
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,910
Let's go

80
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,510
Hold my bag

81
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,230
Hurry up

82
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,910
An exception

83
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,310
Hey, you...

84
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,030
Here you are

85
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,070
Stop talking, just practice

86
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,990
You all came so early

87
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,710
I thought I was early enough

88
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,910
Yes

89
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,070
Let's practice

90
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,830
Class 8, amazing

91
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,270
Class 5, remarkable

92
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,790
Class 8, unstoppable

93
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,270
Score every time

94
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,670
Class 5, definitely win

95
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,270
Extraordinary

96
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,910
Come on, Class 8

97
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,470
Come on, Class 5

98
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,870
Come on, Class 5

99
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,150
-Come on, Class 8 -Come on, Class 5

100
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,710
-Come on, Class 8 -Come on, Class 5

101
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,350
Come on, Class 5

102
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,670
Come on, Lan Jinghui

103
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,910
Come on, Lan Jinghui

104
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,310
Come on, Lan Jinghui

105
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,670
Come on, Lan Jinghui

106
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,350
Lan...

107
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,630
What are you doing?

108
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,670
Where are you from?

109
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,830
What do you want?

110
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,590
I I'm here to cheer for my son

111
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,390
It's okay to cheer

112
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,150
Don't bring people

113
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:35,990
from society to the school

114
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,870
Let them leave immediately

115
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,740
No, I...

116
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,830
Just leave

117
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,190
Why are you in such a hurry?

118
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,750
Just go

119
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,510
Go

120
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,590
Why did you come back?

121
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,750
I can't leave

122
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,790
I have to cheer for my son

123
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,030
I beg you, please

124
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,270
Can you just let me go?

125
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,510
You standing here

126
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,710
already affects the order of the school

127
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,110
Okay

128
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,550
Go out

129
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,590
I promise

130
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,430
not to mess things up

131
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:02,870
Lan Shangjin

132
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,230
So annoying

133
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,190
Ms. Fang

134
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,150
I didn't expect us

135
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,390
to meet in the finals

136
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,670
I think in the game,

137
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,630
do not ruin the relationship between students

138
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,390
I'll tell our students

139
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,430
to take it easy

140
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,190
The score difference won't be too big

141
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,030
I don't care about winning or losing

142
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,510
I'm just worried that our students

143
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,470
won't enjoy playing

144
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,070
It's as easy as pie

145
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,030
to win the first place

146
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,910
Okay, I'll go

147
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,430
They don't seem that strong

148
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,950
Are you sure?

149
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,590
Yes

150
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,630
What do you think?

151
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,110
Bro, is that okay this time?

152
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,390
Come on

153
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,110
Come on

154
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,270
We are

155
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,230
the champion

156
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:18,350
-Come on, Class 5 -Come on, Class 8

157
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,470
Ready

158
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,430
You don't study properly

159
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,390
Just fool around

160
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,750
There's only one spot

161
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,470
I only need the strongest one

162
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,310
Violation

163
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,870
What's the rush?

164
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,430
Nervous, huh

165
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,870
Ready

166
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,270
What a joke

167
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,550
Can you even play basketball?

168
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,510
Brother Hui, how about I take over?

169
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,470
You do it, Qiangzi

170
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,790
What are you staring at?

171
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,150
Just play

172
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,710
You think you're so strong

173
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,110
Look at yourself now

174
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,030
Play if you can

175
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,950
If you can't, just go home

176
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,110
Who told you I can't play anymore?

177
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,030
Why are you yelling at me?

178
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,430
What's the matter?

179
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,990
Referee

180
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,070
Does this count as a technical foul?

181
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,390
Get this old man out of here

182
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,510
Who's the old man?

183
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,630
Save it for later

184
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,110
Just say it later

185
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,190
Let it go now

186
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,030
What are you doing?

187
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,590
Don't you think what you said earlier

188
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,310
was too much?

189
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,510
What are you laughing at?

190
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,350
You know nothing since you don't have kids

191
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,270
His grandpa taught me this way

192
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,630
Look at his state just now

193
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,470
Provocation, understand?

194
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,350
Brother Hui

195
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,870
I know, the finals are nerve-wracking

196
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,350
It's okay, you can do it

197
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,550
Come on, Brother Hui

198
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,470
These are just minor mistakes

199
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,190
Everyone makes mistakes

200
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,670
It's okay, stay strong

201
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,670
Keep trying

202
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,830
Got it

203
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,110
Come on, Brother Hui

204
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,430
No, no

205
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,470
Why are you comforting me?

206
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,630
Am I a loser?

207
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,070
I'm the pride of Chenjun

208
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,510
I don't need

209
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,910
the care of ordinary people

210
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,270
Come on

211
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,150
Enough

212
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,630
Focus on the game

213
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,590
Alright, keep going

214
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,870
Come on, Lan Jinghui

215
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,190
Come on, Lan Jinghui

216
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,070
Come on

217
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,350
Come on

218
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,590
Come on, let's get it

219
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,070
Nice shot. Well done

220
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,270
Nice

221
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,070
See that? He's better now

222
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,070
Bi Peng

223
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,590
likes attacking from the right

224
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,390
Defend him there

225
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,950
Chao, Qiangzi

226
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,990
Leave him to you guys

227
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,030
No problem

228
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,430
Keep it up, everyone

229
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,990
Class 8, let's go

230
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,510
Come on

231
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,790
Nice shot

232
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,750
And there's one more important thing

233
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,230
Anger him

234
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,350
Make him foul, force him off the court

235
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,310
Foul violation

236
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:33,670
Come on

237
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,390
Brother Hui

238
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,910
Referee, we request a substitution

239
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,590
Substitution

240
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,950
Foul violation, two free throws

241
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,070
Come on, Class 8

242
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,630
Come on, Class 8

243
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,670
Come on, Class 5

244
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,230
Come on, Class 8

245
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,710
Take a break, come on

246
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,270
Take a short break

247
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:37,830
Take a short break

248
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,670
Be careful

249
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,070
Thank you

250
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,670
Guys

251
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,630
The first quarter is almost over

252
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,470
Pretty good

253
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,190
Next, let's stick to our tactics

254
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,950
Chao, Qiangzi and Yiming

255
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,710
You did a very good job

256
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,430
Got it

257
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,550
You played well today, good job

258
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,670
Thank you

259
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,350
Looks like we can win

260
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,950
I can't stand anymore, Old Zhang

261
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,870
Go find me a chair

262
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,350
Or you can go out first

263
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,870
One, two, three

264
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,710
Let's get it

265
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,630
It's all up to you guys

266
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,870
Pass the ball to me when you have the chance

267
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,830
Whenever I have the chance,

268
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,670
I'll shoot

269
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,030
Got it

270
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,710
Come on, Class 8

271
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,630
Let's go!

272
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:40,790
Ball!

273
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,190
Why does Ling Dong always shoot as soon as he gets the ball?

274
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,310
Can he make it with so many defenders?

275
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,750
With the trust between teammates,

276
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,390
he can make

277
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,110
decisive shots at any time

278
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,910
Ma Yiming

279
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,470
You're in charge of the Key

280
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,470
No problem

281
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,430
I have plenty of tricks

282
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,310
Holding

283
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,390
Backcourt

284
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,470
As soon as I'm double-teamed,

285
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,710
there will definitely

286
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,990
be openings in the defense

287
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,710
Leave it to me

288
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,310
Nice shot

289
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,870
At this point, the opponents

290
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,590
must be in chaos

291
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,030
We need to seize this opportunity

292
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,430
to extend the lead

293
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,590
If we can be ahead

294
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,110
by 15 points

295
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,910
at the end of the first half,

296
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,270
we'll win this game for sure

297
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,300
Time's up for the second quarter

298
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,830
Good job

299
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,470
Well done

300
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,390
Have some water

301
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,790
Come on, Ling Dong

302
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,870
Thank you, teacher

303
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:20,510
Lan Jinghui

304
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,310
Okay

305
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,030
Thank you, teacher

306
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,710
Well done

307
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,630
Keep playing like this, we'll win

308
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,350
Good

309
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,830
I told Ms. Chai

310
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,710
that we'll just

311
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,750
take the first place today

312
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,310
We must take the first place

313
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,790
Do we?

314
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,390
Come on!

315
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,270
We will win

316
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:38,910
In .The first half

317
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,270
We've completely lost our rhythm

318
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,790
Don't let the other side control you

319
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,110
Stay calm, alright?

320
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,390
Do your best

321
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,870
Bi Peng, it's your turn in the second half

322
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,830
Lead them

323
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,990
Guys, it was my fault just now

324
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,870
I was too impulsive

325
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,110
I'll apologize to all of you here

326
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,030
After you go on in the second half,

327
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,670
just play like this

328
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,390
It's okay

329
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,830
If they keep playing like this,

330
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,790
just use our bodies to fight back, okay?

331
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,550
Alright

332
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,070
Believe it or not,

333
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,110
we'll definitely win this game

334
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,350
Well done

335
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:21,910
Defence

336
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,270
Be harder

337
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,630
Okay

338
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,030
Who is that doll?

339
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,190
I don't know

340
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:30,950
She's quite good at dancing

341
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,710
So cute

342
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,350
Good

343
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,870
Disciple

344
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,150
Xiao Xiaohua

345
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,150
Good

346
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,390
Xiao Xiaohua

347
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,110
It's your turn

348
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,790
Come on

349
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,470
Come on

350
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,030
Come on, let's get it

351
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,550
Come on

352
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,150
Hey, guys

353
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,550
Once we're done, we'll win

354
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,150
The final basketball game in high school

355
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,030
Let's get it

356
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,310
Let's get it

357
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,950
Class 5, we will win

358
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,630
Come on

359
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,630
Come on

360
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,590
Isn't that a foul?

361
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,150
Ms. Fang

362
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,230
Are you alright?

363
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,230
Hold on

364
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,030
Come on

365
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,670
Good

366
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,550
We're in danger

367
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,350
In the first half, they were good

368
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:04,950
at using tactics

369
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,310
to catch the other side off guard

370
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,990
But in the second half, they couldn't keep up physically

371
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,350
Their biggest enemy

372
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,070
is fatigue

373
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,630
Goal! Let's go!

374
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,590
Are you okay?

375
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,830
Ling Dong

376
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,190
What happened?

377
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,390
Are you okay?

378
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,910
Say something

379
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,110
Does it hurt?

380
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,470
Referee, we need a substitution

381
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,830
Jia Letian, you go in

382
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,190
Okay

383
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,270
He's too tired

384
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,310
Tired

385
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,310
Come on. Let's help him up first

386
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,630
Are you alright?

387
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,670
Let me help you up first

388
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,390
Nod

389
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:21,750
Come on

390
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,750
Three, two, one

391
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,670
Take your position

392
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,590
Come on, drink some water

393
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,790
Lan Jinghui, you guys go play

394
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,310
Jia Letian, you go in

395
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,150
Okay

396
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,350
Pass it to me

397
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,350
-Defense -Offense

398
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,190
They're already intimidated

399
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,590
If we keep losing points

400
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,470
it'll be in danger

401
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,030
The key to this game

402
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,790
lies with Lan Jinghui

403
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,310
What's going on?

404
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,150
Xiaohui

405
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,830
Class 5

406
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,910
We must win

407
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,150
We must win

408
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,550
We must win

409
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,470
Come on

410
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,310
We must win

411
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,670
Offense

412
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,310
Defense

413
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,190
Come on

414
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,590
Nice

415
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,110
Fantastic

416
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:42,870
Nice shot

417
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,750
Come on

418
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,750
Come on

419
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:07,030
Offense

420
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,350
Penetrate from one side

421
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,750
Start with three steps and score

422
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,550
Pay attention to your three-step layup

423
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,830
And the distance to the basket

424
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,790
Five, six, seven, eight

425
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,830
One, two, three, four

426
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,310
Five, six, seven, eight

427
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:47,430
Two, two, three, four

428
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:53,230
Five, six, seven, eight

429
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,910
The movements are clearly correct

430
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,710
But it feels strange

431
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:01,950
Right?

432
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,750
I also feel that something

433
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,550
is off

434
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,230
I have a way

435
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,150
What is it?

436
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,950
Will this work?

437
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:22,790
Of course

438
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,390
It'll definitely be a killer move
