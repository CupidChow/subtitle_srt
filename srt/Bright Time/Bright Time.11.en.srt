[Episode 11]

3
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,950
Xiaohua, I'm so hungry

4
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,870
Why are you hungry?

5
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,550
Didn't you just eat breakfast?

6
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,550
But I'm still so hungry

7
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,470
What do you wanna eat then?

8
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,230
Barbecue

9
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,390
I wanna eat grilled pork belly

10
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,470
Spicy grilled beef

11
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,310
Grilled fatty beef, grilled enoki mushrooms

12
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,110
And grilled potato slices

13
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,150
And stone pot...

14
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,590
Alright, enough

15
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,430
Then let's go eat together

16
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,990
I'll accompany you

17
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,070
No, I can't

18
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,630
Or I'll get fat

19
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,430
Then...

20
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,670
Don't eat it

21
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,430
Ma Yiming

22
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,590
What are you doing?

23
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,350
Why did you put my tangerine down?

24
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,950
Your poor orange will die if you keep exposing

25
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,230
Look at sister Meng's flowers

26
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,230
I've taken such good care of them

27
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,630
It should absorb some sunlight

28
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,030
Aren't you afraid it'll get sunburned?

29
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:51,950
I won't allow you to curse

30
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,270
sister Meng's hydrangea

31
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,990
I can't stand it anymore

32
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,110
What are you gonna do?

33
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,390
Well...

34
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,590
Where is Xu Mengyu?

35
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,640
She hasn't been to class these days

36
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,280
Her mom is preparing for a book signing event

37
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,440
She took leave to accompany her mom

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,840
I didn't even know

39
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,480
about this

40
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,320
How did you know?

41
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,600
I just know

42
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,720
I just know it

43
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,040
What's wrong? Are you mad?

44
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,960
Fine, put my tangerine back

45
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,560
I won't

46
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,640
Hmm

47
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,080
Hello

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,840
Ms Xiao Yinqian

49
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,680
I heard that this time

50
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,440
your published novel

51
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,880
is set in a school setting

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,440
Yes

53
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,560
I got inspired by my daughter

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,320
She is currently in high school

55
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,000
We often discuss

56
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,400
And what about your daughter Mengyu's

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,120
writing talent?

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,160
Is it inherited or cultivated?

59
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,520
I didn't deliberately cultivate her

60
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,000
I think her talent in this area

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,360
is even better than mine

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,480
This is not only my book signing

63
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Today, I'll have an announcement

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,920
to tell you all

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,680
Mengyu's first collection

66
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,680
will be published soon

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,080
Liu Wen

68
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,240
Xu Chao

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,480
Jia Letian

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,760
That's amazing, Mengyu

71
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,120
It hasn't been published yet

72
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,160
This is my first book

73
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm not that experienced

74
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,480
So I brought some stylebooks

75
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,040
for you to refer to

76
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,600
You're really something

77
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,480
Wow, I mean...

78
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,240
I'm really becoming

79
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,040
your fan

80
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,640
No, no, no...

81
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,040
That's so great

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,320
Oh my god!

83
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,960
Xiaohua, this is for you

84
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,040
I have one too

85
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,160
Of course

86
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,680
Different types of readers

87
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,880
are important to me

88
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,760
These days,

89
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,400
anyone can publish a book

90
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,600
Of course, no

91
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,960
You can't do it

92
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,680
Who cares?

93
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,280
Ling Dong

94
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,840
I hope you can give me some advice

95
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,240
What is this? Let me see

96
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,080
Lan Jinghui

97
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,160
If you want,

98
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,200
I can give you another one

99
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
But this one is for Ling Dong

100
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,160
No thanks

101
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,120
I wouldn't understand it

102
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,960
It's okay, Sister Meng

103
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,080
I want it too

104
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,800
Ma Yiming

105
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,280
This is for Ling Dong

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Ma Yiming, take it

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,480
Mengyu

108
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,080
Can you give me one more?

109
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,680
Xiaohua, what are you looking at?

110
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,520
Just studying

111
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,440
I don't have so many

112
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,960
I didn't expect it to be so popular

113
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,640
If you really want it,

114
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,360
I'll give you my own copy

115
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,520
Thank you, I'll read it carefully

116
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,360
How is it?

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,320
It's really great

118
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,800
It's really great

119
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,760
So touching

120
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,120
Class

121
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,920
I have some good news

122
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,800
to announce

123
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,520
This week,

124
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,000
we'll have the activity week

125
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,840
So, the media

126
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,000
will come for filming

127
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,200
I hope

128
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,280
that after school,

129
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,080
don't rush home

130
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,360
Stay and contribute

131
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,560
with your talents

132
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,360
I can

133
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,560
What can you do?

134
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,800
Anything

135
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,600
Alright, then help us

136
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,880
carry the equipments

137
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,400
Okay

138
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,320
Xiaohua

139
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,920
You'll be in charge of

140
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,800
the notice board

141
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,440
Okay

142
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,560
Liu Shu, Lu Yao and Lin Keke

143
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,880
help Xiaohua with it

144
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:34,920
Alright

145
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,640
Thank you all for your hard work

146
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,280
Class dismissed

147
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,400
Stand up

148
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,360
Goodbye, teacher

149
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,240
Goodbye, class

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,480
I've already printed them

151
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,840
We can start now

152
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,000
Why did you come so late?

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,880
We have so many things

154
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,720
to paste

155
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,400
Yes, it's so tiring

156
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,760
Mengyu

157
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,480
Let's go take some pictures with Mengyu

158
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,080
Okay

159
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,960
Then these things...

160
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,120
Xiaohua, paste them first

161
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,200
We'll go find Mengyu for photos

162
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
We'll be back soon

163
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,680
Thank you

164
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,080
Okay

165
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,960
Thank you

166
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,440
Thank you, Xiaohua

167
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,280
You're the best

168
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:15,960
Let's go

169
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,520
Bye

170
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,280
Mengyu

171
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,160
Come on, let's take photos together

172
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,880
Okay

173
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,680
Okay

174
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,080
Let's all come together, okay?

175
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,080
Which ones need to be posted?

176
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,360
These ones

177
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,800
Let's start working

178
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,560
Okay

179
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,320
Four beautiful girls huh

180
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Fine

181
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay, together

182
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,320
That male classmate

183
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,640
Sorry

184
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,680
Come on, let's continue

185
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,520
Let's continue

186
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,800
Okay

187
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,960
Ma Yiming, let's go play basketball

188
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,520
I'm not going, Brother Hui

189
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,640
I'm taking photos with them

190
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,240
What's it to you?

191
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,920
The task assigned by Ms. Fang

192
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,680
I haven't finished it yet

193
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,640
You go first

194
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,800
Can you handle it?

195
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,760
A full-body shot, okay?

196
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:23,880
I suggest you to hide

197
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,040
30 degrees to your left

198
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,480
Okay, too late

199
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,000
Xiao Xiaohua

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,760
Are you stupid?

201
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,640
They're taking photos over there

202
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,400
And you're working alone here

203
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,760
Is that so?

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,440
Stop talking nonsense. Let's just work

205
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,520
You tear the tape

206
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,440
Very lucky for you

207
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,880
to meet the two of us

208
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,160
What if you hadn't met us?

209
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,600
Did you just know

210
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,360
that she'd never say no?

211
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,360
I have to make her

212
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,920
learn to say no

213
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,280
I got it

214
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,600
Is someone talking?

215
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,600
Is someone talking?

216
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,320
I didn't hear anything

217
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,560
I got it

218
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,160
What's that sound?

219
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,720
Okay, I got it

220
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,240
I'll try to say no in the future

221
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,200
No, not allowed, cannot

222
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,760
Is that enough?

223
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,080
Okay, that's the way

224
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,040
Disciple

225
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,840
Remember my teachings

226
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,920
I'm not your disciple

227
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,200
You learn quickly

228
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,240
Tear the tape

229
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,520
Let's work

230
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,120
Great job, everyone

231
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,320
Individual contribution

232
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,440
I bought you drinks

233
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,200
Just distribute them

234
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,480
Vice President is really considerate

235
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
We're so thirsty

236
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,480
Come on

237
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,040
I want one

238
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,040
Qingtian

239
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,080
Come over here

240
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,320
What's wrong?

241
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,400
I bought you

242
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,920
the milk tea you like

243
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,600
It's really my favorite milk tea

244
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,720
Thank you

245
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,280
Drink it while it's hot

246
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,840
Thank you, you're so kind

247
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,880
Hey, let's take a photo

248
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,560
Take a picture of us

249
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,560
Okay, come on

250
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,640
Good

251
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,840
Okay. One

252
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,200
Three

253
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,760
And me

254
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,160
And me

255
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,760
Come on

256
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,440
Let's take one together

257
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,400
Let's take a group photo

258
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:33,840
Come on

259
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,840
One, two, three

260
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,800
Cheese

261
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,400
The sand of the hourglass

262
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,440
is pouring onto this beach

263
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,240
I'm stepping on countless fragments of time

264
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,600
trying to cross everything

265
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,520
and enter this sea

266
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,240
If life is compared to an hourglass

267
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,040
the sand in the hourglass

268
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,280
disappears bit by bit

269
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,000
We'll sigh at the fleeting time

270
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,960
The sand of the hourglass

271
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,800
is pouring onto this beach

272
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,280
The sand in the hourglass

273
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,440
disappears bit by bit

274
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,880
We feel the passing of time

275
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,240
is exactly the same

276
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,320
Xu Mengyu actually plagiarized

277
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,960
Today's topic is worldview

278
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,160
and life value and outlook

279
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,480
which were previously tested in exams

280
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,080
But I'm not sure

281
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,760
if they will be tested this year

282
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,760
But if they are tested

283
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,520
it should be a five-point short answer question

284
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,320
I hope you all review

285
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
about the worldview, life value

286
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,640
and outlook

287
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,480
It's core and symbol of cultural literacy

288
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,920
in people's mind

289
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,760
Okay, class

290
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,200
That's it all for today's lesson

291
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,000
Class dismissed

292
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,600
Stand up

293
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Goodbye, teacher

294
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,400
Goodbye, class. Sit down please

295
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,840
I wanna eat hot pot

296
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,200
I wanna eat something delicious

297
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,680
Hot pot, stir-fried meat, stir-fried vegetables, choose one

298
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,920
Hot pot, stir-fried meat

299
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,560
Hot pot

300
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,840
Hot pot

301
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,680
Xiaohua

302
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,320
What's wrong?

303
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,440
It's okay

304
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,040
Let's go to school

305
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,240
Don't water the starry sky too much

306
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,160
Thank you

307
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,280
When you have something on your mind

308
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,800
it's best not to be distracted

309
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,440
Ling Dong

310
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,960
Well...

311
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,680
Do you have

312
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,400
a secret that you don't want others to know?

313
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,320
I mean...

314
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,920
I found out about someone's

315
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,440
very private secret

316
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,560
I'm thinking whether I should keep it hidden for her

317
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,200
But even if I keep it secret,

318
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,560
it will soon be known by others

319
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,160
What do you wanna do then?

320
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,680
I'm thinking whether I should tell her or not

321
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,160
I already know this secret

322
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,960
But I don't wanna hurt

323
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,040
her self-esteem

324
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,760
Self-esteem can be rebuilt

325
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,000
But losing dignity is hard to regain

326
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,400
Do you wanna

327
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,880
preserve her self-esteem

328
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,160
but let her

329
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,840
be embarrassed in front of more people?

330
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,320
Of course, I don't want her

331
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,240
to be embarrassed

332
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,880
Go and talk to her

333
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,440
Maybe it will be better

334
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,120
Mengyu

335
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,760
Come with me

336
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Are you gonna tell everyone?

337
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,400
I don't intend to do this

338
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,360
Then what do you mean?

339
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,360
You're obviously talented

340
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,920
You don't need to do this

341
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,080
Is that all you wanna tell me?

342
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,040
I hope you can

343
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
withdraw your articles

344
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,680
before the book is published

345
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,720
Let the mistakes

346
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,880
not continue

347
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,600
Xiaohua

348
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,120
Can you not tell others?

349
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,820
This collection is important to me

350
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,480
But what you got this way

351
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,040
is not your own

352
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,000
I can't let others know

353
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,140
especially my mom

354
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,720
Do you understand what I mean?

355
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,200
Even if you don't do this

356
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,000
you can still publish your own book

357
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,720
And...

358
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,520
Your mom is so famous

359
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,920
She's such an excellent writer

360
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,560
Just because

361
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,920
she is such a famous writer

362
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,320
I have to be better than others

363
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,280
since I was young

364
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,240
The better I am, the more they expect

365
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,400
So I can't let them know

366
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,280
that I am so ordinary

367
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,720
And I can't write good articles at all

368
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,960
I don't wanna let her down

369
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,160
These words

370
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,320
Have you said them to your mom?

371
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,880
It's meaningless to say them

372
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,240
She won't even listen

373
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,560
She believes her daughter

374
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,960
is always the most talented one

375
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,120
It's just that I lack confidence

376
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,240
So she tells me every day

377
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,880
to be confident

378
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,400
I'm really afraid

379
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,640
that one day she'll find out

380
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,400
that I'm nothing at all

381
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,120
My grades are average

382
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,520
Every time I don't do well on a test

383
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,880
my mom gets really angry

384
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,680
She often scolds me

385
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,640
But after she scolds me

386
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,560
she always makes me

387
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,680
a delicious meal

388
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,360
Because she loves me

389
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,720
Because she knows

390
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,800
that I really tried my best

391
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,880
So I feel

392
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,720
you can talk to your mom

393
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,760
again

394
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,640
I believe she'll understand you

395
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,600
And...

396
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,080
I won't tell anyone

397
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,960
about this

398
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,320
You really won't tell anyone?

399
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,400
This is our secret between us

400
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,600
Mengyu

401
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,280
The physics problem before

402
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,280
I still don't understand it

403
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,960
Did you understand it?

404
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,920
I understood it

405
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,920
I'll teach you after we finish eating

406
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:03,720
Okay

407
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,920
Mengyu, what are you looking at?

408
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,320
Nothing

409
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,680
You go and save me a seat first

410
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,320
Keke

411
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,400
I don't have this dish

412
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,440
I just wanted to taste it

413
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,400
Lan Jinghui, you can have mine

414
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,800
Good disciple

415
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,040
But I wanna eat that meat

416
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,800
Now you know

417
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,240
Brother Hui, you can have mine

418
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,200
Too late

419
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:01,840
Xiaohua

420
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,360
This is today's special dish

421
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,880
I got it especially for you

422
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,280
Mengyu

423
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,080
Thank you

424
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,840
Xiaohua

425
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,280
When did you be so close

426
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,280
with her?

427
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,160
Are you betraying us

428
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,360
and being friends with her now?

429
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,400
Qingtian, no way

430
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,360
Xiaohua

431
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,000
You're the first person

432
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
that sister Meng treats so gently

433
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,560
Tell me, what trick did you use?

434
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,920
And why haven't I seen this dish

435
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,360
when I come to school?

436
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,120
Did Aunt specially cook it for her?

437
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,180
Don't tell me it's poisoned

438
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,500
Go away

439
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,160
Sister Meng won't even do this

440
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,720
Maybe it's because

441
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,800
I helped her promote her essay

442
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,280
Just eat

443
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,880
Or it'll get cold

444
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,520
Something's wrong with you

445
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,360
Oh, just eat

446
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,640
Xiaoyu

447
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,160
Mom

448
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,520
Look at this

449
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,280
Mom

450
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,120
Actually, there's something I wanna tell you

451
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,080
Talk about it later

452
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,800
Look at this

453
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,960
I've chosen a few outfits

454
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
for your book launch

455
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,600
See if you like them?

456
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,280
How about this one?

457
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,200
It's okay

458
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,880
But it's a bit plain

459
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,880
And what about this?

460
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,200
This one is also good

461
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,840
Yes, the details are great on this one

462
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,880
You should wear this one for the event

463
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,640
It'll be perfect and beautiful

464
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
My daughter is the best

465
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,240
Xiaoyu

466
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,120
What did you wanna tell me just now?

467
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,400
It's nothing, Mom

468
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,920
Okay, then I'll go and order the outfits

469
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Never thought

470
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,280
that she'd do something like this

471
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:36,840
Yes

472
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,560
This is a plagiarism

473
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,600
It's an exact copy

474
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,880
How is this possible?

475
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,640
Yeah, I also find it impossible

476
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
Is it real?

477
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,640
Just make some copies

478
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,760
It became her book

479
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,880
Xu Mengyu

480
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,520
Mengyu

481
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,840
Xiao Xiaohua

482
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,560
I didn't expect you to be this kind of person

483
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,680
I trusted you

484
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,760
that you're not gonna tell anyone

485
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,320
Since you're doing this,

486
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,360
why pretend to be

487
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,760
a good person in front of me?

488
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,400
Hypocrite

489
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,240
What's going on?

490
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,720
Xiaohua

491
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,360
What's going on?

492
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,760
Xiao Xiaohua

493
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,680
How did you know

494
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,640
that Xu Mengyu plagiarized?

495
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,320
Yeah, you've hidden it well

496
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,960
Any other gossip

497
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,320
to share with us?

498
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,960
Xiao Xiaohua, you're so amazing

499
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,800
We've misunderstood you

500
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,400
We didn't expect you to be so scheming

501
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,600
Mengyu now didn't even come to school

502
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,520
because of you

503
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,160
Are you happy now?

504
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,800
Exactly, Xiao Xiaohua

505
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,280
You've gone too far with this

506
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,560
You want everyone to know

507
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:20,840
about it, right?

508
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,400
How can you say like that?

509
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,400
That's right

510
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,120
It's not all Xiao Xiaohua's fault

511
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,560
Right?

512
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,280
If Xu Mengyu didn't plagiarize

513
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,560
would this have happened?

514
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,080
That's just to uphold justice

515
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,640
Such despicable actions

516
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,040
Isn't it just personal vengeance?

517
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,360
We'd better

518
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,080
be a decent person

519
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,200
I believe in Xiaohua

520
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,280
She definitely didn't do this

521
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,400
If it wasn't her

522
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,960
Mengyu said it was her

523
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Or who else could it be?

524
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,320
Patriotism

525
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,520
is the spiritual core of the China

526
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,120
It runs through all aspects

527
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,880
of the national spirit

528
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,480
Unity, love for peace,

529
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,480
diligence, bravery,

530
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,920
and the spirit of perseverance

531
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,680
are interrelated

532
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,040
They all show

533
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,240
the theme of patriotism

534
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,680
Whenever it is,

535
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,200
patriotism serves as a mobilization

536
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,560
and encouragement for the Chinese people

537
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,920
to unite and strive

538
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,960
It is the spiritual pillar

539
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,880
of indomitable spirit

540
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,120
Patriotism is not abstract,

541
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,280
but concrete

542
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,200
As a part of Chinese people...

543
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,480
Mengyu's mom

544
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,440
Are you really

545
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,320
not considering it anymore?

546
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,160
Thank you, Ms. Fang

547
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,640
I won't consider anymore

548
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,360
I will come to handle

549
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,840
Mengyu's transfer procedures in a few days

550
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,320
Okay

551
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,520
Good luck with everything

552
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,440
Thank you

553
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,160
Goodbye

554
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,760
Transfer procedures?

555
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,240
I only heard about it

556
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,400
I don't know

557
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,120
Now it's better

558
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,320
You've forced her to transfer

559
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,160
Are you satisfied now?

560
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,240
Transfer?

561
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,160
Who is it? Who is transferring?

562
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,040
Xu Mengyu

563
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,080
Mengyu's mother came to the school

564
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,920
because of her transfer

565
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,880
I saw it with my own eyes

566
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,160
How could this happen?

567
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,960
Is everything okay?

568
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,400
Why did you do this?

569
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,720
I didn't do this

570
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,680
Ma Yiming

571
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,920
Do you know what you're doing?

572
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,600
This thing itself is

573
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,520
Xu Mengyu plagiarizing

574
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,280
You know what?

575
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,120
Brother Hui

576
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,120
I know what I'm doing

577
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,720
Do you know what she's doing?

578
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,520
Does she know herself

579
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,360
what she's doing?

580
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,400
This plagiarism thing

581
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,520
hasn't even been confirmed yet

582
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,640
No

583
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,480
She said it wasn't her

584
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,080
Do you believe it?

585
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,040
Yes, I do

586
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,840
Sister Meng said it herself

587
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,320
Only Xiao Xiaohua

588
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,360
knows about this

589
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,160
It really wasn't me

590
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,080
Ma Yiming

591
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,440
There's no evidence

592
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,440
that proves

593
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,800
it was Xiao Xiaohua who did it

594
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,280
So I think since there's a disagreement,

595
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,960
we should present evidence

596
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
I think Ling Dong is right

597
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,320
If we have the time

598
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
why don't we look for evidence?

599
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,960
Sister Meng said it herself

600
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,400
Brother Hui, don't you know that?

601
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,320
Xiao Xiaohua said it too

602
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,520
You heard it too

603
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,400
Listen

604
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,720
I think what he said is right

605
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,480
But you don't understand Sister Meng

606
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,640
Then why do you think...

607
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,840
Did I allow you to speak?

608
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,360
Can you just shut up?

609
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,320
I'm telling you, Ma Yiming

610
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,640
What you're doing now

611
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,920
is completely favoring Xu Mengyu

612
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,640
You know that?

613
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,400
I didn't

614
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,080
Right now, you're favoring him

615
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,880
You're favoring Ling Dong

616
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,800
What does this have to do with Ling Dong?

617
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,600
Anyway, now everything Ling Dong says

618
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,160
is right

619
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,400
Whatever I say is wrong

620
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,400
Since now

621
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,520
there's no evidence

622
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,520
Why do you believe Ling Dong

623
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,320
but not me?

624
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,960
I believe who has reason

625
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,240
Are you gonna reason with me?

626
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,280
Let me tell you

627
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,440
Since you started

628
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,480
tutoring with him,

629
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,160
you two have been together all the time

630
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,080
You didn't play basketball with me

631
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,080
You didn't go out with me

632
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
How many times have I asked you?

633
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,840
Every day, you'd tell me

634
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,880
"I have something else"

635
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,080
What's the matter?

636
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,720
Is this your reasoning?

637
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,600
So you mean...

638
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,240
It's all wrong

639
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,120
since I'm studying with him now

640
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,720
Yes, it's wrong

641
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,280
From now on, just go study with him

642
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,840
Don't come to me

643
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,480
Ma Yiming

644
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,160
Stop bothering me

645
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,600
What are you drawing?

646
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,400
It's so ugly

647
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,520
The king of beasts

648
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,000
The king of the dining table

649
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,120
Look at this

650
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,600
Look

651
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,080
Why did you roll at me?

652
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,360
Is my drawing not good?

653
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:24,960
Lan Jinghui

654
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,520
Or is it because...

655
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,560
Do you recognize it?

656
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,120
Can you reach it?

657
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,760
Give it to me

658
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,120
Just a little more

659
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,560
Lan Jinghui

660
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,640
What's wrong with me?

661
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,080
Does it look like him?

662
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,640
Yes

663
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,360
Yes, it does

664
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,720
Does it look like me?

665
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,760
What are you doing?

666
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,560
Finally, I took a photo with Ling Dong

667
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,080
But it's such a pity

668
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,560
I can't even see his face

669
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,120
Next time

670
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,640
Next time, I must take a photo

671
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,960
with his face visible
