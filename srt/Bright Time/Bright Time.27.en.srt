3
00:01:59,470 --> 00:01:59,870
Baby, come on

4
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,710
Let me help you

5
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,670
I don't know where you are training

6
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,630
How's the food? Is it cold?

7
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,470
Or should I bring these sweaters

8
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,430
and jackets with you?

9
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,550
Mom, it's not necessary

10
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,110
It's not cold now

11
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:11,910
It gets cold at night

12
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:13,950
There's a kind of cold

13
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,590
that your mom feels

14
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,190
Can't I stop worrying?

15
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,910
It's your first time going far away

16
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,110
How about this?

17
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,430
Let your dad

18
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,270
send you there tomorrow

19
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,550
Mom, it's not necessary

20
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,430
I'll be training for only a month

21
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,230
And I'm grown up now

22
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,470
There's no need to worry about

23
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,470
No, that's not right

24
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,270
Long johns

25
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,830
Mom

26
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,630
You...

27
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,710
What are you doing?

28
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,630
Oops, I've been caught

29
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,630
Sleepwalking?

30
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,590
Will you suspect me?

31
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,230
Indeed scard in the middle of the night

32
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,150
If you suspect me, go ahead

33
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,830
I'll find out sooner or later

34
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,230
You don't seem like you're here to accompany me

35
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,630
You seem like you're playing with me

36
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,310
Since I can't find in the study,

37
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,230
the next target is...

38
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,830
To sleep first

39
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,150
What?

40
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,390
I sleepwalked again last night

41
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,510
Are you sure it was sleepwalking?

42
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,030
Or were you pranking me?

43
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,390
Grandma

44
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,710
Every time I sleep in a room

45
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,710
that no one has slept

46
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,830
in for a long time,

47
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,470
I'll sleepwalk

48
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,550
Oh, that guest room

49
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,750
hasn't been occupied for a long time

50
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,230
Oh my goodness

51
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,790
You scared me

52
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,430
Xiaomei

53
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,870
You're lucky you sleepwalk at home

54
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,230
It would be dangerous

55
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:23,910
if you sleepwalked outside

56
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,630
What should we do?

57
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,470
I won't sleepwalk outside, will I?

58
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,710
That would be just perfect

59
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,510
Don't be afraid

60
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,230
Xiaomei

61
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,350
Don't sleep in the guest room

62
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,070
Sleep with me instead

63
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,430
Yes

64
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,870
Sleep with Grandma

65
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,470
Let her take good care of you at night

66
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,350
But...

67
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,190
But what?

68
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,470
I've had sleep monitoring done abroad

69
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,110
The doctor said I have severe

70
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,870
sleeping disorder

71
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,430
Sleeping disorder?

72
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,750
Which means when I'm asleep,

73
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,750
my hands and feet are not under

74
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,430
my control

75
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,390
And I might hit someone

76
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,950
So I have to sleep alone

77
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,150
Is it still that severe?

78
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:04,790
What now?

79
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,830
The other guest rooms

80
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,430
haven't been used for a long time either

81
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,790
I can't let you sleep in the living room

82
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,950
I have a proposal

83
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,750
I wonder if brother will agree

84
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,550
Disagree

85
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,830
It's just...

86
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,790
Can you let me sleep in your room?

87
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,870
No way

88
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,750
I'm a teenage boy

89
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,670
I have many secrets

90
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,350
And I can't

91
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,990
give my room to you

92
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,070
And didn't I just say

93
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,550
I disagree?

94
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,110
-Uncle -Okay

95
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:25,750
Then it seems tonight

96
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,070
I can only sleep in the living room

97
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,270
We can't let you sleep in the living room

98
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,550
Xiaohui

99
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,710
She's a girl

100
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,910
And she's our guest

101
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,270
Can she sleep in the living room?

102
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,030
Make your room available

103
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,070
You two switch rooms

104
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,550
Dad, you...

105
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,070
Grandma, can you help me?

106
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,750
Xiaohui

107
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,710
She rarely comes to our home

108
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,070
Just let her have it

109
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,230
Grandma

110
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,230
Why aren't you helping me either?

111
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,310
I'm helping you

112
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,350
I'll tidy up

113
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,070
the guest room for you later

114
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,630
No, Grandma

115
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,870
What kind of help is this?

116
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,150
Thank you, Grandma

117
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,110
Brother

118
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,030
I knew you were the best

119
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,230
I'm not good

120
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,710
I'm not good at all

121
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,230
Eat more

122
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,750
Just eat

123
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,150
Move aside

124
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,270
Don't touch my things randomly

125
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,590
Got it

126
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,030
First

127
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,110
Don't touch my Lego

128
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,870
I'm not interested

129
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,310
Second

130
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,390
Don't touch my bed

131
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,590
Are you crazy?

132
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,430
How can I sleep without touching the bed?

133
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:32,710
I...

134
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,950
Okay, you can touch the bed

135
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,710
But this one

136
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,990
You can't touch it at all

137
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,350
Remember, no touching

138
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,430
Got it

139
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,310
Leave my room

140
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,750
Just go

141
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,790
Remember my instructions

142
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,590
Got it

143
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,190
Just go

144
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,470
Bro

145
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,430
I missed you so much

146
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,990
You came just in time

147
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,790
What's wrong with you?

148
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,230
Grandma

149
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,790
Oh, you're here

150
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,350
You haven't eaten yet, right?

151
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:10,670
No, not yet

152
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,150
I'll go cook for you

153
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,190
Is it too much trouble for you?

154
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:14,990
It's no trouble at all

155
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,470
No problem

156
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,270
Come on, don't be so polite

157
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,950
Come on

158
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,870
Change your shoes

159
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,790
Come on

160
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,590
Come on

161
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,070
Hurry

162
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,230
Have a seat

163
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:23,910
Why are you here?

164
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,710
To borrow a telescope from you

165
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,390
Don't you have one at home?

166
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,630
No, why you need a telescope?

167
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,190
To chase the stars

168
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:30,870
Chasing the stars?

169
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,230
According to the astronomical forecast

170
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,670
Tonight until the 22nd

171
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:34,990
This one

172
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,950
There will be a very rare

173
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,150
conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn

174
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,350
appearing in the sky

175
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,590
From the perspective of Earth

176
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,990
I can lend you the telescope

177
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,430
But I have one condition

178
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,430
Take me along

179
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,350
Really?

180
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,470
You're interested in this, huh?

181
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,990
Times have changed

182
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,710
I must break free

183
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,630
from a troublesome relationship

184
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,790
Who do you consider troublesome?

185
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,750
Hey, brother

186
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,950
I feel like I've seen you somewhere

187
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,430
No physical contact allowed

188
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,990
Go away

189
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:08,990
This is...

190
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,070
This is

191
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,190
-The troublesome... -I'm Su Xi

192
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,910
Lan Jinghui is my cousin

193
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,750
Cool brother, what's your name?

194
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,390
I...

195
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,550
I'm Ling Dong

196
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,070
Ling Dong

197
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,830
Brother

198
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,070
Nice to meet you in person

199
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,150
Let me tell you responsibly

200
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,390
He's more handsome than you

201
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,510
Be careful with your words

202
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,870
Okay

203
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,990
Where is your telescope?

204
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,230
Let me get it

205
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,950
I'll take you there

206
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,790
I know

207
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,350
where the telescope is

208
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,190
She knows something

209
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:40,870
How about this?

210
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,030
Since you're going with me

211
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,790
You can hold it then

212
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,430
I'll leave first

213
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,990
Let me see you off

214
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,070
Where are you guys going?

215
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,230
I'm going too

216
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,870
Why do you care so much?

217
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,510
Just stay at home

218
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,670
Really?

219
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,390
You'll really go for the PKU?

220
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,630
But not the Rong University?

221
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,390
Yes, I've thought it through

222
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,710
You finally figured it out

223
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,390
Let me tell you

224
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,190
The answer lies within yourself

225
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,630
Auntie is amazing

226
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,510
But actually

227
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,630
there are still many questions

228
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,270
No...

229
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,150
Since Auntie has agreed

230
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,070
to go with you

231
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,590
What else do you

232
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,350
have to worry about?

233
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,470
Let me tell you

234
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,470
You're overthinking it

235
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,870
Just have a goal and go for it

236
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,190
Isn't that right?

237
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,190
But what if...

238
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,070
What if...

239
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,390
What if

240
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,430
I really get into the PKU

241
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:44,830
You didn't apply

242
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,070
Would that mean

243
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,790
I didn't even follow the rules

244
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,190
No

245
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,350
Do you have so much confidence in yourself

246
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,070
Of course

247
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,110
What I'm determined

248
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,670
I will definitely achieve it

249
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,710
Okay

250
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,830
But I advise you

251
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,310
to think carefully now

252
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,190
How to deal with

253
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,030
your troublesome cousin

254
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:09,910
Come here, let me tell you

255
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,030
I've noticed

256
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,110
that Su Xiaomei

257
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,710
is always

258
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,710
searching things in my room

259
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,390
What's going on between you and that girl?

260
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,750
Well

261
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,710
She comes to watch me play basketball every day

262
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,030
Haven't you noticed?

263
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,430
I'm getting tired of it

264
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,590
Isn't her mother

265
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,630
a famous writer?

266
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,590
Yes, she's my teacher

267
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,190
You know, this girl

268
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,910
Will she come

269
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,950
to watch brother Mao play today?

270
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,750
I bet she won't

271
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,830
I bet she will

272
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,150
Of course she will

273
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:52,870
As long as I tell her

274
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,550
she'll definitely come

275
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,670
Stop bragging

276
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,030
I'm not bragging

277
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:56,510
If she doesn't come

278
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,510
you'll definitely be embarrassed

279
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,590
Alright

280
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,230
Let's not talk about it

281
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,350
We agreed today, didn't we?

282
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,430
Whoever loses treats the other

283
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,990
It's always me losing to you

284
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,870
Teacher, I'm done with the painting

285
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,270
Teacher

286
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,270
Goodbye

287
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,070
Teacher, I'm also fine now

288
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,910
I'm done with the painting

289
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,870
Goodbye, teacher

290
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,470
Goodbye

291
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:19,910
Mengyu

292
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,830
I thought you won't come

293
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,350
since you're studying

294
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:22,990
No

295
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,430
I came to relax

296
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,390
I'll take you to eat something delicious

297
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,510
when I finish the game

298
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,110
Okay

299
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:27,750
Okay, wait for me

300
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,110
Let's go

301
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,430
Ma Yiming, what are you doing?

302
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,590
Can you stay away from that person?

303
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,940
What?

304
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,030
Ma Mao

305
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,550
Do you know

306
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,670
that he's not a good person

307
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,190
Ma Yiming, are you close to him?

308
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,230
He's my senior brother

309
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,590
We've known each other for years

310
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,670
Is he good or not

311
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,870
I know better than you

312
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,150
I'm telling you the truth

313
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,510
I don't want you to get hurt

314
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,390
Whoever I get close to

315
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,790
has nothing to do with you

316
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,350
Who are you?

317
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,230
What right do you have to control me?

318
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,710
Hello, everyone

319
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,430
According to the astronomical forecast,

320
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,750
there will be a very rare

321
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,630
alignment of Jupiter and Saturn

322
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,150
on the 22nd

323
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:20,750
At that time,

324
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,190
the angular distance between Jupiter and Saturn

325
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,830
will reach six point one nine

326
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,390
From the perspective of the Earth,

327
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,590
the distance between Jupiter and Saturn

328
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,710
will be very close

329
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,470
It's said that the best time

330
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,790
to observe this in our country

331
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,590
is the evening of the 21st,

332
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,870
an hour after it gets dark

333
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,190
Why are you dressed up

334
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,230
like a star?

335
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,430
Not a star

336
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,270
Just the former light of Chenjun

337
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,870
Why did you call me here?

338
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,950
I finally found an excuse

339
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,270
to come out to buy books

340
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,230
You don't even know

341
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,990
Su Xiaomei

342
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,790
is just like having a locator

343
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,350
She never lets her guard down

344
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,870
Do you think it's possible

345
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,430
that you misunderstood her?

346
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,790
Impossible

347
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,150
Then what evidence do you have

348
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:12,950
to prove that she's up to something?

349
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,030
This is the evidence

350
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:19,790
It's...

351
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,470
It's a pencil lead

352
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,230
Of course

353
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,310
Are you stupid?

354
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,350
Sorry for breaking it

355
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,230
But it's foolish

356
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,510
to bring a pencil lead to a bookstore

357
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,470
But this one

358
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,590
No touching is allowed

359
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,190
Remember, no touching

360
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,350
Got it

361
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,390
You'd better leave my room

362
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,030
Just go

363
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,990
Where is it?

364
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,710
I'm going downstairs to eat something

365
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,190
Don't touch anything here, okay?

366
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,150
Don't touch, got it?

367
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,070
Didn't you say

368
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,710
that she's abroad all year round

369
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,710
And you haven't seen her for years?

370
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,550
What could she possibly want?

371
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,150
Yes

372
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,950
That's the scariest part, isn't it?

373
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,270
You know

374
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,230
there's something off about her

375
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,950
Yet you can't put your finger on it

376
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,550
Don't you think

377
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,790
it's weird just thinking about it?

378
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,590
But...

379
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,790
I can't do anything about it either

380
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,270
Come on

381
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,030
She likes talking to you

382
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,150
Then talk to her

383
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,590
Take the opportunity when she's not prepared

384
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,310
and find out more about her

385
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,590
I won't go

386
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,790
You have to help me out with this

387
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,310
What's in it for me?

388
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,310
Uncle

389
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,750
My deskmate

390
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,910
My homie

391
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,670
If you help me out with this,

392
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,470
I'll deal with all the papers

393
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:34,950
Stop

394
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,150
Even if you call me "dad" today

395
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,750
I won't say yes

396
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,230
Grandpa

397
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,830
I didn't hear clearly

398
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,430
Grandpa

399
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,640
That's enough

400
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,960
Look

401
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,920
Have a seat

402
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,480
Are you getting angry?

403
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,840
You're getting angry just like that

404
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,680
I agree with you. Isn't that enough?

405
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,960
I'll go try

406
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
I'll go try, alright?

407
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,240
Is that okay?

408
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,880
Say something

409
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,560
I've already agreed

410
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,520
Look at you

411
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,040
Don't put it on

412
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,960
It looks cool

413
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,640
Isn't that right?

414
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,240
Say something

415
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
I've already agreed

416
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:24,720
Am I cool?

417
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,280
Indeed

418
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,160
Cool

419
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
You're the most invincible one

420
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,680
Brother Ling Dong

421
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,640
Here

422
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,240
I ordered for you

423
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,360
This is the signature dish

424
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,520
Thanks, Brother Ling Dong

425
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,240
How is it?

426
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,160
It's delicious

427
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,440
Do you come back to China every year to visit?

428
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,240
No, I don't

429
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,280
I really enjoy traveling everywhere

430
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,840
I just went to Atacama recently

431
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,960
I know Atacama

432
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,400
The night sky is very clear there

433
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,040
And it's globally recognized

434
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,920
as the best stargazing location

435
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,200
I'd like to go there if I have the chance

436
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,120
Then let's go together next time

437
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,440
I can be your guide

438
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,880
Okay, if there's a chance

439
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,720
This little girl

440
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,840
She even has two different faces

441
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,880
Don't be fooled by her

442
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,720
We'll go together in the future

443
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,320
Brother Ling Dong

444
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,920
You're good at studying

445
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,720
And you're good-looking

446
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,080
Everything about you is good

447
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,400
Why are you friends with my brother?

448
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,840
Well, as for him...

449
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
He indeed has many problems

450
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,440
Bad temper

451
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,280
Poor grades

452
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,000
He doesn't follow rules

453
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,800
And lacks manners

454
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,240
And sometimes, you know

455
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,480
he's a bit silly

456
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,720
Yes, indeed silly

457
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
So, besides me

458
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,320
he doesn't have any other friend

459
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,800
As his only friend

460
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,720
So do you know him inside out?

461
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,760
Of course

462
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,720
Then let me test you

463
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,720
Where does he

464
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,360
keep his most important things?

465
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,400
His most important things?

466
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,720
What are they?

467
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,680
Just...

468
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,520
ID cards, bank cards, and such

469
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,520
-Oh, that's just... -You know that?

470
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,520
I don't know

471
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,720
Why are you asking?

472
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,920
It's just...

473
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,600
It's just to...

474
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,160
To get to know him better

475
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,880
This milk tea is so delicious

476
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,880
I wanna buy another cup

477
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,120
for my grandmother

478
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,320
Almost slipped up

479
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,200
Two cups of signature milk tea, please

480
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,120
Alright, wait a moment please

481
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,720
Handsome guy caused troubles indeed

482
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,320
She's indeed a bit strange

483
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,000
She seems very concerned about your documents

484
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,080
and your bank card

485
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,040
Oh no

486
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,640
She knows all my passwords

487
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,880
She's after the money

488
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,160
What are you thinking?

489
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,240
What do we do next?

490
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,400
Keep an eye on her

491
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,440
Well...

492
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,200
This face mask is actually quite good

493
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,080
You scared me

494
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,840
It's not cheap

495
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,560
Why are you using a face mask

496
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,440
in the middle of the day?

497
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,280
Aren't you using one too?

498
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,240
When I see this person,

499
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,600
it reminds me of a movie I watched before

500
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,080
In the movie, the thief

501
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,320
also wanted to steal from the male lead

502
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,920
The thief actually went to

503
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,760
the male lead's bedroom

504
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,960
and study room to search

505
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,720
Who would put such important things

506
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,680
in the bedroom and study?

507
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,720
Where else would you put them?

508
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,720
In a safe?

509
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,560
How possible

510
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,960
If you put them in a safe,

511
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,280
it's like telling the thief

512
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,640
"Come take it"

513
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,680
So where would you put them?

514
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,520
In my case...

515
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,120
Where?

516
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,720
I don't have anything valuable

517
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,960
My most valuable things are definitely

518
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,200
my sneakers and such

519
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,740
But sneakers...

520
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,000
are so smelly

521
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,120
Who would steal your shoes, right?

522
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,080
You have no sense of security

523
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,000
There are many things

524
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,160
that shouldn't be placed randomly

525
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,160
Like wallet, ID card,

526
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,800
bank card and passport

527
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
It'll be troublesome

528
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,840
if you lose them

529
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,800
I would definitely keep them

530
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,340
in a storage room

531
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,320
to keep them in safe

532
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,520
I've been a bit tired recently

533
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,120
My skin is really dry

534
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,400
Alright, I'll go wash up first

535
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,360
You continue watching

536
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,360
Hui's box

537
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,840
Why are there so many stinky socks

538
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,960
in the drawer?

539
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,640
Could it be a distraction?

540
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,360
So smelly

541
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
I've heard of Pandora's box,

542
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,400
but what's in a Hui's box?

543
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
And it's locked

544
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,880
It should be here

545
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,640
Where are the keys?

546
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,440
How come there are so many keys?

547
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,920
What are you looking for?

548
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,640
Your passport

549
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,640
Brother

550
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,520
Why are you back so early?

551
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,960
Look over there

552
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,400
So you knew all along

553
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,600
Because of your poor acting skills

554
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,960
I saw through you at first glance

555
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,800
Just one glance

556
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,000
I'll tell Grandma

557
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,280
You lied to me and bullied me

558
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,760
It doesn't work

559
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
I'm not falling for your tricks anymore

560
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,680
Go away

561
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,280
Tell the truth

562
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,800
What are you doing with my passport?

563
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,360
Look at how you treat me

564
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,440
I won't tell you

565
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,160
Are you sure?

566
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,640
Help!

567
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,800
Short by 0.01 millimeter

568
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,560
Let go of my little wand

569
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,680
I'm fighting you

570
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,560
One more 0.01

571
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
1.0 is gone

572
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,960
I'd never

573
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,800
bow down to the forces of darkness

574
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,160
Alright

575
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,920
Are you gonna tell me or not?

576
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,400
Fine

577
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,520
I give up

578
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,600
Please, tell me

579
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
What are you planning to do?

580
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,920
I can buy you anything

581
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,520
Whatever you want

582
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,720
Whether it's game skins, clothes,

583
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,160
or skincare products, luxury goods,

584
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,720
cosmetics

585
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,680
Just tell me

586
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,320
Alright, wait and see

587
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,520
Don't force me to use

588
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,480
my ultimate move

589
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,960
I have no weaknesses

590
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,480
Ladies and gentlemen

591
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,800
Let's see the miracle

592
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:40,880
Okay

593
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,080
Okay

594
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,680
Okay

595
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,160
Okay

596
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,240
Okay

597
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,720
Get out

598
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,720
Get out

599
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,040
Get out of here

600
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,040
I'm leaving

601
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,720
What are you doing?

602
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,600
That's enough

603
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,520
Just do your thing

604
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,720
I need to use the restroom

605
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,400
Count to three, just leave

606
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,480
Three, two, one

607
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,800
Did you hear that?
