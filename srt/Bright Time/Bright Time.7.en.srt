1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,520
Now a piece of latest news

2
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,040
Ling Dong, a classmate from Class 5, Grade 2, Senior High School

3
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,240
Will represent Chengjun High School

4
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,280
go out again

5
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,400
He will sign up for

6
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,280
Program Selection of the Municipal Talent Competition

7
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
This was Lan Jinghui's voice

8
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,640
Ling Dong

9
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,880
Why are you and Lan Jinghui again

10
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,680
Got mixed up

11
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,440
Teacher

12
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,760
I want to go to the bathroom

13
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,520
I'll be right back

14
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,920
Go ahead

15
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,880
Ling Dong

16
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,840
Come on, let's keep going

17
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,800
Chen Luyang

18
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,520
Didn't you say you made it

19
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,080
It's a teacher

20
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,200
Come and tell me

21
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:39,960
Good

22
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,200
Students

23
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,040
The vitality of youth

24
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,680
The passion of youth

25
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,360
Will be on your body

26
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,200
embody to your heart's content

27
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,120
Meet yourself and challenge yourself

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,160
We believe you can do it

29
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,720
Student Ling Dong

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,480
Let's release your energy to your heart's content

31
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,280
We shout for you

32
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,440
I'm proud of you

33
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,800
Here we go

34
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,680
The eldest nephew wants to cause

35
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,640
Second cousin's attention

36
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,480
Can I not come

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,040
You did it because you wanted to attend

38
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,720
Physics competition

39
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,080
So I dropped out of the talent contest

40
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm not saying anything

41
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,560
Now you're done

42
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,840
You can always join, don't you

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,280
I don't understand

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,520
Why do you want me to participate so much

45
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,280
Do you want to see me every day

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,560
Are you annoyed

47
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,720
I'm the one who bothers you, okay

48
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,200
I don't care

49
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Now the whole school has heard it

50
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,240
You

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
To participate in a talent contest

52
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,840
If you still quit

53
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,160
Then you're a shrinking turtle

54
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,080
Okay, just give way

55
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,440
What do you do

56
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,680
I want to announce to the whole school

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,440
You're my eldest nephew

58
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,000
Lan Jinghui

59
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,840
What are you doing again

60
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,760
Hello Director

61
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,800
Good

62
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,160
Director, why are you here

63
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,360
Why am I here

64
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,600
If I don't come, you'll go to heaven

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,120
This is the school radio station

66
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,640
Not a place for you to mess around

67
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,720
Go for a lap

68
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,040
No, what about him

69
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:13,960
And

70
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,600
Ling Dong

71
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,480
I've told you so many times

72
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,760
I hand over Lan Jinghui to you

73
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,440
Just to make you

74
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,920
Take care of him, right

75
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,240
Can't leave it to his temper

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,360
I know, Chief

77
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,880
Go to class

78
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,880
Goodbye, Director

79
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,080
Goodbye

80
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,440
Go ahead

81
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,640
No, it's not

82
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,560
No, no, the director

83
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,400
This is too much difference, isn't it

84
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,240
Go for a lap

85
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:36,920
I

86
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,800
Go for a lap

87
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,480
I

88
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,600
Go for a lap

89
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh my God

90
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,040
Small painting

91
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,400
Ling Dong

92
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,200
Sorry

93
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,240
If at the beginning

94
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,680
It's not that I quit the talent contest

95
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,760
And you wouldn't now

96
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,480
It's okay, it's okay Ling Dong

97
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,200
Really

98
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,840
We're fine now

99
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
We've worked hard

100
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,880
that

101
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,480
If you're all right

102
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,520
You can also watch us rehearse

103
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,360
Although we're not very good at the moment

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,640
But

105
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,280
Will you come

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,720
A jug of turbid wine is full of pleasure

107
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,920
Don't dream cold tonight

108
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,400
Have a sip of hot water

109
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,600
Thank you

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
Am I still not singing well

111
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
No, I think it's pretty good

112
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,240
Really

113
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,560
Of course

114
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,120
There is still room for improvement

115
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,080
Ling Dong

116
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,840
What are you doing

117
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,840
Are you gonna come here again

118
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,960
Demagogic

119
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,960
Ling Dong came to see us rehearse

120
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,360
He said I was a pretty good singer

121
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't listen to his nonsense

122
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,520
Of course, it's not all nonsense

123
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,200
Still remarkable

124
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,040
And there's plenty of room for improvement

125
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,000
If I'm like this

126
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,640
Perform on stage then

127
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,440
What should I do if I still can't sing well?

128
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,600
Won't

129
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,320
Your master, I promise you

130
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,400
Absolutely no problem

131
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,360
His little finger was actually on top of his thumb

132
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,520
Really, really, really

133
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,760
Lan Jinghui

134
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,840
Did you just hand

135
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,640
What happened to my hand

136
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,800
My hands are pretty good

137
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,920
What happened to my hand

138
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,040
To disappear

139
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,800
Disappear immediately

140
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,400
Almost enough

141
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,640
That's it

142
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,320
Don't disturb our rehearsal

143
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,360
I promise

144
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,720
Always be your good friend

145
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,440
Come on, you promise

146
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,680
It's wrong for you to do this

147
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,880
To be like this

148
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,640
I can't do it

149
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,040
You see I can

150
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,280
Go, go, go

151
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,120
What about traveling in space? You

152
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
Since when do you care so much about me

153
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,000
You know I love space

154
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,280
Who cares about you

155
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,800
I'm just saying hello

156
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,000
It's so clear when you ask casually

157
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,400
What does it mean

158
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,640
Explain the eldest nephew

159
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I'm getting to know my second cousin better and better

160
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,520
It would be good if I was willing to learn by myself

161
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,960
Don't push my luck

162
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,320
Will I push my luck

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That depends on how you behave

164
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,040
What is this

165
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,440
Can't read

166
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,160
Junior High School Workbook

167
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,680
Are you insulting my IQ

168
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,760
I'm just based on your level

169
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,320
Just choose the exercises that suit you

170
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,320
I found you as a person

171
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,640
It's really a double standard

172
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,120
What do you mean according to my level

173
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,320
Help me choose a junior high school workbook

174
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,960
I still have to do

175
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,600
Then I'll help you according to your level

176
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,240
Registered talent contest

177
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,200
Why don't you join

178
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,800
That's good

179
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,240
As long as you can finish this set of exercises

180
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,400
And the fault tolerance rate

181
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,280
Within one percent

182
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,960
I'll take part

183
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,880
And join our band

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,360
indeed

185
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,720
This

186
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,480
Is it so happy

187
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
But only if you finish it

188
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,080
and fault tolerance rate

189
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,040
Within one percent

190
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,880
There can be no fraud, right?

191
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,040
So what you mean is that

192
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,200
I can only make a mistake

193
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,280
How

194
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,080
I don't think I can do it

195
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,440
I promise I can do it

196
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:01,760
Good

197
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,520
Okay, then we'll make a deal

198
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,000
deal

199
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,800
I wish you all your wishes come true

200
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,320
eldest nephew

201
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Ling Dong, you this time

202
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,360
It's gonna fall into my hands

203
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,400
Arrived to the band

204
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,200
You see how I'm gonna deal with you

205
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Is this a math problem in junior high school

206
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,800
This is too hard

207
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,160
If you check the answer, the transaction will be invalid

208
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,720
Have you installed surveillance?

209
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,800
How does he know that I'm looking at

210
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,240
Young people talk about martial arts

211
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,640
Young master, I'm on my own

212
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,600
Okay

213
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,640
Ling Dong, wait for me

214
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Even if I'm on my own

215
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,880
I can get you, too

216
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,480
You give me these junior high school questions

217
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,880
It's just too simple

218
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,080
Ten minutes

219
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,920
Get it done

220
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
So this is your big night

221
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,600
The reason why you called me to school

222
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,480
Commitment comes first

223
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,480
After all, some people

224
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,800
Having a criminal record is not very trustworthy

225
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,040
I don't think you're

226
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,600
Are you afraid

227
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,360
After all, the fault tolerance rate is one percent

228
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,480
For you

229
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,200
It's not an easy task

230
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,600
This is a big misunderstanding

231
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,040
I hope that after you approve it

232
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,440
A brain that can be intelligent to me

233
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,400
There is a clear perception

234
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,040
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow

235
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,600
Don't be impatient

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,560
In-situ review in-situ inspection

237
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,400
So confident in yourself

238
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,280
Good

239
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,920
What are you talking about

240
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,800
wisdom

241
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,280
Wisdom and Beauty

242
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,040
See you tomorrow in the rehearsal room

243
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,520
See you tomorrow

244
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,280
Real or false

245
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,960
Ling Dong wants to join our band

246
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,120
Impossible

247
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,720
I'll bet you a bag of potato chips

248
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,200
He really agreed personally

249
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,200
Of course

250
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,600
If he dare to go back on his words

251
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,560
I'll just go straight

252
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,680
What about it

253
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,600
Large

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,040
Da Huihui classmate

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,600
As for

256
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,960
So warmly welcome new members

257
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,240
Take it and brush it

258
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,880
Only enthusiasm can appear

259
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,720
My sincerity, right

260
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,520
Let's welcome the new classmates

261
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,000
Classmate Ling Dong joins

262
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,640
Welcome

263
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,120
Talk, don't give it to me again

264
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,240
I'm gasping for breath

265
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:26,960
Grey Brother

266
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,000
Then what is Ling Dong playing

267
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,920
It's on point to ask

268
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,720
Classmate Ling Dong, he doesn't play with anything

269
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,760
Student Ling Dong

270
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Have a more important mission

271
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,160
Waiting for him to do it

272
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,840
That is, with his hands

273
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,720
Hold us up

274
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
The soul of the whole band

275
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,600
Good

276
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,640
Very good little painting keep it up

277
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,800
Lan Jinghui

278
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,920
I can't sweep you like this

279
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,400
Well, why don't you go get a bottle of water

280
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,920
Ling Dong, I'll help you

281
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,640
It's okay, I'll do it

282
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,520
Do you want to eat it

283
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm not eating

284
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,480
unscrew

285
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Want to drink something hot

286
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,480
Lan Jinghui

287
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,400
Why are you calling Ling Dong

288
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,680
How can this be called a command

289
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,120
Classmate Ling Dong is

290
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,760
Willingly serve us

291
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Being part of a band

292
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,640
He guarantees

293
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Our Logistics

294
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,560
How noble and selfless

295
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,200
Right, Ling Dong, classmate

296
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,240
It's hot, isn't it

297
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,440
Waiting

298
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,920
Scalded to death

299
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,400
What's going on with you

300
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,920
You can't sweep the floor well either

301
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
You don't understand the water either

302
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,760
What else can you do

303
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,280
Okay, then you say

304
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,880
What else do I want

305
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,120
Then do you know

306
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,920
Every school in the city

307
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,960
We have to send a representative

308
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,160
Go to a talent contest

309
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,760
You wouldn't have gone to investigate and investigate

310
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,560
What programs do people have

311
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,960
I want a complete program list

312
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,440
Only by knowing yourself and the enemy can you win a hundred battles

313
00:15:59,520 --> 00:15:59,800
Good

314
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,280
It's not that he's sick, is he

315
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,520
He can drink such hot water

316
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,920
Are you sick? You

317
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,920
Where's Ling Dong?

318
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,640
This nerd fished me again

319
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,600
You say that again

320
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,160
I'll never call you Master again

321
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,920
Apprentice

322
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,880
I'm just stating objective facts

323
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,960
People like Ling Dong

324
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,120
You can't be too nice to him

325
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,600
He's not sure now

326
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,520
Where to sleep

327
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,920
You didn't let him go

328
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,960
Investigate intelligence

329
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,160
Is it

330
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,480
Then he can't occupy it either

331
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,880
Our precious rehearsal time

332
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,360
Is it right

333
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,360
Can he use his rest time

334
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,840
Is it right

335
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,000
What time can I use

336
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,840
What is this

337
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,600
Can't read

338
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,040
Summary of talent contest list

339
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,080
Here's what you did

340
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,160
Even every school

341
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,640
Various types of performances

342
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,360
And according to the judges' preferences

343
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,920
Previous ratings

344
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,920
This has all

345
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,920
It's too awesome, isn't it?

346
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,480
It's really amazing

347
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,440
What's the exaggeration about this

348
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,960
Isn't that simple

349
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,640
I also built a group for everyone

350
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,760
Convenient contact later

351
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,160
small group

352
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,000
The group name is Rooftop Squad

353
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,160
This is too ugly, isn't it

354
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,160
Rooftop Squad

355
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,040
Ling Dong

356
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,880
Don't you feel too bad

357
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,360
I think it's pretty good

358
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,880
I think it's pretty good too

359
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,600
It's sunny in summer

360
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,480
Xiao is Xiao Xiaohua

361
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,440
The score is Ling Dong's high-scoring academic master

362
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,760
As for the team

363
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,360
I want to be the captain of the basketball team

364
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,680
Then we are

365
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,160
Rooftop team

366
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,720
What about me

367
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,000
The formation of our band

368
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,120
I can't live without Master, you on the rooftop

369
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,240
Encouragement for me

370
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:11,880
But the apprentice

371
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,200
This is too far-fetched, isn't it

372
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,920
Although it makes sense

373
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,280
Then celebrate us

374
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,520
The rooftop team was officially established

375
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,080
OK

376
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,600
receive

377
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,880
I take it with a reservation

378
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,600
What is the taste of the rooftop team?

379
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,760
It's okay

380
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,040
Your bad taste

381
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,680
I've had a taste of it

382
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,920
Ling Dong, what do you mean by that

383
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,320
Why are you doing this to Ling Dong

384
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,480
It's Lan Jinghui. What do you want to do?

385
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,760
Three people bully

386
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,080
My gray brother is alone, isn't he

387
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,960
Ma Yiming

388
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,520
Grey Brother Grey Brother Grey Brother

389
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,640
Grey Brother Grey Brother

390
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,840
Ma Yiming, be careful

391
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,280
In the long and lonely

392
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,200
In campus time

393
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,720
I felt for the first time

394
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,760
Collective warmth

395
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,560
The rooftop team was officially established

396
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,440
Grandma is back

397
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,480
Xiao Hui is back. Are you hungry?

398
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,600
Not hungry

399
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,880
Grandma will give you a bowl of wonton

400
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,400
Grandma I'm not hungry I'm not hungry

401
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,200
You sit, you sit

402
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,760
Dad

403
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,960
How can you not be hungry

404
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,920
No need grandma grandma

405
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,640
I really don't have to

406
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,560
I was at school today

407
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,840
Okay, okay, thank you, grandma

408
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,760
I went upstairs to grandma

409
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,880
You, you, you, you

410
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,400
Often not going home

411
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,680
It's hard to come back

412
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,480
Xiao Hui doesn't eat wontons

413
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,360
I must want to eat your noodles

414
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,520
I was like this when I was a child

415
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:36,640
Go quickly

416
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,240
Get your son a bowl of noodles

417
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Wait a minute, wait a minute

418
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,400
I said I wouldn't listen to you

419
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,680
Go or not

420
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,160
Mom, mom

421
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,680
Go or not

422
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,200
Go

423
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,480
Xiao Hui is at home

424
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,760
Can you save some face for me

425
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,960
Go, go, go, go

426
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,840
Little Grey Little Grey

427
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,240
stop

428
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,400
It's too early for the horse to beat the drum

429
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,120
erratic rhythm

430
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,200
Why don't you say summer sunny days

431
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,000
Always a beat slower

432
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,800
Do you have the nerve to call me

433
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,320
You were the one who was playing around

434
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,000
Many places can't keep up with the rhythm

435
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,600
I wouldn't have

436
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,960
I've tried my best

437
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,800
Don't play anymore

438
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,880
Do you like to play or not

439
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,440
You guys stop arguing

440
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,720
Is my problem

441
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,720
I've never been able to sing well

442
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,280
What is this

443
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,120
I made a note

444
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,600
Everyone's error-prone paragraphs

445
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,520
I know all the problems

446
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,040
Don't tell me this

447
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,840
Co-authoring is my problem

448
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,440
The biggest

449
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,400
sunny day

450
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,040
This is a problem for all of us

451
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,400
It's not yours alone

452
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,560
Small painting

453
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,920
I know it's me

454
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,320
Has been holding everyone back

455
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,640
Why don't you change someone else

456
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,640
I don't want to mess up either

457
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,200
Your show

458
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,040
You really just stand up and talk

459
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,920
No back pain

460
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,440
You're gone now

461
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,520
Where are we going to find someone

462
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,520
I can try it out

463
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,160
Would you

464
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,240
Won't

465
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,600
You don't know what are you talking about

466
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,840
But I can learn

467
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:20,800
I'll teach you

468
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,000
Come on, tell me, tell me, genius

469
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,360
How many strings does a guitar have

470
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,760
Six roots

471
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,840
Beautiful answer

472
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,680
He seems to be teaching fools

473
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,120
I'll only teach it once

474
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,000
You listen carefully

475
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,960
Three on the thumb tube

476
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,040
index finger middle finger ring finger

477
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,120
From bottom to top in turn

478
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,160
Pipe one, two and three strings

479
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,160
You try

480
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,320
Hand relaxation

481
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,560
bomb

482
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,200
Play it

483
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,840
Why are you so stupid

484
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Have you ever seen anyone play the guitar

485
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,040
Hold the bottom, hold the top

486
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,560
Still three high

487
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,040
I have to learn from the music early childhood class

488
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,360
Start teaching you, isn't it

489
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,760
Learning musical instruments is not like learning mathematics, physics and chemistry

490
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,560
Why is Zhazha Hui always like this?

491
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,520
Say that people are Ling Dong

492
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,680
I'm telling you

493
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,920
Usually Ling Dong teaches Brother Hui

494
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,080
It's hard for Brother Hui now

495
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,640
Seize an opportunity to teach Ling Dong

496
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,000
Can he not enjoy it

497
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,640
Anyway, I believe

498
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,240
Ling Dong can definitely learn

499
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,440
Students, thank you for your hard work

500
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,240
Hello Director

501
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,920
Hello Director

502
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,720
OK OK

503
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,360
I'm representing the school

504
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,120
Come to express my condolences to all the students

505
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,440
How did you practice

506
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,200
Director, don't worry

507
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,920
Our rooftop team

508
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,920
Guaranteed to amaze the audience

509
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,640
Rooftop Squad

510
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,240
That's right

511
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,000
It sounds nice. Who gave this name?

512
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,920
We started it together

513
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,400
Yes, started together

514
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,560
Awesome

515
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,920
Talent contest

516
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,200
This event

517
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
I just count on everyone

518
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,600
Come on and work hard together

519
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,080
Good or not

520
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,560
Don't let the school down

521
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,240
It doesn't matter whether you get grades or not

522
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,200
The important thing is that

523
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,400
To reflect our

524
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,000
The Spiritual Outlook of Chenjun Middle School

525
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:04,640
Refuel

526
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,800
Refuel

527
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah

528
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,880
Yeah

529
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,760
Okay, then I'll go back first

530
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,400
Goodbye, Director

531
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,400
Thank you, Director Zhang

532
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,160
Rooftop team, right

533
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,160
Who was on the rooftop two days ago

534
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,920
You're shouting

535
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,960
Lan Jinghui

536
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,840
How do I listen to that voice

537
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,000
It sounds like your voice

538
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,440
Tianer

539
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,080
Why is my drum blue

540
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,120
Ma Yiming

541
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,920
Not a sunny day

542
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,800
Why is this drum blue

543
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,560
His guitar is also blue

544
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,560
His microphone is also blue

545
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,880
blue

546
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,080
Come and plug this in

547
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,440
Blue

548
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:54,920
Blue

549
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
blue blue

550
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,800
Play the drum hammer

551
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,920
Play the drum hammer Play the drum hammer

552
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,360
drum hammer

553
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,760
Play the drum hammer Play the drum hammer

554
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,360
drum hammer

555
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,360
Blue

556
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,240
Let's play drum hammer on a sunny day

557
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,560
Then play the drum hammer

558
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,200
drum hammer

559
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,120
How's the drum hammer?

560
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,720
Ma Yiming, are you a fool

561
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,360
The six elements of a triangle

562
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,280
We know that

563
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,880
small a small b small c

564
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,760
Represents the edge

565
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,240
Big A Big B Big C

566
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,320
It represents the angle

567
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,840
Then I would like to ask the students

568
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
Big A enlarged B enlarged C

569
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,960
How many degrees is it equal to

570
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,080
Ma Yiming

571
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,880
equal to

572
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,040
Ling Dong, tell him

573
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,080
One hundred eighty degrees

574
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,360
Okay, let's go ahead

575
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,640
We know that

576
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,360
Small a, small b, small c represents the edge

577
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,120
So big A big B

578
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,840
That's amazing

579
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,360
Sure enough, it's the three highs

580
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,240
You learned it in such a quick time

581
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,040
indeed

582
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,480
I just said

583
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,600
Ling Dong must be able to learn it

584
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,960
It's not because I'm a good teacher

585
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:40,960
No one complimented me

586
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,800
Went to dinner

587
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,080
dry rice dry rice

588
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,760
Wait for me

589
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,320

591
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,040
Chen County will win

592
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,520
Too powerful

593
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,160
Wear this on the stage on the day of the game

594
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,480
Director

595
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,280
This is too dirty, isn't it?

596
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,080
What kind of soil?

597
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,720
This is a special exhortation from the principal

598
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,960
And overnight for you

599
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,680
Customized special stage costume

600
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,480
Represents

601
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,440
Our Chenjun Middle School

602
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,320
A mental outlook

603
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,840
A conviction of victory

604
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,360
What ideological realm

605
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,200
Go to rehearsal

606
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,520
My clothes have no words

607
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,040
He has no words

608
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,840
Why doesn't Ling Dong have any words?

609
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:56,760
he

610
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,400
It's not that his clothes have no words

611
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,040
What?

612
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,360
No words

613
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,920
Much better

614
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,760
Then we are now

615
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,520
Chen County must win the exclamation mark

616
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,000
I don't wear it

617
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,960
What are you doing? What are you doing

618
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,120
What a great idea. Don't waste it

619
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,160
I'm gonna wear yours

620
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,280
Be calm and be impatient

621
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,240
If you have to wear it

622
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,240
I'll help you find another one

623
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,480
Ma Yiming

624
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,320
Take yours off and give it to him

625
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:32,840
I don't

626
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,960
Ling Dong, let's take off his clothes

627
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,360

628
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,920

629
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,640
Los Angeles at 4 a.m.

630
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,640
It's only 11 o'clock now bro

631
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Brother, just express that artistic conception

632
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,960
Walk home

633
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,000
