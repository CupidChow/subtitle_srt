[Bright Time]

00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,880
[Happened to be the No.1]
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,550
Xu Mengyu can be the president

4
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,670
I'll vote for her

5
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,070
Who is Xu Mengyu?

6
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,310
Is she among the candidates?

7
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,150
You don't even know who Xu Mengyu is?

8
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,190
She's a famous talented girl

9
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,110
in our school

10
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,310
She's the daughter of

11
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,550
the president of the FLAC

12
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,670
She published her first literary work

13
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,190
at the age of thirteen

14
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,670
She's really amazing

15
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,390
She hasn't shown off at all

16
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,710
Yet she's already the student council president

17
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,870
The most important thing is

18
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,270
that she's both talented and beautiful

19
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,270
I heard that

20
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,190
half of the votes here

21
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,070
are her fans

22
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,590
Listen to me

23
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,790
The most exciting part is yet to come

24
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,270
At this time, Bi Peng was

25
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,550
in a panic

26
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,950
He was jumping up and down

27
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,270
in this narrow corridor

28
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,310
and begging for mercy repeatedly

29
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,670
And finally, he burst into tears

30
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,790
Why won't you listen to me?

31
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:53,830
Hey

32
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,870
If you're here to give me

33
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,550
a letter,

34
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,510
I'm really busy today

35
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,430
Just leave it here for now

36
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,150
I'll read it when I have time

37
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,790
Sorry, mate

38
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,190
You're sitting in my seat

39
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,230
Mengyu, you finally came back

40
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,750
Mengyu, you're back

41
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,510
Mengyu, you have no idea

42
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,870
what happened at school

43
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,310
while you were away

44
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,470
You're really amazing

45
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,590
I heard you're gonna publish a collection

46
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,950
Where have you been lately?

47
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,830
I'll answer each of you one by one

48
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,670
Ma Yiming, look at them

49
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,350
Here comes a girl

50
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,870
And they all rush up

51
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,790
And it has to be you

52
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:34,950
Brother Hui

53
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,630
Sister Meng, when you were not here

54
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,190
I missed you so much

55
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,830
What's wrong with her?

56
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,070
Can't you tell it?

57
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,150
You can tell

58
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:50,950
You can tell

59
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,510
Where are you going?

60
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,150
Disciple

61
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,030
Qingtian

62
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,670
This story

63
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,190
is really exciting

64
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,910
I need to use the restroom

65
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,270
Just wait

66
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,590
Chen Luyang

67
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,110
Please call me president

68
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,710
Stop talking

69
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,150
My story is even more exciting

70
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,230
Listen to me

71
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,230
Is this what you like?

72
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,110
Where's the letter?

73
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,510
Show it to me first

74
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,110
Show it to me first

75
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,670
Come on, hurry up

76
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,390
One by one

77
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,070
Xu Mengyu

78
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,350
This is the letter I wrote for you

79
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,190
Thank you

80
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,790
This is mine

81
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,710
And this is mine

82
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,470
This blue one

83
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,510
And mine

84
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,310
Let me read it to you first

85
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,870
Don't...

86
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,310
I smell several pairs

87
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,710
of stinky feet

88
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,230
So stinky

89
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,950
What's it about?

90
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,430
Actually, nothing much

91
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:51,990
Just some thoughts

92
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,270
I have about life

93
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,830
Can we talk about something else?

94
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,510
Can you all lower your voices?

95
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,710
I still need to study

96
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,390
Well, Xu Mengyu

97
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,550
There's a new movie coming out this week

98
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,390
Maybe we can go watch it?

99
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,230
Chen Luyang, where are you going?

100
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,230
I'll go to the corridor to study

101
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,310
Why study in the corridor?

102
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,990
Xu Mengyu is here too

103
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,790
Don't you have to

104
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,830
report to the president

105
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,030
the recent work situation?

106
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,430
The vice president is just temporary

107
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,510
I'm preparing

108
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,750
for next year's presidential election

109
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,150
The first option is...

110
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,270
No elections next year

111
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,910
I have other plans

112
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,790
Qingtian

113
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,830
My skin has improved

114
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,750
And I've lost weight

115
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,350
Yes

116
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,110
Xu

117
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,830
What book are you reading?

118
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,710
Chemistry

119
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,470
I'm not good at chemistry either

120
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,630
This question is the most difficult

121
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,310
Other students can give it a try

122
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:54,990
Well...

123
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,590
Teacher, I'm Ling Dong

124
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,190
Ling Dong, Chen Luyang

125
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,950
You two are the top two

126
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,470
in the physics competition class

127
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,980
You two must solve it

128
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,860
Alright, just solve the problem

129
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,870
Your approach is correct

130
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,670
But not clever enough

131
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,550
You're taking too many detours

132
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,870
Teacher

133
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,710
I'm done

134
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,550
You're done

135
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,270
I didn't even think of this way

136
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,430
Ling Dong

137
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,230
You solved it so quickly

138
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,710
Truly deserving of being my student

139
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,580
Ling Dong

140
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,000
You're indeed the brain

141
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,390
Stop

142
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,750
Stop it

143
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,750
Just solve your problems

144
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,430
Talented individuals are rare

145
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,390
You need to make up for your shortcomings

146
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,350
Alright, teacher, I'll leave now

147
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,550
Goodbye, teacher

148
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,350
Okay

149
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,230
Where are you going?

150
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,550
To eat alone?

151
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,430
No, there's no chance

152
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,350
Hello, Ms. Fang

153
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,590
Hello, Ms. Fang

154
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,710
Thank you, Ms. Fang

155
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,470
for providing us with a new plant stand

156
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,390
So we can continue growing plants

157
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,790
Do you all like it?

158
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,510
Yes, of course

159
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,950
It's okay then

160
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,750
But speaking of which, Ms. Fang

161
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,350
Why did you come to see us?

162
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,230
What's wrong?

163
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,950
Aren't you happy for me to come?

164
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,030
Can't you eat?

165
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,870
No, how could I not be happy?

166
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,230
Ms. Fang, you're so beautiful, kind,

167
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,830
gentle, and generous

168
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,390
How could we not be able

169
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,110
to eat?

170
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,270
I can eat three bowls

171
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:20,510
Alright

172
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,030
Since that's the case,

173
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,870
I'll tell you

174
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,670
some good news

175
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,150
Okay

176
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,750
I discussed with Director Zhang

177
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,830
And we've decided that

178
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,510
you and Ling Dong

179
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,510
will form a study group

180
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,630
to help each other one-on-one

181
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,910
Me and him?

182
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,270
Me and him?

183
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,990
Yes

184
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,430
Ms. Fang, are you kidding?

185
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,870
Does it look like a joke?

186
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,710
No, teacher

187
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,070
What kind of good news is this?

188
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,510
Why isn't it good news?

189
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,070
Ling Dong is the top student

190
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,070
in our grade

191
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,350
With his help,

192
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,070
you'll definitely

193
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,150
improve quickly

194
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:57,870
And besides,

195
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,310
other students wouldn't even think of it

196
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,990
You're taking advantage and acting coy

197
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,470
Study well and seriously

198
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,310
Don't let us down

199
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,270
We put a lot of effort into you

200
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,670
Ling Dong

201
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,990
Thank you for your hard work

202
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,110
Alright, then I won't stay here

203
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,230
and ruin your appetite

204
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,030
No, it's fine

205
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,350
You guys continue eating, I'll leave first

206
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,110
Goodbye, Ms. Fang

207
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,190
No, Ms. Fang...

208
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,950
No, why didn't you refuse?

209
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,470
Why didn't you refuse?

210
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,350
I'm ranked last in the class

211
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,390
What's the use of me refusing?

212
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,310
If you had brought it up,

213
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:33,710
they would have said

214
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,950
that the teacher is affecting my studies

215
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,150
That's not acceptable

216
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,510
They would definitely agree

217
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,830
It's not necessary

218
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,830
And disciple

219
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,830
Not to criticize you

220
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,470
if you wanna thank me,

221
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,870
you should have some sincerity, right?

222
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,430
You didn't even ask about my taste

223
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,830
Tomatoes are so delicious

224
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,230
Who knew you wouldn't eat them?

225
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,950
Delicious? They look disgusting

226
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,950
Why are you staring at me?

227
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,750
Why aren't you eating tomatoes?

228
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,910
Why am I not eating tomatoes?

229
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,390
I've never liked tomatoes since young

230
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,430
I've never liked eating them

231
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,790
If I don't like it, I won't eat it

232
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,110
Who are you?

233
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,190
Why are you meddling in?

234
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,630
Who do you think I am?

235
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,030
He...

236
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,790
He's my biggest jinx

237
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,270
Jinx

238
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,630
How can you say that?

239
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,350
If it wasn't for Ling Dong's recording,

240
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,990
we wouldn't have cleared our names

241
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,390
Alright, I got it

242
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,430
Ganging up on me, huh

243
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,750
Can you let me eat in peace?

244
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,390
Okay, take your time

245
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,790
Come find me in the study room later

246
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,270
Who said I'll study with you?

247
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,110
I'm leaving too

248
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:54,710
Wait

249
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:00,990
Disciple

250
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,430
Can you do me a favor?

251
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,310
What is it?

252
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,710
Help me go to the study room

253
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,310
Xiaohua

254
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,190
Does he want you to go for him?

255
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,270
Do you wanna improve your grades?

256
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,110
Yes

257
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,470
Listen to me

258
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,790
Do me a favor

259
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,390
I just took a few days off

260
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,510
Xiaohua gets so close

261
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,230
to Ling Dong

262
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,950
It's all because of that scumbag Hui

263
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,670
What?

264
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,310
You asked Xiaohua to go to the study room?

265
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,110
Aren't you afraid Ling Dong

266
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,870
will report you to Director Zhang?

267
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,310
What am I afraid of?

268
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,550
Let me tell you

269
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,430
I've had enough of Ling Dong

270
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,190
a long time ago

271
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,270
Instead of being with him

272
00:11:59,270 --> 00:11:59,910
in the study room,

273
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,630
I'd rather go clean toilets

274
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,670
Lan Jinghui

275
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,110
No, why are you here?

276
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,830
Disciple

277
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,190
Didn't I tell you not to go to the study room?

278
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,470
Ling Dong told me to come

279
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,390
Lan Jinghui's Forbidden Manual

280
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:16,990
Here

281
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,070
I don't want it

282
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,230
Wait a moment

283
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,550
He asked me to give this to you

284
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,390
No matter what it says on here,

285
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,590
I absolutely won't go

286
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,710
Do you want the whole class to know

287
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:30,990
that you're my nephew?

288
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,710
He said you'll understand

289
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,390
once you see the words on it

290
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,510
What's it?

291
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,350
Just let me take a look

292
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,070
Go away

293
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,830
Don't follow me

294
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,670
Ling Dong just used a note

295
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,150
to handle him?

296
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,150
What's it?

297
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,190
I don't know

298
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,830
Didn't you see it?

299
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,670
No, I didn't

300
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,590
Why didn't you see it?

301
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,710
Take a seat

302
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,030
Is it interesting? Always this trick

303
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,790
This trick works well

304
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,550
Now you understand,

305
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,870
the good intentions of uncle

306
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,590
I already said it

307
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,430
Don't mention that to me

308
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,710
Then hurry up and study well

309
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,110
Nephew

310
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,630
Don't mention to me

311
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:33,870
Let's finish this first

312
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,550
I told you, it's all ink

313
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,950
in your stomach, right?

314
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,430
So cunning

315
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,870
Homework

316
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,550
Finish it before class ends

317
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,150
Goodbye, teacher

318
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,510
Brother Hui, let's play basketball

319
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,990
Wait

320
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:39,990
Hurry up

321
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,310
We have a team match tonight

322
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,310
I know, the Wild King is back

323
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,630
Just see what I can

324
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:44,990
Lan Jinghui

325
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,510
Did you do the homework?

326
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,110
Today is Friday

327
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,510
Thanks for reminding, today is Friday

328
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,030
Yes

329
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,110
So double homework

330
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,150
Master, come here

331
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,550
Lan Jinghui

332
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,270
Finish all the test papers

333
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,630
All of them

334
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,750
We can't go on like this

335
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,150
What are you doing?

336
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:25,870
What are you doing?

337
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,310
Stupid idiot

338
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,910
What is this?

339
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,430
Don't you know that?

340
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,270
Let me explain

341
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,550
It's a talent competition

342
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,470
Each school selects one person

343
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,150
to participate

344
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,590
Our school participates every year

345
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,510
Yet we didn't get rewarded

346
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,030
Other schools have won awards

347
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,110
but our school hasn't

348
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,430
I'm sure everyone knows

349
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,790
that this year's talent competition

350
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,110
has already started registration

351
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,190
And this year,

352
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,470
it's a bit different

353
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,390
from previous years

354
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,710
You need to record a video

355
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,230
of their own talent

356
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,270
and upload it to our

357
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,150
school's website

358
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,390
The talent this time

359
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,390
will be voted by all students

360
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,910
The student who gets the most votes

361
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,390
will represent the school in the competition

362
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,350
I hope you

363
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,470
won't be too much burdened

364
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,950
And every student

365
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,870
must record a video

366
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,790
to sign up

367
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,510
Okay?

368
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,030
Okay

369
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,030
Come on

370
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,750
Show your most confident side

371
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,110
So now,

372
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,990
time for the class

373
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,390
What can you do?

374
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,350
We all have to do it

375
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,430
I don't have any

376
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,830
No way

377
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,830
I'll teach you freestyle basketball

378
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,070
Spinning moves

379
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,550
Spinning moves

380
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,270
Is it because we have too little homework lately

381
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,550
that you're so free?

382
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,230
What do we do, Qingtian?

383
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,790
Ms. Fang asked us

384
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,310
to have a talent showcase

385
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,830
What are you planning to do?

386
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,230
I've already thought about it

387
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,590
I'll do a poetry recitation

388
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,030
But I won't get chosen anyway

389
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,470
But...

390
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,470
But I don't know anything

391
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,390
Don't worry, Xiaohua

392
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,190
No one will care about us

393
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,590
You can rest assured

394
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,790
Just record something casually

395
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,310
That's right

396
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,550
Mengyu

397
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,670
You're so good at dancing

398
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,030
You're in the first place

399
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,230
on the leaderboard now

400
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,950
The votes are still changable

401
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,190
It might not be me

402
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,710
Don't worry, Mengyu

403
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,790
No one will surpass you

404
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,510
You will definitely be

405
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,590
the representative of our school

406
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,710
Yes

407
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,590
Mengyu will definitely be

408
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,470
the representative of our school

409
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,590
Stop it, you guys

410
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,990
I'm getting nervous now

411
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,310
Don't be nervous

412
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,390
What are you doing?

413
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,510
It's not even started yet

414
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,630
You're already the representative?

415
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,550
I don't wanna go either

416
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,070
But they'll all vote for me

417
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,150
I have no choice

418
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,110
That's right

419
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,470
What does it have to do with Mengyu?

420
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,630
Xiaohua

421
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,270
Why haven't you recorded yet?

422
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,350
I haven't decided what to record

423
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,070
Then what should I do?

424
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,030
I don't know anything

425
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,030
I recorded last night

426
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,990
Don't be afraid

427
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,790
I'll help you

428
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:35,630
Let's go

429
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,150
Qingtian

430
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,230
It's okay, I know you

431
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,790
Let's go, Ma Yiming

432
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,390
Hurry up, Ma Yiming

433
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,190
Then, what should I do?

434
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,190
Just do something random

435
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,230
Move

436
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,550
You look too much like a robot

437
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,830
I told you

438
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,110
I don't know anything

439
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,830
Let's dance

440
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,590
Come on, just dance

441
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,910
Move

442
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,470
Sing

443
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,150
Can you sing?

444
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,630
Everyone can sing

445
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:25,870
Come on

446
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,350
I'll count to three

447
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,630
Three, two, one

448
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,430
Or maybe forget it

449
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,110
Just sing casually

450
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,350
There's no one else, right?

451
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,950
No one can hear it

452
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,110
Okay, you can go

453
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,830
Three, two, one

454
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:53,830
Outside the long corridor, along the ancient road

455
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,590
the green grass seemed to connect with the sky

456
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,430
Under the gentle night breeze, swung the willows and resonated the melancholic melody from an old flute

457
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:09,790
whilst the descending sun illuminated mountains by mountain.

458
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:15,110
At the edge of the sky and the corner of the land

459
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:20,230
The friends in hearts have gone their separate ways

460
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:24,430
If only we had a bottle of distilled wine...

461
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,950
I forgot the line

462
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,430
Alright, stop

463
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,190
It's fine, that's enough

464
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,390
Perfect

465
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,190
It's done, Brother Hui

466
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,550
It's done

467
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:35,830
But I still have

468
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,710
something more important to do

469
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:37,430
What is it?

470
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:38,950
Brother Hui

471
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,870
I'm sorry

472
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:51,990
Go

473
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,630
No, give it back to me

474
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,630
It's study time now

475
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,270
I'll get it

476
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,110
No

477
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:05,510
I...

478
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,750
I'll do one more paper tonight

479
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,070
Give it back to me

480
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:09,710
Three papers

481
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,510
Is that too many?

482
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,990
Four

483
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,230
Fine

484
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,790
Just four

485
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,790
Remember to give them to me tomorrow morning

486
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,030
No, Ling Dong

487
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,630
Let's see how you'll manage me then

488
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,470
Dear teachers

489
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,150
Dear classmates

490
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,470
Good morning, everyone

491
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,230
I'm Ling Dong from Class 5 of Grade 2

492
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,830
Today, I bring you

493
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,870
an article about pursuing dreams

494
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,350
The existence of dreams

495
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,590
allows us to grow slowly

496
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,710
Dreams are the dreams of each individual,

497
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,430
not as illusory as dreams

498
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,270
Each dream guides us

499
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,030
to step out of our comfort zone,

500
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,470
shedding our childishness

501
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,270
But it also requires overcoming

502
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,350
many difficulties

503
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,070
The word "pursue"

504
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,350
does not guarantee achieving the goal

505
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,190
The composition

506
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,470
The lighting

507
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,110
The camera movement

508
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,030
Have you finished your homework?

509
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,630
Don't all choose option B this time

510
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,950
Why not option B?

511
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,150
I'm a boy

512
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,630
I like basketball, so I choose B

513
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,030
Where do you wanna go?

514
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,110
No, no, no

515
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,070
Slow down

516
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,830
I can't keep you up

517
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,390
Almost there

518
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,070
To make it easy for you

519
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,790
to participate in the competition

520
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,110
I've really done so much

521
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,710
Qingtian, what are you doing?

522
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,630
You scared me

523
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,950
Ling Dong

524
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:07,830
Ling Dong

525
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,110
What's wrong with Ling Dong?

526
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,190
This is the video he recently posted

527
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,830
He's already in the top ten now

528
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,870
Is this Ling Dong?

529
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,310
Then who else could it be?

530
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,190
I didn't expect that

531
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:20,870
I thought

532
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,710
he was just a cold-faced study god

533
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,910
But never thought

534
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,910
him to be so good at street dancing

535
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,390
But I always feel

536
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,750
something is not quite right

537
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,150
It doesn't seem like him

538
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,870
If it's not him, then who else could it be?

539
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,350
What are you doing?

540
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,590
Vote for him, of course

541
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,790
Don't you wanna watch him compete?

542
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,870
Ling Dong, you dance so well

543
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,990
I'll cheer for you

544
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,190
Ling Dong, I didn't expect

545
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,070
you to be such a good street dancer

546
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,750
I voted for you

547
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,710
Street dance

548
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,870
I think Ling Dong

549
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,630
is really talented

550
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,670
I still like Ling Dong

551
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,510
Ling Dong, congratulations!

552
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,430
Now you're in first place

553
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:30,910
You surpassed me

554
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:31,830
I don't really mind

555
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,030
I really hope you can

556
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,430
represent our school in the competition

557
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,910
If you need any help,

558
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,830
you can find me anytime

559
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,550
After all, I participated last year

560
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,510
So I'm quite experienced

561
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,430
I'm not interested in this kind of thing

562
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:45,830
Anything else?

563
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:48,750
Nothing

564
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,990
Ling Dong, congratulations!

565
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,710
Your editing skills are great

566
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,150
No, it's not

567
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,990
You're not very good at it

568
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,190
Yet I'm quite skilled

569
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,590
Lan Jinghui

570
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:18,910
Don't think I don't know

571
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,590
what you're up to do

572
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,390
What do I wanna do?

573
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,910
What do I wanna do?

574
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,630
Ling Dong, please tell me

575
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,790
what I wanna do

576
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,390
I want...

577
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,270
I advise you

578
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,150
not to waste your time

579
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,270
What do I wanna do?

580
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,590
Ling Dong

581
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,590
What do I wanna do?

582
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,790
Congratulations

583
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,990
Have you all seen the video

584
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,550
of the girl from Class 5 in Grade 2?

585
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,830
It's so funny

586
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,790
Super funny

587
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,190
Really? I haven't seen it yet

588
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,710
Go watch it. I already voted for her

589
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,350
She's already in the top ten

590
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,790
But isn't she a bad singer?

591
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,350
Everyone thinks she's funny

592
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,350
So they voted for her

593
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,470
Seriously,

594
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,790
doing something you're not good at

595
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,750
can be funny

596
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,430
No, I voted for her

597
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,310
I don't find her very funny

598
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,870
I find her quite genuine instead

599
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,230
Although she's not good at it,

600
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,030
the fact that she focuses

601
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,790
on doing something

602
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,070
really touched me

603
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,750
Then I'll also vote for her

604
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:19,990
Xiaohua

605
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,910
Xiaohua, your video

606
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,190
has reached second place

607
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,670
Is it true? Don't scare me

608
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,910
When I saw it,

609
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,630
I was also very excited

610
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,950
Didn't you make a mistake?

611
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,590
How could she surpass me?

612
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,350
Why not?

613
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,750
We're all humans

614
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,470
Are you any better than others?

615
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:39,990
What?

616
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,550
Alright, Qingtian

617
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,430
The fact that I'm in second place

618
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,750
is indeed quite strange

619
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,830
Don't worry

620
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,270
I won't get first place anyway

621
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,270
At least you have some self-awareness

622
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,110
What do you mean self-awareness?

623
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,950
Xia Qingtian

624
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,070
How could you talk to sister Meng like that?

625
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,990
I'm just talking like this

626
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,390
You...

627
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,430
You're impolite

628
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,830
She insulted Xiaohua first

629
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,230
She said something bad on Xiaohua

630
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,110
You can't be impolite

631
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,110
Ma Yiming

632
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,750
How can you talk to classmates like that?

633
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,910
What's wrong with it?

634
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,950
Then you can't talk to

635
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,070
the girls in our class like that

636
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,190
What's wrong with me talking to her?

637
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,070
She can't bully...

638
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,070
Alright, stop arguing

639
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,670
It's just...

640
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,270
Anyway, I won't get first place

641
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,070
They vote for me

642
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,830
Just for fun

643
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,190
Hello

644
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,310
Please vote for Xu Mengyu

645
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,790
Hello, please vote for Xu Mengyu

646
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,710
Please vote for Xu Mengyu

647
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,310
Thank you

648
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,710
Hello, please vote for Xu Mengyu

649
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:42,270
Thank you

650
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,270
Thank you

651
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,630
Please vote for Xu Mengyu

652
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:44,870
Okay

653
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,270
Thank you

654
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:45,990
Hello

655
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,070
Sister Meng

656
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,470
Who asked you to do this?

657
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,030
I just wanna vote for you

658
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,870
I don't need it

659
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,830
Isn't it embarrassing?

660
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,030
You wouldn't understand

661
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,030
Look at you

662
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,030
I finally showed

663
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,910
a little interest in studying

664
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,830
And you were elected

665
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,750
Now you have no time to manage my studies

666
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,310
Then it seems

667
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,550
I do have hindered your progress

668
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,510
No...

669
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,950
But the regret in my heart

670
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,750
is like the surging river

671
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,820
So sad

672
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,270
Sad?

673
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:09,870
Yes, of course

674
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,820
Okay, got it

675
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,670
What did you just say?

676
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,590
Regret like what?

677
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:44,950
What do you mean?

678
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,150
No, what happened?

679
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,870
Brother Hui

680
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,990
What's wrong?

681
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,670
Why are you shouting? I'm not dead

682
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,870
Dear students

683
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,710
A notification for all of you

684
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,750
A notification for all of you

685
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,790
Due to personal reasons

686
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,350
Ling Dong, a student from Class 5 of Grade 2

687
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,910
has withdrawn from the talent show voting

688
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,950
The current ranking will be adjusted

689
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,390
Xiao Xiaohua, who ranked second

690
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,430
is leading in votes

691
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,710
Hello, everyone

692
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:39,830
I'm Xiao Xiaohua from Class 5 of Grade 2

693
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,150
Hi, what are you recording?

694
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,310
Mom, you scared me

695
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,350
I'm recording a video

696
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:49,550
Really?

697
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,550
Don't see it

698
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,350
It's required by the school

699
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,670
I'm here to bring you some fruits

700
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,470
Just leave it

701
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,110
It's okay to take a look

702
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,110
No

703
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,260
Okay

704
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,150
I won't record anymore

705
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,590
Hello, everyone

706
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,070
I'm Chen Luyang

707
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,070
Next is my performance

708
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:28,990
π...

709
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,350
Three point one four

710
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,230
Hello, everyone

711
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,590
I'm Lan Jinghui from Class 2-5

712
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,430
No ideas for the talent show. Thank you
