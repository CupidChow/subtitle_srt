[Holiday related to you]
[Episode 16]

3
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,760
Many people would ask

4
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,120
if we try our best

5
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,320
yet the result is still not perfect

6
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,240
Then why should we still strive?

7
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,080
Someone will tell us

8
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,680
that it is for after it's over

9
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,600
you can honestly say

10
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,080
that I tried my best

11
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,720
I really gave it my all

12
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,920
No matter how much you love

13
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
How much you desire

14
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,520
No matter how much you put in

15
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,760
sweat and effort

16
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,280
Sometimes

17
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,000
dreams still shatter

18
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,640
Youth is imperfect

19
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,640
Tomorrow may not be better

20
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,400
In the end, you may still fail

21
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,360
But you still have to

22
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,320
keep running forward

23
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,680
Because...

24
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,960
That's youth

25
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,520
Morning, Ling Dong

26
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,680
Good morning, Xiaohua

27
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,880
Well...

28
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,000
The basketball match yesterday

29
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
was quite exciting, actually

30
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,440
It's just too bad in the end

31
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,520
It was just one goal short

32
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,200
Who would have thought

33
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,760
that in the last few seconds

34
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,040
He would still score

35
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,920
We were careless

36
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,760
So

37
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
I think you might not

38
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,560
be in a good mood today

39
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,840
As a member of the cheerleading team

40
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,880
I can't be upset even more

41
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,960
So, to help you regain energy

42
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,600
I specially prepared

43
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,840
the breakfast for you

44
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,600
I can't finish so much by myself

45
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,520
This's for Lan Jinghui

46
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,480
Thank you

47
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,520
I think

48
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,440
he might need it more than me

49
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you, Xiaohua

50
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,560
Well...

51
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,400
Let's go to class

52
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,000
Is Brother Hui okay?

53
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,720
I don't know

54
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
He doesn't answer calls

55
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,000
And doesn't reply to messages

56
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,000
It can't be, right?

57
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,960
It's just a game

58
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,880
You don't know how important this game

59
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,200
is to Brother Hui

60
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,360
It's a chance

61
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,320
to join the youth team

62
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,920
Yes

63
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,320
To miss it like this

64
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,480
Then he might never recover

65
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,760
When you go in,

66
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,360
don't say anything

67
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,400
to provoke him

68
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,620
What are you up to do?

69
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,000
Scumbag Hui

70
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,120
This is all your doing

71
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,920
You've changed

72
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,080
Why are you guys so late?

73
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Don't you know

74
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,880
"A year's plan starts with spring"

75
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,200
"A day's plan starts with morning"?

76
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We should choose

77
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,920
to improve and strive

78
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,960
for the quality of our lives

79
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,280
Don't choose comfort

80
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,600
when we should strive

81
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,360
Not even a fever, Brother Hui

82
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,920
Listen to me

83
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,440
In our lifetime,

84
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,480
there are many things

85
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,360
that are mostly unpleasant

86
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,720
We need to look forward

87
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,640
Be good

88
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,680
Yes, Master

89
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,360
Look. I specially prepared

90
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,440
breakfast for you

91
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,920
After you finish eating,

92
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
you'll be full of energy

93
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,880
You know what?

94
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,240
No matter what happens,

95
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,120
we'll always be by your side

96
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,800
supporting you

97
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,800
Brother Hui

98
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,760
Brother Hui

99
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,880
Are you okay?

100
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,360
Yes, Lan Jinghui, are you okay?

101
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,160
Brother Hui

102
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,760
Let's go to your house to play games tonight

103
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,600
Is that okay?

104
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,960
I still have many levels to pass

105
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,880
It's not a time to play game?

106
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,360
Final exams are coming soon

107
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,680
I need to study

108
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,960
I have always been known as

109
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,560
the shining star of Chenjun

110
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,520
Are you showing off to me

111
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,360
that you all got them right?

112
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,440
Look at this

113
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,400
I got it wrong

114
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,040
And it's

115
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,000
a very basic mistake

116
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,200
So?

117
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,440
Even someone like me,

118
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,360
who is a top student,

119
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,040
can make mistakes

120
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,280
Everyone is the same

121
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,560
You are the same

122
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,800
What do you mean?

123
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,960
Homework

124
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,040
Yesterday's homework

125
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,560
In that situation yesterday,

126
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
who had the mood to do homework?

127
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:58,960
Yes...

128
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,880
Okay

129
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,600
I'll make up for it

130
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,080
I'll do it now

131
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,680
Class begins

132
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,560
Stand up

133
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,000
Good morning, teacher

134
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,560
Good morning, class. Sit down please

135
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,480
Everyone knows

136
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,720
our basketball game is over

137
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,640
Unfortunately,

138
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,800
we lost to class 8

139
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,200
But...

140
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,640
Our game against Class 8

141
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,680
is not over yet

142
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,360
Final exams are coming soon

143
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,800
Do you still want

144
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,760
to lose to Class 8 again?

145
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,480
No

146
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,000
Good

147
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,640
I have prepared

148
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,320
three sets of test papers

149
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Everyone, listen to me

150
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
In the last midterm exam,

151
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,440
Lan Jinghui made great progress

152
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,920
It means that the study group is effective

153
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,520
So, I suggest that you

154
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,520
form study groups on your own

155
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,320
You can supervise each other

156
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,560
Help each other, progress together

157
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:57,920
Okay?

158
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,800
Okay

159
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,120
Teacher

160
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,920
Can we form our own group?

161
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,640
Yes, you can

162
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,520
Form your own groups

163
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,360
Qingtian

164
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,080
Me, you

165
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
And Xiaohua

166
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,960
Let's form a study group together

167
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,000
I can tutor you

168
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,440
That's impossible

169
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,320
Xiaohua wants to be with Ling Dong

170
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,520
Ma Yiming

171
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,440
Do you wanna join us

172
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,400
and form a study group?

173
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,360
Nope

174
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,680
I wanna be in a group with sister Meng

175
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,760
Qingtian

176
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,720
Let me tell you

177
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,280
Actually, a group of two

178
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,800
is the most suitable

179
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,720
It's the most efficient

180
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,480
Really?

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,520
Let's eat first

182
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,600
Okay

183
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,280
Are you done eating?

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,520
Yes

185
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,000
Let's go

186
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,120
Okay

187
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,000
-Xiao Xiaohua -Xiaohua

188
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
-Chicken leg for you -Take it

189
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,760
What's this for?

190
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,720
We wanna be

191
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,680
in a study group with you

192
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,400
Yes, join us

193
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,800
We'll give you a chicken leg every day

194
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,480
No, thanks. I...

195
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,240
Come on, there's meat

196
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,640
Just eat it

197
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,160
Here, take this. And this is for you too

198
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,080
Here, take this

199
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,560
Your meat

200
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,200
Look, this meat is for you

201
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,840
Thank you

202
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,640
Xiaohua said

203
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,760
she wanted to be in a group with us

204
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,320
Lan Jinghui

205
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,480
These chicken legs are for Xiaohua

206
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,480
Why do you eat it?

207
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,920
She can't eat so many chicken legs

208
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,240
No, why do you

209
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
decide for Xiaohua?

210
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,440
She hasn't even said anything yet

211
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,160
Exactly

212
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,640
Xiaohua, what do you say?

213
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,120
Xiaohua, here

214
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,280
Who do you wanna be in a group with?

215
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,320
I wanna be with Ling Dong

216
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,720
and Lan Jinghui

217
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,480
Did you hear that?

218
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,600
She herself said

219
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
that she wants to be in a group with us

220
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,160
Just go, quickly

221
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,400
Give it back to me

222
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,960
Eat it yourself

223
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,160
After school,

224
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,240
come to the self-study room on time

225
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,320
Okay, I'll definitely be on time

226
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,800
Then...

227
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,640
Congratulations to

228
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
our study group...

229
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,880
Officially

230
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,760
Begins

231
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,320
Qingtian

232
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,560
This is the first time I've seen you

233
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,840
taking a test so seriously

234
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,240
It's all because of that Chen Luyang

235
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,400
He comes up with some reward systems

236
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,360
If I can do it well

237
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,680
he'll buy me lots of snacks

238
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,960
You know it too

239
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
How can I resist

240
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,600
the temptation of good food?

241
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,800
Is that right, Doudou?

242
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,600
I've noticed that the monitor treats you

243
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,160
differently, huh?

244
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,560
How is that possible?

245
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,720
I think he's just trying to save face

246
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,240
If he tutors me

247
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,800
and it's not as effective as

248
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,640
Ling Dong tutoring you,

249
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,160
then he'll be embarrassed

250
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
So, am I

251
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,000
making concessions to you

252
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,960
just to save his face?

253
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,600
Where do you get your confidence?

254
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,840
Let me tell you

255
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,160
I've been very effective in doing exercises lately,

256
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,120
I'm very focused

257
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,120
But Xiaohua

258
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,920
I've noticed

259
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,040
something different about you lately

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,440
How am I different?

261
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,280
Let's take this

262
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,720
study group as an example

263
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
You actually refused Lu Yao

264
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,880
If this were before,

265
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,640
you'd definitely say yes

266
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,280
You're no longer the

267
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,280
sticky note girl you used to be

268
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,640
So, what do you think?

269
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,240
Will I become better?

270
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,360
Definitely

271
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,520
You're in the same study group

272
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,480
as Ling Dong

273
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,460
And even Lan Jinghui

274
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,800
has improved so quickly

275
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,200
There's nothing you can't do

276
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,520
I'm not as excellent

277
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,320
as Ling Dong,

278
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,720
at least I can

279
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,640
follow him

280
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,520
and get closer to him little by little

281
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,320
You can do it

282
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,260
Let's keep going

283
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,880
Coffee time

284
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,640
Enough for everyone

285
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,160
This is the last in-class quiz

286
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,760
before the final exam

287
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,360
If there's anything you don't know

288
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,000
feel free to ask me after class

289
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,440
The final exam is tomorrow

290
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,480
Just be confident and determined

291
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,080
It's time to show

292
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,320
my true capabilities

293
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,760
The rankings are out

294
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,640
The rankings are out

295
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,520
How's it going?

296
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,720
Did you check for us?

297
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,640
Of course

298
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,400
Ling Dong got first place

299
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,480
Don't waste time with useless words

300
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,320
Say something useful

301
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,680
Xiaohua did well this time

302
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,360
She improved a lot

303
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,080
Really?

304
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,960
That's great

305
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:32,800
Oh no...

306
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,440
Usually Brother Hui

307
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,280
is even worse than Xiaohua

308
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,680
How did Brother Hui do?

309
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,720
You've improved 198 places

310
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,480
Are you kidding me?

311
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,960
Ling Dong, how did you know?

312
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,680
Brother Hui really improved

313
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,760
198 places

314
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,320
Really?

315
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,000
Really

316
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,800
You didn't lie to me

317
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,200
198?

318
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,280
No, why?

319
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,680
Give me...

320
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,520
Give me a reason

321
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,080
No, why?

322
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,400
He didn't lie to you

323
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,680
Ling Dong wrote the list

324
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,200
Amazing

325
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,240
You're quite good at keeping secrets

326
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,600
That's what makes it more surprising

327
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,120
It almost turned into shock

328
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,920
Class

329
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,640
Don't get too excited too soon

330
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,040
This final exam

331
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,680
Our class

332
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,320
finally surpassed Class 8

333
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,960
We got first place in the whole grade

334
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,240
Okay, stop

335
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,160
Class begins

336
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,000
Stand up

337
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,640
Hello, teacher

338
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,960
Hello, class

339
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,000
Sit down please

340
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,320
Thank you

341
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Ling Dong

342
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,040
No need to thank me

343
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,680
I admit

344
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,440
I lost

345
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,240
Everyone has unlimited potential

346
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,880
Don't judge a person

347
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,720
based on stereotypes

348
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,720
But...

349
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,280
I won't take back

350
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,000
what I said that day

351
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,240
He did improve this time

352
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,080
And he improved a lot

353
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,000
But can you guarantee

354
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,240
that he'll never affect you?

355
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,080
I can't guarantee that

356
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,560
But what does that have to do with you?

357
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:38,820
Yes

358
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,720
For me, it's also a good thing

359
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,600
Just like you said,

360
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,840
people have unlimited potential

361
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,160
One day, I will

362
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
surpass you and become first

363
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,420
Just wait and see

364
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,120
Sure

365
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,840
I'll be waiting

366
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,240
Class

367
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,720
Winter vacation starts tomorrow

368
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,880
I'll give you a heads up

369
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,040
Do not miss

370
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,080
the winter vacation homework

371
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,840
Don't play around

372
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,200
And finally, let me emphasize again,

373
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,180
the things to pay attention to

374
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,180
during winter vacation

375
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,840
Okay, stop

376
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,400
That's it all for today's class

377
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,120
See you next semester

378
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,120
See you next semester

379
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,920
I'll go wash the mop first

380
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,560
Qingtian

381
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
You did a very good job

382
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,320
in the final exam

383
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,800
Thanks to you helping me

384
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,600
Otherwise,

385
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,660
I wouldn't have done so well

386
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,320
I don't know how to thank you

387
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,880
Very simple

388
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Treat me to a meal

389
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,320
Okay

390
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
What do you wanna eat?

391
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
I've been studying too hard lately

392
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,720
I need to take a break

393
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,200
Great!

394
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,840
Let's go to

395
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,160
the newly opened barbecue restaurant

396
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,440
That's exactly where I wanna go today

397
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,000
Okay

398
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,920
20

399
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,520
Uncle Wang gets more

400
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,880
So cute

401
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,080
Polar bear

402
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,200
Penguin

403
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,680
I like that deer

404
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,000
I like the polar bear

405
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,480
It looks like you, Ma Yiming

406
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,440
That one looks like you

407
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:16,920
Can't you see that?

408
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,680
Skiing

409
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,400
What? Can't you do it?

410
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,840
Who said that?

411
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,320
I'm good at everything

412
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,360
Of course I can ski

413
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,680
Let's get our equipment

414
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,160
I'll show you

415
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,360
Let's go

416
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,800
Ma Yiming, what are you doing?

417
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,920
Don't you wanna take photos?

418
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,640
We only have ten sheets of film

419
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,840
I don't want her to take my photo

420
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,360
Take it now

421
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,120
Let's go

422
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,480
One less photo if you take one

423
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,000
It's fine

424
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,840
When the time is right, take the photo

425
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,960
Aim at Ling Dong and snap

426
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,400
Let's go

427
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,480
Xiaohua

428
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,920
Your shoelace loosened

429
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,040
Let me tie it for you

430
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,040
Be careful

431
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,680
Ling Dong

432
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,560
Your shoelace is untied

433
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,320
Why did you help her?

434
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,880
She's my disciple

435
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,520
Leave it to me

436
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,000
Can you do it?

437
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,480
Come on, take a break

438
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,360
I'll do it myself

439
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,840
Sit down

440
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,520
No need

441
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,040
Your shoelace loosened

442
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,680
Get away from me

443
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,520
Get away from me

444
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,240
Get away from me

445
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,360
Get away from me

446
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,840
Why don't you go?

447
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,160
Why don't you go away?

448
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,040
-Get away -Why don't you go away?

449
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,480
Look at your teeth

450
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,920
Brother Hui, I'm leaving first

451
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,080
Ma Yiming

452
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm leaving too

453
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,160
Wait for me

454
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,920
Can you two...

455
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,520
Still do it?

456
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,280
Of course, I can

457
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,440
Lower yourself down

458
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,160
Squat a bit more

459
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,160
No, why are you so clumsy?

460
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,840
It looks about right like this

461
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,720
Can you do it?

462
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,880
Mind your own business

463
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,160
I just need to be better than you

464
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,360
Wait for me, you two

465
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,480
Hold this

466
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,880
Wait for me, I'll be right back

467
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,640
Here

468
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,040
This is completely not in line with

469
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,040
Lan Jinghui's temperament

470
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,720
Take this

471
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,360
Doesn't this look like yours?

472
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,120
Thank you

473
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,320
I just saw others with it

474
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,960
You should have it too

475
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,720
Put it on quickly

476
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,520
Let's go

477
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,440
Lan Jinghui, hurry up and put it on

478
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,920
Are you ready, decathlon?

479
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,640
Not ready yet

480
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,400
Ready now

481
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,480
By the way,

482
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,760
you must remember

483
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,680
to pay attention to your center of gravity

484
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,520
Got it

485
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,120
Then I'll go first

486
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,280
Are you really going down?

487
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,480
Apprentice

488
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,840
Are you scared?

489
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,680
I...I'm scared

490
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,400
Master, what about you?

491
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:41,920
I'm scared too

492
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,720
Ling Dong, Lan Jinghui said he's scared

493
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,040
Who said that?

494
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,280
I'm good at everything, okay?

495
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,880
Is it fun?

496
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,880
It's so much fun

497
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,400
Apprentice

498
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,360
I wanna play another round

499
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,320
Let's go

500
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,360
Ma Yiming, you...

501
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,880
Why is it Ma Yiming again?

502
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,720
Pay attention to your center of gravity

503
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,000
Center of gravity

504
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,080
Move aside

505
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,480
Lan Jinghui

506
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,040
Lan Jinghui

507
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,840
Are you okay?

508
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,080
Are you okay?

509
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,560
My waist

510
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,480
What's wrong with your waist?

511
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,080
What's wrong with your waist?

512
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,840
It hurts, right?

513
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,160
Take your time

514
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,720
Take your time

515
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,200
Here

516
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,480
Right here

517
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,360
What's wrong with here?

518
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,840
Does it hurt here?

519
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,960
It's that kind of...

520
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,160
Look

521
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,280
How's it...

522
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,480
Lan Jinghui

523
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,440
Ma Yiming

524
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,200
Lan Jinghui

525
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,400
Ma Yiming

526
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,640
I'm sorry

527
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,040
Ms. Fang

528
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,960
Qingtian

529
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,200
What are you doing here?

530
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,040
Ms. Fang

531
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,040
Ma Yiming

532
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Are you guys also here to ski?

533
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,360
Yes, me and Qingtian

534
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,880
Lan Jinghui

535
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,040
Ling Dong, Xiao Xiaohua

536
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,920
We came together

537
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,480
Why is it just the two of you?

538
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,040
What about the other three?

539
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,280
They're playing over there

540
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,760
How's your skiing going?

541
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,560
It's okay

542
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,320
It's okay

543
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:50,920
Ms. Fang

544
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,240
Is this your boyfriend?

545
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,680
Boyfriend?

546
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,680
This is...

547
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,360
He's my friend

548
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,800
Then we won't bother you

549
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,560
Okay

550
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,440
We'll go have fun now

551
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,120
Alright

552
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,240
We're leaving, bye

553
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,800
Bye

554
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,680
Be safe and have fun

555
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,600
Let's go, friend

556
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,120
Let's go

557
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,120
Bye

558
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:15,880
Why is he hiding?

559
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,600
Take off your glasses

560
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,560
I'd better not do it

561
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,400
Why not?

562
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,200
Ma Yiming

563
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Ma Yiming

564
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,920
Monitor, why are you here?

565
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,520
I'm here to ski

566
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,640
Did you just arrive?

567
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,000
What a coincidence, you're here too

568
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,680
Do you know how to ski?

569
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:39,960
Not really

570
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,600
Then let's go, I'll teach you

571
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
It's mutual help after all

572
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,240
You're teaching me?

573
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,160
Alright, let's go

574
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:46,560
Let's go

575
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:54,960
Ling Dong

576
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:55,960
Lan Jinghui

577
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,560
Let's take a photo together

578
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:57,920
Sure

579
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:58,720
Brother Hui

580
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,880
I just saw Ms. Fang

581
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,720
with her boyfriend

582
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,840
Wait a bit

583
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,360
They'll probably come over soon

584
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,400
Why are you so nosy?

585
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,160
Do you have to meddle in her vacation too?

586
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,560
I just happened to run into them

587
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,000
Didn't I?

588
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:14,840
I didn't mean that...

589
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,760
Hello, Ms. Fang

590
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,880
Hello, Ms. Fang

591
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,000
Come on, just stop this trick

592
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,560
Buddies

593
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,280
Don't act like three idiots, okay?

594
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,840
Alright?

595
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,560
Hello, idiot

596
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,400
Idiot

597
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,280
Ms. Fang

598
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,720
Where's your boyfriend?

599
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,520
What boyfriend?

600
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,240
I finally got a vacation

601
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,520
and ran into you guys

602
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,200
He...

603
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,800
He's just a normal friend of mine

604
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,400
Normal friend

605
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:47,920
Alright, enough

606
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,800
So

607
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,960
Are you taking a photo?

608
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,760
Yes

609
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,840
Here, let me take it for you

610
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,280
Okay, thank you, Ms. Fang

611
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,240
I'll count to three

612
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,160
You'll say "cheese," okay?

613
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:00,760
Alright

614
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,280
Here we go

615
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,000
One, two, three

616
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,240
Cheese

617
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,120
It's okay

618
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,120
Thank you, teacher

619
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,800
Thank you, Ms. Fang

620
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,960
Crispy on the outside

621
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,000
Juicy inside

622
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,600
Just the way I like it

623
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,600
Glad you like it

624
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,480
Xiaohua

625
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,080
Chen Luyang

626
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,720
What are you doing here?

627
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,320
The ski resort

628
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,560
is not owned by your family

629
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,720
Why can't I be here?

630
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,000
It just happens to be crowded now

631
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,960
We can eat together later

632
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,320
Sure

633
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm starving

634
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,440
Let's go

635
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,320
Let's go find Uncle Lan

636
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,120
Wait a minute

637
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,920
Uncle Lan

638
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,080
No, he...

639
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,760
Maybe Ma Yiming wants to say

640
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,240
Well, it's just...

641
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Does that person look like your dad?

642
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,400
Does he look like him?

643
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,800
No, he doesn't look like him

644
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,000
That's him

645
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,440
It's quite cold here

646
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,960
Yeah, it is

647
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,200
Son, are you cold?

648
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,360
Are you having fun?

649
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,440
Are you tired from playing?

650
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,920
I've made a reservation

651
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
in the restaurant over there

652
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,080
Let's go eat

653
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,640
Let's go eat

654
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,040
I'm starving

655
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Let's eat together

656
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,160
Let's go. We're all starving

657
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:39,880
Let's go

658
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,880
Let's change clothes

659
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,520
Let's eat

660
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,720
Don't just stand there

661
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,280
Eat quickly

662
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,320
The dishes will get cold soon

663
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,440
Don't be polite

664
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,040
Eat

665
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,680
Thank you, Uncle

666
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,480
Thank you for what?

667
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,240
If you wanna eat anything else

668
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,560
Tell me

669
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,720
I'll get it for you

670
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,720
Don't hesitate to ask him

671
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,240
Look at you all

672
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,920
You're Xiaohui's best friends

673
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm sure Xiaohui

674
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,000
has caused you a lot of trouble

675
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:04,760
Here

676
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,760
Thank you

677
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,200
Come on, let's have a toast

678
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:07,640
Cheers

679
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,440
Cheers

680
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,760
Especially Ling Dong

681
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,280
Xiaohui did so well on the final exams

682
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,520
It's all thanks to you

683
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,880
No, Uncle

684
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,520
He worked hard himself

685
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,440
Actually, I didn't do much

686
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,920
Alright, stop talking nonsense

687
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,600
Hurry up and eat

688
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,200
Come on, eat quickly

689
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,160
By the way

690
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,880
I just wanna ask you

691
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,320
You're about to enter your senior year

692
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,360
What are your plans for the future?

693
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,760
I wanna be a professional basketball player

694
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,480
Impressive

695
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,360
I wanna be a food blogger

696
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
Try all the delicious food in the world

697
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,520
That's nice

698
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,560
I wanna study computer science at PKU

699
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,080
I wanna be a programmer

700
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,240
That's challenging and stressed

701
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,800
Really?

702
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,280
Should I change my major then?

703
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,080
You'll have to wear a wig

704
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:03,800
Ling Dong

705
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,600
Do you also

706
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,520
wanna go to the PKU?

707
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,440
But I wanna study in the Physics

708
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,320
Physics Department in PKU

709
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,360
I heard the admission requirements are quite high

710
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,160
Keep up the good work

711
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:16,840
Thank you, Uncle

712
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,120
I envy you so much

713
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,360
You can choose whatever you wanna study

714
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,000
What about you, Xiaohua?

715
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,960
Me?

716
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,240
I haven't decided yet

717
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,520
I think Xiaohui hasn't decided either

718
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,560
But I've already decided for you

719
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,640
I've arranged

720
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,800
a school for you overseas

721
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,600
It's a really good one

722
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,000
Everything has been arranged for you

723
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:40,960
I even found you

724
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,640
an IELTS teacher

725
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,680
During winter break

726
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,760
brush up on your English

727
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,640
So you'll be prepared to

728
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,720
study abroad next semester

729
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,760
No, Dad...

730
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,200
It's all arranged

731
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,280
Why didn't you ask for my opinion?

732
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:55,800
No

733
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,240
Before

734
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,320
didn't we always listen to your opinion?

735
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,160
Look

736
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,720
I transferred you

737
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,680
to Chenjun based on your opinion

738
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,080
But you didn't make any progress

739
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,840
in basketball

740
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,840
So now

741
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,280
Studying abroad

742
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
is the best arrangement for you

743
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,920
But I don't wanna go abroad

744
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,800
What do you wanna do

745
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,040
if you don't study abroad

746
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,240
I...

747
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,720
I also wanna go to the PKU

748
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,960
When Lan Jinghui said

749
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,240
he wanted to go to the PKU

750
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,280
we were all surprised

751
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,440
We didn't know if he was just saying it casually

752
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,960
or if he had really planned it for a long time

753
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,920
Perhaps it had always been

754
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,760
a dream that he didn't

755
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,160
have the courage to voice

756
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,760
deep in his heart

757
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm already here

758
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:00,760
Yes

759
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,360
I haven't seen any of you

760
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,120
Yeah

761
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:09,560
Hello

762
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,040
Hello

763
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,680
Where are you taking me?

764
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,280
Don't speak

765
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,960
You'll find out when we get there

766
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,240
This is kidnapping

767
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,840
Skiing, huh
