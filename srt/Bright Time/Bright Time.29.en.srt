00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,200
Disciple

5
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,560
You're back

6
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,840
I'm back

7
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,280
Thank you

8
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,480
Thank you

9
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,680
Why do you seem a little unhappy?

10
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,960
Actually, I'm not very happy either

11
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,040
Starting classes so early

12
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,960
It's like the vacation never happened

13
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,800
How can I be happy?

14
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,360
Did someone bully you during training?

15
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,920
Is that?

16
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,120
Who would dare to bully

17
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,960
my disciple?

18
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,240
Tell me

19
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,080
No one did

20
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,120
Why do you look so down?

21
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,280
Like a frostbitten eggplant

22
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,240
Like a frostbitten eggplant

23
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,920
Now I understand

24
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,560
what it means to be outshined

25
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,680
by others

26
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
People more talented than you

27
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,720
are working harder than you

28
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,440
Is that it?

29
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,400
Isn't that important?

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
I don't think I can get into the PKU

31
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,800
Disciple

32
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,760
Hard work will bring you

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,720
good luck

34
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,280
And before you left

35
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,520
you didn't have calluses like this

36
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,280
I'm not that talented

37
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,240
If I don't work hard...

38
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,720
You're already working hard enough

39
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,720
I saw your post on Moments

40
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,920
It was past 3 AM

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,000
You can't possibly be in the studio

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,040
24/7, right?

43
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,520
How much longer until the exam?

44
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,840
About four months

45
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,400
Besides working hard

46
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,600
I don't have any other options

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,640
You still have four months until the exam

48
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
Why are you in such a hurry?

49
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,480
You need to have confidence in yourself, right?

50
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,960
Keep going, you're the best

51
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,400
But I...

52
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Who said that life's paintbrush

53
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,240
should be held in your own hands?

54
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,120
Why are you

55
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,240
giving up at the slightest setback?

56
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,520
I'm not

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,960
Well, then, that's settled

58
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,400
Don't let others influence you

59
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,920
Just be yourself

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,120
You still have us, right?

61
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,800
It's just...

62
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,600
Forget about me now

63
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,480
Who is Ling Dong?

64
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,800
The god in Chenjun

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,120
With him as your backing

66
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,800
they can only envy

67
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,920
what you have

68
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,040
Yes, until the last moment

69
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,440
we don't know who will come out on top

70
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,120
We don't know who will come out on top

71
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,680
Let's go

72
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,200
Let's go

73
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,360
Both of you

74
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,120
are making me worry so much

75
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,400
The shining stars of Chenjun

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,560
are becoming agony aunt

77
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,240
Hey, why are you riding so fast?

78
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,720
Challenging me, huh?

79
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,560
I won't allow anyone to ride faster

80
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,720
than me, Lan Jinghui

81
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,160
Look at them riding so fast

82
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,360
So childish

83
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,760
Jiang Jing, do you miss me?

84
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,600
How was your vacation?

85
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,640
How was your vacation?

86
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,200
The vacation went by too quickly

87
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,760
I didn't even feel it ended

88
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,720
Fast

89
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,600
Too fast

90
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,520
What did you do during your vacation?

91
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,520
Too busy

92
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,920
Happy new semester

93
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,080
Class monitor

94
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,680
Happy new semester

95
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,160
But don't forget

96
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,600
to hand in your summer homework

97
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,920
Okay, here it is

98
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,880
Class monitor, this is my homework

99
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,080
This is for you too

100
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,320
Well, listen

101
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,480
What is the most important thing?

102
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,320
It's confidence

103
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,000
Only when you have confidence

104
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,720
Brother Hui

105
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,880
Brother Hui

106
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,280
Did you watch the match last night?

107
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,280
Yes, I did

108
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,720
Such a god

109
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,480
It was really amazing

110
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,240
I've never seen

111
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,320
such an exciting match before

112
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,040
And let me tell you

113
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,680
LeBron James

114
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,080
almost got a triple-double last night

115
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,880
Ling Dong

116
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,400
These are the letters for you

117
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,320
I brought them for you

118
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:34,960
Thank you

119
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,960
No problem

120
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,000
So many people are writing to you

121
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,640
Xu Mengyu

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,120
No one is writing to you?

123
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,320
Ma Yiming

124
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,720
What's wrong with you today?

125
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,960
Just eat eggs

126
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,320
If you keep doing this,

127
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,480
I'll tell sister Meng

128
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,960
I'm sorry

129
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,520
Didn't you

130
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,280
not read any of the letters?

131
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,520
Have you changed?

132
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,200
Who signed it?

133
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,520
Su Xi

134
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,480
Su Xiaomei

135
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,600
Why didn't she send me a postcard?

136
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,120
Maybe she's not close to you

137
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,520
Come on, I'm her brother

138
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,640
How could she even do this?

139
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,480
She didn't even tell me when she got home

140
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,560
I even prepared

141
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,240
so many local specialties for her

142
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,520
Ungrateful

143
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,600
Hi, class

144
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,760
How's it going?

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,120
Did you have a happy vacation?

146
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,920
Yes, we did

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,600
Great, before we start the class

148
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,840
let me say something

149
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,840
Time flies

150
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,840
In the blink of an eye,

151
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,600
you've entered your senior year

152
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,360
Everyone knows

153
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,400
that senior year is crucial

154
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,400
But actually,

155
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,000
it's not that special

156
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,400
It's just a phase in your life

157
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,080
In your senior year

158
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,120
You don't need to worry too much

159
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,840
But you need to give it your all

160
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,520
No need to sacrifice sleep and meals

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,520
But you need to persevere

162
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,240
Of course

163
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,000
You can also choose to give up

164
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,200
Just like most people

165
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,640
They can just say

166
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,160
It doesn't matter

167
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,320
After all,

168
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,080
life still goes on

169
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,920
But the sweat on your face

170
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,880
And the tears in your eyes

171
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,160
You still have to choose one, right?

172
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,560
Whether to pursue immediate ease

173
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,400
Or the poetic in the distance

174
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,880
This is your choice now

175
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,480
Alright

176
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,880
Class begins

177
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,640
Stand up

178
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Morning, teacher

179
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,960
Alright, class

180
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,600
Before class ends, I have something to say

181
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,960
According to our school's tradition

182
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,880
In order to improve

183
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,440
the study efficiency of the senior students

184
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,080
Starting next week

185
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,960
There will be a weekly

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,320
mock exam

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,760
Followed by

188
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,040
individualized coaching based on

189
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,560
the performance in each subject

190
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,880
Students

191
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
I hope that before the exams

192
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,120
You can review well

193
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,240
Keep it up

194
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,400
Alright, class dismissed

195
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,320
Stand up

196
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,640
Goodbye, teacher

197
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,960
Goodbye, class

198
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,200
Why is it so quiet today?

199
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,840
You didn't even say anything

200
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,720
Is it because after listening to

201
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,360
Ms. Fang's words

202
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,240
you feel a bit of pressure

203
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,320
on the college entrance exam?

204
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,800
Have you ever felt

205
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,840
that there is a sense of

206
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,280
calm before a big battle?

207
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,920
Everyone is getting ready to unleash their full potential

208
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,760
Actually, it's quite exciting

209
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,920
It's something to look forward to

210
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,720
Are you not normal?

211
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,360
I can't understand

212
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,520
the world of academic overachievers

213
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,640
Don't you feel

214
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,120
that a little pressure

215
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
is actually a good thing?

216
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,240
I don't think so

217
00:10:59,520 --> 00:10:59,960
Mom

218
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,640
Mom, you don't even know

219
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,080
Su Xiaomei is too obvious

220
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,320
How could a person like her

221
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,760
complete the task you gave her?

222
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,760
I saw through it at a glance

223
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,640
You already know?

224
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680
Yes, I already know

225
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,280
Next time, find someone more reliable

226
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,840
Otherwise, it can't even be a surprise

227
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,040
And if you wanna secretly take me

228
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
to travel to Singapore

229
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,360
you just steal my passport

230
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,760
Letting her get involved

231
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,960
will expose everything

232
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,880
Furthermore

233
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,800
Aren't you a bit late?

234
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
I've already started school

235
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,760
Although I'm glad that you're here

236
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,160
Yes

237
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,960
I should have come back earlier

238
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,040
William was still young before

239
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
He needed someone to take care of him

240
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,160
I'm also busy with work

241
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,320
That's why I just came back now

242
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,360
By the way, Huihui

243
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,440
Do you still remember William?

244
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,840
He's already six years old this year

245
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,600
He has been saying

246
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,560
that he wanna see his big brother

247
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I remember

248
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,960
When I left

249
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,040
he was still so young

250
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
I really can't imagine

251
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,560
if he still remembers me

252
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,880
Of course, he remembers you

253
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,640
Both of you are my children

254
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,800
Blood is thicker than water

255
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,240
Of course he remembers

256
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,160
a big brother like you

257
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,600
Mom

258
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,840
Let's not talk about this for now

259
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,080
How about you stay a few more days

260
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,120
this time you come back？

261
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,800
I can take you around

262
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,480
And there're so many changes

263
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,640
in Xiangbei City

264
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,720
This time coming back

265
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,400
I feel you've changed the most

266
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,000
Do I?

267
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,920
I remember when you left me

268
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,720
to go back to the country

269
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,400
you were still so tall

270
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,680
Now you're already a grown up

271
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,640
Mom

272
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,560
How about tomorrow

273
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,600
I'll take a day off to accompany you

274
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,960
No need

275
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,920
I'll go back to my hometown tomorrow

276
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,840
to visit Uncle and others

277
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,960
Then

278
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,720
When will you come back

279
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
to see me and Grandma?

280
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,800
When I come back from my hometown

281
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,600
I'll visit your Grandma by then

282
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,320
Okay?

283
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,000
Okay

284
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,320
After coming back

285
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,280
I'll take you to your favorite

286
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,440
restaurant for a meal

287
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,440
It should still be open

288
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,840
Mom

289
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,760
Do you still remember that?

290
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,920
Silly. Of course I remember

291
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,200
Okay

292
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,840
Alright

293
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,360
It's a deal

294
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll take you home first, okay?

295
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,000
Okay

296
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,560
Let's go

297
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,160
Let's go

298
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,400
Get in the car

299
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,160
Hurry

300
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,720
I heard that the school

301
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,760
announced the list of candidates

302
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,960
for the independent enrollment of the PKU

303
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,520
Ling Dong and the class monitor are on it

304
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,560
Why do you sound so upset?

305
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,200
I'm worried about the simulated exams

306
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,920
If that happens, we will be separated

307
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,480
Well, actually

308
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,160
if we perform normally

309
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,880
the chances of being separated are not high

310
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
But Ling Dong will join the sprint class

311
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,240
Yes

312
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,120
In that case

313
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,840
The class monitor will also be separated from us

314
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,400
It's really annoying

315
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,040
Why are they even doing this?

316
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,680
What's the hell?

317
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,640
Why are you looking at me like that?

318
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,160
When did you

319
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
start caring so much about the class monitor?

320
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,600
No, I don't

321
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,440
It's just...

322
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,960
Helping each other as classmates

323
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,880
Really?

324
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,680
Really

325
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,440
Really?

326
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,080
Really. Eat a candy

327
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,200
I don't want it

328
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,880
Xiaohua

329
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,080
Class monitor

330
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,960
How's your interview speech?

331
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,840
What's wrong?

332
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,080
Don't you worry about this?

333
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,840
Come, let me help you with it

334
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,280
After all,

335
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,640
I won the speech competition first place

336
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,360
Really?

337
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,320
Of course

338
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,920
We're all friends

339
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,920
Before, you helped me review for so long

340
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,280
This time, I wanna help you too

341
00:14:59,400 --> 00:14:59,920
That's great

342
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,800
Ling Dong

343
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,880
How's your speech preparation?

344
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,800
It's almost done

345
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,320
Well, Ling Dong

346
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,360
Do you need me

347
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,880
to help with designing slides?

348
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,440
If you need,

349
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,200
I can help you with it

350
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,840
Although I haven't won first place

351
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,600
in slide design

352
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,200
That's fine

353
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,480
I'll find you when I need it

354
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,720
Okay

355
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Monitor, your task is challenging now

356
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,480
Let's go over there to prepare

357
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,840
Don't let them hear us

358
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,520
We won't copy you

359
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,320
Okay?

360
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,800
Do the translation

361
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,520
So many

362
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,880
Consider it

363
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,280
an English-to-Chinese training

364
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,760
You know what?

365
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,120
Translators are expensive

366
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,720
You know what?

367
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,000
Tutoring is also expensive

368
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,600
Let's get to work

369
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,680
Eat it, Mom

370
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,640
Son

371
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,320
You've had a long day at school

372
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,360
Are you tired?

373
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,800
Nope

374
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,240
Mom

375
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,200
Did you not get enough rest?

376
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,760
Maybe I've got used to my bed

377
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,200
It's okay

378
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,640
Okay

379
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Huihui, eat more tomatoes

380
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,120
I remember

381
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
that you used to love eating tomatoes

382
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,320
Mom, I don't eat tomatoes

383
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,440
Don't you remember?

384
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,040
Maybe I got it wrong

385
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,920
It's okay

386
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,080
Then eat something else

387
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,520
Here, have some potato cakes

388
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,600
Kids love them

389
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:01,960
Okay

390
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,840
Mom

391
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,040
Look

392
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,800
Is Xiangbei City

393
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,480
undergoing significant changes now?

394
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,160
That tower,

395
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,160
There used to be no lights like this

396
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,600
Yeah

397
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,160
When you were young,

398
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,840
I used to bring you here to run around

399
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,800
I remember

400
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,360
Maybe back then,

401
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,920
we used to run around here

402
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,800
We ran around too much

403
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,040
Now they've put up pillars,

404
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,720
So I can't even run anymore

405
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:20,960
Huihui

406
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,040
You've been with me these days

407
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,680
Will it affect your studies?

408
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,480
No, it won't

409
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Although I know

410
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,680
my academic performance

411
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,320
used to be a bit lacking,

412
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,680
the situation is different now

413
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,960
I now have a deskmate,

414
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,680
Ling Dong, who's always pushing me

415
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,760
So I've made some progress

416
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,320
And I'm also

417
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,000
a key player in the school's basketball team

418
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
I got a good physical fitness

419
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,880
What's wrong, mom?

420
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,240
Nothing

421
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:49,920
Huihui

422
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,040
You'll be taking the university entrance exam soon

423
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,240
You know,

424
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,080
there are many good universities

425
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,680
in Singapore

426
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,760
Have you ever thought about it?

427
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,060
Mom

428
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,200
I think I know what you mean

429
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,560
But...

430
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,560
I can often go to Singapore

431
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,480
to visit you, right?

432
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,680
And I'm living well here

433
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,200
Most importantly,

434
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
I have a group of friends

435
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,880
Like I just told you

436
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,240
My deskmate, Ling Dong

437
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
His academic performance

438
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,760
is absolutely outstanding

439
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,880
in our school

440
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,840
And he's a good friend

441
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,520
And I've also met a girl

442
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,800
named Xiao Xiaohua

443
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,000
She's a bit silly

444
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,040
But actually,

445
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,040
she's quite adorable

446
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,160
Anyway...

447
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,160
Wait a moment

448
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,320
I got a phone call

449
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,240
Okay, go ahead

450
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,680
Hello?

451
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,600
What?

452
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,000
What's happening with William now?

453
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,000
Okay, I'll come back ASAP

454
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,200
Mom

455
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,960
Regarding what we talked about earlier,

456
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
I need to show you

457
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,160
the video of our talent show

458
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,320
This was during the talent show

459
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,400
The talent show

460
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,960
It was a city-wide competition

461
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,880
This is me

462
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,000
And the rest are my classmates

463
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,560
We formed a band

464
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,400
and played musical instruments

465
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,960
And then

466
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,680
This band is called...

467
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,720
Rooftop Squad

468
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,920
Mainly, it's just...

469
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
You see, you can tell

470
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,640
I'm over here

471
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,760
But my bass

472
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,120
plays a crucial role

473
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,960
Sorry for being late

474
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,840
It's okay

475
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,240
Anyway, I'm used to it

476
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,480
No, how did you...

477
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,600
How did you get used to it?

478
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,520
There was something going on at work

479
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,560
I didn't wanna be late either

480
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,320
Alright, Lan Shangjin

481
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,680
I'm not here

482
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,360
to argue with you

483
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,760
How have you been recently?

484
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,960
I called you here today

485
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,000
Because I need your help with something

486
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,360
What is it?

487
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,800
I want you to talk to Xiaohui

488
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,000
About this...

489
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,320
I

490
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,720
won't stop you from going to see Xiaohui

491
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,840
That's already good enough

492
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
You want me to help convince him

493
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,080
It's impossible

494
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,440
I already went to see

495
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,200
my younger brother and the others

496
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,760
None of their configurations can be matched

497
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,920
Now Xiaohui

498
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,240
is my only hope

499
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,760
Didn't you meet Xiaohui?

500
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,480
What did he say?

501
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,240
I didn't tell him

502
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,240
Yu Lihua

503
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,080
Let me tell you

504
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,480
Neither you nor I

505
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,640
are competent parents

506
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,040
But I am his father

507
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,680
I have to think for him

508
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,720
He has his own dreams now

509
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,360
In this recent period of time

510
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,240
I've also seen his changes

511
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,920
and efforts

512
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,440
Senior year of high school

513
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,880
Every point, every second

514
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,040
is so important to him

515
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,640
You know that?

516
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,600
I know all of this

517
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,960
But now I have

518
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,840
no other choice

519
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,400
So, this matter...

520
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,440
You have to personally talk to him

521
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,800
It can only be up to him

522
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,440
No one has the right to interfere

523
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,760
When I came over just now

524
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,800
I saw a group of candidates

525
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,640
wearing formal attire

526
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,560
They're looking presentable

527
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,120
Ling Dong, we should dress up too

528
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,840
You can't lose

529
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,960
I think so too

530
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,840
Yes

531
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,200
And as the saying goes

532
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,360
The clothes make the man

533
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,200
If you wear formal attire

534
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,000
you'll definitely get into the PKU

535
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,520
No need

536
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,560
I can just wear my school uniform

537
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,600
It's almost the same as a suit

538
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,360
No, you have to have it

539
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,440
Yes

540
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,680
Fine. It's okay

541
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,360
What?

542
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,840
My dad bought me many suits

543
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
But I've never worn them

544
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,960
I always thought that was

545
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,480
what well-behaved students wear

546
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,000
Alright then

547
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,320
I'll take care of it

548
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,160
I'll bring you a set

549
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
But Ling Dong's body shape

550
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,880
seems to be different from yours

551
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,480
Are you sure he can wear it?

552
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,840
It's close enough

553
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,120
He can definitely wear it

554
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:52,960
How about this?

555
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,200
Tomorrow is the weekend

556
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,520
I'll deliver it to your house

557
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,200
You can try it on first

558
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,960
I won't wear it. It's too much trouble

559
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,000
What's the trouble?

560
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,920
It's settled then

561
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,840
I have something to do. I'll leave first

562
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,960
Brother Hui, are you leaving now?

563
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,720
What about self-study tonight?

564
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,360
My mom is coming

565
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:07,880
We made plans

566
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,280
I'll take my mom to eat hot pot

567
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,800
You guys talk first. I'll leave

568
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:11,960
Don't bring it for me

569
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,480
I won't wear it

570
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,040
Who cares?

571
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,160
I'm leaving. Bye

572
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,120
Bye

573
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,000
I won't wear it

574
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,480
Monitor, do you have formal wear?

575
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,400
Yes, I do

576
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,440
But...

577
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,040
My clothes

578
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,400
seem to be the wrong size

579
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,600
If you have time,

580
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,520
would you accompany me to buy a new set?

581
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,240
Sure

582
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Tomorrow is the weekend

583
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,920
Let's go tomorrow

584
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,840
Okay

585
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,760
Thank you, Qingtian

586
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,520
You're welcome

587
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,800
You all help Ling Dong

588
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,160
Well, it's for the fair competition

589
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,760
Even the class monitor needs it

590
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,120
Don't go with us tomorrow

591
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,400
So concerned about the class monitor

592
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,600
And you said there's nothing going on

593
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,400
You won't let me follow either

594
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,480
There's a saying that goes

595
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,720
"Fire, theft, and best friends"

596
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,120
And Xiao Xiaohua

597
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,320
What nonsense are you talking?

598
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,480
Just go on with your homework

599
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,840
Come on, continue

600
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,040
Just now, about this third question,

601
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,320
We've actually discussed this kind of problem before

602
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,640
Hello?

603
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,680
Hello?

604
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,080
Mom, it's me

605
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,760
Yes

606
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,600
You can wait for me at the store

607
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,280
Okay

608
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,160
Okay

609
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,160
Okay

610
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,320
I'm leaving now

611
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,240
I'll be there soon

612
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,680
I don't agree

613
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,000
This kind of thing

614
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,280
If Xiaohui really goes to Singapore,

615
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,600
can he still come back?

616
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,640
I'm already aged

617
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,320
I can't let my grandson

618
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,160
suffer like this

619
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,280
Mom, it's not as serious as you think

620
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,200
I don't want Xiaohui to go either

621
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,880
But it's a life after all

622
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,160
Look

623
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,280
Xiaohui and William are

624
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,240
half-brothers from different mothers

625
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,640
They are a perfect bone marrow match

626
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,000
with the highest success rate

627
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,800
That's not just any place

628
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,080
That's bone marrow

629
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,120
I feel bad

630
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,000
when I think about Xiaohui having surgery

631
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
What if there are any complications

632
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,280
How can I still be alive?

633
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,160
He hasn't gone yet

634
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:33,960
And besides

635
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,520
He may not be matched even if he goes

636
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,480
Yu Lihua came back this time

637
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,720
How happy Xiaohui is

638
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,000
When I think back to the past

639
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,320
she said she would take Xiaohui abroad

640
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,480
She really went abroad

641
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,080
But then?

642
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,360
She sent Xiaohui back alone

643
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,240
I don't know how much

644
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,800
Xiaohui suffered abroad

645
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,320
For so many years,

646
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,080
she never came back to see Xiaohui

647
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,960
Now she needs us

648
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,800
She needs us now

649
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,000
And she found us again

650
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,680
Now it's a critical moment

651
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,120
for Xiaohui's studies

652
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,560
Shangjin

653
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,120
No matter what you think

654
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,480
I definitely won't agree

655
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,400
Your brother William

656
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,000
has been diagnosed with leukemia

657
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,560
He needs a bone marrow transplant

658
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,240
Everyone who is blood-related to him

659
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,280
has been tested

660
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,840
But there is no match

661
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,680
Now all your mother's hope

662
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,680
is on you alone

663
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,600
Huihui, I'm sorry

664
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,200
I know I'm too selfish

665
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,760
Mom

666
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,880
I know what you're gonna say

667
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,520
I'll go back to Singapore with you

668
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:41,920
Huihui

669
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,720
If you don't wanna go

670
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,840
No one can force you

671
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,560
But it's a surgery

672
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,240
Grandma, it's okay

673
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,640
William is my brother

674
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,840
Even if my mom didn't ask me

675
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,560
I would still go

676
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,200
So don't worry

677
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,600
Mom, when are we leaving?

678
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,320
I'll pack my bags

679
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,400
William is not good now

680
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,080
The sooner, the better

681
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,360
Okay

682
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,040
Then let's leave the day after tomorrow

683
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,920
Tomorrow

684
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,560
I have something else to do

685
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,680
Because I know that the PKU

686
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,280
Hello, what's wrong?

687
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,160
Well...

688
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,120
I'm downstairs at your place

689
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,040
Are you home?

690
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,200
I came to deliver your suit

691
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,160
I told you I don't need it

692
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,200
I really don't need it

693
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,320
And I'm not home right now

694
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,360
I'm waiting for Director Zhang and the others

695
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,520
for a mock interview

696
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,360
I'm busy on Monday

697
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,400
Is your mom at home?

698
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,880
My mom...

699
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,080
Alright then

700
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:20,960
That's it

701
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
I'll just take you in directly

702
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:22,840
Okay

703
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,560
Actually, I have something else

704
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,200
What is it?

705
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,640
Ling Dong, it's your turn

706
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,880
If there's something else,

707
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,600
let's talk about it later

708
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,360
It's my turn

709
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,320
Okay

710
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,040
Well

711
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,440
I'll wait for you to come back and tell you in person

712
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,560
So formal

713
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,240
What is it, exactly?

714
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,440
You'll find out when you come back

715
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,920
That's it

716
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,920
Who's that? Coming

717
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
Xiaohui, you're here

718
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,040
Come in

719
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,800
Come in

720
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,520
Okay

721
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,720
Little monster

722
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Does this look like you?

723
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,600
This one looks like you

724
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,040
Let's go to space together

725
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
to travel, okay?

726
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,680
I promise

727
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,040
to always be your good friend

728
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
Come on, you promise too

729
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,760
Why does Ling Dong have this painting?

730
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,600
My dad and mom are fighting again

731
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,760
She said she wants to take me away

732
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,760
So, will we

733
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,920
never see each other again?

734
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,120
I don't wanna leave

735
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,640
If your mom insists on taking you away,

736
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,280
what will you do?

737
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,320
I can hide

738
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,240
Where?

739
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,040
Hide here

740
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,640
This is our secret base

741
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,800
No one can find me

742
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,120
I'll come out when my mom leaves

743
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,760
Okay

744
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,760
But you have to keep my secret

745
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Don't tell anyone

746
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,920
Pinky swear

747
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,400
Huihui

748
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,440
Xiaohui

749
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,480
Xiaohui, Huihui

750
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,920
Xiaohui

751
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,640
Xiaohui

752
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,680
Xiaohui, Huihui

753
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,320
Xiaohui

754
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,200
Xiaohui, Huihui

755
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,040
Xiaohui

756
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,880
Xiaohui

757
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,560
Big liar

758
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,040
Come on, good

759
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,760
Straighten up, adjust your state

760
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,040
Relieve your emotions a bit

761
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,960
Lower your chin a bit

762
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,840
Tug on the inside of your shirt

763
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,320
Tug it

764
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,760
Okay

765
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,480
No, not too much

766
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:37,880
Alright

767
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,560
Get ready

768
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,920
Three, two, one

769
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,600
Name?

770
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,480
I think there's no need for this

771
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,800
Why?

772
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,200
It's the interview

773
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,600
Only by trying can we find out the problems

774
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,800
Right, apprentice?

775
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,720
I think it makes sense

Ling Dong

778
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,200
Any strengths?

779
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,200
No weaknesses

780
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,240
You wanna go with this style, right?

781
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,920
Alright, got it

782
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,760
Compliment your deskmate

783
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,160
Try to use more fancy words

784
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,960
Lan Jinghui, stop joking around

785
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,240
It's just a joke, come on

786
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,920
Let me take a look

787
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,160
I've already organized it for you

788
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,880
Summary of interview questions

789
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,680
during the independent enrollment

790
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,560
and the answering techniques

791
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,640
So, next

792
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,280
I will select a few

793
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,960
challenging questions

794
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
to test you properly

795
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
Are you ready?
