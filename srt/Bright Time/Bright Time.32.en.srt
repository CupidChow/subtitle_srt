[When Time First Met Youth.]
[Episode 32]

3
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,080
Xiaohui, have you eaten enough?

4
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,400
Yes

5
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,320
And also...

6
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Don't get nervous for the exam

7
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,800
And also,

8
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,200
Oh yeah, your ID card

9
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,040
Did you bring your admission ticket?

10
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, I brought it

11
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,080
You've asked me so many times

12
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,040
all this morning

13
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,880
Why don't you ask me

14
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,840
if I brought my brain?

15
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,920
Did you bring it?

16
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,560
Yes, I did

17
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,480
Alright, Mom

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,720
You can relax now

19
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,680
It's almost time

20
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm afraid it'll get stuck in traffic

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,280
We'll leave early

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,400
Okay, fine

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,480
Alright, Grandma, we're leaving

24
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,800
Don't worry, Grandma

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,400
Alright

27
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,320
Okay

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,760
Good luck

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,240
Good luck

30
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,840
Bye

31
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,480
Bye

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
The first bowl of rice cake sold

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,680
in the first rice cake shop

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,680
in Laoma Street

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,560
You'll definitely get into high school

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,040
The first bowl

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,320
Mom, is that so much?

38
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,320
Your mom woke up at five in the morning

39
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,400
and went out to buy it

40
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,000
You must eat it

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,480
Okay

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,640
It's a bit hot

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,000
Let me try it too

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,680
Good luck all for her

45
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,160
Just her eating it alone

46
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
I can't finish it

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,840
You have to eat it

48
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,640
Dad

49
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,880
I'll go in first

50
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,240
Son

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,200
Do your best in the exam

52
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,840
Manage your time well

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
and carefully read the questions

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,360
Got it

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,480
Son

56
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,600
Good luck

57
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,680
I believe in you

58
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,200
Got it

59
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,360
Don't worry, Dad

60
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,800
Bye

61
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,560
Read the questions, don't rush

62
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,680
Got it, Mom

63
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,880
Uncle Lan

64
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,480
Dongdong, sister-in-law

65
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,040
Go in quickly

66
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,480
Study well, Dongdong. Good luck

67
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,200
-Hello, Auntie. -Ma Yiming -Hello, Uncle

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,240
Go in quickly

69
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,280
Don't worry, Mom

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,000
Bye

71
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,400
Are you here to accompany the exam?

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,720
Of course

73
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,480
Yes

74
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,480
This is a once-in-a-lifetime exam

75
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,360
in a person's life

76
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,640
You have to come even if you're busy

77
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,560
That's right

78
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,720
Isn't that Jigang?

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,480
During the exam,

80
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
you must stay calm

81
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,800
and be composed

82
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,440
Come on

83
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,720
Time flies

84
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,240
Okay, Director Zhang

85
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,480
The young boy back then

86
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
And today he becomes the director

87
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,280
He's really impressive

88
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,560
Even more nervous than the students

89
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,920
We're also nervous

90
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,200
I'm so nervous

91
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,720
Lan Jinghui

92
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,560
Apprentice, Qingtian

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,560
You're here so early

94
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,200
How are you?

95
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,120
Did you rest well last night?

96
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,320
You look energetic

97
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,200
Have you eaten?

98
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,920
Of course, I ate enough

99
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
Are you ready?

100
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,040
I'm more than ready

101
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,680
Alright

102
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,440
Lan Jinghui

103
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,960
Brother Hui

104
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,320
You're here so early

105
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,560
Aren't you all the same?

106
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,040
On such an important day

107
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,480
Of course, we have to be early

108
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Everyone's here, let's go

109
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,320
Have you seen the Monitor?

110
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,480
Isn't he there?

111
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,920
Monitor

112
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,400
Qingtian, don't be nervous

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,640
Do your best

114
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,800
Definitely

115
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,280
This is for you

116
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,800
This is for you

117
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,480
Thank you

118
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,000
Sister Meng

119
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,840
Ma Yiming

120
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,520
Ling Dong

121
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,840
Come on

122
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:50,880
Come on

123
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,600
You too

124
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,560
See you in PKU

125
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't worry

126
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,320
The three of us will be fine

127
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,040
Qingtian, come over here

128
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,720
Roof Squad

129
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,040
Good luck for the college entrance exam

130
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,520
Come on

131
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,920
Wait a moment

132
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,880
Mengyu, come over here

133
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:11,840
Come on

134
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,240
Three, two, one

135
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,600
Good luck

136
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,440
Chenjun will win

137
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,440
Apprentice, Ling Dong

138
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,520
You're done with the exam

139
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,120
How did it go?

140
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,360
I don't know, I didn't think about it

141
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,440
How can you not think about it?

142
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,520
How can you not know?

143
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,560
The exam is already over

144
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,440
What's the use of thinking about it?

145
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,080
Ling Dong, how was it?

146
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,120
I don't know

147
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,280
I didn't think about it either

148
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:39,840
No

149
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,400
Why don't you think about it?

150
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,240
The exam is already over

151
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,280
What's the use of thinking about it?

152
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,480
Let's go then

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,880
It's vacation now

154
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,200
10 yuan for two

155
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,880
Buy one get one free

156
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,800
Do you want it?

157
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,960
Just take a look

158
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,320
There's a golden house in books

159
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,560
You must take a good look

160
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,720
Don't fight

161
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,280
It's okay

162
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,400
How about that?

163
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,760
What do you think?

164
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,000
We are about the same

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,720
So do I

166
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,080
How possible?

167
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,800
Just a few old books

168
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Isn't this old?

169
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,880
You don't understand this

170
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,920
On Ling Dong's book,

171
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,600
there's good luck to the top students

172
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,360
So superficial

173
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,960
Why not spend that time studying?

174
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
and doing homework instead?

175
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,160
I agree with that

176
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,960
Why am I so unlucky?

177
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,760
It's my turn soon

178
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,600
It's okay

179
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,600
Senior Chen is still here, let's go

180
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,760
Welcome

181
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Don't be in a hurry

182
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,880
Do you have senior Lan Jinghui's note?

183
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,840
Lan Jinghui

184
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,440
Yes, I heard he is

185
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
the lucky star of our school

186
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,840
From being last in the grade,

187
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,640
he improved his rank by 511 places

188
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,240
in the last mock exam

189
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,440
If that's not a lucky star, what is it?

190
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,720
Am I the one who was last?

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,680
Could it be me?

192
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,240
It's gone now

193
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,560
The lucky star is here, come on

194
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,520
Over there

195
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Don't rush

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,240
You can have one

197
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,520
Senior

198
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,520
Can you sign my clothes?

199
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,680
I wanna wear it for the college entrance exam

200
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,240
Lucky senior

201
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,280
Can I take a photo of your head?

202
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,440
I wanna have good luck

203
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,080
Lucky senior

204
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,960
Can I take a group photo?

205
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,400
I wanna use it as my phone wallpaper

206
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,880
Lucky senior

207
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
I wanna make it my ringtone

208
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,120
Senior

209
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,240
Senior

210
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,880
He is the first in the grade

211
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,920
Go and find him

212
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,600
Yes

213
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,520
We can just find Ling Dong

214
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,720
Are these all yours?

215
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,600
Sister Meng

216
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,880
Xu Mengyu

217
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,840
Wrap them up for me, I'll take them

218
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,960
Are you sure?

219
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,920
Don't you wanna give them to me?

220
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,720
No...

221
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,840
Why do you want these?

222
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,960
They're just basketballs, jerseys, and stuff

223
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,320
You called me

224
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,440
by my full name three times

225
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,840
The first time was when I was caught plagiarizing

226
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
You came to my house to find me

227
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,240
The second time was by the lake,

228
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,400
when we were looking at the stars

229
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
The third time was just now

230
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,520
Why do you remember them so clearly?

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,160
Actually, these things

232
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,880
might be just junk in others' eyes

233
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
But in my eyes,

234
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,720
each item here

235
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,120
has been with you

236
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,040
as you pursued your dreams

237
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,120
Each represents the most beautiful memories

238
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,360
from your youth

239
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,760
I think

240
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,160
It's quite valuable for collection

241
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,640
Maybe in the future

242
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,880
I can use it as material for my writing

243
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,760
Will you give them to me or not?

244
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,280
Of course

245
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,560
But you have to keep it safe for me

246
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,640
Because in the future

247
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,600
I'm gonna be the King of basketball

248
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,400
Okay

249
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,120
Wrap them for me

250
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,640
Sure

251
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,640
So, what's up?

252
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,320
Why did you call me over?

253
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,280
Qingtian, this is for you

254
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,680
What's wrong?

255
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,960
Don't you like this flavor the most?

256
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,480
Indeed, it's my favorite flavor

257
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,640
But I just find it strange

258
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,360
Why every time when you buy milk tea

259
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,160
you always get

260
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,960
my favorite flavor

261
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,160
And also

262
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,480
Why did you suddenly

263
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,400
show up in the same cram school as me?

264
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,440
Are these all just coincidences?

265
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,880
I know

266
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,320
You don't actually live near my house

267
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,840
I also know

268
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,000
every time you walk me home

269
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,240
It's not on the way for you

270
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,640
But you still

271
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,760
always walk me home

272
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,760
Why is that?

273
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,240
Don't you wanna tell me, right?

274
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,800
Just now, there're two juniors

275
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,840
gave me two friendship letters

276
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,720
Should I open and read them?

277
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,960
You're not allowed to open them

278
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,000
Why not?

279
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,960
Qingtian

280
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
Do you really not remember me?

281
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,520
Actually, we've known each other for a long time

282
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,040
Do you remember that summer vacation

283
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,280
when we were about to be in the junior high school?

284
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,880
You were in an alley

285
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,680
helping a skinny boy

286
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,920
who was being bullied

287
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,120
That boy was me

288
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,000
You appeared

289
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,040
like a female hero

290
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,800
It was so cool

291
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,120
You shouted loudly

292
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
and scared them away

293
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,240
That's because I have a loud voice

294
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,480
They were afraid I would call for help

295
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,800
Actually

296
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,640
As soon as I heard your voice

297
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,760
I recognized you

298
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,880
Thank you for everything

299
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,840
you did for me that day

300
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,520
So, I've decided

301
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,040
that whenever you need help

302
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
I'll always be by your side

303
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,800
Why didn't you say it earlier?

304
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,680
So you just wanted to repay me

305
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,640
I already have a loud voice

306
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
I've helped many people

307
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,200
I can't remember them all

308
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,160
Actually, a lollipop

309
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,200
can solve everything

310
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,680
This is...

311
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,720
All the lollipops you gave me

312
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,360
I've kept them all

313
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,560
What's this?

314
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,320
I like you

315
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,680
Come and see if it's nice

316
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,480
Don't spill, don't leak

317
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,520
Me and Qingtian got the best one

318
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,480
Yes, of course

319
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,600
This one is good

320
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,920
All the graduating seniors

321
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,320
We're gonna

322
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,400
take graduation photos

323
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,800
Time to take graduation photos

324
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,440
Let's go then

325
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,600
Come on, let's go

326
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Alright, teachers, students

327
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,440
Look at my camera

328
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,480
Don't blink

329
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,960
Alright, come on

330
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,480
Come on, everyone, stand up straight

331
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,280
One, two, three

332
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,680
Why aren't you two posing at all?

333
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,200
So scheming

334
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,960
What are you two doing?

335
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,920
Come on

336
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,480
Let's do it properly

337
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,640
Come on, let's start over

338
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,640
It must be the ugliest one

339
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,280
You don't need to move, you're already ugly

340
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,680
You...

341
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,600
Hurry

342
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,880
Come on, three, two, one

343
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,880
One more

344
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,160
Hooray for graduation

345
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,160
Hooray for graduation

346
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,320
Finally done

347
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,200
My face is stiff from smiling

348
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,040
That's how it ends

349
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,000
It feels like something's missing

350
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,640
Do you wanna leave a last memory

351
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,120
for Chenjun?

352
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,600
What are you trying to do again?

353
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,680
Follow me

354
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,960
Go

355
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,360
Go

356
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,800
Open the door

357
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,760
Open the door

358
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,440
Junior brothers and sisters

359
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,640
Today we are about to graduate

360
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
But your journey

361
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,960
has just begun

362
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,800
Here

363
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,360
we have a few words

364
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,240
to tell you

365
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Don't be downcast

366
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,160
It's not the style of Chenjun

367
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,280
Only by flying against the wind can you create miracles

368
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,600
Don't be afraid of failure

369
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,640
Don't be afraid of loneliness either

370
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,000
Because what you're experiencing now

371
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,320
has been experienced

372
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,680
by countless people

373
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,600
So there's nothing to worry about

374
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,620
Don't mind what others say

375
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,920
Just walk your own way

376
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,880
Success has no shortcuts

377
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,000
Only with double the effort

378
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,360
can you achieve it

379
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,200
Even if studying is tiring, you still have to eat well

380
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,680
Treasure a period

381
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,800
of time that will never come again

382
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,760
You must cherish

383
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,320
the people around you

384
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,960
No regrets in youth

385
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,280
As long as you work hard, you won't regret it

386
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,640
No regrets in youth

387
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,920
As long as you work hard, you won't regret it

388
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,640
Go for it, you are the best

389
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,960
The college entrance exam signifies

390
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,360
the end of high school era

391
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,040
But my youth

392
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,360
has become extraordinary

393
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,920
because I met all of you

394
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
No matter how heavy the fall,

395
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,720
there is the courage to start over

396
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,680
Someone will stand against you

397
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,440
and the whole world

398
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,360
Some people will share with you

399
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,280
all the joy and sorrow

400
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,600
Some people pass you by

401
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,000
with caution

402
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,600
Some people will solve

403
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,720
every problem for you

404
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,760
Some people will shield you

405
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,640
from all malice

406
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,640
I keep encountering

407
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,800
different lovely and kind people

408
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Then I have to say goodbye to them

409
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
I have spoken

410
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,560
with a serious voice

411
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,960
And received

412
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,040
so many sincere responses

413
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,320
Those stories that happened

414
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,360
People I met

415
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,280
will be engraved

416
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,880
in each of our hearts

417
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,680
Never-ending

418
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,440
Doudou, do you also wanna know

419
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,520
my exam results?

420
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,760
Aren't you curious?

421
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,440
Anyway, the results will be out

422
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,760
in a few hours

423
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,600
No matter the result

424
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,800
I will persist

425
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,040
on the path I chose for myself

426
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,840
The answers are meaningless

427
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,120
Are you still

428
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,880
the same Xiao Xiaohua?

429
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,880
A better...

430
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,600
Xiao Xiaohua

431
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,640
Hello

432
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Get down, we've arrived

433
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,880
Do you think my disciple

434
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,200
would be too scared to check the results alone

435
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,560
So she brought the two of us

436
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,440
You're not any better

437
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,800
What's wrong with me?

438
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Then why are you trembling?

439
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,200
I mean

440
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,760
Is it necessary to be so nervous?

441
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,760
Can I not be nervous?

442
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,880
I've never been this serious

443
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,080
in my entire life

444
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,680
I've been studying for over a year

445
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,040
If I don't do well in the exams

446
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,120
The exams are already over

447
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,560
No matter what, the results are there

448
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,760
Don't think too much

449
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,880
Exactly, see Xiaohua

450
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,920
She has such a good mindset

451
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,800
So, you didn't ask us

452
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,840
to accompany you to check the results?

453
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,560
Well

454
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,880
Then why did you invite us?

455
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,800
Three years of high school

456
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,840
I have one regret

457
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,280
It could have been accomplished

458
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,200
It's all your fault, Lan Jinghui

459
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,560
No sense of responsibility

460
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,520
What does that have to do with me?

461
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,080
On the first day we met

462
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,160
Didn't you say you would teach me

463
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,040
how to ride a bike?

464
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,040
Now I have a bike

465
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,960
That's it

466
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,880
No problem

467
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,240
Since I'm your master

468
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,920
I should do what I should, right?

469
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,360
Let's go

470
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,080
Did you guys notice

471
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
this road is more beautiful than before

472
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,320
We've been walking for three years

473
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
You're just realizing it now?

474
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,000
Why do I feel like

475
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
nothing has changed?

476
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,200
Before, we used to walk

477
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,240
this road every day

478
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,760
Either rushing to school

479
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,200
or hurrying back home

480
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,760
We never really see this road clearly

481
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,320
High school went by so quickly

482
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,160
Afterwards, the three of us

483
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,960
may rarely have the chance

484
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,000
to walk this road together like this

485
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,680
Do you still remember the first time

486
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,280
we met over there?

487
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,320
Of course, I remember

488
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,560
It was at that intersection

489
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,280
Thank goodness I called the police that time,

490
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,520
Otherwise this guy

491
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,160
might have fought with that driver

492
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,760
He might have even been expelled

493
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,120
You could say that I saved you

494
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,480
Listen

495
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,240
How bad was he back then?

496
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,080
He clearly saw

497
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,640
that there were surveillance cameras

498
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,880
and had already called the police

499
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,160
But he didn't tell the two of us

500
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,440
to stay in place

501
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,480
Come on

502
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,680
If it wasn't for me influencing you back then,

503
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,240
would you have turned out like this?

504
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,400
What do you mean "influencing"?

505
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Get it straight, I saved you

506
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,920
Someone as cold and heartless as you

507
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,720
Someone as selfish as you

508
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,960
If it weren't for me,

509
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,160
who would be friends with you?

510
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,840
Then please tell me, who was the one

511
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,640
who diligently helped

512
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,760
improve someone's grades

513
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,000
during the two years?

514
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,200
That's because I've always been smart

515
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,880
I'm naturally gifted

516
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,060
Alright, stop it

517
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,640
Thinking about it now

518
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,520
We were quite funny back then

519
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,280
I think the funniest moment

520
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,360
must have been that time

521
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,120
When Spider-Man fell from the sky

522
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,840
So funny

523
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,480
You guys found it funny

524
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,400
My waist hurt for several days

525
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,480
It really hurt

526
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,160
But thinking back,

527
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,800
there was one regret for me

528
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,960
I still haven't found

529
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,040
the person who swapped my letter

530
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:18,840
Congratulations

531
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,600
There's no more regret now

532
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,760
It's you

533
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,400
Surprised?

534
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,360
Let me tell you, it's impossible

535
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,000
Because back then,

536
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,880
I compared your notes

537
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,880
I even said you were a big fool

538
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,680
I wrote with my left hand

539
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,120
Look at you

540
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,960
So you really got that letter

541
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,320
No, no, no

542
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,520
There's still one more person

543
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
who admired me

544
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,960
It's me

545
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,880
Did you write it for me?

546
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,000
I wrote it for Ling Dong

547
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,440
Alright, Xiao Xiaohua

548
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,520
Ever since the first day of school,

549
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,400
Okay, stop

550
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,400
Didn't you say

551
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,040
that you'd teach me how to ride a bike?

552
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
It's almost the grand finale

553
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,120
Why haven't you taught yet?

554
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,280
Who told you it's the grand finale?

555
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,840
There's more to come. Get on

556
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,680
Let's go

557
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,640
Come on, hold on

558
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,800
Three, two, one, go

559
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,520
Charge!

560
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,440
Charge!

561
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,760
Keep up the good work

562
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,800
When looking back on this youth,

563
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,080
something to be proud of

564
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,440
are not just acceptance letters

565
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,200
But the one

566
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,800
who gave it their all

567
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,360
And those young people

568
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,120
who accompanied us

569
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,080
with their most youthful appearance

570
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,600
We've walked through

571
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,800
the most beautiful moments together

572
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:50,600
Got it

573
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,520
Sorry, I'm late

574
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,720
I kept you waiting for so long

575
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,920
It's okay. I just arrived

576
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,880
Do you know how far it is from here?

577
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,760
I had to transfer twice on the subway to get here

578
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,600
Here

579
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,040
Thank you

580
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,880
I haven't finished yet

581
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,960
Do you know

582
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,000
how crowded the subway was today?

583
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,760
My makeup got ruined

584
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,560
Look at this pimple

585
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,000
No, I need to fix it quickly

586
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Hold this for me

587
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:45,720
Higher

588
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:53,960
How is it?

589
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,360
Perfect

590
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:01,880
What's wrong?

591
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,920
I wanna taste your milk tea

592
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:12,920
Let's go

593
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,280
Your hair

594
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,560
What's wrong?

595
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,120
It's sticking to your neck

596
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,280
Ma Yiming

597
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,200
Ma Yiming, Xu Mengyu

598
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,360
Why are you two still late?

599
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,680
Even as a freshman,

600
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,560
I'm not late

601
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,920
You guys are later than us

602
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,240
Ma Yiming

603
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,760
You finally got into Rong University

604
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,120
You can speak with confidence now

605
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,920
Of course

606
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,560
I'm a college student now

607
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,320
Xia Qingtian

608
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,160
Never thought you're already in college

609
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,400
You still love to eat so much

610
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,600
Mind your own business

611
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,520
It's my lifelong pursuit

612
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:52,760
Let's go

613
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,520
Let's go inside quickly

614
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:53,960
Okay

615
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,160
Stop pursuing her

616
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,600
Or you'll end up like her

617
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,960
Shut up. Ma Yiming

618
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,200
You're here

619
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,760
Xiaohua

620
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,240
That's amazing

621
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,600
You already have a personal art exhibition

622
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,760
No, no

623
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,080
Okay, we'll come and see

624
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,720
Okay

625
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,360
See you

626
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,760
See you

627
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,600
Xiao Xiaohua

628
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,280
Li Ruosi

629
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,560
You actually...

630
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Congratulations

631
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,600
Pretty good

632
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,280
Let's go

633
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,440
Let's go over and take a look

634
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,200
Alright

635
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,480
Is it okay?

636
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,000
Come here

637
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,480
Xiaohua

638
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,440
Can't you say something?

639
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,200
You're insulting me

640
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,600
Why did you all just arrive?

641
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,800
Xiaohua, congratulations

642
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,800
Never thought you could

643
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,480
hold an art exhibition here

644
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,760
Congratulations to you too

645
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,720
Your new book is published

646
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,160
Now I'm your fan

647
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,800
Really?

648
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,400
Of course

649
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,760
Senior sister is now

650
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,240
the number one young author

651
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,440
Stop buttering up, okay?

652
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,120
What about Lan Jinghui and Ling Dong?

653
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,080
Didn't they come with you?

654
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,440
They haven't arrived yet?

655
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,160
I thought they were already here

656
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:09,760
Xiaohua, everything is ready

657
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,520
We can start now

658
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,920
Alright, I'll be right there

659
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,440
Okay

660
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
On such an important occasion today,

661
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,600
they are still late

662
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Why don't we wait, Xiaohua?

663
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,640
Go quickly

664
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,640
Okay

665
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:21,960
Let me tidy up for you

666
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,880
Thank you, everyone

667
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,360
for coming to my art exhibition

668
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,680
I named it "Bright Time"

669
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,600
to record the most important journey

670
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,840
in my life

671
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Whenever I feel lost, confused,

672
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,000
or stagnant,

673
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,840
I can draw strength from it

674
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,560
Because I cherish it

675
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,800
I record it with my brush

676
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,400
The school playground,

677
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,960
the phoenix trees along the shaded road,

678
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
endless homework,

679
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,080
and the smiling faces that never tire

680
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,680
And...

681
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,680
The young man riding a bicycle in white

682
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,520
Thanks to those who accompanied me

683
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,320
throughout this journey

684
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,840
It is because of them

685
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,800
that this small period of time

686
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,160
radiates an enduring light

687
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,840
Great!

688
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,040
Fantastic!

689
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,280
Just two days ago, China's first

690
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,240
manned spacecraft, Tianwen 7th,

691
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,440
successfully landed on Mars

692
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,760
This successful landing

693
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,840
holds great historical significance

694
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,360
in China's aerospace history

695
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,720
Now let's connect with

696
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,040
the two astronauts

697
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,680
Hello, everyone

698
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,200
I'm astronaut Lan Jinghui

699
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,480
Hello, everyone

700
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,800
I'm astronaut Ling Dong

701
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,400
Right now,

702
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,720
it is 3:15 Beijing time on Earth

703
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,940
We'll send greetings

704
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,200
to our fellow Earthlings

705
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,480
Hello, everyone

706
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,900
Our high school friend, Xiao Xiaohua

707
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,480
holds an art exhibition today

708
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,320
Unfortunately,

709
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,480
we can't be there in person

710
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,160
But it's okay

711
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,840
We're sending our greetings to her

712
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,040
in space

713
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,640
Wish her a successful exhibition

714
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,680
Successful exhibition

715
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,840
You can see

716
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,360
that we're not

717
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,200
traveling in the boundless universe

718
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,440
The scenery before us

719
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,760
is indeed beautiful

720
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,800
Extremely beautiful

721
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,120
It makes me exclaim

722
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,360
the marvels of nature again and again

723
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,920
and the insignificance of humans

724
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,840
in the vast universe

725
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,160
Indeed insignificant

726
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,520
Very insignificant

727
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,160
Did I say that just now?

728
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,720
Did we say it wrong?

729
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,880
Did I get your line?

730
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,440
No, I remember

731
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,480
that should be my line

732
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,680
Let me see the script

733
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,400
Let me see the script

734
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,360
This scene is...

735
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,800
Here

736
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,040
Right, indeed

737
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,280
Look,  from here

738
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,000
You said indeed insignificant

739
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,360
I should have added another line

740
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:15,960
Right?

741
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,680
Lan Jinghui, Ling Dong

742
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,800
Come out

743
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,440
Here

744
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,840
What are you two doing

745
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,080
at my art exhibition?

746
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
It's not us

747
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,000
It was his idea

748
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,000
He thought your exhibition

749
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,560
should have a cosmic atmosphere

750
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,560
This is to surprise you

751
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,320
You call this a surprise?

752
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,240
Disciple, don't you feel

753
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,000
after watching this video

754
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,680
the whole exhibition

755
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,520
becomes more high-end

756
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,800
Executive

757
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,560
So tell me

758
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,360
Where is the high-end?

759
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,200
Where is the executive style?

760
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,080
This is a message

761
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,320
sent back by humans

762
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,480
from interstellar travel

763
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,600
One and only in the world

764
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,400
Should I send you two back now?

765
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,680
Is there still time?

766
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,000
Ling Dong, you actually

767
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,840
joined him in this nonsense
