[I'm not a Little Joke]
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,990
Come in

4
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,230
Director Zhang

5
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,670
Ling Dong, why are you here?

6
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:57,910
Director Zhang

7
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,550
The physics competition

8
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,830
you told me last time

9
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,310
I've decided to participate

10
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,670
Alright

11
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,590
That's great

12
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,390
But in that case,

13
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,590
I won't be able to participate

14
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,590
in the talent competition

15
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,710
I have to withdraw

16
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,590
You have to think it through

17
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,990
If you give up, it would be a pity

18
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,190
The time conflict, well

19
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,190
I think the physics competition

20
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,430
is more important for me

21
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,310
Okay, I know

22
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,110
I'll deal with it

23
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:29,990
And you'll just have to

24
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,830
prepare for the physics competition

25
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:33,990
Thank you, Director

26
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,950
You're welcome

27
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,150
Brother Hui

28
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,190
What's wrong?

29
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,990
Why are you yelling? I'm not dead

30
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,070
Dear students

31
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,310
we have an announcement to make

32
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,350
We have an announcement to make

33
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,030
Due to personal reasons,

34
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,750
Ling Dong from Class 5 of Grade 2

35
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,230
has withdrawn from the talent competition voting

36
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,510
The current rankings will be postponed

37
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,910
Xiao Xiaohua, who is currently ranked second,

38
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,990
is leading by a large margin

39
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,110
Well,

40
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:04,670
this...

41
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,350
I told you earlier

42
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,910
Don't waste time

43
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,030
Never thought

44
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,190
you're still secretly scheming

45
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,150
I underestimated you

46
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,350
Get it clearly, okay?

47
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,790
You're the one playing tricks behinsd

48
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,790
not me

49
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,430
You can't just quit this competition

50
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,470
without any consequences

51
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,270
Brother Hui, where are you going?

52
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,070
They say life is like

53
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,910
a hyacinth

54
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,510
Until the very end,

55
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,790
you never know

56
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,510
what color of flower there'll be

57
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,270
Just like you never know

58
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,870
what awaits you in the next second,

59
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,110
a surprise or a fright

60
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,710
Xiaohua

61
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,350
You're now in first place

62
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,270
We're competitors now

63
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,910
Keep it up, Xiao Xiaohua

64
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,150
Ms. Fang, this is unfair

65
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,950
The talent competition is a big event

66
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,190
But Ling Dong can just withdraw

67
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,190
Ling Dong has to participate

68
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,390
in the physics competition at the end of the month

69
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,590
Director Zhang approved it

70
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:40,950
Any questions?

71
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,150
No questions

72
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,710
Before participating,

73
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,870
he's already planned well

74
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,190
How despicable

75
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,790
You really think

76
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,990
that the tricks you've done behind

77
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,710
go unnoticed by the teacher?

78
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,310
I...

79
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,230
I think you're just free

80
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,990
Since you're so idle,

81
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,870
this is specially prepared for you

82
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,910
A basic knowledge workbook

83
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,150
Take it back and finish it

84
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,350
Then hand it over to Ling Dong for inspection

85
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:04,990
No

86
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,110
Ms. Fang, you can't do this

87
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,030
Xiaohua

88
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,750
Anything happened?

89
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,150
Ms. Fang

90
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,270
I also wanna withdraw from the talent competition

91
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,870
What's your reason?

92
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,830
I don't wanna participate

93
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:28,710
Xiaohua

94
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,190
Ling Dong withdrew from the competition

95
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,470
because he has a valid reason

96
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,350
He has a physics competition

97
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,070
And Director Zhang has already given special approval

98
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,750
If you're only withdrawing

99
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,830
because you don't wanna participate,

100
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,030
I can't agree to it

101
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,230
And I don't have the authority

102
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,590
to agree to your withdrawal

103
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,270
But, Ms. Fang

104
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,070
I don't have any talent

105
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,590
I...

106
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,670
Look at you

107
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,510
What should I say?

108
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,950
You just lack confidence

109
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,990
I think it's good for you

110
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,390
to take this chance to improve yourself

111
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,990
But, Ms. Fang....

112
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,510
There's no but

113
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,270
Alright, it's time for class

114
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,550
You can go back now

115
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,710
Thank you, Ms. Fang

116
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,030
Xiaohua

117
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,310
Go back and prepare well

118
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,750
I'm looking forward to your wonderful performance

119
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,390
in the talent competition

120
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,750
I believe in you

121
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,630
Keep it up

122
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,830
Go back to class

123
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,550
Go

124
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,790
Now let's talk about

125
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,030
the voting activity

126
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,750
for the talent competition

127
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,190
Many students in each class

128
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,510
haven't voted yet

129
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,630
I think our student council

130
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,590
has the obligation to organize

131
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,590
this selection properly

132
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,350
I believe you all know

133
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,710
that this talent competition

134
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,070
represents our school

135
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,030
So it must be

136
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,830
the best one

137
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,430
Originally, Ling Dong was eligible

138
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,990
but unfortunately, he withdrew

139
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,190
Ling Dong withdrew

140
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,150
There are other candidates

141
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,030
It doesn't have to be him

142
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,110
But now, among

143
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,270
the high vote candidates,

144
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,590
there isn't anyone particularly suitable

145
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,190
to represent our school

146
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,340
Why not?

147
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,350
Mengyu. You're also among the top

148
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,990
I'm not good enough yet

149
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,390
But at least you're better

150
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,350
than that Xiao Xiaohua

151
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,150
It's difficult for me to say that

152
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,550
But I think our student council

153
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,510
should play a leading role

154
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,390
and set a good example

155
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,950
It should be you

156
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,310
Mengyu has participated before

157
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,070
And she's experienced

158
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:16,830
And

159
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,270
She is also the president of student council

160
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,590
It's only right for her to take on the role

161
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,230
Mengyu, it's already this time

162
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,630
You must not be modest

163
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,990
After all, it's gonna

164
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,590
represent our school

165
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,670
This is not child's play

166
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,550
Alright then

167
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,670
But let's make it clear beforehand

168
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,230
I'm not trying to steal the thunder

169
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,630
It's just that we do need someone

170
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,430
like you for this role

171
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,150
to represent our school

172
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,070
I'll definitely work hard

173
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,390
and set a good example for everyone

174
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,830
After the meeting, everyone

175
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,590
please mobilize

176
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,070
the classmates around you to vote

177
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,990
After all, this is

178
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,870
for the good of our school

179
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,670
No problem

180
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:51,710
That's it

181
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,550
Ma Yiming

182
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,590
Sister Meng

183
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:17,830
The photo on the previous poster

184
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,590
isn't that beautiful

185
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,870
I'm sorry, Sister Meng

186
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,630
I didn't know you didn't like it

187
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,070
And also the ribbon from last time,

188
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,230
my name was too small

189
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,070
I won't do it anymore. I promise

190
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,630
Oh, I didn't mean that

191
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,390
Sister Meng, no need to say anything

192
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,510
I heard everything just now

193
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,990
You've worked so hard for the competition

194
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,270
I should consider everything

195
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:42,950
Don't worry

196
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,470
I won't do such things anymore

197
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,830
Who said you can't do it?

198
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,470
If you wanna do it, do it well

199
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,710
I'll send you a photo later

200
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,390
Use the one I send you

201
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,390
Okay, copy that

202
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,150
Hello

203
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,390
Vote for Xu Mengyu

204
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,110
from Class 5 of Grade 2

205
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,630
Thank you

206
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,230
Please vote for Xu Mengyu

207
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,350
Thank you

208
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,030
Please support Xu Mengyu

209
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,310
Thank you

210
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,230
Please do not vote for me anymore

211
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,630
Don't worry, Xiaohua

212
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,910
I'll definitely support you

213
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,510
No, that's not what I meant

214
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,510
No need to say anything

215
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,910
We are classmates after all

216
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,870
I'll definitely support you

217
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,510
Please vote for Xiao Xiaohua

218
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,990
Vote for Xiao Xiaohua

219
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,230
Please, everyone

220
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,350
Do not vote for me

221
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,630
Please do not vote for Xiaohua

222
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,270
Yesterday

223
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,550
when the voting deadline approached,

224
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,950
it seemed like Mengyu was leading

225
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,950
It must be Mengyu

226
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,190
I think so

227
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,230
Now here's an announcement

228
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,830
After public voting

229
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,150
and discussions with the school,

230
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,270
the final winner of the talent competition

231
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,790
representing our school, Chenjun Middle School

232
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,270
is from Class 5 of Grade 2

233
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,590
Xiao Xiaohua

234
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,510
She'll represent Chenjun Middle School

235
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,070
in the final selection

236
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,750
of the city-wide talent competition

237
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,110
Congratulations to Xiao Xiaohua

238
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,350
Congratulations

239
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,230
Xiaohua, you're amazing

240
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,550
You are really a dark horse

241
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,470
Xiaohua

242
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,270
Xiaohua

243
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,030
Xiaohua

244
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,630
Are you satisfied now?

245
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,550
It's over

246
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,870
Our school this year

247
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,910
definitely won't win any awards

248
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,310
Mengyu

249
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,390
It would be great if it were you

250
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,910
It's nothing

251
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,670
Liu Shu

252
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,870
What do you mean by that?

253
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,750
Just the literal meaning

254
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,390
Don't you understand?

255
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,950
Xiaohua sings off-key

256
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,150
That's indeed ridiculous

257
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,070
I'm just questioning this result

258
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,510
But everyone is willing

259
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,270
to vote for her

260
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,550
They're willing to vote for her

261
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,950
Are you jealous?

262
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,070
I think

263
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,830
they just wanna see a joke

264
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,260
No wonder they call her Little Joke

265
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,470
Liu Shu

266
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,910
Let me ask you a question

267
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,390
Why do you call her Little Joke?

268
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,230
Why can't she

269
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,670
participate in the talent competition?

270
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,030
The talent competition represents the school

271
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,110
Can she even do it?

272
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,110
I think she can

273
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,470
She can definitely do it

274
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,910
Congratulations, Xiaohua

275
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,150
It seems that this time

276
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,350
the task of representing the school

277
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,310
falls on you

278
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,390
You must work hard

279
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,150
Don't embarrass the school

280
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,310
Last year, Xu Mengyu

281
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,550
represented our school

282
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,310
This year, it's Little Joke

283
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,790
Too cruel

284
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,830
I think Xiaohua is good

285
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,190
I have high hopes for her

286
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,430
She might even win surprisingly

287
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,030
Come on

288
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,150
Don't talk nonsense

289
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,430
Her singing is so terrible

290
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,870
We'll probably come last

291
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,110
So annoying

292
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,790
I just randomly chose her

293
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,750
I didn't know she'd actually get selected

294
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,230
Now things become interesting

295
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,230
So annoying

296
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,110
Why is it like this?

297
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,390
What are you doing?

298
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,910
Xiao Xiaohua

299
00:12:59,270 --> 00:12:59,990
Ling Dong

300
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,070
Do you really wanna jump?

301
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:01,950
I...

302
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,230
Setbacks are just experiences in life

303
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,350
They are not everything in life

304
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,630
Is it worth sacrificing your life

305
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,430
to escape?

306
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,350
No, I don't

307
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,510
Do you know how many people

308
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,670
can't even live?

309
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,350
Do you know

310
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,510
how many people would cherish

311
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,910
the life you're giving up?

312
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,230
Do you know

313
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,950
that if you jump, in an instant

314
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,110
everyone you know

315
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,070
and everything you love

316
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,990
will turn into nothing

317
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,150
It doesn't make any sense anymore

318
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,630
If you really jump down

319
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,350
You might really

320
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,350
become a joke, you know?

321
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,550
Ling Dong

322
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,550
Why do you say she's a joke?

323
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,790
If you don't withdraw from the race

324
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,550
Will she do this?

325
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,990
Why would I withdraw?

326
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:54,950
Don't you know it yourself?

327
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,870
Don't think that

328
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,830
this has nothing to do with you

329
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,070
Instead of arguing with me here

330
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,430
you should think about

331
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,390
how to solve the problem

332
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,950
You coward

333
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,150
Ling Dong, I'm telling you

334
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,390
Lan Jinghui, you misunderstood

335
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,150
Ling Dong just wanted to help me

336
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,150
No need to speak for him

337
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,390
Every word he said...

338
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,150
He didn't mean it

339
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,630
He didn't mean it

340
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,510
I'll support you with it, okay?

341
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,150
The Earth is round

342
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,750
If you keep running away like this

343
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,870
sooner or later you'll return to the starting point

344
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,350
Isn't it?

345
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:26,990
So instead of...

346
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,550
What are you doing?

347
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,390
One thought I was gonna commit suicide

348
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,230
The other one started preaching

349
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,950
I just wanted to

350
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,550
cry alone for a while

351
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,830
Okay

352
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,070
Don't cry

353
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,590
You should have said it earlier

354
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,310
If you wanna cry

355
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,190
I can cry with you

356
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:52,750
Right?

357
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,710
If you wanna vent

358
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,830
just shout it out

359
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,990
How do I shout?

360
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,070
Come here

361
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,190
Shout as I do

362
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,150
I'm not a Little Joke

363
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,790
I'm Xiao Xiaohua

364
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,550
I'm not a Little Joke

365
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,990
I'm Xiao Xiaohua

366
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,630
Louder

367
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,590
I'm not a Little Joke

368
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,230
I'm Xiao Xiaohua

369
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,030
With some emotion

370
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,910
Shout it out

371
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,910
I'm not a Little Joke

372
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,710
I'm Xiao Xiaohua

373
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,630
Much better

374
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,150
You have to tell them

375
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,550
I, Xiao Xiaohua, can do it

376
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,470
I, Xiao Xiaohua, can do it

377
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,150
I am the champion of the campus

378
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,110
I am the champion of the campus

379
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,070
I am the champion of the campus

380
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,190
I am the champion of the campus

381
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,270
Louder

382
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:05,910
I am the champion of the campus

383
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,190
Who is it?

384
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,350
Who's shouting on the rooftop?

385
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,230
Dangerous. Come down quickly

386
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,750
Run

387
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,590
Don't be afraid. Director Zhang can't catch up

388
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,230
I didn't know you were so timid

389
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,310
How did you survive until now?

390
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,710
Don't sigh

391
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,070
Happiness will slip away

392
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,270
But you shouted up there

393
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,990
Doesn't it feel better?

394
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,470
But, the stage is not the rooftop

395
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,390
There are so many spectators underneath

396
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,510
What do I do if I get nervous on stage?

397
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,030
Don't worry, I'm here

398
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,430
If you perform well, it's your credit

399
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,990
Or it's my fault. Okay?

400
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,430
Thank you, Lan Jinghui

401
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,630
But what are we gonna perform?

402
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,870
Leave it to me

403
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,430
What?

404
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,630
You're gonna form a band for Xiao Xiaohua

405
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,870
That's right

406
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:54,750
Why?

407
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,510
Xiaohua is too scared to do it alone

408
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,470
So I've decided to join her

409
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,390
No, Brother Hui

410
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,870
I still have to train

411
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,870
I don't have time

412
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,190
If we don't perform on stage,

413
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,430
Xiao Xiaohua will go to the rooftop

414
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,430
Can you bear it?

415
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,310
I'll go to the rooftop then

416
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,230
No, disciple

417
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,230
Don't go, Xiaohua

418
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,670
Just because of this word "don't",

419
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,750
since we're already closed

420
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,870
That's settled. Then Let's go

421
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,830
So you're saying we'll perform on stage

422
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,910
But we don't even have a good pair of shoes

423
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,790
How can we perform like this?

424
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,150
Is that so?

425
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,590
It's just sneakers, right?

426
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,430
I'll buy them for you

427
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,990
The latest models

428
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,790
Okay

429
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,870
Okay then

430
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,590
Since you're so eager,

431
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,070
then we...

432
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,430
But I haven't agreed yet

433
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,670
Tell me your wish

434
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,230
I don't want sneakers

435
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,030
You can't eat sneakers

436
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,990
Rehearsing is exhausting

437
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,990
I don't know how much I need to eat

438
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,790
to replenish it

439
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,390
Is it just about eating?

440
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,310
A month's worth of snacks

441
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,750
Is it enough?

442
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,310
For a month?

443
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,110
For a quarter

444
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,590
For a semester

445
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,710
Unlimited snacks

446
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,910
No time limit

447
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,470
Meal card

448
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,710
Here you go. Yes

449
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,590
Long live freedom

450
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,710
So now you have freedom

451
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,910
and sneakers

452
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,750
We'll start rehearsing tomorrow

453
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,470
Okay

454
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,630
Okay

455
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,790
Let's go, Xiaohua

456
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,550
Hurry up

457
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,350
Hurry up

458
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,030
Come, look and choose whatever you want

459
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,990
That's great, Brother Hui

460
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,030
You do splash it out, huh

461
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,110
No

462
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,990
My dad used to play music when he was young

463
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,550
I just brought a few over

464
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,750
from my home

465
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,790
So I've been playing since I was young

466
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,190
But I can't tell

467
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,670
uncle is so trendy

468
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,230
But I don't know how to play any of them

469
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,230
When the time comes,

470
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,350
you'll just stand here

471
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,390
The center of the band

472
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,270
As our lead singer

473
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,110
As long as the band grooves,

474
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,390
you'll definitely be a star

475
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,510
Don't worry

476
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,150
Come up and feel it

477
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,030
Feel it

478
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:51,950
Come on

479
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,070
Outside the long corridor,

480
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,910
That's enough

481
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,270
What's your problem?

482
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,510
Voice cracked

483
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,630
Yes

484
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,630
So we'll lower the pitch

485
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,910
Just a little bit

486
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,870
Lower it a bit

487
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,070
Let's try again

488
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:16,470
Outside the long corridor, along the ancient road

489
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,990
The green grass seemed to connect with the sky

490
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,590
It's a bit better than before

491
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,110
Right?

492
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,790
But the problem is...

493
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,910
Breath support, not enough

494
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,910
So the solution is

495
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,870
What is Ma Yiming doing?

496
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,870
Panting like a dog

497
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:30,790
Let's practice panting

498
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,710
Yes, come on

499
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,150
Let's get it together

500
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:33,870
Get ready

501
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,470
Three, two, one

502
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,630
Be more active

503
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,110
Practice at home by yourself

504
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,230
And the second point is

505
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,670
Let your voice out

506
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,510
Let's do some vocal warm-ups first

507
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,150
Like this

508
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,270
That's it, come on

509
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,070
Make your voice ten times louder

510
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,030
Come on, do it together

511
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,870
I marked all the difficult parts

512
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,830
on this sheet

513
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,070
Just practice according to it

514
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,150
That's impressive

515
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,670
Got it

516
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,590
Keep practicing

517
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,030
A minus B is a positive number

518
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,190
So if we use symbols

519
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,470
to represent it

520
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,150
A is greater than B, greater than 0

521
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,190
Lan Jinghui

522
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,950
Lan Jinghui

523
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,510
What are you doing? Listening to music?

524
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,070
No

525
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,190
My ears hurt

526
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,790
It seems like water got in

527
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,230
when I was showering last night

528
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,230
Your ears got water in while showering?

529
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,510
Why did you shake your head?

530
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,070
Isn't that making it worse?

531
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,540
Do you want me to take you to the hospital?

532
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,470
No need

533
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,390
Headphones

534
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,110
Get them

535
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,510
Listen to the lesson properly

536
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,110
Okay

537
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,910
Okay, let's continue

538
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,350
If A...

539
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,030
I heard you've been doing well recently

540
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,510
The teachers have high praise

541
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,070
for you

542
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,270
That's right

543
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,950
Director

544
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,310
Recently, I've been behaving well

545
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,590
I haven't caused any trouble for you

546
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,480
Then, Director

547
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,270
Shall I leave if there's nothing else?

548
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:38,830
Wait a minute

549
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,750
Can't you really know what I mean?

550
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,030
You can leave

551
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:44,910
Give me

552
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,670
the study group's study notes

553
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,670
Let me see them first

554
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,270
If they are qualified

555
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,590
then you can calmly

556
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,150
walk out of my office

557
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,150
Bring it here

558
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,990
Director, let's discuss something

559
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,390
Take a look

560
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,470
Recently, aren't you

561
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,390
busy helping your classmates

562
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,630
for the program?

563
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,150
So, can we

564
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,710
slow down a bit

565
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,270
And I can write it later

566
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,780
I can discuss something with you too

567
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:13,510
Go ahead

568
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,510
About the notes

569
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,910
You still have to insist

570
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,630
After all, Lan Jinghui's

571
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,590
personal growth

572
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,950
is crucial

573
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,830
Director

574
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,630
Can't we slow down a bit in growing up?

575
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,550
What do you think?

576
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:26,790
Hello, Director

577
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,470
Lan Jinghui

578
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,030
How did your notes end up with me?

579
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,150
I was wondering why I couldn't find them

580
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,550
Director, look

581
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,670
It's here, see?

582
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,710
Well, Director

583
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,230
We'll leave if there's nothing else

584
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,470
Let's go, Director

585
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,150
Don't think that

586
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:00,950
I'll be grateful to you

587
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:01,830
Let me tell you

588
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,510
I know

589
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,150
you just wanna see me embarrassed

590
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,110
You're not that kind

591
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,750
Finish your notes first

592
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,510
No, you already turned them in, right?

593
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,910
You said it yourself

594
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,310
I'm not that kind

595
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,630
I knew it

596
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,830
Finished

597
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,630
I'm gonna go. Bye

598
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,310
Wait a minute

599
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,830
You missed a lot before

600
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,870
Make up for those

601
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,190
Hey bro. Let me go

602
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,910
Xia Qingtian, Xiao Xiaohua, Ma Yiming

603
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,590
They're waiting for me to teach them the piano

604
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,790
Watch your attitude

605
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:55,750
Ling Dong

606
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,670
I really didn't expect

607
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,990
that you'd become like this

608
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,110
Why didn't I

609
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:06,470
see you clearly earlier?

610
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,390
I really didn't expect

611
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,230
that you would be like this

612
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,710
You're really cruel

613
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,070
So cruel

614
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,270
You're so cruel

615
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,790
What's wrong with it?

616
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:42,550
Outside the long corridor, along the ancient road

617
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:48,230
The green grass seemed to connect with the sky

618
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:56,030
Under the gentle night breeze, swung the willows and resonated the melancholic melody from an old flute

619
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:01,870
whilst the descending sun illuminated mountains by mountain

620
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,670
One more time

621
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,590
Brother, I'm done writing

622
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,070
Good job, all correct

623
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,590
That's about the time

624
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,390
That's it all for today

625
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,670
Xiaoling, class is over

626
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,470
Right

627
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,350
Your tutoring fee for this month

628
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,310
Here, take it

629
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,350
Thank you, Auntie

630
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,270
Xiaoxiong has made significant progress

631
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,310
with extra classes recently

632
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,110
Thank you

633
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,230
No need to thank me

634
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,750
Auntie, I'll be leaving now

635
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,430
Goodbye, Brother Ling Dong

636
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,870
Goodbye, Xiaoxiong

637
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,070
Dongdong

638
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,830
You don't need to do these things

639
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,790
Just focus on your studies

640
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,030
It's okay, Mom

641
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,110
Here, be careful, it's hot

642
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,350
Be careful

643
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,310
By the way, Mom

644
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,990
This is my tutoring fee for this month

645
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,230
We have enough living expenses

646
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,470
By the way,

647
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,510
I heard that there is

648
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,910
an English teacher at Erzhong School

649
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,550
who is quite good

650
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,630
Should I sign you up?

651
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,230
No need, Mom

652
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,870
It's not necessary

653
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,750
Keep it for now

654
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,230
I'm gonna review now

655
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,310
The medicine is too hot

656
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,870
Remember to let it cool down before drinking

657
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,800
Don't worry

658
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,270
What's this?

659
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,910
Raw eggs

660
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,230
My dad said

661
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,310
drinking raw eggs is good for the throat

662
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,750
This is our Xia family's

663
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,950
secret recipe

664
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,550
Can I not drink it?

665
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,510
No

666
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,230
How does it feel?

667
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,510
Xiaohua, don't vomit

668
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,310
Protect your throat

669
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,030
Xiaohua

670
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,430
Xiaohua

671
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,550
Radish

672
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,590
Radish

673
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,110
Eating radish helps with breathing

674
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,310
It's perfect for you

675
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,750
Should I eat radish just to sing a song?

676
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,150
Just admit that your breath is blocked

677
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,030
Just eat it

678
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,230
Stop eating radish

679
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,830
You're not a rabbit

680
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,190
Are you planning to

681
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,190
make me eat something else?

682
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,470
My grandmother said

683
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,630
eating garlic is good for a voice

684
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,590
that can't reach high notes

685
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,670
It has a special effect

686
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,550
If you can't handle raw garlic,

687
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,190
you can try this fermented garlic

688
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,990
Although it's sweeter,

689
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:47,950
it has a better texture

690
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,150
But it's definitely not as good as raw garlic

691
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,550
Look, I'm chewing it now

692
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,150
It really works

693
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,710
Is your throat still okay?

694
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,830
Should I give you another piece?

695
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,470
No

696
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,190
Please, don't make me eat

697
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,270
anything anymore

698
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,990
Stop torturing me

699
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,350
How about I'll just

700
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,430
recite a poem on stage

701
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,590
Anyway,

702
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,910
no one expects me to win

703
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,870
I think that's a good idea

704
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,670
Or just let me go back to playing basketball

705
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,510
No

706
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,390
How can you be so upset?

707
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,870
We cannot give up easily

708
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,150
There're so many teachers and students

709
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,550
waiting for us to win

710
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,790
Does the school deserve our efforts?

711
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,150
Or should we leave it to Ling Dong?

712
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,670
What does Ling Dong count for?

713
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,910
Attention, everyone

714
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,590
Attention, everyone

715
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,030
Now we've got the latest news

716
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,750
Congratulations to Class 5, Grade 2

717
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,950
Ling Dong

718
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,350
has won the first prize in the physics competition

719
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,070
Chen Luyang

720
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,710
won the second prize

721
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,030
They have brought honor to our school

722
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,310
Let's give the warmest

723
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,910
and most sincere applause

724
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,390
to these two students

725
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,430
Congratulations to them

726
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,950
Well done, Ling Dong

727
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,990
Where are you going, Lan Jinghui?

728
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,630
We've now known

729
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,550
that after how many collisions

730
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,310
the rebound height of the particle

731
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,350
is less than 0.01 meters

732
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,390
Let's take a look at the last question

733
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,710
Well, Ling...

734
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:31,830
Ling Dong

735
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,510
Ling Dong

736
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,670
It seems like you're the only one

737
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,870
who solved this in the competition class

738
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,790
Tell us about

739
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:38,950
your thought process

740
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,710
Yes

741
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,310
Many of us

742
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,710
failed on the last question

743
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,630
Please tell us quickly

744
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,470
Ling Dong, share with us

745
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,230
Please share

746
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,030
Tell us quickly

747
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,150
Teacher, I figured it out too

748
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,510
Now with the latest news

749
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,070
Ling Dong from Class 5, Grade 2

750
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,270
will represent Chenjun Middle School

751
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,310
to join in another competition

752
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,270
He'll participate in

753
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:13,310
the talent show selection

754
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,470
Who is it?

755
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,470
Who is shouting on the rooftop?

756
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,350
It's dangerous. Come down quickly

757
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,430
Who is it?

758
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:45,910
Director Zhang

759
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,030
About the physics competition

760
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,510
I have some details to ask you

761
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,670
I see, we'll talk later

762
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,230
No, Director

763
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,390
It might be urgent

764
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,390
The competition is about to start

765
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:58,190
Well...

766
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,670
Come to my office
