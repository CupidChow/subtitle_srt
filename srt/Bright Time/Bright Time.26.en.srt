[Episode 26]

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,560
Ma Yiming

4
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,240
Is she from your school, right?

5
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,680
Xu Mengyu, isn't it?

6
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,880
Why is she here to watch us play?

7
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,560
I'll be back in a moment

8
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,960
Ma Yiming, where are you going?

9
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,760
You're leaving us to play two against three?

10
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,280
Sister Meng

11
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,840
Why are you here?

12
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,560
I'm facing a writing block

13
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,160
So I'm here

14
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,880
to find some inspiration

15
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,560
Ma Yiming, hurry up

16
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,960
You guys are training seriously

17
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,160
Of course

18
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Our team is really good

19
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,360
In our last game...

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,720
Ma Yiming, hurry up

21
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,800
Coming

22
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,320
Sister Meng, I'll go back first

23
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,800
Nice shot. Let's go

24
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,840
Let's go

25
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,400
Senior

26
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,080
Mengyu, you're here

27
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,240
I just finished

28
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,360
Let's have a meal together

29
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:15,960
Let's go

30
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,360
Let's go

31
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,320
Let's go

32
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,880
Goodbye

33
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,680
Let's go

34
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,440
Good morning, disciple

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,320
Good morning

36
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,640
I've finished homework

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
and the notes

38
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,080
So bored

39
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,440
Xiaohua

40
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,440
Do you have any problems

41
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
that you need help with?

42
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,080
Whether it's in life

43
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,880
or in academics

44
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,600
Let me help you

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:19,920
Nope

46
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,520
My desk mate is not here

47
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
I still can't get used to it

48
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,080
Didn't expect you to miss me so much

49
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,560
Well, that's perfect

50
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,880
I brought some gifts for you

51
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,920
You'll definitely like them

52
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Why are you here?

53
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,280
Who will take care of Auntie?

54
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,920
Someone is taking care of her for me

55
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,640
Why don't you take a few days off?

56
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,280
Stop drawing and look at this question first

57
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,360
What can be concluded from the given?

58
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,680
EF is parallel to CD

59
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,920
And EF

60
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,000
Look at EF

61
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,320
Class dismissed

62
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,080
Stand up

63
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,200
Goodbye, teacher

64
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,920
Let's go to the hospital to see Auntie

65
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Isn't Auntie getting discharged today?

66
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,160
Oh, yes

67
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,960
I forgot about this

68
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:45,800
Master

69
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:46,880
Do you remember

70
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,040
what day it is tomorrow?

71
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,640
Of course I know

72
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,120
You actually remember

73
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,640
Tomorrow is a free,

74
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,240
lazy

75
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,920
weekend where you can sleep until noon

76
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,720
I've been looking forward to it for five days

77
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,400
Do you think I wouldn't know?

78
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,320
That's not what I meant

79
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,560
Test my general knowledge, don't you?

80
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,040
International Toothbrushing Day

81
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,320
Forget it. You just know nothing

82
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,120
World Sleep Day

83
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,760
No, no

84
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,520
Well, at least let me know

85
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,240
the answer, right?

86
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,560
Really?

87
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,200
Yes

88
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,240
Quite sure

89
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,480
Then we should do something

90
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,040
Mom, I'm back

91
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,400
Mom

92
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,800
Mom

93
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,040
Surprise!

94
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,120
Happy birthday!

95
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,520
Happy birthday!

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,200
Happy birthday to you

97
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,040
Happy birthday to you

98
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,520
Happy birthday to you

99
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,240
Wishing you a Happy birthday to you

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,640
This is what we

101
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,960
prepared for you

102
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,920
Surprised?

103
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,480
These are all arranged by you guys

104
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,480
Personally arranged

105
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,320
Dongdong

106
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,640
I wish you

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,480
a happy 18th birthday

108
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,880
Thank you, Mom

109
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,640
Let's go

110
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,640
Blow out the candles, eat the cake, make a wish

111
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,240
Make a wish, eat the cake

112
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,520
Hurry, let's go

113
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,800
Here, give me your backpack

114
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,440
Let's go

115
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,920
Gravity

116
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,720
No, it's...

117
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Friendly gravity

118
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,560
Come on, light the candles

119
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,480
Light the candles

120
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,320
Good

121
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,600
Now, birthday boy, make a wish

122
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,840
Everyone says that

123
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,360
the wish made at 18

124
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,240
is the most effective one

125
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,240
So, I believe your wish

126
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,440
must be getting into the PKU

127
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,860
This is his birthday

128
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,880
Let him make his own wish

129
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,040
Why are you interfering?

130
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,320
How can you call it interfering?

131
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,760
He must be thinking the same

132
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,240
Right, Auntie?

133
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:29,880
Dongdong

134
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,360
I think they're right

135
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,920
You three are good friends

136
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,680
Why don't you make a wish

137
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,000
together to enter the PKU next year?

138
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,320
Auntie, you're so thoughtful

139
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
It's up to you

140
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,600
whether we can also get into the PKU?

141
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:43,680
Make a wish

142
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,960
I hope I can always

143
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,880
be with Mom

144
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,720
I hope Mom can always stay healthy

145
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,880
Happy birthday

146
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,840
Xiaohua, look at you

147
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,040
Be careful

148
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,960
Ms. Fang

149
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,520
This is my college application form

150
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,560
Why?

151
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,520
You're the top student in the class

152
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,120
You've even won awards in the national physics competition

153
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,760
With your grades,

154
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,920
getting into the PKU is almost guaranteed

155
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,400
Don't you wanna

156
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,120
go to the best university?

157
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,320
I've already made up my mind

158
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,840
It's okay

159
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,320
You don't have to decide so quickly

160
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,560
And this time,

161
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,800
it's just a simulation

162
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,920
There's still a chance to change

163
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,400
Ling Dong

164
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,720
You need to know

165
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,720
the PKU is a place

166
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,760
that everyone is always dreamed of

167
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,760
You're capable

168
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,280
Why do you wanna give up

169
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,040
such a good opportunity?

170
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,960
And does your family know

171
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,800
about your choice?

172
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,080
Ling Dong, can I ask

173
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,720
what does this have to do

174
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,560
with your recent absence

175
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,120
If there's anything at home

176
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,440
you can talk to me...

177
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,320
Ms. Fang

178
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,760
It's my personal choice

179
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,200
Alright, I won't force you

180
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,160
There's still a chance

181
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,240
You can think it through

182
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,400
You wanna go to Rong University

183
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,320
You already know that

184
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,240
I didn't mean to listen

185
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,120
during the day

186
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,200
It was just a coincidence

187
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,320
I heard

188
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,800
Ms. Fang talking to Director Zhang

189
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,960
that you won't go to the PKU

190
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,160
because of your mom

191
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,120
But your mom

192
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,000
has already been discharged

193
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,080
Her health has always been poor

194
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,320
I have to take care of her

195
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,920
What about your own dreams?

196
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,120
What about your life and dreams?

197
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,880
When I was young

198
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,000
I saw my dad with my own eyes

199
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,560
being sent to the emergency room

200
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,240
But he didn't come out alive

201
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,520
So this time

202
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,960
when I saw my mom

203
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,520
being sent into the emergency room

204
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,640
I told myself

205
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,040
I've already lost my dad

206
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,160
I can't lose my mom too

207
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,560
Alright

208
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,160
I support you

209
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,760
Are you serious?

210
00:13:59,440 --> 00:13:59,840
I'm serious

211
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,760
I've thought about it carefully

212
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,640
If it were me

213
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,040
I'd definitely make the same decision

214
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,080
Don't think too much. Let's go

215
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,960
Let's go

216
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,240
Mom

217
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,800
Mom

218
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,920
Dongdong, you're back

219
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,360
I made a bowl of noodles for you

220
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,200
Come and try it

221
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,240
Mom

222
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,800
Didn't the doctor say

223
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,920
that you should rest?

224
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,040
How could you even cook?

225
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,080
It's alright to move a little

226
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,720
Come and try it

227
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,120
Eat it quickly

228
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,360
There are two delicious side dishes

229
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,520
Mom

230
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,440
How is it? Is it delicious?

231
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,640
Delicious

232
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,000
Unconsciously

233
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
you've already grown up

234
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
You'll be leaving me

235
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,480
and going to college soon

236
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,400
Mom, I won't leave you

237
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
Your teacher called me

238
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,880
Said you chose Rong University

239
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,920
Dongdong

240
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,120
This university choice is very important

241
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,200
You can't be so vague

242
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,680
And Mom doesn't want

243
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,480
you to make such a hasty decision

244
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,320
Dongdong, listen to me

245
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,600
Mom knows

246
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,440
you are worried about my health

247
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,160
But your future

248
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,960
is more important than my health

249
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,720
Besides

250
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,280
didn't you always wanna

251
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,400
study physics at the PKU?

252
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,040
You're always good

253
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,320
You will definitely get in

254
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,400
And last time

255
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,760
you made plans

256
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,360
with your classmates, right?

257
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,480
Mom

258
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,120
But now

259
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,440
I really don't wanna go to the PKU

260
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,680
I just wanna be with you

261
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,120
This is my dream

262
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,040
But by doing this,

263
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,120
you'll definitely regret it

264
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,240
You know what?

265
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,920
It's a great deal for your whole life

266
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
I think

267
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,080
the biggest thing in my life

268
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,920
is this family

269
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,080
Being able to be with you

270
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,680
When I made my birthday wish

271
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,480
I wished for your good health

272
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,000
and to always be with you

273
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,920
And you know me

274
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,280
Whether it's at Rong University or the PKU

275
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,600
I will have a bright future

276
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,040
No, you...

277
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,240
I've already told you

278
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,160
Why can't you listen?

279
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,880
I don't wanna

280
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,560
burden you because of me

281
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,920
You know that?

282
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,800
Mom

283
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,320
Before you were hospitalized

284
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,160
I had already decided

285
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,840
to go to Rong University

286
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,400
I just wanted to be with you

287
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,520
And...

288
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,000
It's only the two of us in our family

289
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,520
I really don't wanna be apart

290
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,040
But...

291
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:55,760
Mom

292
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,480
This is my choice

293
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,520
I have my own ideas

294
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,560
You want me to go to the PKU

295
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,440
but that's not what I want

296
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,080
It's what you think I want

297
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,280
I believe I can be with you

298
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,160
take care of you

299
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,480
That's more important than the PKU

300
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,440
So, Mom

301
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,560
Just this once

302
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,920
Listen to me, okay?

303
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,880
I know you want the best for me

304
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,240
But...

305
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,640
I always feel like I'm holding you back

306
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,240
Such a big decision

307
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,560
Why didn't you

308
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
discuss it with me before?

309
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,240
Mom

310
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,720
Why isn't there an egg on the noodles today?

311
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,000
You want fried eggs?

312
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,280
Then wait a moment

313
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,560
Don't interrupt me

314
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,200
Mom

315
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,600
I've been considering it

316
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,280
for a long time

317
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,080
It's not a sudden impulse

318
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,520
Don't you wanna make me happy?

319
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,360
But...

320
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,840
Alright, mom

321
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,600
How can we eat without eggs?

322
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,440
Okay

323
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,520
Just wait a moment, it will be ready soon

324
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,720
Thank you, mom

325
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,480
It's ready

326
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,160
Smile

327
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,200
Three, two, one

328
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
Cheese

329
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,480
Wait

330
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,080
Let's do it again. It didn't turn out well

331
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,520
Three, two, one

332
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,600
Cheese

333
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,920
That's good

334
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,600
What are your plans for the summer vacation?

335
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,760
What plans?

336
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,400
I'm gonna attend an art training camp

337
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,160
I have classes every day

338
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,280
That sounds tough

339
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,560
Feel pain and pleasure

340
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,880
Well done

341
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,120
I haven't taken a photo yet

342
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,800
And what about you?

343
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,560
I'll be at home with my mom

344
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,680
What else?

345
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,320
To make sure you study

346
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,520
No thanks, I'm good

347
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,480
Ma Yiming

348
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,200
What's up?

349
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
What are your plans for the summer vacation?

350
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,400
I have basketball training

351
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,840
And then I'll be playing with the college team

352
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,480
in matches

353
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,320
Good luck

354
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,480
I'm rooting for you

355
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,880
Don't embarrass me

356
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,440
Of course not

357
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,320
Qintian, it's time for a long break

358
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,200
Why are you sighing?

359
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,640
I don't like long breaks at all

360
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,840
Whenever there's a break, I'm all alone at home

361
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,880
It's so boring

362
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,720
If you're bored,

363
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,440
I can play with you

364
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,240
Nope

365
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,480
If it's you who'll play with me

366
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,960
It's either studying or studying

367
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,560
I don't wanna study during the holidays

368
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,960
I'm so worried

369
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,800
As soon as the holidays start,

370
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,600
all sorts of relatives come to my house

371
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,720
visiting

372
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,480
All kinds of aunts and uncles, you know

373
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,920
People I know, people I don't know,

374
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,680
those who can be called by name,

375
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,600
those who can't be called by name,

376
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,400
and even those

377
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,640
who are younger than me

378
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,960
Once they come to my house,

379
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,440
they make a mess, cause a commotion,

380
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,640
and rummage through my things

381
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,760
It's so annoying

382
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,880
I have absolutely

383
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,040
no such troubles

384
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,160
Cousin

385
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,440
Cousin

386
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,320
Su Xiaomei, is it really you?

387
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,960
Firstly, I'm not Su Xiaomei

388
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,280
My Chinese name is Su Xi

389
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,120
My English name is Susie

390
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,600
And

391
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,400
I've grown up already

392
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:33,840
Please

393
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Don't call me Su Xiaomei anymore

394
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,360
Secondly,

395
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,600
I'm on vacation at my grandmother's

396
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,240
and visit you as well

397
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,000
Su Xi

398
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:44,960
Is that really you?

399
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,720
Then who else could it be?

400
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,600
Do we need a password?

401
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Because women change so much

402
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,680
I really can't recognize you

403
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,200
anymore

404
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,920
So, just to be safe,

405
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,000
I have to test you

406
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,920
What's your game password?

407
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,720
2222

408
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,360
And my...

409
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,240
Your bank card password

410
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,080
is also 2222

411
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,440
I...

412
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,280
Phone password

413
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,840
is also 2222

414
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,560
All your passwords

415
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,280
are 2222

416
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,840
Only you would

417
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,360
choose such a simple password

418
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,160
Su Xiaomei, is that really you?

419
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,520
Well, it's not me who's saying this

420
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,200
but your outfit...

421
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,120
isn't it a bit too exaggerated?

422
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,760
Let me tell you

423
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,240
Mrs Chang Xiuying

424
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
is a quite traditional

425
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,200
Chinese lady

426
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,240
But with your style

427
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,480
you should tone it down when talking

428
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,680
You can't be so opinionated

429
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,760
talking to people like you're rapping

430
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,840
It will scare her

431
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,920
Have you even listened to me?

432
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,240
Okay, I got it

433
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,280
Let me change my outfit

434
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,720
Grandma

435
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,920
Oh, you're here

436
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,560
Grandma, I've missed you so much

437
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,480
Xiaomei

438
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,280
Oh my god

439
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,520
I missed you too

440
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,360
Dad

441
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
And Grandma

442
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,680
You can't call her Su Xiaomei anymore

443
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,960
She's now Su Xi, it's trendy

444
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,480
No, no, no

445
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,280
I really like

446
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,400
when others call me Xiaomei

447
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,440
It feels more intimate

448
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,640
Let me take a look

449
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,480
You've grown taller and even more beautiful

450
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,840
Such a beautiful young lady

451
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,640
Xiaomei

452
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,880
You've really changed a lot

453
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,440
Yeah

454
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,400
What's going on with you?

455
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,400
You suddenly showed up

456
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,080
without even making a phone call

457
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,800
I could pick you up

458
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,400
It's been a while since you've been here

459
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,720
Stay a little longer

460
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,360
Spend some quality time with Grandma

461
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,440
She missed you a lot

462
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,200
If there's anything else,

463
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,320
go find your cousin

464
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,200
Dad, no

465
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,360
I have something to do

466
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
It's okay, Uncle

467
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,640
Even if he doesn't wanna accompany me

468
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,720
I'll pester him until he does

469
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:21,800
Alright

470
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,320
If he dares to bully you

471
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,080
tell me

472
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,200
I'll teach him a lesson

473
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,480
Dad, I'm not gonna bully her

474
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,040
Come on, let's go

475
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,440
Xiaomei

476
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,080
Let me show you to your room

477
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,280
Please help me with these luggage, cousin

478
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,200
Help me take them upstairs

479
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,240
When did I promise you

480
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,360
to take these luggage upstairs?

481
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,080
Grandma, I can't carry them

482
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,800
Xiaohui

483
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,560
Just help your sister, okay?

484
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,840
She's a girl

485
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,960
You're a boy

486
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,120
You should take care of her

487
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,120
Yes

488
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:50,760
Let's go

489
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,080
Su Xiaomei

490
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,440
What did you pack in here?

491
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,080
Dumbbell? It's so heavy

492
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,520
Be careful

493
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,720
These are all my treasures

494
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,760
You, a young man,

495
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,120
You eat three bowls of rice for a meal

496
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,560
How heavy can this be?

497
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,960
It's not heavy either

498
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,200
Carry it upstairs

499
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,040
Dad

500
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,480
How can you just throw this around?

501
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,080
Where did I throw it?

502
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,000
I put it on the bed

503
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,560
My brown bottle

504
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,920
So cute

505
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,480
And my magic water

506
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,120
And my perfume

507
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,440
What's all this?

508
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,640
You know nothing

509
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,280
They're enough to buy

510
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,400
several game consoles from you

511
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,800
My little cutie

512
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,840
You endured the bumpy ride with me

513
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,920
Thank you so much

514
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,480
Alright

515
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,280
Don't wipe it

516
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,400
It's still clean

517
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,160
There's nothing to wipe

518
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,520
Be quick

519
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,280
Clean up quickly

520
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,000
and then let's go out

521
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,160
What are you doing?

522
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,520
The task Mrs. Chang Xiuying

523
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,440
assigned to me

524
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,640
Take you out shopping

525
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,320
To eat, drink, and have fun

526
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,880
I'm not going

527
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,920
I have jet lag

528
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,840
You go alone

529
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,840
You flew over from Singapore

530
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,360
Is there even a jet lag?

531
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,520
I don't wanna go

532
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,240
I wanna binge-watch my shows

533
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,640
But you said it

534
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,920
I'm gonna play with friends

535
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,720
Don't go find Miss Chang Xiuying

536
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,640
and complain about me

537
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,200
No, I won't

538
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,040
Explain it yourself

539
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,800
It's okay. Just go

540
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,440
Don't mind me

541
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,120
Really?

542
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,280
Bye

543
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,600
Hello

544
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,720
Everything is going smoothly

545
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,320
Don't worry

546
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,640
It's okay

547
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,880
I've already planned it

548
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,120
I'll go to his room later

549
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,840
and take care of this

550
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,080
Okay

551
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,400
Cousin

552
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,000
Cousin

553
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,560
You...

554
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,560
What are you doing here?

555
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,040
What am I doing here?

556
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,160
This is my room

557
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,520
What do you think?

558
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,840
Then where else would I be?

559
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,840
Aren't you gonna

560
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,880
hang out with friends?

561
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,120
Aren't I playing right now?

562
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,840
Didn't you say you wanted to watch a show?

563
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,200
What are you doing here then?

564
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,640
Exactly

565
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,760
To watch a show

566
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,040
I...

567
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,400
This's...

568
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,720
I don't know the Wi-Fi password?

569
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,840
What's the Wi-Fi password?

570
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,600
I'll send it to you on your phone

571
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,480
Why aren't you leaving?

572
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,000
I'll go

573
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,080
Let me tell you

574
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,960
Don't disturb me while I'm studying

575
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,000
This isn't studying

576
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,080
You're playing games

577
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,400
Can't you study while playing games?

578
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,400
Improvement comes from gaming

579
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,320
Let me teach you

580
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,840
I'll help you rank up

581
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,400
Really?

582
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,200
Really

583
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:44,920
Really

584
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,600
No need

585
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,920
I really can teach you

586
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,640
Thank you

587
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,560
Your mom is recovering well

588
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,520
Doctor

589
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,760
What else should we pay attention to

590
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,720
after we go back home?

591
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,760
Overall, there's nothing major

592
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,920
Just rest more

593
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,040
when you're back home

594
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,080
Don't overexert yourselves

595
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,360
If you feel any discomfort in your heart,

596
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,880
come to the hospital for a check-up

597
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,200
See? I told you

598
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,160
There's no need for a check-up

599
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,440
if there's nothing else

600
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,680
Mom

601
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,600
Health is a big deal

602
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,100
Your son is right

603
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,780
Better safe than sorry

604
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,600
Yes

605
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,400
Okay then

606
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,400
We'll be going now

607
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:30,960
Thank you

608
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,720
You're welcome

609
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,440
Thank you, doctor

610
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,320
Goodbye

611
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,000
Goodbye

612
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,200
I told you, there's nothing wrong

613
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,080
You see

614
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,880
You're too nervous

615
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,600
Mom, we'd better be careful

616
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,920
Alright. Don't worry

617
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,300
I'll make you something delicious when we get home

618
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,400
Brother

619
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,560
I think your room

620
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,520
is really nice

621
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,240
Look at the layout and the decorations

622
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,040
And even the lighting

623
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,080
I love it

624
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,960
Your room and my room

625
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,320
are no different

626
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,840
He's so handsome

627
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,200
I know

628
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,240
Explain clearly to me

629
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,480
Is it him or me?

630
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,120
I mean...

631
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,160
Don't I look better than him?

632
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,480
You're the best-looking one

633
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,040
Your bed

634
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,240
is so hard

635
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,120
I like sleeping on a hard bed

636
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,400
Can you stop talking nonsense?

637
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,040
Your bed

638
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,160
is exactly the same as mine

639
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,760
Your room

640
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,240
has such a nice environment

641
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,480
What are you up to do?

642
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,200
I...

643
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,400
Can I

644
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,440
switch room with you?

645
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,920
I don't believe

646
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,120
I can't handle you, you silly dog

647
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,680
Slow down

648
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,520
Finally, you're back

649
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,440
Mom, do you wanna eat oranges?

650
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,920
I'll peel them

651
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,120
Please sit

652
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,600
Okay

653
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,920
Dongdong

654
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,000
What's your birthday wish?

655
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,160
Mom

656
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,920
Didn't I tell you already?

657
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,560
I know

658
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,640
Mom just wants you

659
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,160
to say it again

660
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,640
My birthday wish is...

661
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,160
I hope you stay healthy

662
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,240
And that I can always be by your side

663
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,280
Look

664
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,800
Your birthday wish

665
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,560
came true

666
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,440
Didn't the doctor say it?

667
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,960
He said that I'm fine

668
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,840
Everything is good

669
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,960
So I wanna discuss something with you

670
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,320
Mom

671
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,040
There's no need to discuss

672
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,040
We've talked about it before

673
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,440
No

674
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,280
I know you quite well

675
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,800
You can choose to stay

676
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,280
That's your choice

677
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,520
It's okay for me

678
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,520
But I just want

679
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,680
to discuss with you

680
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,840
Can I

681
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,920
go to the PKU with you?

682
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,560
I wanna see you enter the PKU

683
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,720
I wanna see my son succeed

684
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,400
Then I'll be happier

685
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,560
I don't want any regrets

686
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,200
Wherever you are

687
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,520
That's where Mom is

688
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,280
The house doesn't mean a family

689
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,360
Only people matter

690
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,400
What do you think?

691
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,400
Mom

692
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,680
Happy birthday

693
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,280
Ling Dong, happy birthday

694
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,200
This is for you

695
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,560
Your 18th birthday wish

696
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,160
will definitely come true

697
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,280
Ling Dong

698
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,680
Wish you get what you want

699
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,280
And for your path to be smooth
