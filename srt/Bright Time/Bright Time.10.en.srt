Bi Peng

4
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,350
Stand up

5
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,710
Teacher, I...

6
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,350
Stand up

7
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,550
Stand up

8
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,750
Ridiculous

9
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,750
You...

10
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,030
And you

11
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,430
Stand up

12
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,790
Teacher

13
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,510
Lan Jinghui also didn't hand in the phone

14
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,830
When did you collect it?

15
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,270
I had no idea

16
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,670
Hand it in quickly

17
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,070
I really had no idea

18
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,390
Stop pretending

19
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,790
It's a rule for so many years

20
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,590
How could you not know?

21
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,510
You...

22
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,030
Enough

23
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,710
I've written down your names

24
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,110
I'll tell Director Zhang later

25
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,070
Think about what to do

26
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:36,710
Did you hear?

27
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,150
Sit down first

28
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,310
Hurry up and answer the questions

29
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,990
Others, don't be affected

30
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,030
Bi Peng

31
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,110
I didn't expect you to be so shameless

32
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,750
No whispering

33
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:16,830
Class begins

34
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,590
Stand up

35
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,350
Hello, teacher

36
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,990
Morning, class. Sit down please

37
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,270
Class

38
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,950
You all saw

39
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,990
the midterm exam results, right?

40
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,790
Yes

41
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,070
A few students

42
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,350
made significant progress this time

43
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,070
Especially Xiao Xiaohua

44
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,950
Li Ruosi

45
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,230
And Lan Jinghui

46
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,310
Not even a big deal

47
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,990
Of course

48
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,510
Our class's overall ranking

49
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,550
has also improved significantly

50
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,990
You all did a great job

51
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,070
Ms. Fang

52
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,270
Is there a reward?

53
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,110
Yes

54
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,790
What is it?

55
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,150
Each of you will receive

56
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,350
a set of exam papers

57
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,270
This is a collection of

58
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,590
my years of studying

59
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,630
and teaching experience

60
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,550
I hope you'll treat it seriously

61
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,270
Alright?

62
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,630
Same tricks

63
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,310
Chen Luyang, distribute them

64
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,830
Thank you, Ms. Fang

65
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,110
You've made a progress this time

66
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,470
We moved up 50 places

67
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,870
If it weren't for my stomach

68
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,110
If I felt well

69
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,350
I could have done even better

70
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,630
Really?

71
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,830
Absolutely

72
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,590
Lan Jinghui

73
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,070
Go to the Director's office

74
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,270
after class

75
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,390
We have something to talk to you

76
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,630
No problem

77
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,630
Ms. Fang is too modest

78
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,350
Being praised in front of the whole class is not enough

79
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,510
They also praise privately

80
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,710
Please take a look at the exam papers first

81
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,310
I have something to

82
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,710
inform you

83
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,870
about our exam this time

84
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,630
These students

85
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,950
brought their phones into the exam room

86
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,710
with suspicion of cheating

87
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,630
So

88
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,790
I've invited you to come today

89
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,950
So that we can discuss

90
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,910
how to solve this problem

91
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,070
Director

92
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,990
I'll definitely educate him properly

93
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,350
Apologize to the Director

94
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,910
Director, I'm sorry

95
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,430
I promise there won't be a next time

96
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,470
I'm sorry, Director

97
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,350
We were wrong

98
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,150
Yes, we're sorry

99
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,910
Since you all admit it

100
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:38,990
No, no, no...

101
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,590
Director, why am I called?

102
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,990
I didn't cheat

103
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,350
I just forgot to hand in my phone

104
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,070
Why did you bring your phone to the exam?

105
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,470
What else could it be if not cheating?

106
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,030
I was wondering

107
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,310
how you did so well in math this time

108
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,510
Admit your mistake quickly

109
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,190
No

110
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,950
What's wrong with me doing well in math?

111
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,070
A few days ago

112
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,950
I got a perfect score in the middle school competition

113
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,590
Alright, stop making things up

114
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,430
You're still talking about middle school?

115
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,230
Why don't you bring out

116
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,830
your elementary school diploma?

117
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,150
A real man

118
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,310
should dare take responsibility

119
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,270
Don't believe me?

120
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,510
How can you make me believe you?

121
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,630
You're always at the bottom

122
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,030
and now you did so well

123
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,750
Now the phone is here

124
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,390
and the test paper is here

125
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,590
Can I just accuse you?

126
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,190
Mr. Lan

127
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,550
Just calm down first

128
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,630
Since you all

129
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,430
admit your mistakes

130
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,710
I'll announce

131
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,950
the school's decision

132
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,910
All the scores of these exams

133
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,350
are canceled

134
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,790
No, why cancel them?

135
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,830
I rarely do well

136
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,510
for once

137
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,510
Don't interrupt the director

138
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,630
I only did well because I copied

139
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,910
I'm always at the bottom no matter what

140
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,150
Right?

141
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,110
Then what's the point of me studying?

142
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,310
You just come back, huh

143
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,790
Look at the time

144
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,350
Where have you been?

145
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,430
I'm talking to you

146
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,270
Can you hear me?

147
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,950
Yes, I can

148
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,790
See how you acted at school?

149
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,910
Look at the other two students

150
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,990
They knew they were wrong

151
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,950
They admitted it

152
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,630
But you...

153
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,710
In front of so many parents, teachers

154
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,110
and students

155
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,270
you dare talk back to me

156
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,400
Do you think of me as your father?

157
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,070
Let me tell you

158
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,550
I'll be on a business trip in the next few days

159
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,990
You better behave yourself

160
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:33,830
Don't cause trouble

161
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,310
I'll take care of your matter

162
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,230
when I'm back

163
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,430
Why are you shouting?

164
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,390
Can't we have a civilized conversation?

165
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,910
Xiaohui

166
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,550
It's okay now

167
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:48,990
Let's have a meal

168
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,750
Grandma, I don't wanna eat

169
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,870
Xiaohui

170
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,190
Look at you

171
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,750
Let's take attendance

172
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:56,990
Ling Dong

173
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:57,630
Yes

174
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,790
Chen Luyang

175
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,590
Yes

176
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,750
Xiao Xiaohua

177
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,510
Yes

178
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,670
Lan Jinghui

179
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,430
Where is Lan Jinghui?

180
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,550
Teacher

181
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,110
Lan Jinghui hasn't come to school

182
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,230
He hasn't come to school

183
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,670
Ridiculous

184
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:11,870
Ma Yiming

185
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:12,630
Yes

186
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:13,910
Xu Chao

187
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,470
Yes

188
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,630
Xu Mengyu

189
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,110
Yes

190
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,710
Lan Jinghui, are you coming tomorrow?

191
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,790
I'll bring breakfast for you

192
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,630
Fool Hui

193
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,030
Fried chicken available in the cafeteria

194
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,510
You won't be able to eat it if you don't come

195
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,350
Brother Hui, when are you coming back?

196
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,030
The basketball team can't be without you

197
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,390
Do you guys know

198
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,910
Lan Jinghui is gonna be expelled

199
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,070
Is it true?

200
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,870
It's true

201
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,590
Skipping class, cheating

202
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,270
It's impossible

203
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,790
Brother Hui can't be expelled

204
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,990
Why is it impossible?

205
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,470
He did eveything

206
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,310
that Li Ruosi said just now

207
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:41,710
Yes

208
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,550
As a student

209
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,630
His primary task

210
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,790
is to study well

211
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,390
This is really dangerous

212
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,070
Yeah

213
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,430
Right

214
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,430
What are you guys talking about?

215
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,830
Is he still your classmate?

216
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,750
You guys are so heartless

217
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,470
Exactly

218
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,430
I'm just worried about him

219
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,710
You better worry about yourself first

220
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,390
No

221
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,830
I'm going

222
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,430
to get Lan Jinghui to come back

223
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,830
I'm gonna buy him delicious food

224
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,670
I'll go to his house every day

225
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,750
and bring him breakfast

226
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,470
Xiaohua

227
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,750
Does it work?

228
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,630
I...

229
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,710
Ling Dong

230
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,670
Is there any ways?

231
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:19,830
Yeah

232
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,270
Ling Dong

233
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,390
Do you have any good ideas?

234
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,630
Well

235
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,790
Don't worry for now

236
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,150
I'll go find Ms. Fang

237
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,630
I know

238
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,830
That's how it is now

239
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,750
His head teacher

240
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,430
Including academic affairs office

241
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,230
All the teachers

242
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,510
are trying to contact him

243
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,630
but we cannot reach him

244
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,830
Don't worry for now

245
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,510
Alright

246
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,030
You are out of town

247
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,430
You can't help at all

248
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,630
I will contact you

249
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,190
once I've found him

250
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,590
That's it

251
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,390
He's so stubborn

252
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,230
even at this age

253
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,670
Is cheating justifiable?

254
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,590
Cheating means no need to attend class

255
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,630
Director

256
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,830
We haven't investigated it clearly yet

257
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,870
What if we wrongfully accuse him?

258
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,830
How could we accuse him?

259
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,110
I've told you so many times

260
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,590
Lan Jinghui, Ling Dong

261
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,750
Keep an eye on them

262
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,510
Keep a close watch

263
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,310
It's my fault for not handling this well

264
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,470
Make a phone call and find someone

265
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,350
How is it going?

266
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,550
What's the situation?

267
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,550
How's it going?

268
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,110
Wait a moment

269
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,390
I'll be right back

270
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,110
Director Zhang, Ms. Fang

271
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,110
Why are you here?

272
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:53,710
I can prove

273
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,710
that Lan Jinghui didn't cheat

274
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,550
Teacher

275
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,270
I've been helping him recently

276
00:14:59,270 --> 00:14:59,910
with his tutoring

277
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,270
These are his own work

278
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,310
Indeed, it's Lan Jinghui's handwriting

279
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,590
Especially this set of competition questions

280
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,070
He can answer all of them correctly

281
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,030
So I don't think he would cheat

282
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,550
He can completely

283
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,230
rely on his own abilities

284
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,150
to achieve these scores

285
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,910
It seems that Lan Jinghui

286
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,030
has indeed put in a lot of effort

287
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,070
I told you it's possible

288
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,950
that we misunderstood him

289
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,310
Go back first

290
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,870
Find Lan Jinghui first

291
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,630
Okay?

292
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:32,790
Director

293
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,070
Maybe he's not

294
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,390
in a good mood right now

295
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,990
He's in a bad mood?

296
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,590
How could he be in a bad mood?

297
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,110
Ling Dong

298
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,350
I can understand

299
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,510
I also understand

300
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:48,750
Just rest assured

301
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,990
Director Zhang and I

302
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,830
will definitely clear his name

303
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,950
Go back to class first

304
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,030
Where did Lan Jinghui go?

305
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,030
I don't know either

306
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,590
He doesn't answer calls

307
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,270
or reply to messages

308
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,190
Let's not speculate

309
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,350
Maybe he's just sleeping at home

310
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:17,950
No way

311
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,630
I called his grandma

312
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,830
She didn't know he skipped class

313
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,510
Let's not make baseless claims

314
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,470
So where could he have gone?

315
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,030
Brother Hui

316
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,830
Hey, Brother Hui

317
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,030
If you don't answer your phone soon

318
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,070
I'll have to call the police

319
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,110
Hands-free

320
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,030
Hands-free

321
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,110
Why are you calling the police?

322
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,310
I didn't do anything

323
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,190
I'll tell you when I call you

324
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,030
Don't worry about it

325
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,550
As long as you're okay

326
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,270
Why aren't you coming to school

327
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,270
since you're fine

328
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,870
What's the point of going to school?

329
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,030
Then...

330
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,950
Tell us where you are

331
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,750
We'll find you after school

332
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,670
Don't come

333
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,510
I have something urgent to do

334
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,950
That's it. Bye

335
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,470
Good

336
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,150
Good

337
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,430
Good

338
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,070
Good

339
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,870
Great

340
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,670
You're so great

341
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,470
Amazing

342
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,510
Amazing

343
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,430
Lan Jinghui

344
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,990
Another round

345
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,630
Haven't we finished playing?

346
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,430
Why are you still playing?

347
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,110
No, let's play another round

348
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,670
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

349
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,990
I said

350
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,430
Not to mention another round

351
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,150
You still won't win with ten more rounds

352
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,390
What did you say? Say it again

353
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,830
I said

354
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,590
no matter ten laps

355
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,870
or a hundred laps

356
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,070
He still won't make it

357
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,430
Besides

358
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,190
I just...

359
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,390
You wanna fight, don't you?

360
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,990
Come on

361
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,510
Stop it

362
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,910
Lan Jinghui

363
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,110
What are you gonna do?

364
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,480
Lan Jinghui

365
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,160
Lan Jinghui

366
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,560
Why aren't you gonna class?

367
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,640
Is it your business?

368
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,360
If you're leaving, then it's my business

369
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,520
Soon

370
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,440
It won't be your business

371
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,280
I'm about to leave

372
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,080
Don't you understand?

373
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,080
And I'm leaving

374
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,160
You can relax a bit

375
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,520
Right?

376
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,480
I don't feel tired either

377
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,000
Forget it

378
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,120
You've been helping me with my studies for so long

379
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm still last

380
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
You've made a lot of progress

381
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,920
You know what?

382
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,600
In their eyes

383
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,400
I'm still the same

384
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:15,910
Let go

385
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,510
Lan Jinghui

386
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,150
Brother Hui

387
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,230
Lan Jinghui

388
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,310
What's wrong with you?

389
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,750
Why did you even get injured?

390
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:30,870
It's fine

391
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,510
I've been running around

392
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,310
with the Director for your sake

393
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,550
Let's go back to school and talk

394
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,790
I'm not going back

395
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,430
What did you say?

396
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,750
I said I'm not going back

397
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,990
Skipping class and fighting

398
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,550
You're right, aren't you?

399
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,470
Director

400
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,870
It's not entirely Lan Jinghui's fault

401
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,990
After all, there is a reason

402
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,310
Yes, Director

403
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,390
Anyone who is wrongly accused

404
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,670
wouldn't feel good about it

405
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,470
Exactly

406
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,630
This's not entirely

407
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,110
Lan Jinghui's fault

408
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,230
Brother Hui, come back with us

409
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:01,870
Is that okay?

410
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,510
Let's go back to school

411
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,110
I'm not going back

412
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,870
Lan Jinghui

413
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,030
Your classmates came all the way

414
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,270
to bring you back to school

415
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,070
What are you trying to do?

416
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,510
Do you really wanna be punished?

417
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,670
Lan Jinghui

418
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,310
You've made such great progress this time

419
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,470
Are you just gonna give up like this?

420
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,790
And Director just called your dad

421
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,950
and apologized to him already

422
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,990
After he found out about this,

423
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,710
he felt very guilty

424
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,150
and wanted to come back to make it up to you

425
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,550
And now you're doing this

426
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,910
Isn't it making things  more serious?

427
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,430
Ms. Fang

428
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,190
Please don't bring up my dad

429
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,550
I just don't wanna study now

430
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,590
I feel like no matter how I study,

431
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,030
everyone thinks

432
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,710
I'm the last

433
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,350
Lan Jinghui

434
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,030
Alright, Ms. Fang

435
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,670
I know you've put in a lot of effort

436
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,750
with me

437
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,990
But I don't think it's necessary

438
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,110
Do you know

439
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:54,710
how serious this matter is?

440
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,590
I have to discuss

441
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,390
with the school leaders how to handle it

442
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,830
Can you straighten your attitude?

443
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,390
Thank you

444
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,350
Director

445
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,670
I'm taking it seriously

446
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:06,830
I'm serious

447
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,550
How about this?

448
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,430
Get to the point

449
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,070
You Just expel me

450
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,310
No...

451
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,710
What's wrong with him?

452
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,510
Director

453
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,870
Ms. Fang

454
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,230
Actually, I think

455
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,590
you should apologize to Lan Jinghui

456
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,350
for this matter

457
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,550
Okay, today we'll talk about

458
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,710
the fundamental questions of philosophy

459
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,430
The fundamental questions of philosophy

460
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,510
are about the relationship

461
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,110
between thinking and existence

462
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,510
Different answers to this question

463
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,670
are the only criteria for distinguishing

464
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,790
materialism and idealism

465
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,150
Idealism can be divided

466
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,910
into two stages in history

467
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,350
Objective idealism

468
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,350
and subjective idealism

469
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,910
And materialism can be divided

470
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,110
into three forms

471
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,190
The first one...

472
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,670
historical materialism

473
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,550
And the second...

474
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,110
modern metaphysical materialism

475
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,990
And dialectical materialism

476
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,990
and historical materialism

477
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,030
Grandma, I'm back

478
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,030
What are you cooking? It smells so good

479
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,870
Xiaohui is back

480
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,310
Guess who's here

481
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,870
Who's here?

482
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:45,750
Why are you here?

483
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,230
What do you mean?

484
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:48,750
No, wait

485
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,990
Of course, it's to visit my...

486
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,510
Auntie, of course

487
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,910
Who's your auntie?

488
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,470
Xiaohui

489
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,830
Be polite

490
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,750
to talk to your uncle

491
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,550
Go wash your hands and eat

492
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,030
Did you hear me?

493
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,990
Does your grandma know

494
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,910
that you wanna skip the school?

495
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,270
Lower your voice

496
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,630
Are you coming back to school with me or not?

497
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,830
Who am I to you?

498
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:14,870
No

499
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,270
Grandma

500
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,910
Stop shouting

501
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,470
Is that my grandma or your grandma?

502
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,630
No need to call me so loudly

503
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,670
Are you hungry?

504
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,830
Come and eat

505
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,630
Okay

506
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,790
Grandma, I'll be right there

507
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,230
Mind your words and actions

508
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,710
Mind your words and actions

509
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,590
Come, drink the soup

510
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,270
Thanks, auntie

511
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,910
Uncle

512
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,270
How's Xiaohui doing

513
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,710
in school?

514
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,510
Don't tell grandma everything

515
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,990
Stop talking nonsense

516
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,790
What?

517
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,590
Didn't you say it?

518
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,550
Auntie

519
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,350
Xiaohui is a bit shy

520
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,270
He's too embarrassed to say it

521
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,110
You may not know

522
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,070
his great achievements in school

523
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,350
What great achievements

524
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,150
could he have in school?

525
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,670
Look at him

526
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,470
Xiaohui

527
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:25,910
Show me

528
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,230
Let me see

529
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,630
Let us see

530
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,470
Show grandma

531
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,990
Xiaohui

532
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,590
Why are you so troublesome?

533
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,830
Did you fight with others again?

534
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,590
No, no, no

535
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,430
Grandma, I would never

536
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,310
fight with someone outside

537
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,470
Listen to me

538
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,430
This is definitely

539
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,150
a misunderstanding

540
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,110
No

541
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,750
Explain it

542
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,190
Don't talk to me

543
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,070
Tell her quickly

544
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:48,950
What do you want me to do?

545
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,150
Uncle

546
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,870
Uncle

547
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:53,990
Uncle

548
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,950
He knows

549
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,030
Just ask him

550
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,510
Uncle

551
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,150
Just say it

552
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:58,750
Tell her

553
00:24:59,230 --> 00:24:59,990
Well, here's the thing

554
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,230
Xiaohui loves playing basketball a lot

555
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,350
And he's very hardworking

556
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,870
During one training session,

557
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,190
he accidentally got injured

558
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,670
He is really good at basketball

559
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,150
He has really good physical fitness

560
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,510
Really good

561
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,230
Yes, good physical fitness

562
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,030
Eat more

563
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,070
Take care of your health

564
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,470
Take care

565
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,030
Come on, take care

566
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,990
Eat more, okay?

567
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:24,710
Eat more

568
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,870
Why so polite?

569
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,070
Are you going back to school with me?

570
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,590
No, never, ever

571
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,390
Definitely no

572
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,030
Auntie

573
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,630
I suddenly remembered something

574
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,590
I have to tell you

575
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,670
Okay, go ahead

576
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,710
He once

577
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,750
offended students from other schools

578
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,430
Xiaohui

579
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,310
Grandma, nothing like this happened

580
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,310
Don't listen to him

581
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,390
I would never do this

582
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,190
What's going on?

583
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,070
Let's talk about it later, okay?

584
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,030
Stop it

585
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,430
Are you going back or not?

586
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,670
It didn't happen, Grandma

587
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,390
We'll talk about it later

588
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,270
Auntie, here's the thing

589
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,870
He formed a band in our school

590
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,430
And then participated

591
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,350
in a talent show

592
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,070
He won the prize

593
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,870
So...

594
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,150
he made other school students

595
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,630
envy and hate him

596
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,550
Xiaohui has had a passion

597
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,550
for music since he was young

598
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,470
That's right

599
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,750
That's right

600
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,670
And it's not just for music

601
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,830
He's also popular

602
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,510
He's very helpful

603
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,110
When other bike broke,

604
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:17,790
he helped to pump air

605
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,990
And he even provided an air pump

606
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,830
And he treated the whole class to drinks

607
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,310
He remembered

608
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,910
everyone's favorite flavors

609
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,030
Isn't that right?

610
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,590
I remember one time,

611
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,750
one of our classmates

612
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,910
got pricked by a cactus

613
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,870
His hand was full of spines

614
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,710
Lan Jinghui plucked them out

615
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,510
one by one

616
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,830
Yes, slow and steady wins the race

617
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,910
Xiaohui

618
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,790
You did such great jobs

619
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,870
You're being helpful and kind

620
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,310
This should be praised

621
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,790
Okay, Grandma

622
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,950
Don't praise me for now

623
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,670
I suddenly remembered

624
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,470
that Ling Dong definitely has

625
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,590
something unfinished at home

626
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,350
Let's go

627
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,110
Let's go and deal with them

628
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,150
Just finish eating

629
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,950
Do I have something else to do?

630
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,830
Yes, I remember it very clearly

631
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,870
You definitely have something. Let's go

632
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:02,830
Yes

633
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,590
Is it something related to school?

634
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,430
Yes, of course. Let's go

635
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,150
Yes

636
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,430
Auntie

637
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:15,870
I remembered

638
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,870
there's something at school

639
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,190
Then I'll leave first

640
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,590
Let me tell you

641
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,870
Come to our house

642
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,510
What's going on at that school?

643
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,310
Xiaohui will see me off

644
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,070
You can just tell me...

645
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,790
I like listening

646
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,990
Come here more often

647
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,070
That's enough

648
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,190
The Director has already clarified it for you

649
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,310
It's time to go back to school

650
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,150
Let it go

651
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,430
Don't fool me anymore

652
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,750
No one cares about me

653
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:48,910
Even if I try my best,

654
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,750
no one will care about me

655
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,110
Xiao Xiaohua gave this to you

656
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,350
Even if she knows you won't go back to school,

657
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,350
she still buys breakfast for you

658
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,310
and takes notes for you

659
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,230
When someone speaks ill of you,

660
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,710
Xia Qingtian rolls up her sleeves

661
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,430
ready to fight

662
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,190
And Ma Yiming

663
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,430
He practices basketball

664
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,510
diligently every day

665
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,430
saying it's your dream

666
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,510
He won't give up

667
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:16,950
As you see

668
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,110
It's not that no one cares about you

669
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,230
Yet you choose to turn a blind eye

670
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,790
Only she can do

671
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,310
this kind of foolishness

672
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,390
Alright

673
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,110
I've got you the notes

674
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,190
I've said what I needed to say

675
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,150
See you tomorrow

676
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,510
My nephew

677
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,230
I told you

678
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,710
Don't call me nephew

679
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,390
Xiaohua

680
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,270
Do you think Lan Jinghui

681
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,510
would come to school today?

682
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,710
Ling Dong went to look for him

683
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:21,510
If he doesn't come

684
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,790
that would be too heartless

685
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,470
Who's speaking ill of me behind my back?

686
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,430
Lan Jinghui

687
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,670
Master, you finally came back

688
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,350
Was that a bad-mouth?

689
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,270
Master, I was just joking

690
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,830
Look

691
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,910
Breakfast for you

692
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,470
Well done

693
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:38,950
Master

694
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,110
You haven't come to class these days

695
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,870
What are you planning to do?

696
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:43,870
Don't worry

697
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,910
Since I'm here,

698
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,790
I naturally have a plan

699
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,310
Let me check

700
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,310
Come in

701
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,750
Lan Jinghui

702
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,190
You finally showed up

703
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,830
Lol

704
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,670
You're all here

705
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,070
I think it's about time for you to be back

706
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,390
What? Have you figured it out?

707
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,390
I've figured it out

708
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,750
About...

709
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,430
Just sit down. No need to be polite

710
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,630
I won't sit

711
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,230
Just stand and talk

712
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,150
These past few days

713
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,510
I've deeply reflected

714
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,390
on my mistakes

715
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:42,950
I'm sorry

716
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,750
Look at this if you don't believe me

717
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,470
Ms. Fang

718
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,790
What character is this?

719
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,470
This...

720
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,270
I couldn't see it clearly

721
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:58,990
This...

722
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,950
Now I can see it clearly

723
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,630
Jing

724
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,070
Jing, as in admitting one's fault

725
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,470
Yes

726
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,830
Quite good

727
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,190
But...

728
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,790
Apologizing to the Director alone is not enough

729
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,630
I understand

730
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:15,990
Me and Ms. Fang

731
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,550
We're just like a family

732
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,630
Well...

733
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,950
I know what to do

734
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,550
Okay

735
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,830
Lan Jinghui

736
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,950
You've grown up

737
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,870
And you, take a look at his self-reflection

738
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,030
See if it's well-written

739
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,830
If it's not enough,

740
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,630
get him a few thousand more words

741
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:37,950
Okay

742
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,110
No problem

743
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,630
Alright

744
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,230
Just kidding

745
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,230
Ms. Fang and I

746
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,990
have forgave you a long time ago

747
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,150
In handling this,

748
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,550
Ms. Fang and I

749
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,990
didn't fully understand the situation

750
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,310
We wrongly accused you

751
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,310
And made you suffer a lot

752
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,270
Today

753
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,670
Ms. Fang and I

754
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,990
will sincerely apologize to you

755
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,310
I'm sorry

756
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,790
No need

757
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,470
It's fine

758
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,870
I've already forgiven you

759
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,910
An inch will make you take a mile, huh

760
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,350
You're quick to take advantage

761
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,510
Yes, in this matter

762
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,910
we did handle it improperly

763
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,560
But...

764
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,470
During your time at school

765
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,310
you were skipping classes, fighting

766
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,310
and violating school rules and regulations

767
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,430
How much negative impact

768
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,710
it had on the school?

769
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,710
I understand

770
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,430
Alright, Ms. Fang

771
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,190
Stop scaring him

772
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,550
I just talked

773
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,470
with the school leaders

774
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:38,950
In this matter

775
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,550
Punishment is inevitable

776
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,230
Consider it a lesson

777
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,950
Don't make the same mistake again

778
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,350
Alright, Director

779
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,550
I'll remember

780
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,550
Thank you, Director

781
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,030
I'll leave now

782
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,110
Don't you talk anymore?

783
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,310
No, no, no

784
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,030
I won't make this mistake again

785
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,710
I'll remember the teachings

786
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,590
I'll go back and be good

787
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,510
Hurry back to class

788
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:01,830
Put on your clothes

789
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,110
Okay, I'll go first

790
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,590
Why are you here?

791
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,630
You're really stupid

792
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,310
What nonsense are you talking about?

793
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,910
Just ready to give and take

794
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,870
Back then, King Goujian of Yue

795
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,590
achieved success with this tactic

796
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,270
and became a winner in life

797
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,630
I think you should go back

798
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,270
and read the biography

799
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,590
of Lian Po and Lin Xiangru

800
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:30,710
Are you only here

801
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,790
to make fun of me?

802
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,950
Do I look that free?

803
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,830
Then you must be concerned about me

804
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,790
Well, I'm your uncle, after all

805
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,710
Caring for my nephew

806
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,670
is also the responsibility

807
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,470
of an elder

808
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,790
No need to be polite

809
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:45,790
Ling Dong

810
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:50,870
Thank you

811
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,030
Thanks for what?

812
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,070
You know what I'm talking about

813
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,710
No need to thank me

814
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,470
You've helped me before

815
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,430
So let's call it quits

816
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,430
What?

817
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,190
Now you owe me again
