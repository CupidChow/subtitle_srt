[Episode 14]

3
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
Come on

4
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,680
Come on

5
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,200
Well done, Lan Jinghui

6
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,640
Take it easy

7
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,840
Come on

8
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,960
Lan Jinghui, come on

9
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,720
Come on

10
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,880
Lan Jinghui, come on

11
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Lan Jinghui

12
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,360
Come on

13
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,600
Good job, everyone

14
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,560
It's okay

15
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,680
Now we're

16
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,360
not much different from Class 1

17
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,560
So I hope everyone can

18
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,400
keep going

19
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,280
Great job, everyone

20
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,760
Old Wu

21
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,040
How's their performance?

22
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,720
Not bad

23
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,920
Well done, No. 10

24
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,240
Come on, let me say something

25
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,320
Come on

26
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,000
We played well in the first half

27
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,200
We are only a few points behind

28
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,880
But it's okay

29
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,280
When the second half starts

30
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,720
closely watch No. 35

31
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,600
and No. 28

32
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,360
One is strong, the other can shoot three-pointers

33
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,040
But it's okay

34
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,640
Ma Yiming

35
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,480
When the second half starts

36
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,840
we'll cooperate with you for fast breaks

37
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,680
Understood?

38
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,200
Jian Zhiqiang

39
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,120
Okay

40
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,960
Then, you take a look first

41
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,880
We'll talk after the game

42
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,280
Hey

43
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,000
Who is that person over there?

44
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,680
An old friend

45
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
We just had a chat

46
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,720
Well done

47
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,200
Come on

48
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,400
Class 5, win

49
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,320
Come on

50
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,520
Come on

51
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,480
They have a physical advantage

52
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,920
Be careful, don't collide head-on

53
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Don't worry

54
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,200
I know what to do

55
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,960
Come on, Lan Jinghui

56
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,600
Come on

57
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,880
Go for it

58
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,120
What's wrong?

59
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,880
What's the matter?

60
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,920
Move aside

61
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,480
Give him some space

62
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,600
What's the situation?

63
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
My glasses broke, I can't see clearly

64
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,000
What should we do then?

65
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,160
We have no substitutes

66
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,920
What a pity

67
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,880
Such a bast*rd

68
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,560
Lan Jinghui

69
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,240
Lan Jinghui

70
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,800
If there's really no other way

71
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,360
let's forfeit the game

72
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,000
No, we can't do that

73
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,800
How can we give up the game?

74
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,960
It's okay, I can still play

75
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,800
How about you?

76
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,560
Don't force yourself

77
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,040
How are you feeling right now?

78
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
We have no substitutes

79
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,640
Does that mean

80
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,520
we can only forfeit the game?

81
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,880
No, substitute

82
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,200
Substitute?

83
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,720
Take a rest first

84
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,000
Find a pair of glasses to wear

85
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,080
I'll do it

86
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,320
Can Ling Dong play basketball?

87
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,160
Am I seeing it right?

88
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,320
Can he still play basketball?

89
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,840
I've never seen him play before

90
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,400
Could he be

91
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,120
our class's secret weapon?

92
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,200
Is Ling Dong capable? Can he play?

93
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
I don't know

94
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,160
Usually, at times like this,

95
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,080
it may be the god that controls the game,

96
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,240
or just a trash player

97
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,440
Foul

98
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,400
Rebound

99
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,200
Move aside

100
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,920
Nice shot

101
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,000
Double

102
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,600
You kicked the ball

103
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,800
Violation

104
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,440
Traveling

105
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,920
What's he doing?

106
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,000
So, do you actually

107
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,480
know how to play basketball?

108
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,960
Come on

109
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,920
Come on

110
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,400
Defense

111
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,680
Come on

112
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,760
Faster, defense

113
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,840
Come on

114
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:34,720
Come on

115
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,320
Come on

116
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,600
Come on, Class 5

117
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,120
Come on

118
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
Come on, Class 5

119
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Come on

120
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:56,240
Come on

121
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,760
Come on, Class 5

122
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,080
Come on, Class 5

123
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,720
Come on, Class 5

124
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Lan Jinghui, congratulations

125
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,720
You guys are amazing

126
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,520
Fantastic

127
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,240
Not bad

128
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,640
Let's go back and talk

129
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,600
Sister Meng, did I do a great job?

130
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,800
Not bad

131
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,920
You guys were just

132
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,120
so impressive and cool

133
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,800
Yes

134
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,640
Especially your shot earlier,

135
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,600
and Ling Dong's final three

136
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,840
It was fantastic

137
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,680
Praise us more

138
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,480
But actually,

139
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,760
those were only 50% of

140
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,320
brother Hui's skills

141
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
I haven't shown

142
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,680
my full potential yet

143
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,760
What are you doing? My water

144
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,600
You've really changed now

145
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I just drink your water. How can you...

146
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,800
You worked hard today

147
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,840
It's okay

148
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:51,800
Great job

149
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,920
So next,

150
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,240
keep working hard

151
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,720
Come on

152
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,640
Why is he so annoying?

153
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,160
It's such a struggle to beat Class 1

154
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,280
You're really so bad

155
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,320
You even brought in the coach, someone irrelevant?

156
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,680
How do you know

157
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,920
he's irrelevant?

158
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,360
How do you know

159
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,640
he's not our secret weapon?

160
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:11,800
Fine

161
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,240
Looking forward to you making it to the finals

162
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,360
So we'll secure the championship

163
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,560
Well, student

164
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,040
The villain died from talking too much

165
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,360
Don't you know that?

166
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,760
Who do you think is the villain?

167
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,240
Lan Jinghui

168
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,120
Do what you should

169
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,440
Wait

170
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,040
Don't you think

171
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,120
you owe me an explanation?

172
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,600
What explanation?

173
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,800
So, in the end

174
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,360
can you play basketball or not?

175
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,680
No, I can't

176
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, if that's the case

177
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,280
you might be

178
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,080
a rare genius

179
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,920
Of course, compare to me

180
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
You are still a bit lacking

181
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
I've already told you

182
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,360
There's nothing wrong

183
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,520
if you join us

184
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,000
There's no loss, right?

185
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,280
I've told you

186
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,480
Basketball is just something to do

187
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,800
when you're tired of reading

188
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,360
You know that?

189
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,640
It builds your core muscles

190
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,400
It improves your coordination

191
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,920
It has countless benefits

192
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,800
And let me tell you

193
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,920
It's a lifelong benefit

194
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,040
I just don't understand

195
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,560
Look at you

196
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,960
You know what? There should be all-round moral,

197
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,320
intellectual, physical and aesthetic

198
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,040
You know what I mean?

199
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,160
You don't seem like someone

200
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,280
at your age

201
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,480
No, why can't you

202
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,560
listen to what I'm saying?

203
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,800
Let me tell you

204
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,000
What's the most important thing in basketball?

205
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,360
It is to

206
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,560
change your coordination

207
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,880
Look at how agile I am

208
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,800
Even with so many people here

209
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,600
I won't even touch them

210
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,040
Are you even listening to me?

211
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,560
I'm talking to you

212
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,960
Let me tell you

213
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,800
You can slow down

214
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,760
I'm carrying the food

215
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
But basketball...

216
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,080
You know what?

217
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,440
I've almost worn out my mouth

218
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,120
It's useless to talk to you

219
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,560
You have to personally immerse yourself

220
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,720
in playing to understand

221
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,080
the charm of this sport

222
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,920
It's a competitive sport

223
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,240
And besides

224
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,280
Only basketball

225
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,280
can unite a team

226
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
I've never seen you so hungry

227
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,480
Look

228
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,440
Without playing basketball

229
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,560
there's no vitality

230
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,960
Hey, seriously

231
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,760
The charm of the basketball

232
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,320
lies in...

233
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Ling Dong

234
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,960
How long do you plan to...

235
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,200
Until you join our basketball team

236
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,520
Why do you...

237
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,920
Why do you want me to join you?

238
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,640
I don't care

239
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,160
Anyway, you took away

240
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,800
all my limelight that day

241
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,320
And I already said

242
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,000
that you're the secret weapon

243
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
You have to join our basketball team

244
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,800
Then come with me

245
00:16:59,480 --> 00:16:59,760
Okay

246
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,360
No, wait

247
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,680
You agree?

248
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,520
Is that a yes?

249
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,680
Why did you bring me here?

250
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,160
Give me the ball

251
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,160
The ball

252
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,120
You're pretty good at shooting

253
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,240
It's a shame

254
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,960
you won't join the basketball team

255
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,040
But my dad only taught me shooting

256
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,680
Dad, you're amazing

257
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,440
I wanna learn how to shoot too

258
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,960
You wanna learn too?

259
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,320
I'll teach you now

260
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,000
When you grow up,

261
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,760
I'll teach you shooting, layups,

262
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,680
dunking, and dribbling

263
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,160
Ready

264
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,920
Shoot

265
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,320
Ling Dong gets one

266
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,840
The most crucial point of the game

267
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,960
Ling Dong wins

268
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,440
When I was little,

269
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,800
my dad used to bring me

270
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,680
to this basketball court

271
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,360
Then

272
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,280
Why did you stop learning?

273
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,800
I didn't have the chance

274
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,480
He passed away

275
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,160
Well...

276
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,120
I'm sorry

277
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,600
I had no idea

278
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,640
I didn't know before...

279
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,480
I'm really sorry

280
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,680
So every time I think of him,

281
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,840
I'll come to this basketball court

282
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,760
He taught me how to shoot here

283
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,360
So you only know how to shoot?

284
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,400
Nothing else?

285
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,160
Dad, when can I

286
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,000
shoot at the big hoop?

287
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,280
The big hoop?

288
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,360
When you're as tall as me,

289
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,600
you can do it at that time

290
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,080
I wanna see how you shoot?

291
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,640
Sure, I'll teach you

292
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,600
So that means

293
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,800
we're actually quite similar

294
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,160
I remember I saw your father

295
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,920
That's not what I mean

296
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,280
I mean...

297
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,400
I started play basketball

298
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,240
because of my dad

299
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,440
Because when my dad first

300
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,760
came to Singapore to see me,

301
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,680
I was just in a game

302
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,040
And I won the champion

303
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,440
So I was just thinking

304
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,320
my dad liked me, paid attention to me

305
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,800
because of basketball

306
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,600
Since then,

307
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,780
I've been playing every day

308
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,340
Slowly, it became a habit

309
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,260
365 days a year

310
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,760
I can count the days

311
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,480
you're at home

312
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,380
on my ten fingers

313
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:03,720
I don't wanna

314
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,520
live like this anymore

315
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:05,960
No, wait

316
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,640
Wasn't it for making money?

317
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,000
Wasn't it for our family?

318
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,160
Stop mentioning money to me

319
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,680
Alright?

320
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,160
Money is never enough

321
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,840
I just hope you can stay at home

322
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,880
and spend time with me and son

323
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,920
Isn't that right?

324
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,000
You are not a good father

325
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,520
Let alone a good husband

326
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,600
Also

327
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,440
I'll take the child away

328
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,160
I'm telling you, Yu Lihua

329
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,080
Don't even think about it

330
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,080
He is my son

331
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,920
I'll never let you take him away

332
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,760
If you wanna leave, go by yourself

333
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,960
But he is still my son

334
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,160
I have to take him away

335
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
He is my own flesh and blood

336
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,840
I...

337
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,160
Then your mother took you abroad

338
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,200
And then?

339
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,560
Ling Dong

340
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,800
Are we here today

341
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,840
to listen to a story?

342
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,960
Aren't we here for this?

343
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,280
Didn't you say

344
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,320
no one has taught you

345
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,480
since then?

346
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,460
I'll teach you

347
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,400
You're quite talented, buddy

348
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,640
You learn fast

349
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,000
That's because I have strong learning ability

350
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,120
Otherwise, I suggest...

351
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,400
Just give up on study

352
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,720
And just play basketball with me

353
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,320
Let's create greatness together

354
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:45,920
What do you think?

355
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,960
I have something I wanna do

356
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,640
Alright, tell me about it

357
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
What do you wanna do?

358
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,800
I wanna study physics at PKU

359
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,440
PKU

360
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,720
The one in Beijing, right?

361
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,880
Then what?

362
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,000
Sometimes

363
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,280
I just can't understand

364
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,720
Why top students like you

365
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,680
always like to challenge

366
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,640
these difficult levels

367
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,080
Isn't it better to live happily?

368
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,480
But dreams are still necessary

369
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,440
What if they come true?

370
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,240
Isn't that right?

371
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,760
It's not my dream

372
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,920
Just my next step plan

373
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,680
That's all

374
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,080
That makes sense

375
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,080
Top students like you

376
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,960
You can make anything happen

377
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,840
that you wanna set your minds to

378
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,160
I mean

379
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,680
Are you done resting?

380
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,400
If you're fine...

381
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:36,920
Stop

382
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,640
Isn't it impolite

383
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,880
to groan like that?

384
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
I've been teaching you

385
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,040
how to play basketball seriously

386
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,560
Shouldn't you address me

387
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,320
as Coach Lan?

388
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Still teach me?

389
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,280
When you were young,

390
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,440
your dad taught you how to play basketball

391
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,120
Now it's my turn

392
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,920
I've been playing basketball

393
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,960
for so many years

394
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,200
I might have got

395
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
kind of glory of fatherly love

396
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,000
So, why not just call me...

397
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,920
Nephew

398
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,080
Don't mix up the generations

399
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,280
Come on, Nephew

400
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,040
It's just our class and class 8 left

401
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,680
Destiny will make enemies meet

402
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,880
Their class is really terrifying

403
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,880
They're all skilled

404
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,400
And their coordination is impeccable

405
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,200
Not to mention the tough guy, Bi Peng

406
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,600
We can't beat them no matter what

407
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,040
What are you afraid of?

408
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,840
Letting others' ambition extinguish our own glory?

409
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,680
They're not that scary

410
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
I took a look yesterday

411
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,080
when they played against class 4

412
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,720
They're not very good at defending

413
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,280
Since we can't improve our skills

414
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,600
in a short time,

415
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,600
let's think of a way

416
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,520
to use tactics to defeat them

417
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,920
Sounds good

418
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,080
I don't even know

419
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,600
that you're so talented to be a strategist

420
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,400
Why don't you go

421
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:30,880
and find out

422
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,560
what they're training tomorrow

423
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,240
No, I won't go

424
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,000
Why not?

425
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
You did a good job

426
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,960
in the talent show before

427
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,600
How sneaky

428
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,400
Ma Yiming

429
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,200
He's not going

430
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,280
We'll go

431
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,280
Is it safe?

432
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,520
Let's go

433
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,560
Brother Hui

434
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,320
I'm fine

435
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,440
Brother Hui, I found out everything

436
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,600
Let me tell you

437
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,240
The No.13

438
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,840
Their point guard

439
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,480
He's good at passing and ball control

440
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,520
And he's very fast

441
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,360
He's always fast going back

442
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
We'll leave him to Xu Chao

443
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:28,880
And also,

444
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,120
that No.9,

445
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,680
Shooting guard

446
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,480
He's a 3-point shooter

447
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,640
Once he's outside the arc,

448
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,960
he never misses a shot

449
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,360
It's fine

450
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,920
We have Ling Dong

451
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,000
And then Bi Peng

452
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,360
Not even have to mention him

453
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,160
We're old acquaintances

454
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,360
Brother Hui, when the time comes,

455
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,720
you'll go against Bi Peng

456
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,960
Can you handle it?

457
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,400
Yes

458
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:00,960
Are you sure?

459
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,120
Don't worry

460
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,760
Brother Hui

461
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,000
The height of Class 8

462
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,800
is around 1.9 meters

463
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,680
What do we do?

464
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,560
How can we compete when we're so much shorter?

465
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,880
What are you two doing?

466
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,600
Go

467
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,000
Come in

468
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,680
Mr. Guo

469
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:41,920
Ms. Chai

470
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,800
Ms. Fang

471
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,640
Mr. Zhao, I'm still working

472
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,840
Let's go eat

473
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:49,880
No, thanks

474
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,640
To avoid criticism

475
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,760
The upright

476
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,960
basketball team coach

477
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,400
is actually giving Class 5 special treatment

478
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,480
That's not good

479
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,040
No, Ms. Fang, just a meal

480
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,640
Not even a meal

481
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,240
And our classmates

482
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,040
are still training

483
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,560
I need to go see them

484
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,200
As for the hotpot incident last time...

485
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,120
Let me go

486
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,000
Come on, let me do it

487
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,040
No need

488
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,520
Ms. Fang

489
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:16,920
Give it to me

490
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,120
Go

491
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,880
Nice shot

492
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,760
It's us. What are you doing?

493
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,000
Classmates

494
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,360
Teacher

495
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,800
Take a break and have some water

496
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,640
Come on

497
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,840
Thanks, teacher

498
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,680
You've worked hard, teacher

499
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,040
How's it going, Lan Jinghui?

500
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,240
How's the training?

501
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,440
It's just...

502
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,240
It's alright

503
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,160
It's okay

504
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,920
It's fine

505
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,480
What about you three?

506
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,400
We're doing well, just so-so

507
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,360
Mr. Zhao

508
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,360
You're training, huh

509
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,640
How's the training going?

510
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,120
You'll have a match against Class 8

511
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,120
Right now, it's still like this

512
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Looking at them

513
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,680
Each of them with a worried expression

514
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:02,920
It reminds me

515
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,440
of when we used to play basketball

516
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,720
You played basketball?

517
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,040
I know what they're worried about

518
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,280
What are they worried about?

519
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,880
First, they need strong scoring ability

520
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,360
Fast breakthrough speed

521
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,760
In our school, who else can do it?

522
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,000
Who's that?

523
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,720
Bi Peng from Class 8

524
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,200
Bi Peng from Class 8, right?

525
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,680
He's quite similar with the opponent

526
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,600
I faced before

527
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,160
But they all have one

528
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,800
fatal weakness

529
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,240
What weakness?

530
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,520
Rough skills

531
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,400
You know what?

532
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,760
They can only dribble with their right hand

533
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,600
This means that

534
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,240
their scoring ability is strongest

535
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,600
when driving from the right

536
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,100
So what are you gonna do?

537
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,620
So, when I defended him

538
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,000
I focused on defending his right side

539
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,360
I can let him go to the left side

540
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,560
Just let him go

541
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,680
What else, Teacher?

542
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,960
Any other similar stories

543
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,460
like this in other chapters?

544
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,240
And...

545
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,260
If he'll post up,

546
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,840
our guard will just cut off his ball

547
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,000
His score in that game

548
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,120
was not even ten points

549
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,280
Does your team have someone like...

550
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,640
Not your team

551
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,400
Your opponent's team

552
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,000
Do they have

553
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,240
a particularly strong center?

554
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,800
Yes

555
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,760
How did you deal with it?

556
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,400
At that time, as soon as

557
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,880
the center was on the court

558
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,240
not to mention the scoring

559
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,640
we couldn't even get a rebound

560
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,640
What did you do then?

561
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,640
Our old coach at that time

562
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,360
had no other choice

563
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,240
Just picked the player

564
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,880
with the best physical fitness

565
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,160
Qiangzi

566
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,440
Yes, just like Jian Zhiqiang

567
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,120
in your class

568
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:40,640
Right?

569
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,360
He told him

570
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,600
even if you have to squeeze him

571
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,800
just get him out of the Key

572
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,480
By squeezing, you know?

573
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,400
Squeeze him out

574
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,840
Mr. Zhao, do you have any more stories?

575
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,720
Yes, any more?

576
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,440
Yes

577
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,600
Any other stories?

578
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:54,840
Teacher

579
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,160
You can share with us

580
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,160
It's tiring talking for so long

581
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,560
I have

582
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,440
Come on, Mr. Zhao

583
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,040
You drink

584
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,920
Drink water

585
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,640
Do you have any more stories?

586
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,880
Let's talk about that center again

587
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,960
That center, indeed, has good skills

588
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,240
He's tall

589
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,400
And he's capable of scoring

590
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,760
But he has a fatal weakness

591
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,200
What's that?

592
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,480
Bad temper

593
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,800
He gets a bad temper

594
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,160
Once his temper flares up

595
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,240
he starts with dirty tricks

596
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,480
Once he starts with dirty tricks

597
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,480
the fouls pile up

598
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:29,920
Mr. Zhao

599
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,200
Was there a shooting guard

600
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,360
with a precise shot?

601
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:32,840
Yes

602
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,960
The team who was ranked first

603
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,480
in the province

604
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,320
Their scoring guard

605
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,400
Don't leave him open

606
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Once you give him an opening

607
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,000
he'll make every shot he takes

608
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,840
So what did you do then?

609
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,000
Well...

610
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,080
I can't tell you

611
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,640
How could you?

612
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,960
Just tell us, Mr. Guo

613
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,560
Why can't you just tell us?

614
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,200
How can...

615
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,720
Mr. Zhao, it's okay

616
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,080
You can tell me

617
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,120
What did you do then?

618
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,680
I'd like to know

619
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,480
what you did to deal with him

620
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:57,920
It's very simple

621
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,960
Just block his line of sight

622
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,000
But what if they don't let you block?

623
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,880
If he didn't let you do it, you just...

624
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,380
If he won't let me do it,

625
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:07,840
can I just...

626
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,680
Give him a poke

627
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:09,600
This is not acceptable

628
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,200
This is not acceptable

629
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,640
This goes against sportsmanship

630
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,120
Just block him
