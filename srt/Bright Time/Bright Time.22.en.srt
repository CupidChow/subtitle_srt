[Episode 22]

3
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,920
Any news about him there?

4
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,520
Ms. Fang and Mr. Zhao

5
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,600
have already gone to look for him

6
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,320
No way

7
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,400
I have to go look for him too

8
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,880
Ling Dong

9
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,480
Just wait a little longer

10
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:21,880
No

11
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,000
Ling Dong

12
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,400
Why did you come down?

13
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:25,880
Teacher

14
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
Have you found Lan Jinghui?

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,360
Not yet

16
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,120
Let's wait here for now

17
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,080
If he doesn't come back

18
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,840
by tomorrow morning,

19
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,040
we'll report to the police

20
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,000
Lan Jinghui

21
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,800
Lan Jinghui

22
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,240
You finally came back

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,160
No, what's wrong?

24
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,640
You finally come back, huh

25
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,680
Don't you know that Ms. Fang

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,440
was so worried about you?

27
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,760
What were you doing?

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,160
Why was your phone turned off?

29
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,560
I was handling something

30
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,800
Where's my phone?

31
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,280
Lan Jinghui

32
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,160
No

33
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,840
Ms. Fang, listen to me

34
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,800
I really just

35
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
went out for a walk

36
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,000
I didn't do anything wrong

37
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,760
Just keep quiet

38
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,000
This is a complete misunderstanding

39
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,040
Bend your legs

40
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,080
Raise your hands

41
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,880
Did I misunderstand about you?

42
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,360
I'm asking what I misunderstood about you

43
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:20,920
Really

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,440
What time is it now?

45
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,120
Check it yourself

46
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,640
Do you know

47
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,680
how worried everyone was about you?

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,880
I think you're just idle

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,360
I mean it

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,480
I repeatedly reminded you

51
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,320
So tell me

52
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,960
what if something happens to you?

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,360
I shouldn't have agreed

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,160
to bring you out

55
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,240
You're really accusing me wrongly

56
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,040
Accuse...

57
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,160
How did I unjustly accuse you?

58
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,960
Let me tell you

59
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,000
If you don't squat for two hours,

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,880
I won't let you get up

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,560
You really annoyed me

62
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,360
Calm down

63
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,760
Lan Jinghui

64
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,320
Tell me

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,320
You knew this would happen

66
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,800
Why did you do it?

67
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,880
So what were you doing?

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,920
I

69
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,640
I was doing something important

70
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,880
Xiao Huihui

71
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,440
Xiao Huihui

72
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,640
Sis, why are you here?

73
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,640
Sis

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,400
You were so engrossed in dancing

75
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,080
that you forgot your phone

76
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,680
It's here

77
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,920
I'm telling you

78
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,680
You're so absent-minded

79
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,600
Luckily you told me

80
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,320
that you live the hotel

81
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,160
across the square

82
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,920
So I bought it to you right away

83
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,000
Sisters, you're dancing, huh

84
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,360
You're so sweet

85
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,680
Wait a minute

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,360
After this dance

87
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,480
we'll switch to a duet

88
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,520
You should join us then

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,560
No, sister

90
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,120
Don't dance yet

91
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,560
There's a duet after that?

92
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,160
Yes

93
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,440
Let me tell you something

94
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,520
Sister

95
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,360
Here's the situation

96
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,480
I have a friend

97
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,600
who has a very important exam tomorrow

98
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,560
He's studying for it now

99
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,240
He needs a quiet environment

100
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
So I'm asking you

101
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,400
If you can

102
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,520
postpone this dance until tomorrow

103
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,600
Sister

104
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,480
Can you pause for a moment?

105
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,480
I bought something for everyone

106
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,600
Come and collect it, sisters

107
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,040
Sisters, come over

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,240
Sisters

109
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,240
Sisters, come here

110
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,440
I bought something for you

111
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,120
I bought headphones for each person

112
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,200
One headphone for each person

113
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,200
High-tech, isn't it? Do we have to pay?

114
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,440
It's free, completely free

115
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,160
Everyone has one

116
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:56,920
This...

117
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,760
How can you dance with headphones on?

118
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,880
No problem

119
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,120
Dance however you want

120
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,000
Just wear the headphones

121
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,000
Play the music

122
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,760
Just dance however you want

123
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,280
Silence is golden at this moment

124
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:05,840
Right?

125
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,680
Come on

126
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,400
Slow down

127
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,680
Everyone has one

128
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,520
Okay

129
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,360
Sisters, I'll leave now

130
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,480
No, you can't

131
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,840
Sisters

132
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,600
I won't dance today

133
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,640
Because tomorrow

134
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,480
I have something to do

135
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:47,840
I have to...

136
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,120
I have to leave

137
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,760
Okay

138
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,760
I was looking for this phone

139
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,240
I couldn't find it

140
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,520
Then I thought

141
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,680
I must have left it on the square

142
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,960
You're good at dancing

143
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
You should come again next time

144
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,960
You taught me well

145
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,640
You're so sweet

146
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,880
Lan Jinghui

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,160
I didn't expect

148
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,480
that you went to dance in the square

149
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
When I think of...

150
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,240
When I think

151
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,680
When I think of how you dance

152
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,120
I can't help but laughing

153
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,760
No, wait

154
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,200
What are you two laughing at?

155
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,440
I am a rising star

156
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,880
in the square dance world

157
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,680
Alright

158
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,400
Stop laughing

159
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,440
I have something important to ask you

160
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,880
Will you still be dancing tomorrow morning?

161
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,520
Didn't you give us your earphones?

162
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,840
Don't worry

163
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,360
Let your classmates focus on their exams

164
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,920
Get good results

165
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,400
Thanks for your kind words

166
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,520
I'm gonna leave

167
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,520
Okay, bye

168
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,440
Let me see you off, sister

169
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,480
Let's see you off together

170
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,240
You dance really well

171
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,080
Really?

172
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,760
Yes, really

173
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,480
Thanks to you both for teaching me so well

174
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,920
Alright

175
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,240
I'm sorry

176
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,040
I misunderstood you

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,080
You should have told me earlier

178
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,560
Ms. Fang

179
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,640
In that situation just now,

180
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,080
I don't even have a chance to say anything

181
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,840
Maybe it's because

182
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,240
I've been squatting for too long

183
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,120
My legs are a bit numb

184
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,640
So my mind became stiff too

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,880
Lan Jinghui

186
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,800
I've seen you playing around everywhere

187
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,720
I haven't seen you tired at all

188
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,280
I made you squat for a while,

189
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,360
Yet your legs became numb and stiff

190
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,000
Can't you take it anymore?

191
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,600
Well, what can I do?

192
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,640
Mr. Zhao

193
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,840
Can you give him a massage?

194
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,840
Alright, we misunderstood you

195
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,880
Just get stretched

196
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,240
No need

197
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,160
No need

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,120
Well, it's getting late

199
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm a bit tired, so I'll go rest first

200
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm leaving first

201
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,720
Let me support you

202
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,960
No need

203
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,000
Just stretch a bit, okay?

204
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,520
I'm okay now

205
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,280
Alright, I'll go up first

206
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,040
Ling Dong

207
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,520
I think the air conditioning in our hotel

208
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,360
is quite cold

209
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,680
You haven't been sleeping well these days, right?

210
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,600
It's okay

211
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,800
I've been sleeping well

212
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,880
You've been sleeping well?

213
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,920
That's not possible

214
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,240
Mr. Zhao said

215
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,200
he's almost catching a cold

216
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,360
I asked the hotel front desk

217
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,160
to bring you two

218
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,200
two extra blankets

219
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,720
Ms. Fang is really considerate

220
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,560
She's taking care of us so much

221
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,200
Teacher, yesterday the waiter

222
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,360
brought me a blanket

223
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,720
Wasn't it at your request?

224
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,960
No, it wasn't me

225
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,000
You asked the waiter to bring it?

226
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,320
No, it wasn't me

227
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,640
Well, that's strange

228
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,040
They bring you supper

229
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,200
and they bring you blankets

230
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,720
Why do they treat you candidates

231
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,840
with special care?

232
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,600
Maybe they do

233
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,080
I'm going up now

234
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,440
Alright, study well tomorrow

235
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,600
Goodbye, teacher

236
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:30,960
Bye

237
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,000
Have a good rest

238
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,320
Lan Jinghui usually

239
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,160
seems quite out of place

240
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,600
Never thought...

241
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,920
I really misunderstood him this time

242
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,440
Yeah

243
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,160
He's usually quite mischievous

244
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,200
But this time,

245
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,000
I really see him in a new light

246
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,440
By the way

247
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,920
You've been busy all this time

248
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,680
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

249
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,280
I'm not hungry

250
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,240
It's alright, it's still early

251
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,840
Let's go out and grab a bite

252
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,480
Really?

253
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,720
Don't you wanna eat?

254
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,400
Then forget it

255
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,080
Let's go

256
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:55,800
Ms. Fang

257
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,560
What should we eat?

258
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,320
Anything is fine

259
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,920
What do you feel like eating?

260
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,440
How about spicy hot pot?

261
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,200
Sure. My treat

262
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,680
Let's go

263
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,360
Celebration!

264
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,160
How was it?

265
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,720
How was the exam?

266
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,000
Did you feel a sense of superiority?

267
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,400
It was alright

268
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,120
Teacher

269
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,360
Have a seat

270
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,800
The exam is over now though it's quite hard

271
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,840
Monitor, does the Sunny Doll really work?

272
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,280
It works very well

273
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,840
Thank you, Qingtian

274
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,760
You're welcome

275
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,760
This is for you

276
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,000
Thank you

277
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,000
Ling Dong, this is for you

278
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,240
Replenish fluids after excessive brain usage

279
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,560
Xiaohua

280
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,480
Why didn't you give me

281
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,240
a bottle?

282
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,280
I've been busy all this time

283
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,200
Why won't you let me

284
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
replenish fluids?

285
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,640
Ms. Fang

286
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
There's a vending machine at the entrance

287
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,000
You can help yourself

288
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,800
Alright, Xiao Xiaohua

289
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,400
How capable you are

290
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,440
Now you're mocking me

291
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,280
You dare make faces at me, huh?

292
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,920
Alright

293
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,600
Ms. Fang has something to say

294
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,200
Now that the exam is over,

295
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,480
it's free time

296
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,240
You can go out and have fun

297
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,960
But...

298
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,720
Be back at the hotel by 8 o'clock

299
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,320
Did you hear that?

300
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,760
Remember, 8 o'clock

301
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,960
Isn't it a bit too early?

302
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,520
There's nothing we can play

303
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,000
The problem is...

304
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,920
What are you gonna do about it?

305
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,600
Is 8 o'clock too early?

306
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,720
How about 7 o'clock?

307
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:24,960
Or 6 o'clock?

308
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,240
Or...

309
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,960
If you don't wanna go out,

310
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,520
you can tell me

311
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,480
No, wait

312
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,120
That's not what I meant

313
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,080
What I meant was..

314
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,920
Eight o'clock is fine

315
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,880
Well

316
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,040
Teacher

317
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,640
You are the most friendly

318
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,320
teacher in the world

319
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,920
We love you

320
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,280
Alright, stop flattering

321
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,280
Okay

322
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,520
You guys can go play

323
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,440
Then we'll go

324
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,280
Bye bye

325
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,920
Goodbye, teacher

326
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,720
Have fun, and stay safe

327
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,400
Cell phone

328
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,840
Keep it on 24/7

329
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,720
Got it

330
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,640
Goodbye, teachers

331
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,800
Goodbye, teachers

332
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Have fun

333
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,320
The PKU

334
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,360
Didn't you say

335
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,680
you wanted to see the physics lecture here?

336
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,360
Forget it

337
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,920
There are so many people

338
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,920
And today is open day

339
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,440
It's hard to get free tickets

340
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,720
I knew he would say that

341
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Tickets

342
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,160
Master, you're amazing

343
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,160
How did you get them?

344
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,760
Well, you see

345
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,240
Such campus open day

346
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Why are there so many people?

347
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,800
Exactly

348
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,880
They're all queuing here

349
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,360
If it wasn't for my girlfriend forcing me,

350
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,360
I wouldn't come at all

351
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,120
What about you?

352
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,480
I have a friend

353
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,320
who wants to apply here next year

354
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,600
So we wanna come and have a look

355
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Your friend wants to apply here?

356
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,720
It's not easy to get into this place

357
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,720
Every year, the students who can get in

358
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,600
are extremely rare

359
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,400
Of course

360
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,080
Let me tell you

361
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,200
My deskmate came here

362
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,800
to participate in the national physics exam

363
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,280
You know what? National exam

364
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,160
It's not something

365
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
ordinary people can participate in

366
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,880
It'll give you bonus points

367
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,640
in the college entrance exam

368
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,000
So your girlfriend is so amazing

369
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,000
It's a guy

370
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,920
Now start collecting tickets

371
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,960
Don't push, everyone

372
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,920
Register on the left, collect tickets on the right

373
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,480
Next one

374
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,600
Okay

375
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,760
Three tickets please

376
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,000
Each person can only get one

377
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,160
So...

378
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,360
Can this be difficult?

379
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,160
I just changed my disguise and got them

380
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,640
Master, you're really great

381
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,680
Thanks to you

382
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,040
We managed to get tickets in advance

383
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,640
Otherwise,

384
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,240
we wouldn't even be able to enter in

385
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,040
It's not even a big deal

386
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,840
If you guys wanna express

387
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,440
your gratitude to me

388
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,840
Well...

389
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,040
My throat feels a bit dry

390
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,920
Get a bottle of water

391
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,520
Sure, I'll take a note

392
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,120
What?

393
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,280
I'll buy it for you when we go back to school

394
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,480
Well, you have to show some appreciation

395
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,000
Don't you wanna get into the PKU

396
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,880
I'll help you

397
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,000
After we go back

398
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,920
we'll intensify our tutoring

399
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,960
No, that's not necessary

400
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,120
No room for negotiation

401
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,840
Why is there no room for negotiation?

402
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,880
You still have a long way to go

403
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,480
No, how ridiculous

404
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,320
If you get in here

405
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,920
your life will definitely change

406
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,120
I feel like everyone

407
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,040
is full of vitality and confidence

408
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,800
Do you wanna study here too?

409
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,800
I can't get in

410
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,360
But Ling Dong definitely can do it

411
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,040
Let's go and check out the front

412
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
We have a lawn at our school

413
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,160
I'm here every day

414
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Take a picture of me here

415
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,800
Are both of your life paths

416
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,720
so unconventional?

417
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,560
Life paths

418
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,520
By the way, it's almost time

419
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,560
for that physics lecture

420
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,320
Where is it again?

421
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,800
Lecture Hall 2

422
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,160
I already checked before coming

423
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,880
It's over there

424
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,400
But if we don't go now

425
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,400
we might really be running out of time

426
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,280
I still wanna go

427
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,880
and check out the fine arts department

428
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,560
Let's meet here later

429
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,000
Alright, then

430
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,400
Sounds good

431
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,200
See you here later

432
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,480
Great

433
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,760
We're gonna go

434
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,080
Okay

435
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,120
Let's go

436
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,920
Beauty, come to our place

437
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,320
Order it together with the iced lemon tea

438
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
You can enjoy an 20% discount

439
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,760
Hello

440
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,720
Our coupon

441
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,640
can be used in conjunction

442
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,440
Buy one, get one at half price

443
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,880
What are you doing?

444
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,880
Throw it away

445
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,680
These coupons are all over the place

446
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,440
I can't understand them

447
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,280
What's the point of keeping them?

448
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,600
Although these

449
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,840
are all tricks from the businesses

450
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,280
If you use them well

451
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,680
you can enjoy the most delicious food

452
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,120
at the lowest cost

453
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,240
Really?

454
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,560
Yes

455
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,360
Look

456
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,000
This restaurant

457
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,240
can be used separately

458
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,120
These two can be

459
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,000
combined for discounts

460
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
And this one...

461
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,360
If you use the mobile payment

462
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:13,920
you can get

463
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,280
a subsidy of 15 yuan for every 50 yuan spent

464
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,240
How did you know?

465
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,360
They just mentioned it

466
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,880
And it's written here

467
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,360
Then why can't I see it?

468
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,960
This is just

469
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,600
basic statistics

470
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,280
You're amazing

471
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Do you wanna eat takoyaki?

472
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,600
Then let's go to this sushi restaurant

473
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,720
If we spend over 30 yuan,

474
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,560
they will give us a free

475
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,360
takoyaki

476
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,400
So the total cost of this trip

477
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,760
should be...

478
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,480
1278.8 yuan

479
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:46,920
to enjoy

480
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,360
all the food you want

481
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,880
You're amazing

482
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,480
Why are you staring at me?

483
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,040
I'm not Chi-bi Maruko

484
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,800
Of course you're not Chi-bi Maruko

485
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,440
You're my Doraemon

486
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,320
Today, I'll make an exception

487
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,400
and let you join our Roof Squad

488
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,160
Roof Squad?

489
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,480
What's that?

490
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,320
Oh well

491
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,680
It means being one of us

492
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,200
Let's go

493
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,120
Don't make a mess in dark places

494
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
Pay attention to ventilation

495
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,400
Nice stars

496
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,760
Is Professor Yang really that popular?

497
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,320
Hello, class

498
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,120
Hello

499
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,360
I'm glad that today

500
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
we can have a discussion

501
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,360
about physics together

502
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,440
I've noticed a problem

503
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,160
Nowadays,

504
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,560
there are many science fiction works

505
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,720
that encounter

506
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,000
classic logical problems

507
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,600
and cannot continue the story

508
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,480
They then refer to quantum theory

509
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,320
In this way

510
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,840
to make the story seem reasonable

511
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,120
Things will suddenly become clear

512
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,920
and continue

513
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,040
So,

514
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,880
we have summarized it as

515
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,520
"When in doubt, use quantum mechanics"

516
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,160
This also reflects from one aspect

517
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,040
the content of quantum mechanics

518
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,520
is indeed complex

519
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,440
and difficult to understand

520
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,200
But don't worry

521
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,840
Today I'll explain it

522
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,680
in a relatively simple

523
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,880
and popular way

524
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,880
for us to understand

525
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,160
About 13 billion years ago,

526
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,520
there were two black holes

527
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,560
merging together

528
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,120
The mass of these two black holes

529
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,680
was

530
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,680
36 solar masses

531
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,480
and 29 solar masses respectively

532
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,240
They were orbiting each other

533
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,040
Fortunately,

534
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,720
China has also designed and built

535
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,200
our own FAST

536
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,640
Its appearance

537
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,080
directly replaces the

538
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,160
position of the Arecibo telescope in the US

539
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,440
becoming the world's

540
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,240
largest radio telescope

541
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,920
It marks

542
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,320
China's breakthrough and rise in technology

543
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,800
This is an

544
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,280
unprecedented voyage

545
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,760
It will prove to humanity

546
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
that our exploration can reach

547
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,680
over 10 billion light years away

548
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,000
Xingchen

549
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,600
I'll be right back

550
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,400
Watch over it for me

551
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,360
Oh, yes

552
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,520
Remember

553
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,560
After you finish drawing

554
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,680
Don't rush

555
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,520
Step back and observe carefully

556
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,120
You can even squint your eyes

557
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,520
That way, you can easily spot

558
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,600
any inconsistencies

559
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:23,920
Hey

560
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,000
Which department are you in?

561
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,760
I'm not in any department

562
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,160
I'm just here to visit

563
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,160
Are you an art student?

564
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,680
Well, not really

565
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,720
I saw your drawing

566
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,000
You have a good sense of color

567
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,280
Many art students

568
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
don't have that feeling

569
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,800
Thank you, senior sister

570
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,520
Come, let me take you somewhere

571
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,400
About ten years ago

572
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,440
Human beings observed

573
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,960
the Higgs boson for the first time

574
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,320
I wanted to ask

575
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,760
all the students here

576
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,200
What do you think

577
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,600
the difference is between it

578
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,880
and gravitational waves?

579
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,040
The one who is dozing off

580
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,200
Yes, it's you

581
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,080
You must think

582
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,800
my question is too simple

583
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
and doesn't interest you

584
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:26,840
Alright

585
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,160
Let's have him answer it

586
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,000
No, where were we?

587
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,720
I don't know where we left off

588
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,000
Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves

589
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,520
a hundred years ago

590
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,000
Higgs predicted the existence of the Higgs boson

591
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,480
fifty years ago

592
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
The Higgs boson

593
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,960
is very important

594
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,080
to the standard model

595
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,720
But at the same time

596
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,280
it has many limitations

597
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,240
and uncertainties

598
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,720
The discovery of gravitational waves

599
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,120
is like

600
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,600
opening a telescope

601
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,600
that allows us  to use it

602
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,640
as a probe in the future

603
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,840
to explore more

604
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,280
about the universe

605
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,560
Are you in our physics department?

606
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,560
Not yet

607
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,840
Good

608
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,440
I hope

609
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,880
to see you again

610
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,840
in my classroom in the future

611
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,120
I will, Professor

612
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,880
Okay

613
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,600
Let's continue

614
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,480
So this is how you can draw

615
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,720
Drawing is a way for creators

616
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,200
to express themselves

617
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,640
You can draw however you want

618
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,560
What universities teach

619
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,320
is to get students into the system

620
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,680
and then break the system

621
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,600
Break the rules

622
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,160
I envy this so much

623
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,680
Being able to hang paintings here

624
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,280
They must be really talented

625
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,440
I think you have talent

626
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,560
Have you ever thought about studying art?

627
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,520
I...

628
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
I can't

629
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,160
Why?

630
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,440
My mom doesn't want me to study art

631
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,640
So

632
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,120
I'll just treat it as a hobby

633
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,760
That's enough

634
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,240
Let me ask you

635
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,080
Why do you like to paint?

636
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,320
When I was little

637
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,040
My dad used to take me to the art museum

638
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,160
when he went to work

639
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,840
I would always go with him

640
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,960
While he was working

641
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,440
I would wander around the gallery

642
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,240
The paintings on the walls

643
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,600
Over time

644
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,560
they became my childhood memories

645
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,040
That's when I fell in love with painting

646
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,360
Whether I was happy

647
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
or unhappy

648
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,920
I would record it

649
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,760
Look

650
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,720
Every painting here

651
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,800
is a world created by the artist

652
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,160
They're just like you

653
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,080
expressing their understanding of the world

654
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,400
through painting

655
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Has anyone ever praised you

656
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,920
for your great painting skills?

657
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,280
Is Lan Jinghui not here yet?

658
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,040
Yes

659
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,800
You have a talent for painting

660
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,000
But I think he might be

661
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,480
comforting and encouraging me

662
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,440
And after coming here

663
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
and seeing these paintings

664
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,680
I feel even more

665
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,200
that I still have a long way to go

666
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,520
Someone once told me

667
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,680
there's no such thing as a genius

668
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,920
Most of them are ordinary people

669
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,200
The difference between those apparent geniuses

670
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,600
and ordinary people

671
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,080
is that

672
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,600
they give their all

673
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,640
and try their best

674
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
to do everything

675
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,800
While ordinary people think

676
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,800
they can't do it

677
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,000
In this world,

678
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,120
nothing comes easily

679
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,480
And also

680
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,280
the brush of life

681
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,640
is in your own hands

682
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,400
You won't know unless you try

683
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,640
Come on

684
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,280
This is for you

685
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,080
Hope it will be helpful to you

686
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Thank you, senior sister

687
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,440
This art department's exhibition hall

688
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,320
is quite famous

689
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,800
Do you need me

690
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,560
to take a photo for you?

691
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
No need, senior sister

692
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,600
Why not?

693
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,920
I feel like I will come again

694
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,280
See you

695
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,720
I hope when I see you next time,

696
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,000
you'll be my junior

697
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,880
You're back

698
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,800
Why is it raining so heavily?

699
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,760
What's this?

700
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,920
This is the recruitment brochure

701
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,200
and promotional materials from PKU

702
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,720
Help me take it

703
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,560
I've made up my mind

704
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,560
I wanna study in the Art Department in PKU

705
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,480
Xiaohua

706
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,720
I said I'd go for the PKU

707
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,000
That was just for my dad

708
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,840
It's not because of you

709
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,560
It's after coming here

710
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,040
that I suddenly found

711
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,280
my own dream

712
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,440
Shouldn't you support me?

713
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,960
It's not easy to get into here

714
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,600
Okay

715
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,040
I support you

716
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,280
But...

717
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,000
Dreams are always necessary

718
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
What if one day they come true?

719
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,360
Yes

720
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,000
The brush of life

721
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,240
is in our own hands

722
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,880
How will we know if we don't try?

723
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,400
Alright

724
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,640
Then I've decided too

725
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,720
Let's all go for the PKU

726
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,160
And I...

727
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,600
Don't say you don't wanna come

728
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,720
Since you entered here,

729
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,240
your eyes have been shining

730
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,280
Yes, Ling Dong

731
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,720
You were born for

732
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,960
the physics department of PKU

733
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,880
If you don't come here, who will?

734
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,280
Wow

735
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,240
You two got all my lines

736
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,080
Is that so?

737
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,120
Then it's a deal

738
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,800
It's a deal

739
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,600
Okay, it's a deal

740
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,280
PKU

741
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,680
Wait for us

742
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,840
PKU

743
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,240
Wait for us

744
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,320
PKU

745
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,160
Wait for us

746
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,680
When I say these words,

747
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,440
it feels like I have grown wings

748
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,680
I can hear the sound of wings flapping

749
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,960
I can see a surge of power suddenly rises

750
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,040
in the campus

751
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,520
Even if the road ahead is full of obstacles,

752
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,280
I'll surely have a bright future if I keep going

753
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,640
Lan Jinghui, Ling Dong

754
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,440
Let's get it together

755
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,920
I'm so full

756
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,680
I'm so stuffed

757
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:33,920
Bye

758
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,480
Bye

759
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:34,960
Bye

760
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,880
Bye. Rest early

761
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,520
Goodnight

762
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,120
Goodnight

763
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:37,840
Bye

764
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,360
Hello

765
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,000
I'd like to give you some feedback

766
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,520
I think the temperature

767
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,760
of the central air conditioning in your hotel

768
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
is really too low

769
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,260
It's really cold at night

770
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,800
Sorry about that

771
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,520
The central air conditioning system

772
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,320
in our hotel

773
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,440
is being adjusted centrally

774
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,240
How about

775
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,600
I'll help you add another blanket

776
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,720
Okay

777
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,080
Then please give one

778
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,200
to room 2069

779
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,680
