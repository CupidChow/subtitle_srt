[It really makes me hard.]
[Episode 23]

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,160
Xiao Datu

4
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,040
What's up?

5
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,200
What are you being so sneaky about?

6
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,800
What?

7
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,440
I didn't take anything

8
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,640
Ouch!

9
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,560
So expensive!

10
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,240
Did you buy another art book?

11
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,360
Can't you buy something useful?

12
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,360
Even buying groceries would be better

13
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,680
What are you doing?

14
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,920
Honey, this...

15
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,840
It has great collectible value

16
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,720
What?

17
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,160
Do you really think you're an artist

18
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,040
Or even a collector?

19
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,480
Let me tell you, Xiao Datu

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,680
When we got married,

21
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,200
you told me

22
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,240
you had a talent for painting

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,920
And I believed it

24
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,400
All these years,

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,840
what have you achieved?

26
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,680
I have talent, you know

27
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,120
What talent do you have?

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,200
I have a unique talent

29
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,800
Mom, I'm back!

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,280
Xiaohua

31
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,120
Xiaohua, you're back

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,640
Are you happy?

33
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,320
Yes, of course

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,480
That's great

35
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,160
Take a break

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,920
You're tired, right?

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,720
Go on

38
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,320
You must be tired from travelling

39
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,280
Go and rest, Xiaohua

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
Put your clothes outside

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,600
Okay

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,840
I'll wash them for you later

43
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,080
Xiao Datu

44
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,160
Let me tell you

45
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,240
Good news for everyone

46
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,360
In the national physics competition,

47
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,720
Ling Dong

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,760
and Chen Luyang

49
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,360
have both won first and second prizes

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,560
with excellent results

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,440
Congratulations to them

52
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,520
Okay

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,040
I hope that all the students

54
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,480
can take them as role models

55
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,920
and follow their lead

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,760
Also,

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,680
I have another announcement

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,600
There's an art course

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
in our school

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,200
Those who're interested

61
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,600
can come to me after class

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,480
to get the registration form

63
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,600
Get your parents' signature

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,360
Also, this course

65
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,200
is voluntary

66
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,720
Advice from me

67
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,160
Art exams are definitely not shortcuts

68
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,840
So I hope that

69
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,920
you can think it through carefully

70
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,000
and discuss it with your parents

71
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,640
before signing up

72
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,160
Okay, class begins

73
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,040
Stand up

74
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,120
Morning, teacher

75
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,440
How's Mrs. Guo feeling today?

76
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,760
Cloudy with a chance of clearing

77
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,480
Still somewhat bright

78
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,360
What are you doing?

79
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,720
Mom, how about I help you wash the vegetables?

80
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,640
Did you do anything wrong?

81
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,640
No

82
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,280
Then what's wrong?

83
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,360
I...

84
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,960
I want

85
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,080
What's the matter?

86
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,560
I wanna learn how to paint

87
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,800
It's nothing

88
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,840
I'm going back to my room to do homework

89
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,800
Go ahead

90
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,600
Doudou

91
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,120
What if my mom doesn't agree?

92
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,520
I'm so scared she'll say no

93
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,560
The brush of life

94
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,960
is in your own hands

95
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,760
How would you know if you don't try?

96
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,000
The senior sister is right

97
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,800
The brush of life

98
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,360
is in your own hands

99
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,800
How would you know if you don't try?

100
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,640
Mom

101
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,280
What are you doing?

102
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,520
I wanna apply for the art exam

103
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,920
No

104
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,120
My dear mom

105
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,520
Didn't you

106
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,400
let me learn how to paint before?

107
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,080
I asked you to learn how to paint

108
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,320
to cultivate your interests

109
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,440
not to make a living

110
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,400
Let alone be an artist

111
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,000
What's wrong with being an artist?

112
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,600
Dad is also an artist

113
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,400
We're no worse off than others

114
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Right, Dad?

115
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,080
Actually, I think...

116
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,160
Xiao Datu

117
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,520
When I'm educating daughter,

118
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,640
you should keep quiet

119
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,080
Please continue

120
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,400
Sweetheart

121
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,640
That's enough

122
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,440
for us to have one artist

123
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,880
Please don't interfere

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,080
You are a student now

125
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,960
What should you do?

126
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,320
It's studying for the college entrance examination

127
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,640
That's your path

128
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,000
Now, go back to your room and study

129
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,320
But the college entrance examination

130
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,840
is not the only way, right?

131
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,720
People always have dreams

132
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,960
If there's no dream,

133
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
what's the difference with a salted fish?

134
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,840
Painting is my dream

135
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,000
I've never felt so strongly before

136
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
My dear mom

137
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,160
Just say yes

138
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,160
Xiaohua

139
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,760
Think about it carefully, okay?

140
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,960
Look at how you were just now

141
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,440
You kept talking nonsense

142
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,800
It's already so late

143
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,680
You're still talking about dreams

144
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,680
What's wrong with dreams?

145
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,840
Can dreams put food on the table?

146
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,960
You are a student now

147
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,640
What should students do?

148
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,880
They should study, study, and study

149
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,600
For the college entrance examination

150
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,400
That's your way out

151
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
Why don't you just know?

152
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,440
Hurry, go study

153
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,520
Since you don't want me

154
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,280
to learn how to paint,

155
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,340
then why did you

156
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,980
give me this name?

157
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,400
Still crying

158
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,520
You know your mom quite well

159
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,320
You have to go with the flow

160
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,320
You can't go against her

161
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,600
I didn't say anything before

162
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,600
I was afraid of getting things worse

163
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,880
This is the registration form

164
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,320
We have to sign it, right?

165
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,280
You have mother and father

166
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,240
Besides your mom

167
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,160
I can still do it

168
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,360
Xiaohua

169
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,800
Just now

170
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,640
How did you talk to your mom?

171
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Apologize to your mom

172
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,960
Mom

173
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,440
I'm sorry

174
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,000
I didn't mean to say that

175
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,160
What did you say?

176
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,400
What is there to apologize for?

177
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,800
There are no grudges between mother and daughter

178
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,360
Alright

179
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,600
Well, let's eat

180
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,720
I cooked some dishes

181
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,560
Tomato stir-fry for dinner

182
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,760
This is too sumptuous

183
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,840
Alright

184
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,760
Indeed, it's not enough

185
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,320
I'll go to the supermarket to buy more ingredients

186
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,000
We'll have a good feast tonight

187
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,280
Well

188
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,240
You two rest for a while

189
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,040
Thank you

190
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,440
Action

191
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,880
Dad

192
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,880
You actually have so much money

193
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm going to tell Mom

194
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,400
We need money

195
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,040
for the painting materials

196
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,760
This is all the money I have

197
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,440
Keep quiet

198
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,240
Okay

199
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,880
This is the study material for the art exam

200
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,560
There are only two of you in our class

201
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,120
taking the art exam

202
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
So if you have any questions,

203
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,160
I hope you can

204
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,600
help each other and ask for advice

205
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,280
And also,

206
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,360
the art class will start

207
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
from this week

208
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,360
Monday to Friday after school

209
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,140
And the whole day on Saturday

210
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Since both of you wanna study,

211
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,520
study hard

212
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,400
Don't be late

213
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,920
Don't worry, Ms. Fang

214
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,080
No matter what I do,

215
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,320
I will try my best to do it well

216
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,120
I will also work hard

217
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,680
Oh, and

218
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,400
In about a month,

219
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,400
the ability level test will begin

220
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
I believe

221
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,280
you will have no problem

222
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,080
with this exam

223
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,520
Thank you, teacher

224
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,240
Keep up the good work

225
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,400
Mengyu

226
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,880
What does the ability level test

227
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,160
usually cover?

228
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,600
Don't you know anything?

229
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,320
I feel like I know nothing at all

230
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,840
I signed up with just enthusiasm

231
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,680
This is the first step

232
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,080
for our provincial art exam

233
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,160
After passing this,

234
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,520
we'll have the chance to participate in

235
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,480
the provincial joint exam and school exams

236
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,480
Will it be difficult?

237
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,760
In short, it won't be too easy

238
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,840
But for those who

239
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,360
have no foundation,

240
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,920
it can be quite challenging

241
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,600
Then I'm in trouble

242
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,800
It's still a long way to go

243
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,760
The school exams and college entrance exams

244
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,080
are the real challenges

245
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,640
Aren't you full of enthusiasm?

246
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,680
Now you're hesitating?

247
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,680
I will do my best

248
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,520
The same with you

249
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,080
Of course

250
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,880
I'll go find Ms. Yu on the third floor

251
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,760
You go ahead

252
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,720
Okay, bye

253
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,160
Bye

254
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,600
Congratulations

255
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,200
Now you can focus on studying art

256
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,680
These paints and art supplies

257
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,560
were carefully chosen

258
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,560
by me and Ling Dong for you

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,760
And this is something

260
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,000
I specially prepared for you

261
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,240
Guys

262
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,720
I believe that I will succeed

263
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,760
in the entrance exam

264
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,560
Darling

265
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,920
I've been standing for a long time

266
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,840
Can I take a break?

267
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,560
No way

268
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,720
Stand straight

269
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,560
Tighten your stomach

270
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,480
Raise your head

271
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,360
Xiao Datu

272
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
After all these years,

273
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,840
why did you deceive me

274
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,720
and secretly save money?

275
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,800
What influence does it have on the child?

276
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,080
What kind of example did you set?

277
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,840
Mom

278
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,120
This...

279
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,320
It's reasonable, right?

280
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,560
How can this be understood?

281
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:14,840
Sweetheart

282
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,240
Our family is so warm

283
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,120
and pure

284
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,920
How could there be deception?

285
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,120
Tell me

286
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,080
I love you two so much

287
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,960
By the way

288
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,080
I specially and thoughtfully

289
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,960
enrolled you in a tutoring class

290
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,760
Classes start this week

291
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,320
Of course, in the meantime,

292
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,200
your dad also played a role

293
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,520
His hidden money came in handy,

294
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,560
as it paid for the tuition

295
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,600
Xiaohua

296
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,520
Thanks dad for his good intentions

297
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,480
Dad, thank you

298
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,280
Study hard

299
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,600
Okay

300
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,040
Stand straight

301
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,200
Tighten your stomach

302
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,640
Art training class

303
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,520
and tutoring class

304
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,040
happen to overlap in time

305
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,480
What should we do?

306
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,440
I have a way

307
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,000
Split you in half

308
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,160
You can still paint well

309
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,280
and keep it a secret from Mom

310
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,960
Good idea

311
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,280
You go first, let me see

312
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,000
It's just a joke

313
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,840
Can you have a sense of humor?

314
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,880
Xiaohua

315
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,080
Is that tutoring class

316
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,360
on campus or off campus?

317
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,480
Off campus

318
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,320
My mom gave me a student card

319
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,600
She said I can just

320
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
go to class with the card

321
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,080
That makes it much easier

322
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,200
Then you can just find someone

323
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,240
to attend the class for you

324
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,680
Yeah

325
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,000
Since it's off campus, right?

326
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,760
No one knows you, Xiaohua

327
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,200
Just find someone to substitute for you

328
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,840
That should work

329
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,520
Impressive

330
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,680
Flawless

331
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,960
Indeed

332
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,640
Really?

333
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,280
Say something

334
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,640
I am Xiaohua

335
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,840
Well...

336
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,800
This voice, although a bit rough

337
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,440
It can still be explained

338
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,560
Come on, stand up and take a look

339
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,280
Too tall

340
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,000
Qingtian

341
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,880
Looks like I have to rely on you

342
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,880
Rely on her

343
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,880
Then why didn't you say it earlier?

344
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,160
I suspected you were playing a trick on me

345
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,760
Yep

346
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,360
No need to suspect

347
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,120
When you start drawing,

348
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,320
you must feel

349
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,160
the weight of the pen

350
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
Don't draw so clumsily

351
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,040
Xiao Xiaohua's good at drawing

352
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,040
You can see her sketches

353
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
after class

354
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,640
Daughter, good morning

355
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,560
Good morning, Dad

356
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,080
Well

357
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,560
Why is breakfast so simple today?

358
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,800
What?

359
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,280
I'm going to tell Mom

360
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,480
Keep quiet

361
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,040
Breakfast is specially sumptuous

362
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,760
Yep

363
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,360
So, where's Mom?

364
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,520
She went to buy groceries

365
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,480
Oh

366
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,080
I'm done eating, I'm leaving

367
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:14,960
Hey

368
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,520
Where are you going?

369
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,760
I'm going for extra classes

370
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,120
Oh, extra classes

371
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,280
Eat more, take care of yourself first

372
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,560
I'm on a diet

373
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,240
I'm leaving

374
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,680
Why are you dieting at such a young age?

375
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,800
Bye

376
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,080
Goodbye

377
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,800
Take care and study well

378
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,960
Xiaohua

379
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,360
Oh

380
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,960
Ling Dong

381
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,680
Why are you here?

382
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,800
Xia Qingtian has something at home

383
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,080
I'm here to bring you art supplies these days

384
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,280
Thank you, that's very kind of you

385
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,720
It's no trouble, it's on my way

386
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,040
Then let me get the art supplies

387
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,840
No need, I'll carry them for you

388
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,480
Let's go

389
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,200
Thank you

390
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,480
The photo is blurry

391
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,960
I can't see the face clearly

392
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,080
But he should be very cool

393
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,480
Just like me back then

394
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,120
What are you doing?

395
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:16,760
What?

396
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,320
Where are you going?

397
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,720
Going to Xiaohua's room to look for clues

398
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,560
Oh

399
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,320
Hey

400
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,040
I'll go too

401
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,840
Oh dear

402
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,360
Honey

403
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,280
This...

404
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,560
This is our daughter's room

405
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,320
Hey

406
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,480
We shouldn't mess around

407
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,560
I don't think it's a good idea

408
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,720
Just taking a look

409
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,840
There's nothing

410
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,560
Nothing

411
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,560
No, there isn't anything

412
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,200
Take a look

413
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,200
What's this?

414
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,440
Hey

415
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,360
I don't think it's a good idea

416
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,040
Hey

417
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,720
Honey

418
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,360
Honey

419
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,720
Honey

420
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,480
XIao Datu

421
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,920
Look at this

422
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,760
Wow

423
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,680
Her sketches

424
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
She draws really well

425
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,480
Look at the facial lines

426
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,120
Clean and smooth

427
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,720
It's just what I drew

428
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
What I mean is...

429
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,240
It's good to draw when there's nothing to do

430
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,360
It helps relieve the pressure of studying

431
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,520
No, it's not

432
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,200
What's the point of this?

433
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,400
Our daughter is in love

434
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,480
What?

435
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,360
Look

436
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:36,920
Oh

437
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh dear

438
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,920
Which of these two boys

439
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,440
is the one pursuing our daughter?

440
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,000
Neither of them

441
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,760
The college entrance exam is coming up

442
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,720
She should be fully focused

443
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,880
on studying

444
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,880
How can she wholeheartedly study?

445
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,760
Look, Honey

446
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,960
During puberty,

447
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,640
these are normal problems

448
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,760
When we were young,

449
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,920
we were like this too, right?

450
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,280
How about I go talk to Xiaohua?

451
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,720
No

452
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,840
Don't act rashly

453
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,320
We have to carefully plan our approach

454
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,440
Mom, I'm leaving

455
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,360
Going to the extra class?

456
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,840
Yes

457
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,800
I'm going

458
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,880
Alright

459
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,080
Ling Dong

460
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,480
You're here

461
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,040
Did you wait long?

462
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,840
If I had known,

463
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,840
I would have left earlier

464
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,000
No, I just arrived too

465
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,280
Let's go

466
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,120
I'll take it

467
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,520
It's okay, it's not a big deal

468
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,560
Let's get on the car first

469
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,160
Hey, be careful

470
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,000
Mom, Dad

471
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,240
You're both here

472
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,400
You seem to be in a good mood

473
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,880
How's the extra classes going?

474
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,360
I think it's going well

475
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,640
The teacher's lectures are very engaging

476
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,720
I think

477
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,440
it should be effective

478
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,840
So, do you have any other classmates

479
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,960
taking the extra classes with you?

480
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,600
No, no other classmates

481
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,800
There's a study group

482
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,960
or something else

483
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,320
with your classmates, right?

484
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,560
Didn't he go to the extra classes with you?

485
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,200
Well, I improved my grades

486
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,040
Ms. Fang didn't ask us to continue

487
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,880
What's his name again?

488
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,680
Ling Dong

489
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,800
Ling Dong, right?

490
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,000
So during the winter break

491
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,280
you went to his place for extra classes?

492
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,480
No

493
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,440
I went to Lan Jinghui's place

494
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,000
A male classmate tutoring you?

495
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,400
You went to another

496
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,320
male classmate's house?

497
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,600
Which one is it, then?

498
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,760
Which one?

499
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,160
No, it's like this

500
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,880
That Ling Dong...

501
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,000
And that...

502
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,280
Lan Jinghui

503
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,960
Yes

504
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,400
Mom wants both of them

505
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,640
to come to our house for dinner

506
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,160
to cook delicious food for them

507
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:23,920
What?

508
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,400
What's wrong?

509
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,360
No, it's just...

510
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,120
Why do you want them

511
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,280
to come to our house for dinner?

512
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,320
That's normal, right?

513
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,920
They helped you with the extra classes

514
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,200
and being so nice to you

515
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,920
Mom should show some gratitude

516
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,160
Yeah

517
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,360
You spent the New Year at their house

518
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,800
That would be a trouble

519
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,640
So we should also

520
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,640
do something in return

521
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,560
It's a deal

522
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,520
You can go now

523
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,200
Yeah

524
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,080
You've been giving us

525
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,440
that teary-eyed

526
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,480
wanting to say but not saying look

527
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,640
for quite a while now

528
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,360
Go ahead

529
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,200
Tell us your wish

530
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,840
I have a small, small

531
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,480
tiny request

532
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,320
As long as it's not illegal or against the rules,

533
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,160
anything else is fine

534
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,360
This request

535
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,240
is neither illegal nor against the rules

536
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,160
And it can also fill your stomachs

537
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,760
This deal only brings profit, no loss

538
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,880
So

539
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,400
This Friday, come to my house for dinner

540
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,960
Battle plan for tonight

541
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,160
Break their psychological defenses

542
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
with delicious food

543
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,920
Find out who it really is

544
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,080
having a relationship with our daughter

545
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,080
with the truth spelled out through chat

546
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,560
Then, just let them go seperate

547
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,120
Shatter the budding emotions

548
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,040
Perfect

549
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,480
Yeah

550
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,760
First of all

551
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,880
We need to find out

552
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,000
who knows our girl's taste

553
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,480
Then

554
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,160
See who will serve our girl

555
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,400
Don't worry

556
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,520
What's that detective's name?

557
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,560
Furman

558
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,840
Then I am Fursholmes

559
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,200
What is it?

560
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,760
Sherlock Holmes

561
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,440
How ignorant

562
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,080
Xiao Datu

563
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,960
Draw less and read more

564
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,880
Okay?

565
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,840
Come on

566
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,720
Cut the vegetables

567
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,120
By the way

568
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,080
Uncle, what happened to your hand?

569
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,560
Just twisted it

570
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,400
Okay

571
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,080
So, once again, thank you to Uncle and Aunt

572
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,920
for inviting the two of us

573
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,600
to have dinner at their house

574
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,960
So we won't be polite

575
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,120
Thank you

576
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,880
Let's eat

577
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,440
Okay

578
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,280
Come, have some green beans

579
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
They look really delicious

580
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,440
Promote intestinal peristalsis

581
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,160
And it also nourishes the skin

582
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:33,880
Come on

583
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
Don't just sit there

584
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,480
This spare rib

585
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,240
looks really delicious

586
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,200
Eat more meat

587
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,240
I like meat

588
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,160
What's going on here?

589
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,520
Why aren't they serving our girl?

590
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,720
It definitely can't be that obvious

591
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,040
Let's observe a bit more

592
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,760
Come on, Lan Jinghui

593
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,880
Have a piece of pork belly

594
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,920
You can't reach this from there

595
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,840
Thank you

596
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,320
Ling Dong, you have some too

597
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,640
Thank you

598
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,840
Could it be that our girl

599
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,840
is also concerned about the two?

600
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,400
I wonder if my cooking

601
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,320
suits your tastes

602
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Come, have a taste of this

603
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,200
Oh

604
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,920
Mom, wait a moment

605
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,320
Ling Dong doesn't eat cilantro and chili

606
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,880
I told you

607
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,920
Something's wrong with it

608
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,800
But Lan Jinghui likes it

609
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,520
That's right

610
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,080
Without cilantro and chili

611
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,520
it's soulless

612
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,600
Seems like there's a problem with this too

613
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,360
It's fine

614
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,800
There're often some issues in connection

615
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,240
Daughter

616
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,640
Did you trouble the parents

617
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,720
when you went to

618
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,040
their house for tutoring?

619
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,120
Not at all

620
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,080
My grandmother really likes Xiaohua

621
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,240
She wishes she could go there every day

622
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,560
The main suspect

623
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,200
Well

624
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,360
Your home must be far from the school, right?

625
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,680
It's quite far

626
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,800
So when you go to school normally

627
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,000
Do you take the bus

628
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
or the subway?

629
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,880
I mainly ride my bike to school

630
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,600
It's very fast

631
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,840
Wait, that's not right

632
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,120
Ling Dong, when you go to school

633
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,920
you definitely take the bus, right?

634
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,840
No, Auntie

635
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,400
I also ride my bike to school

636
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:44,960
Hey

637
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,640
Mom, what are you doing?

638
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
Why are you asking so much?

639
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,120
Are you conducting a census?

640
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,000
Just let us eat, okay?

641
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,440
Let's eat

642
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,880
Dad, you too

643
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,920
Let's eat

644
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,760
Eat

645
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,000
Let's eat

646
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,840
Eat

647
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,080
Let's eat

648
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,440
Slow down

649
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,600
Don't run, or you'll get indigestion

650
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,120
We just finished eating

651
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,040
Your body can't handle it

652
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,720
Don't you think

653
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,080
auntie is trying to trick us?

654
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,560
No need to think, it's just it

655
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,440
Right?

656
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,760
You also feel that something is off

657
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,120
My mom seems strange, right?

658
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,960
But...

659
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,320
What is Auntie up to?

660
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,680
There must be a reason for the unusual behavior

661
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,400
Since I started taking

662
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,280
extra classes

663
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,320
She's been acting strange

664
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,600
Could it be...

665
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,320
Could it be that she found out...

666
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,200
About my painting classes?

667
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,320
Why didn't she just expose you?

668
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,760
Maybe she's just starting to suspect

669
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,400
Then why don't you

670
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,520
ask Uncle to find out some information?

671
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,400
Try to get some information from him

672
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,800
If my dad knows something

673
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,320
He would definitely let me know

674
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,920
We're on the same side

675
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,360
Now there's only one way

676
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
What's that?

677
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,880
Put Auntie's worries to rest

678
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,480
You make it sound easy

679
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
How do we do it?

680
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,440
Come on

681
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,360
I'll tell you

682
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,440
You know

683
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,920
Who is that bus guy?

684
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,000
I don't think they look alike

685
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,000
Put your hand down

686
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,200
Do you really think you're Sherlock Holmes?

687
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Sherlock Holmes

688
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,680
It's actually quite normal

689
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,560
I can't see anything unusual

690
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,080
Honey

691
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,480
What do you think

692
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,000
about these two boys?

693
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,680
I think they're both good

694
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,240
I think

695
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,800
Lan Jinghui is pretty good

696
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,400
He's kind and sweet

697
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,960
I actually think Ling Dong is good

698
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,040
He's stable and composed

699
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,120
He can achieve great things in the future

700
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,760
They're still young

701
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,040
It's not good to have so many deep thoughts

702
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,600
You're not young anymore

703
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,600
Yet you're restless and impatient

704
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,640
How will you be in the future?

705
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,360
What?

706
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,320
Now is the time of youth

707
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,280
So, we should be full of vitality

708
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,960
What?

709
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,160
You can see old age when you're young

710
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,200
You weren't composed when you're young

711
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,120
What can you achieve in the future?

712
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,400
Just like you

713
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:39,680
Look

714
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,400
What's wrong with me?

715
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,120
You've always been lively

716
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,720
and not serious

717
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,160
Why are you talking about me again?

718
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,040
What's wrong with me?

719
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,400
You've never listened to me

720
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,800
Let me tell you

721
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,540
Xiao Datu

722
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,520
Honey

723
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,320
What's wrong?

724
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,440
Go wash the dishes

725
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,720
Go take a shower

726
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,800
Cunning

727
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,120
Spicy brother

728
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,480
Then I'll go back first, bye

729
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,000
Goodbye

730
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,680
Goodbye

731
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,320
Goodbye

732
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:12,760
Take care

733
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,440
Okay

734
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,440
Who do you think Uncle and Auntie

735
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,720
like more, you or me?

736
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,120
No need to think about that

737
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,640
Yes

738
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,480
Of course, it's me

739
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,280
You're shameless

740
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,840
I still think it's me

741
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,720
Didn't you see

742
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,520
the way Auntie looks at me?

743
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,760
You just didn't see

744
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,480
the way Uncle looks at you

745
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,360
When he looks at me, he furrows his brow

746
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,480
When he looks at you, he furrows his brow

747
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,880
Then did you see that

748
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,600
after dinner

749
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,520
auntie didn't let me wash the dishes

750
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,240
because she was afraid I'd get tired

751
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,760
But Uncle gave me an orange

752
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:43,840
Did you get one?

753
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,120
So, what about Auntie

754
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,160
calling me by my nickname directly?

755
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:49,800
It's so warm

756
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,720
Yes, you win

757
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
Xiao Huihui

758
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,840
It's different

759
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,520
There's no connection

760
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,000
with Xiao Huihui

761
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,520
I'm using this example

762
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,160
It means...

763
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,640
I'm easy-going

764
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,360
Auntie gets along well with me

765
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,560
She directly calls me by my name

766
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,220
That's a different thing

767
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,220
You know what?

768
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,120
It's not that easy to get into Hengyuan

769
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,160
It's normal to be eliminated

770
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,640
And the purpose of the trial is to

771
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,320
go give it a try

772
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,520
You've already tried

773
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,400
You're better than me

774
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,480
It's normal to be better than you, right?

775
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,440
I was just careless that day

776
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,640
I didn't lose that game

777
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,160
Or let's just wait until next year

778
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,280
How foolish

779
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,440
I won't compete in my senior year

780
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,600
Yeah, I forgot

781
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,240
By the way

782
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,600
I heard that when I went for the trial,

783
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,440
you never came for practice

784
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah

785
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,080
I'm done playing

786
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,680
I've tried

787
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,080
I lost

788
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,920
Come on, I'll give you a chance

789
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,840
One-on-one

790
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,880
Don't leave you any regrets

791
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,000
Have you thought about the future?

792
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:05,840
I mean,

793
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,760
after graduating from high school

794
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,400
I don't know

795
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,520
Maybe I'll continue playing basketball

796
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,520
I'm leaving

797
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,880
What are your plans for the future?

798
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,160
I wanna go to university

799
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,000
The PKU

800
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,600
Actually,

801
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,080
you guys played really well that day

802
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,000
If you had gone for the tryout,

803
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
you might have been able to stay

804
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,440
Don't practice alone all the time

805
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,200
Call me anytime

806
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,080
if you need someone to play with

807
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,440
Come on
