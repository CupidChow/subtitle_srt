[Episode 25]

3
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,520
Now you've got

4
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,960
the voluntary application form

5
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,760
According to the tradition

6
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,400
everyone can choose one university

7
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,240
that you most wanna attend

8
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,880
Next

9
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,360
is to double your efforts

10
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,280
towards this goal

11
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,520
Ms. Fang

12
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,760
When will you collect it?

13
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,960
No rush for that

14
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:16,960
I hope you can

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,160
seriously consider

16
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,800
and fill it out

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,480
according to their actual situation

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,520
After filling it out

19
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,400
it will be collected by the class monitor

20
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,800
and posted next Monday

21
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,720
Okay

22
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,080
I'd like to go to the PKU

23
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,000
Daydreaming

24
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,960
Mom

25
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,320
Hey

26
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,760
Dongdong, you're back

27
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,640
Yes

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Mom, just let it go

29
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,400
Let me do it

30
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,520
No need

31
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,520
You can watch TV there for a while

32
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,160
Wait a moment

33
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,960
It'll be done soon

34
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,840
Dongdong, come wash your hands and eat

35
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,760
Why don't you...

36
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,920
This...

37
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,760
Mom

38
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,640
What's going on?

39
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,960
Are you feeling unwell?

40
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,520
Look at you

41
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,440
You're still young

42
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,640
Yet you always ask for details

43
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,200
There's nothing wrong

44
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,840
It's probably just a seasonal change

45
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,840
and a slight chill

46
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,600
There's really nothing wrong

47
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,920
Don't worry

48
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,440
Then why did you hide it from me?

49
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,080
If I tell you

50
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,960
you'll still ask for all the details

51
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,080
There's nothing wrong

52
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,880
Really?

53
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,360
Yes

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,320
I know my own body

55
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,400
Don't worry

56
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,400
Mom

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,440
I'll come home early these days

58
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,840
If there's anything at home

59
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,800
leave it to me

60
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
You just rest

61
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,240
Okay

62
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,520
Look at you

63
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
You're always worrying

64
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,600
at such a young age

65
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,640
Alright, let's go

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,400
Let's eat quickly

67
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,160
Look

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,680
I've made your favorite dish

69
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,560
Tomato scrambled eggs

70
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,840
Come on

71
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,480
Sit down quickly

72
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,140
I'm scared

73
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,520
Come on, just check your grades

74
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,120
Just check it

75
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,640
Then you do it

76
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,720
Or you do it

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,920
Then I'll do it

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,240
What's wrong?

79
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,880
I didn't pass it, right?

80
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,400
Why is this score?

81
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,760
I knew it, it's definitely gonna...

82
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,760
You passed

83
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,800
I passed

84
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,160
I passed?

85
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,080
You passed

86
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,840
You got more than 30 points than the line

87
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,440
I told you before

88
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,560
You can definitely do it

89
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,040
So, can I

90
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,120
apply for the PKU?

91
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,400
Yes

92
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,280
Okay

93
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,000
Alright

94
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,400
To celebrate Xiao Xiaohua's success

95
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,520
in the exam,

96
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,200
It's the first step of a long journey

97
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,200
After school tonight,

98
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,040
we will celebrate

99
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,800
We must

100
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's go for spicy hot pot

101
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,760
Spicy hot pot

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,840
Spicy hot pot

103
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,280
Hot pot

104
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,080
Fragrant pot

105
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,800
Hot pot

106
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,320
Let's have both

107
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,480
You guys go tonight

108
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,560
I have something else to do

109
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,640
Why do you always

110
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,480
act like a "good student"

111
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
at this time?

112
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,000
Really?

113
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,160
You wanna go home and study hard again?

114
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,600
Is that it?

115
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,280
You wanna do better than us

116
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,200
Let me tell you, no way

117
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,680
No

118
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,120
I really have something to do

119
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,280
No

120
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,880
Just have a meal

121
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,840
How much time will it take?

122
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,640
It's okay

123
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,400
I also need to go home early today

124
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,000
and tell my parents about it

125
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,920
Maybe, next time

126
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,400
Alright

127
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,440
Let's celebrate again then

128
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,920
Look at how cool he is

129
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,560
Look, he's amazing

130
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,720
Looks a bit like you when you were young

131
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,280
Look how cute she is

132
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,280
When I was young,

133
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,160
I was that cute

134
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,880
You are much cuter than her

135
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,120
Look, so adorable

136
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,920
Indeed

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,520
It reminds me of when I was young

138
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,280
Mr. Xiao Datu

139
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,240
Ms Guo Ying

140
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,080
your daughter

141
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,640
has something important to announce

142
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,240
Just go

143
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,360
We're watching TV

144
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,600
Just move aside

145
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,440
What's going on?

146
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,000
Which one is more important

147
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,280
TV or your daughter?

148
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,720
Your daughter passed the exam

149
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,200
I got 30 more points than the line

150
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,600
Oh

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,520
Oh

152
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,880
That's it?

153
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,800
That's all?

154
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,720
Just that?

155
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,800
Just that reaction?

156
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
What else?

157
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,560
Alright, go back to your rooms and rest

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,200
Don't think that learning to paint

159
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,440
means you don't have to study other subjects

160
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,760
Don't disturb us watching TV

161
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,280
Really

162
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,880
Where does it go?

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,520
It's so fun

164
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,240
Yes

165
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,960
Oh...

166
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,320
Will our daughter

167
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,440
be moved to tears?

168
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,320
Very possible

169
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,520
After all, artist is always

170
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,120
full of emotions

171
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,360
When did you prepare?

172
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,560
This afternoon

173
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,720
Your mom helped you check the scores

174
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
and then bought these for you

175
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,880
Look

176
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,920
She has never bought me

177
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,840
such expensive paints before

178
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,760
And brushes

179
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Can you compete with your daughter?

180
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,680
Our daughter is very talented

181
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,800
Unlike you, who's not focused on work

182
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,640
Mom

183
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,640
I'm really happy

184
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,600
that you'd actually go with me

185
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,360
Daughter

186
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,680
I've been thinking a lot lately

187
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,680
You still have a long way to go

188
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,160
There are still many things you can do

189
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,480
So

190
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,400
We just want you to be happy

191
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,520
Do what you love to do

192
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,960
That's the happiest thing

193
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
We're not that capable

194
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,280
The rest is up to you

195
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,160
Dad, mom

196
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,240
I will definitely work hard

197
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,760
and not let you down

198
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,600
I like rainy days

199
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,360
Umbrellas of different colors

200
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,600
are just like people who're dancing

201
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,720
Rainy days and basketball go well together

202
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,320
How to play basketball in the rain?

203
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,640
Well, indoor basketball

204
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,120
Fancy basketball court

205
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,520
Mom

206
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Breakfast is ready

207
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,960
I'm going to school first

208
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,280
Mom

209
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,280
Mom

210
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,200
Mom

211
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,240
Mom, what's wrong?

212
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,120
Aren't you feeling well?

213
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,360
Don't move, I'll get you some medicine

214
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,520
It's okay

215
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,080
It's okay

216
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,960
I just

217
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,240
I got up too quickly

218
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,680
and felt dizzy

219
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,840
Maybe low blood pressure

220
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,440
I'm feeling better now

221
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:16,920
No, mom

222
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,000
Listen to me

223
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,040
I'll take the day off today

224
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,840
and take you to the hospital

225
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,880
I already told you, it's fine

226
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,800
Look at me now

227
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,880
I'm fine

228
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,800
Just go to school today

229
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,240
We'll go to the hospital on the weekend

230
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,040
You can't be late today

231
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,520
Go to school quickly, be obedient

232
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,000
Mom is really fine

233
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,240
I'll be fine in a while

234
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,640
And you...

235
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,280
Don't work today either

236
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,480
Rest well

237
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,600
If there's anything, call me

238
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,280
Okay, I will

239
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,800
Don't be late for school

240
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,600
Remember to call me

241
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,120
if there's anything

242
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,160
Alright, go ahead

243
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,800
Well, I'm leaving then

244
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,440
Just go

245
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,520
Hurry up

246
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,920
Take a good rest

247
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,320
Don't worry

248
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,440
Go

249
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,080
Oh my god, so many

250
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,000
Where are these from?

251
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,480
They are all so good

252
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,680
Rousi, where are you going?

253
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,720
Me?

254
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't wanna go too far from home

255
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,440
Rong University

256
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,840
Rong University

257
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,000
It is also good

258
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,600
Many majors there are not bad

259
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,400
What can we do? Let's work hard

260
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,240
Let's work hard

261
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,400
Xiaohua, you are so talented

262
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,200
You actually wanna apply for PKU

263
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,320
Oh my god

264
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
Maybe just for fun

265
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,000
Didn't you see that Lan Jinghui

266
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,760
also apply for the PKU?

267
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,280
Look down on me, Liu Shu

268
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,440
PKU is not

269
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,560
where you can easily get into

270
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,360
If everyone can get in

271
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
then is it still PKU?

272
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,840
Do you care about me so much?

273
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,560
So strange

274
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,240
What's strange?

275
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Ling Dong

276
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,640
Ling Dong

277
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
He didn't apply any school

278
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,680
Where is he?

279
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,400
Why didn't he apply?

280
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,520
Why didn't he write anything?

281
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,040
Still not applied

282
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,680
It doesn't matter if he applies or not

283
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,120
Hello

284
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,320
Aunt Ma

285
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Is my mom with you?

286
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,080
No

287
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,720
Your mom is not with me

288
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,960
Is there something wrong?

289
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,040
Nothing

290
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,640
I see

291
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,080
The class is about to begin

292
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,680
Where are you going?

293
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,840
I have something to do, I'll go back first

294
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,240
Can you help me ask for leave?

295
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,120
What's the matter? Why so urgent?

296
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,680
Mom

297
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:14,960
Mom

298
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,400
Mom, what's wrong with you?

299
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,960
Mom

300
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,200
Mom

301
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,440
How long has the patient been unconscious?

302
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,320
I'm not quite sure

303
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,200
We still need to

304
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,120
do further examinations

305
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,880
Don't worry

306
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,880
Wait outside

307
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,440
Mom

308
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,640
Why hasn't dad come out yet?

309
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,880
Why did you come?

310
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,480
You ran off in such a hurry

311
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,040
Can I feel at ease?

312
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,720
Don't worry

313
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,720
Auntie will be fine

314
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,720
Thank you

315
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,200
Doctor, how is the situation?

316
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,160
Luckily, you brought her here in time

317
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,680
She is now out of danger

318
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,120
However,

319
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,760
we still recommend

320
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,360
to stay in the hospital for a while

321
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,480
Because of her illness

322
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,680
It's mainly due to overwork

323
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,560
Usually, pay more attention to rest

324
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,400
Okay?

325
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:50,960
Okay

326
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,960
Well, you're her son, right?

327
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
Go and handle the hospital admission procedures first

328
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,120
Okay, that's it

329
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,960
Alright

330
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,200
Okay, thank you, doctor

331
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,360
Thank you, doctor

332
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,160
It's nothing

333
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Normally,

334
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,280
the process is

335
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,760
that you pay the fees first

336
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,240
Then I'll go get the medicine

337
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,680
Right?

338
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,720
Yes

339
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,960
Okay, thank you

340
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,800
You're welcome

341
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,880
Are you alright?

342
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,160
I'm fine

343
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,480
Go back to class

344
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,160
How can I do that?

345
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,560
Leaving you alone here

346
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,240
I already asked Xiao Xiaohua

347
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,040
to take a leave

348
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,080
If I'll go back now

349
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,080
it's for nothing

350
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,360
Zhang Li's family member

351
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,720
Come, sign here

352
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,880
You sign first

353
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,160
This is the prescription, right?

354
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,080
I'll get the medicine first

355
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,120
Where is the pharmacy?

356
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,400
Hello, please get the medicine

357
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,240
Counter 3, right?

358
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,720
It's not time yet, wait for your number to be called

359
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,840
Hello

360
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,680
We're missing these two

361
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,520
You have to go to the Chinese medicine department to get them

362
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,520
Hello, can I ask

363
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,520
where I can get these two medicines?

364
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,520
Go along this way

365
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,400
and keep going straight

366
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:39,960
Then turn left

367
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,000
You'll see a white door

368
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,840
It's inside there

369
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,440
Alright, thank you

370
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,120
Where is it?

371
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,840
Is this where I get this medicine?

372
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:13,920
Let me check

373
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,120
Wait a moment

374
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,200
Young man

375
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,960
Look at you

376
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,640
Didn't you get medicine at the hospital before?

377
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,360
Who comes to the hospital every day for no reason?

378
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,120
Here, your medicine

379
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,520
Alright, thank you

380
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,200
Because of long-term

381
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,920
excessive fatigue

382
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,720
combined with not resting properly

383
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,680
This led to myocardial damage

384
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,640
If you had brought her later,

385
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,080
there could have been a life-threatening situation

386
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,760
What happened?

387
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,760
Why are you still here?

388
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,680
Oh...

389
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,120
Didn't you say you were gonna stay overnight?

390
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,600
I'll stay with you

391
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,640
If you're tired

392
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,520
You can rest for a while

393
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,480
We can take turns

394
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,320
No need

395
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,400
I can manage on my own

396
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,760
Come on

397
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,520
Sit down

398
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,840
Check it

399
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,640
What about these?

400
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,480
Why haven't I seen this before?

401
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,920
I must have missed it

402
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,920
I'll go again

403
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,320
Wait

404
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,320
I'll go with you

405
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,600
Let's go

406
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,800
Are you sure?

407
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,760
I remember it being the other way around

408
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,280
We're here

409
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Sure

410
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,400
I've been searching for so long

411
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,760
It's surprisingly close

412
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,200
Her health hasn't been great

413
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,920
So besides home and school,

414
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,880
the hospital is where

415
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,720
I come most often

416
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:41,840
What happened?

417
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,640
Take a nap, I'll watch over

418
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,560
Lan Jinghui

419
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,280
Disciple

420
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,800
Why are you here?

421
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,600
Ling Dong's mother is sick

422
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,600
I came to visit her

423
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,880
My mom specially made

424
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,200
the chicken soup

425
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,280
Your mom doesn't suspect

426
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,000
me and Ling Dong?

427
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,720
What?

428
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,200
Young love, huh?

429
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,320
That was ages ago

430
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,160
We've moved on

431
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,080
Already moved on so quickly?

432
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,440
What are you doing here?

433
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,760
Let's go

434
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,240
Here, mom

435
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,200
I feel much better now

436
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,240
Really?

437
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,080
I feel particularly energetic today

438
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,080
That's good

439
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,440
This is the freshest

440
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,480
Who's here?

441
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,600
Hello, auntie

442
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,080
Dongdong's classmate

443
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,480
This is the chicken soup my mom made

444
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,560
It's really delicious

445
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,560
Thank you

446
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,680
Thank you for coming to see me

447
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,680
Thank you so much

448
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,960
And you brought so many things

449
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,280
Don't let it affect your studies

450
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,520
It's alright

451
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,160
It's the weekend today

452
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,760
Have you finished your homework?

453
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,400
I've finished it

454
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,200
Doctor

455
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,520
Doctor

456
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,880
Dr. Zhang

457
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,880
You guys chat first

458
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,720
I'll go wash some fruit

459
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,000
It's quite good

460
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,080
We'll observe for another two days

461
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,480
If there are no problems,

462
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,160
you can go home if there's nothing wrong

463
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,240
with your report

464
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,280
Thank you

465
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,320
Doctor

466
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,880
Can we leave a few days earlier?

467
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,640
My son's birthday is coming up

468
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,560
I wanna spend it with him at home

469
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,160
Sure

470
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
But remember

471
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,200
Rest properly at home

472
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,680
Okay

473
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,520
Thank you, doctor

474
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,920
Thank you, doctor

475
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,680
I told you, we can leave the hospital now

476
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,560
Auntie

477
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,360
Hurry up and try the chicken soup

478
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,320
made by my mom while it's hot

479
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,120
Thank you

480
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,680
Ling Dong, are you okay?

481
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,080
You need to rest more these days

482
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,680
Or

483
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,320
I can stay here with you

484
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,120
No need

485
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,560
I'm fine here

486
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,200
You should go back quickly

487
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,400
Don't worry

488
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,280
During the days you're not at school

489
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,760
I'll share homework and notes

490
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,680
with you

491
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,720
He will stay here

492
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,960
to take care of Auntie

493
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,160
He won't have time to do notes and homework

494
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,680
That's true

495
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,920
Don't listen to him

496
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,920
Just give it to me, it's okay

497
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,680
Alright

498
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,240
I won't go out then

499
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,040
I still have to go upstairs

500
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Okay, call us if you need anything

501
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,120
Bye bye

502
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,320
Xiaohua

503
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,720
You've drawn so many pictures

504
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,280
I started later than others

505
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,440
So I need more time to practice

506
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,800
How come there's a kettle here?

507
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,400
This is from my grandma's generation

508
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,400
Where did you find it?

509
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,280
Throw it away

510
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,360
No, no, no

511
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,160
This is my lucky kettle

512
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,320
Such an old-fashioned kettle

513
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,600
This question is too niche

514
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,240
We're in a different era

515
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,240
Why use this kind of thing

516
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,160
This is...

517
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,320
A kettle

518
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,840
Will they really ask this question in the exam?

519
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,840
It's a predicted question, of course

520
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,600
Strategic guessing

521
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,520
We can't miss

522
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,320
any possibility

523
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,120
Be quiet

524
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Three hours for the exam

525
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,520
Please make good use of your time

526
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,720
Classmates

527
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,240
The topic for our sketch this time is

528
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,480
"Rainy Day"

529
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,480
and draw three figures in motion

530
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,920
PKU

531
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,320
Wait for us

532
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,440
PKU

533
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,920
Wait for us

534
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,840
PKU

535
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,840
Wait for us

536
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,400
What?

537
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,920
Lan Jinghui actually guessed the topic

538
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,920
He got lucky, didn't he?

539
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,480
Even if it was luck

540
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,520
he still got it right

541
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,200
Anyway, I'm grateful to him this time

542
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,080
Never thought he could

543
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,440
be somewhat useful in critical moments

544
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,040
What about his final exam?

545
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,760
Can he guess it right?

546
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,800
What are you thinking?

547
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
For the final exam predictions

548
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,360
we'll go to Ling Dong, of course

549
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,360
Ling Dong is amazing

550
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,960
but Doraemon's predictions

551
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,680
are not that bad

552
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,960
Little Doraemon?

553
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,640
Who's Little Doraemon?

554
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,960
I won't tell you

555
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,240
You're so annoying

556
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,440
How could you only say half of it?

557
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,040
I'm not telling you

558
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,680
I'm not telling you

559
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,120
I'm not telling you

560
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,280
Tell me quickly
