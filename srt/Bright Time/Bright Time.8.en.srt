1
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,400
You two have gone too far

2
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,200
He secretly practiced behind our backs

3
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,400
What do you want to do

4
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,600
Trying to steal me on purpose

5
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,960
The limelight of the talent contest

6
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,360
But that song just now

7
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
It sounds pretty nice

8
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,600
Otherwise

9
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,720
Let's practice this song

10
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,960
Still change

11
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,640
We've been practicing for so long

12
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,920
Is it sick to change?

13
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,440
Can you still practice?

14
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,000
Practice

15
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,400
Come

16
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
I feel that my opponents are so strong

17
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,280
Their clothes are also beautiful

18
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,120
I think our clothes

19
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,000
It's nice too, isn't it

20
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,960
Never grow the ambition of others

21
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
Destroy your own prestige, right?

22
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,520
Winning

23
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,360
Winning

24
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,360
Yeah. Where's the others

25
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,600
I didn't see Sheng

26
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
Don't call Sheng quickly

27
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,080
I've just called

28
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,880
But no one answers

29
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,880
You're all here

30
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,480
Teacher

31
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,160
How's the preparation going

32
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,440
Where's Ling Dong?

33
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,560
He hasn't come yet

34
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,640
Didn't come

35
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,840
It's okay, don't worry

36
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,840
Ling Dong is definitely not

37
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,120
People who fall off the chain at critical moments

38
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,200
Students

39
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,760
The game is about to begin

40
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,480
Please get ready and come on

41
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,640
What to do

42
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,120
It's okay it's okay don't panic

43
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,360
So Ma Yiming

44
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,520
You go to the door and wait

45
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,600
After Ling Dong came over for a while

46
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,480
You bring him straight over

47
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,880
Good

48
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,920
I'll go with you

49
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,400
walk

50
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,360
Dear leaders

51
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,920
Distinguished guests

52
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,760
Dear teachers and students

53
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,960
Good afternoon everyone

54
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,240
Welcome to our city

55
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,720
The 13th High School Talent Competition

56
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
On behalf of the organizer, I would like to

57
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,160
To the arrival of the distinguished guests

58
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,400
Express a warm welcome

59
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,600
And heartfelt thanks

60
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,880
Now I declare

61
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,200
The thirteenth session of our city

62
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,400
High School Talent Competition

63
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,960
Official start

64
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,080
How's it going

65
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Waited at the door for half an hour

66
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,040
Haven't come yet

67
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,000
Chenjun Middle School, is it?

68
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,120
You're next

69
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,160
Getting ready to wait at the side curtain

70
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,960
But we're not all there yet

71
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,240
Can you help us

72
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,640
Arrange a little later

73
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,080
The order is all set

74
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,280
If you want to change

75
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,720
You can only negotiate with the team behind you

76
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,520
It's okay, so I'll negotiate

77
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,400
You guys get ready

78
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,880
Xiangbei No.1 Middle School Preparation

79
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,800
Beside the ancient road outside the long pavilion

80
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,600
The grass is green and the sky is green

81
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,000
What a visual feast

82
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,840
What about the next show

83
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,280
Will lead us into

84
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,160
Different art hall

85
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,880
Please enjoy below

86
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
Brought by Junde No.1 Middle School

87
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,880
Accordion solo

88
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,400
Raise your hijab

89
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,000
What to do

90
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,400
Teacher Fang has helped us transfer to

91
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,240
The last one

92
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:24,880
But

93
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,560
Improvise

94
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:27,960
Ling Dong

95
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,200
Ling Dong, why did you come here?

96
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,120
Excuse me

97
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,920
I've been delayed by something

98
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,440
You, you, what's wrong with your face

99
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,760
I'll get you a band-aid

100
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,520
No need

101
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,880
Time is tight and tasks are heavy

102
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,240
Let's get ready first

103
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,840
Brother Grey, someone is watching

104
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,440
Perform first

105
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,360
I'll settle accounts with you after the show

106
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,520
Step onto the stage

107
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,120
Thanks to Chun Tak High School

108
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,760
Bring wonderful performances

109
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,320
Classmate Cha is in his prime

110
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,880
The book business angrily reprimanded Fang Qiu

111
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,080
A teenager is a man who listens

112
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,800
It makes people feel

113
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,160
Clean and beautiful words

114
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,160
Please enjoy Youchen County Middle School below

115
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,400
Bring the band to sing

116
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,880
An unfinished time

117
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,440
Applause, please

118
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,680
What's going on

119
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,600
The lights went out

120
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,240
Our Chenjun Middle School

121
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Until this moment

122
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,240
For the first time I believed

123
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,960
Unstoppable blood

124
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,000
And the determination to keep improving

125
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,400
Can eventually create miracles

126
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,400
Cheers

127
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,280
Celebrate our rooftop team

128
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,200

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,280
Best Idea Award

132
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:47,840
Xiao Xiaohua

133
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,760
You sang amazingly today

134
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,800
Didn't run a single note

135
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,080
This is all Lan Jinghui

136
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,440
Correct my intonation. Well corrected

137
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,680
These are all minor problems

138
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,480
It's just that today almost

139
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,720
I'm about to be screwed up by someone

140
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,360
Sorry

141
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,240
I didn't mean to be late today

142
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,000
Then I'll call you

143
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,600
Why don't you answer

144
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,520
What happened

145
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,280
It's okay to accidentally fall

146
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,720
Ling Dong is definitely not

147
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,520
deliberately late

148
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,480
He must be

149
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,840
Something delayed me on the road

150
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,600
No no

151
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,760
You guys stop talking

152
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,120
Hurry up and eat, it's cold

153
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,440
Then he

154
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,320
Lan Jinghui, eat it quickly

155
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,200
You have made the most of the credit

156
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,720
Brother Hui has made great contributions

157
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,960
My credit is not small

158
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,520
Is it not

159
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,440
Grey Brother

160
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,120
What you promised me earlier

161
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,680
I haven't seen one till now

162
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,080
I'm not

163
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,760
Teach someone the guitar these days

164
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,800
Have you delayed this matter

165
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,160
I promise you

166
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,400
It will be in place tomorrow

167
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,040
This is delicious

168
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,080
Lan Jinghui

169
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,280
You make that gesture

170
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,800
Why is the little finger on it

171
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,920
Isn't it okay for anyone

172
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,880
My little finger can only be below

173
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,200
Me too

174
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,960
Not me

175
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,920
I've been like this since I was a kid

176
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,960
Okay, stop paying attention to this weird point

177
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,920
Hurry up and eat

178
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,560
Come, come, come, come

179
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,520
Touch again

180
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,600
Cheers

181
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,720
Shohoku City Talent Competition

182
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,560
Best Idea Award

183
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,120
It's amazing!

184
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,240
Daughter, from childhood to childhood

185
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
You've never won an award

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,040
Get it as soon as you get it

187
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,280
Such a good award

188
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,760
The cow is dead

189
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,120
My daughter is amazing

190
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,800
You surpassed Dad

191
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,040
Where do you think this prize should be put

192
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,440
Where to put it

193
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,240
Put put put put

194
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,080
Put it on the balcony

195
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,040
Yes, yes, yes, balcony, put balcony

196
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,280
No, no, no, the balcony is too grand

197
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,800
Can't put it here

198
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,440
Can't put it here

199
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,400
This way

200
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,960
Put it in that studio

201
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,360
Yes, yes, yes

202
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,320
Yes, yes, yes

203
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,800
It's not like you won the prize

204
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,360
What studio do you put

205
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,080
This way this way

206
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,600
put

207
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,200
Put it in my daughter's bedroom

208
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,760
Yes, yes, yes

209
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:17,920
No way

210
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,680
She looked at the bedroom alone

211
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,760
None of us can see it

212
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,880
We need to see it collectively

213
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,360
Is the dining room right

214
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,080
In the dining room

215
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,680
Good morning. Are you Xiao Xiaohua?

216
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,560
Goodbye

217
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,080
Little painting, I like you so much

218
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,840
Early painting

219
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,400
Come on, small painting

220
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,440
Come on, small painting

221
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,160
Small paintings, small paintings, come on, small paintings

222
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,600
Little drawing your video is awesome

223
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,240
Little painting I watched your video

224
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,120
Little painting, you have to work hard

225
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,560
Xiao Hua, you sing really well

226
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,080
Small painting

227
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,240
Particularly powerful

228
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,000
Small painting

229
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,520
You're really, really, really powerful

230
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,720
I like you very much after watching your video

231
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,280
Small painting

232
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,720
sunny day

233
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,160
It's really weird

234
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,240
As soon as I entered the school

235
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,960
There are a lot of people I don't know

236
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,880
Say hello to me

237
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,000
Scared me to death

238
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,360
That's a good thing, little painting

239
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,760
Prove that you are popular right now

240
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,840
But I'm not used to it

241
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,480
What's so unaccustomed to this

242
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,120
Get used to it slowly

243
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,800
Where is Xu Mengyu

244
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,160
No no

245
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,040
Where is Xiao Xiaohua

246
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,480
Xiao Xiaohua

247
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,680
Looking for you

248
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,000
You guys did a wonderful show

249
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,800
No, it's so handsome

250
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,080
Here's for you

251
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,960
I hope I can be friends with you

252
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,880
OK thank you

253
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,960
Remember to read the letter

254
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,880
Small painting

255
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
You're literally a celebrity now

256
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,240
We have supporters

257
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,200
Delivering a message to you

258
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,120
Isn't it just a competition

259
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,840
As for

260
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,720
What's so remarkable about it

261
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,440
Liu Shu

262
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,080
If you're jealous of the little painting, just say it

263
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,520
What are you doing? This is

264
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,320
I'm jealous of her

265
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,120
Last year we dreamed

266
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,920
When taking part in the competition

267
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,160
It's not as high-profile as she is, is it

268
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,160
All right

269
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,520
Not going to the biology lab

270
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,320
What are you doing

271
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,560
Can't eat grapes and say grapes are sour

272
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,480
I've been waiting for you for a long time

273
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,520
Lan Jinghui

274
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,200
You're not just

275
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,520
The last of the grade to get to school

276
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,520
You're the last in the whole school

277
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,840
I won a prize yesterday and it was inflated, didn't I

278
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,480
No

279
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,160
How could I possibly expand

280
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,720
Be serious

281
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,400
Why are you late

282
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:30,760
Had slept

283
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,320
I really slept

284
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,240
Look at my dark circles

285
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:33,880
lack of sleep

286
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,080
Go home and go to sleep

287
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,120
Hello Director

288
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,400
How do you

289
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,080
Why are you late

290
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,200
The car broke down and just repaired it in the morning

291
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,720
My face fell yesterday

292
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,880
I didn't accidentally make it fine

293
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,400
Go to class

294
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,560
Goodbye, Director

295
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,520
Ling Dong

296
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,520
Be careful next time you ride your bike

297
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,080
Understood, Director, Goodbye, Director

298
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:00,920
Director

299
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,920
You believe such a ridiculous reason

300
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,120
I'm true

301
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,440
I really sleep

302
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,600
Why haven't you gone home yet

303
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,080
Go to class

304
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,760
Hurry up

305
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,120
Go!

306
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,520
Thank you, Director

307
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,080
What about this class today

308
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,240
Our main task is

309
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,520
Solve these onions

310
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,840
Today's experimental topic

311
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
is a crude extraction of genes

312
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,600
Free grouping in pairs

313
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,160
One is responsible for doing the experiment

314
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,720
What about the other one in charge of recording

315
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,480
Onions are more irritating

316
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,400
So what

317
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,800
Each person has a pair of goggles on the table

318
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,720
And a pair of gloves

319
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,720
Is everyone clear

320
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,560
Clear

321
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,080
Report

322
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,960
Excuse me, teacher

323
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,720
I'm late

324
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,880
Next time pay attention

325
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,320
The Light of Chen County came to report for duty

326
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,880
Lan Jinghui, what are you fooling around

327
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,720
Don't want to go to class

328
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
No no

329
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,680
Go and join Ling Dong

330
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,240
Grey Brother

331
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,800
Where are my new shoes

332
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
In your place

333
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,160
If you don't understand anything, you can ask me

334
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,080
Crude extraction and identification of genes

335
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,640
At this stage, we can

336
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,920
Do such an advanced experiment

337
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,960
No, is there this in the book

338
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,280
I'm afraid of what

339
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,160
Don't you

340
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,120
You can't do it yourself

341
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,520
Can't hold on

342
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,680
Much more

343
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,080
Too little again

344
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,320
Mengyu

345
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,000
Your onion was cut for you

346
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,240
What are you doing? Are you so moved

347
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,280
Who touched me was smoked by you

348
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,160
Don't sit there and make notes

349
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,920
Come here for a moment

350
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:15,960
What are you doing

351
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,680
I won't do it. Don't rely on me

352
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,960
Help me take off my goggles

353
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,840
I have something in my hand

354
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,960
Why are there so many things

355
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,320
put on

356
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,080
Why

357
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,240
I want my experiments to be recorded

358
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,200
Could be more accurate

359
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,520
Is it okay

360
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,640
I keep my eyes closed

361
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,880
It can also be recorded very accurately

362
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,320
Then keep remembering

363
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,080
Mix the mixture

364
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,520
Strain out with two layers of gauze

365
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,560
The precipitated solution is then

366
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,480
Add another ten milliliters of

367
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,200
Pre-cooled ethanol solution

368
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,280
Then let stand

369
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,400
How did you get the injury on your face

370
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,160
Then let stand

371
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,120
Record

372
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,960
How did you all do it

373
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,400
Oh my God, it's Ling Dong

374
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,240
Look at the speed

375
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,800
This accuracy

376
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,000
slag ash

377
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,360
You're a god teammate

378
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,560
You simply lay down and win

379
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,400
What is lying down and winning

380
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,800
I'm also in our group

381
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,960
Would you like a share

382
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,000
conscientious

383
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,560
Not taking notes

384
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,600
Where did this lying win come from

385
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,640
Is it not

386
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,360
Have you finished remembering

387
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,600
Go

388
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,280
I was forgotten when you interrupted me like this

389
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,000
Go quickly, go quickly, go quickly

390
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,720
What's fierce? It's boring

391
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Small painting or I'll do it

392
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,040
You can record it

393
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,440
Good

394
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,520
The sunny day broke

395
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
Each group only has one pair of gloves

396
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,800
What to do

397
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,240
Why don't you use this on sunny days

398
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,800
Then what do you use

399
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,080
You leave it alone

400
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,760
Thank you

401
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,400
That's my deskmate

402
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
What are you doing

403
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,520
This is what I should do as a monitor

404
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,000
Grey Brother

405
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,520
Where's my gift

406
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,240
Put it on your desk. See it for yourself

407
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,840
One A and one J

408
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,640
And come with a coconut

409
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,080
Grey Brother

410
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,960
Class is going to start

411
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,040
Lan Jing Hui Ma Yiming

412
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,200
What are you two doing

413
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,080
What about running

414
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,160
Don't run, let's go to class

415
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,760
Class

416
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:05,800
Give it back to you

417
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,400
Stand up

418
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,880
Hello teacher

419
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,520
All right, classmates, please sit down

420
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,360
Students

421
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,480
Mid-term exam immediately

422
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,200
It's about to begin

423
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,120
I hope this time

424
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,200
You can take it seriously

425
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
I just finished saying that I have an exam

426
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,240
You just start howling

427
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,200
Are you gonna be nervous too

428
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,640
nervousness

429
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,160
One by one late for class

430
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,120
Sleeping in class

431
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,840
And a bunch of people who don't hand in their homework

432
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,360
I think you usually

433
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,240
It's quite relaxing

434
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,200
Teacher

435
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,880
Then you misunderstood

436
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,840
We can work hard in private

437
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,600
Right, Lan Jinghui

438
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,240
Yes

439
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,400
Are you serious

440
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:45,960
serious

441
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,800
There is no basis for what you say

442
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,080
Our results will be known

443
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,760
Especially you Ma Yiming

444
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,800
And Lan Jinghui

445
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,240
You two are me

446
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,560
Key Objects of Focus

447
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,960
I didn't do anything, teacher

448
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,400
It's completely an accidental injury

449
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,920
I don't know if it's injured by mistake

450
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,680
When are you two

451
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,360
Brothers in distress are out of the countdown

452
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,400
I'll just shift the target, okay

453
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,240
Okay, let's start class

454
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,880
Today we study

455
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,240
The concept of sequence

456
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,480
What are you laughing at

457
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,160
Let me tell you what

458
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,680
Just this kind of mid-term exam

459
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,160
A small exam

460
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,960
I didn't take it seriously at all

461
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,400
I'm not worried about you

462
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,080
Conservative estimate

463
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,880
Not surprisingly

464
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,280
Go ahead one hundred places

465
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,680
So confident in me

466
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,560
Not having faith in you

467
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,000
Is to have confidence in myself

468
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,160
Zouma Yiming and playing ball

469
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,240
Don't fight

470
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,320
How about it

471
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,120
The coconut brother gave you is nice, isn't it

472
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,800
I don't want it back to you

473
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,040
Let me ask you something

474
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,320
Did you see that Ling Dong's face was injured

475
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,400
No

476
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,240
Your eyes

477
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,520
Is it just for recharging

478
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,000
Me, I'm a big gentleman

479
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,720
Why are you staring at him all day

480
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,120
I think my dream sister doesn't she sweet

481
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,040
And

482
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,440
Something's wrong with you

483
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,000
Are you trying to mess with him again

484
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,760
I'm telling you something serious

485
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,760
Then he probably hit it himself

486
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,400
Not like

487
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,080
If he hit

488
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,680
Then there must be bruises here

489
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,040
Then he scratched it on his own fingernails

490
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,480
Impossible

491
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,400
He has no fingernails for all his gentlemen

492
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,120
What are you rowing with?

493
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
Brother Grey, I really don't know

494
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,600
I'm not a medical examiner

495
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,560
You tell me this

496
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,120
The most critical point

497
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,520
He was late this morning

498
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,000
Have you ever seen him late

499
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:06,840
No

500
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,640
When you say that

501
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,200
Something's wrong

502
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,000
Is it right

503
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,080
Is he causing trouble outside

504
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
Let someone smash it

505
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,080
Beating is not smashing

506
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,400
Got beaten up

507
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,800
Playing really well

508
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,800
Thank you

509
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,720
Does my son make that song nice

510
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,280
Second cousin seems to have made it up, too

511
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,960
Mostly my son made it up

512
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,200
His guitar

513
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,080
My son taught it all

514
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,960
Okay, okay, okay, you're amazing

515
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,480
Okay, you're the number one in the world

516
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,600
Xiao Hui has the same demeanor as you used to be

517
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
Isn't that what you want to hear

518
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,600
Compared with me back then, this kid

519
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,320
Still almost meaningful

520
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,000
Xiao Hui now knows

521
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Is there any relationship between us

522
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,360
Don't tell him

523
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,800
Or in school

524
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,520
refuse to obey

525
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,720
What do I think

526
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,960
He didn't accept your control

527
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,400
His second cousin manages it quite well

528
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,480
That's my second cousin

529
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,360
Can it be worse

530
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
Let me tell you something serious

531
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,440
How have you been all these years

532
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,400
Ask me to give it to Ling Dong and his family

533
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,680
All grants

534
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,040
My sister-in-law refused all of them

535
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,520
I thought it was

536
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,000
It is very likely that it is

537
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,200
After Lao Ling left

538
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,200
This hurdle in my sister-in-law's heart has not been overcome

539
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,240
You know what I mean

540
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,520
Okay, take your time

541
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,480
What's up with another song

542
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,200
Let's go

543
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,560
walking
