00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,070
Hug

4
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,270
Congratulations

5
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,510
Hug

6
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,430
Hug

7
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,430
Hug

8
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,430
I can't breathe

9
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,510
I can't breathe anymore

10
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,070
It's so hard

11
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,390
Over there

12
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,110
What is this?

13
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,950
What is this?

14
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,310
I think Class 5 is very outstanding

15
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,750
Mr. Zhao, what happened?

16
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,910
It's nothing

17
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,030
It's nothing, Ms. Fang

18
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,430
Just seeing these students

19
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,070
makes me realize

20
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,310
that being young is great

21
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,190
I think I'm still young

22
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,470
Well, that's true

23
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,910
Actually, I'd always like to ask you

24
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,750
Ms. Fang, do you have a boyfriend?

25
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,230
Boyfriend?

26
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,150
Every day when I go to school

27
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,070
I have to accompany them to class

28
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,790
And when I finally have a weekend

29
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,030
Look, I'm here for training

30
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,110
Do you think I have time

31
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,670
to date?

32
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,590
Well

33
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,950
What type of guys

34
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,870
do you like, Ms. Fang?

35
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,710
I mean to ask...

36
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,030
What type of boys do you like?

37
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,470
What type of boys do I like?

38
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,630
I haven't really thought about it

39
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,790
I think it depends on the feeling

40
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,470
But I...

41
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,910
I know what type I don't like

42
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,310
So, what type don't you like?

43
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:34,830
I don't like guys

44
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,880
who wear sportswear every day

45
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,630
Bye, instructor

46
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,110
Bye

47
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,830
Goodbye, Instructor

48
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,870
Bye

49
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,630
Don't let Ms. Fang be upset

50
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,110
Okay

51
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,230
Ms. Fang

52
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,630
Come back often

53
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,230
Sure

54
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,710
Thanks for taking care of us these days

55
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,150
Instructor Wu

56
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,510
Don't be so polite with me

57
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,510
Ms. Fang

58
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,430
Hey

59
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,750
I'll leave with you later

60
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,350
Okay

61
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:10,950
Mr. Zhao

62
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,750
Instructor Wu

63
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,070
Sorry for the trouble

64
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,510
It's okay

65
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,310
Come back often

66
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,110
You have my word

67
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,070
Let's go

68
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,590
Goodbye

69
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,390
Bye

70
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,150
How's it, Ms. Fang?

71
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,030
I think...

72
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,550
You'd better wear sportswear

73
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,870
Isn't it cool?

74
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,710
Looks like this training

75
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,950
really tired them out

76
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,270
They're all sleeping

77
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,230
Yeah

78
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,270
Ms. Fang

79
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,030
What?

80
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,390
Isn't it really cool?

81
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:09,830
What?

82
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,310
This...

83
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,110
Oh...

84
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,750
Well...

85
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,030
It's okay

86
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,750
Right?

87
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,270
I think so

88
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,790
It took a long time to choose

89
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,030
Back then...

90
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,550
The future seemed shapeless and distant

91
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,190
Every day, our worries

92
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,550
were only about homework and the people around us

93
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,430
Even if we argued fiercely

94
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,830
one day,

95
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,790
we could make up in a few apologies

96
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,590
and return to being good friends

97
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,030
Perhaps...

98
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,470
This is the privilege of youth

99
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,070
Class

100
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,870
Here're the results

101
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,150
for this physical test

102
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,830
This time,

103
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,630
you all made significant progress

104
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,950
Most of our classmates have passed

105
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,750
This proves that the training

106
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,310
had a significant effect

107
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,670
You all did really well

108
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,790
So, during your free time

109
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,630
from studying

110
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,230
pay attention to exercise

111
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:51,910
Okay?

112
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,190
Okay

113
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,340
Chen Luyang, Ling Dong

114
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,470
Both of you

115
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,390
Go to the teacher's office

116
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,150
Mr. Guo is looking for you

117
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,470
-Okay -Xu Mengyu

118
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,510
Come up and post it

119
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,030
Okay

120
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,790
Just post it there

121
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,710
Let me say something

122
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,070
Although many students in our class

123
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,390
have passed this time

124
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,710
There are still some who didn't

125
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,590
make it

126
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,750
So I still hope that

127
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,470
during your free time from studying

128
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,350
you can do more exercise

129
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:17,990
Alright?

130
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,990
Okay

131
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,870
Check the score sheet later

132
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,950
Okay

133
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,510
Mr. Guo

134
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,550
Hello, Mr. Guo

135
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,590
This time, the national physics competition

136
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,110
We've decided

137
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,270
to have both of you represent the school

138
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,190
to participate in the competition in Beijing

139
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,470
This result

140
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,190
not only affects your future

141
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,190
But also represents the honor of our school

142
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,950
Me and Ms. Fang will accompany you

143
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,430
You must perform well

144
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,630
Good luck

145
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,830
Don't worry, Mr. Guo

146
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,230
I'll definitely do well on the exam

147
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,870
Alright, then

148
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,670
I'll go back to the classroom first

149
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,510
if there's nothing else

150
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,510
Don't rush

151
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,710
During the days when your competition ends

152
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,670
there'll be an open day at PKU

153
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,310
There will be a lecture by Professor Yang

154
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,590
If you're interested, you can go and listen

155
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,230
These days

156
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,470
the physics classroom is open for you

157
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,670
If you have any questions

158
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,270
come and find me anytime

159
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,990
Hey, you know what?

160
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,750
Mr. Guo found Ling Dong and Chen Luyang

161
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,350
They're gonna represent the whole school

162
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,430
to participate in the national physics competition

163
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,390
There shouldn't be any suspense

164
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,750
Definitely

165
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,870
Usually if you get a ranking

166
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:28,870
in this kind of competition

167
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,990
It can be added to your college entrance exam scores

168
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:30,750
Added points?

169
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,110
Really?

170
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,470
Yeah

171
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,390
Look

172
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,870
They're already top students, they can still get extra points

173
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,110
What about us ordinary people?

174
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,230
Yeah

175
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,790
But it seems like

176
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,590
there's only one first place

177
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,070
So it's probably Ling Dong

178
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,790
Chen Luyang is really unlucky

179
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,590
As long as Ling Dong is there

180
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,990
he'll always be second place

181
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,430
Monitor

182
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,470
Is that so?

183
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,510
Seems like it

184
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,630
That's good

185
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,750
Anyway, we're both representing the school

186
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,910
No distinction between first and second

187
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,150
Exactly

188
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,230
No distinction between first and second

189
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,390
No distinction between first and second

190
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,470
Right

191
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,430
No distinction between first and second

192
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,510
Let's go back to the classroom

193
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,310
Let's go

194
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,190
Why did Mr. Guo look for you?

195
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,870
The teacher asked me to participate in

196
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,830
the national physics competition

197
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,190
Oh

198
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,630
Open Day at PKU

199
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,510
Ling Dong

200
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,150
Are you going to PKU's Open Day?

201
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,990
What kind of day is it? Is it fun?

202
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,790
It's a week-long open day

203
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,950
held by PKU

204
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,430
I heard that their fine arts department

205
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,590
holds an exhibition every year

206
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,270
I really wanna go

207
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,270
Just go if you want

208
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,350
I have to prepare for the competition

209
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,110
I might not have time

210
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,070
Yeah

211
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,750
And this open day is especially popular

212
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,350
They distribute tickets regularly

213
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,670
But there are really too many people

214
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,630
who come

215
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,430
It's really hard to get tickets

216
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,510
There's also a threshold?

217
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,190
Chen Luyang, what's wrong with you?

218
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,070
Qingtian

219
00:10:59,230 --> 00:10:59,830
I'm fine

220
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,230
I can see from your expression

221
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,150
that you're not feeling well

222
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,470
Is it because

223
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,110
you're preparing for the physics competition?

224
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,470
And you didn't get enough rest?

225
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,310
There is some pressure

226
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,270
But it's okay

227
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,870
No need to worry about me

228
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,630
Have a lollipop

229
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,390
Whenever I'm under pressure

230
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,550
I eat lollipops

231
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,590
Feel like the world is beautiful now

232
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:22,910
Thank you

233
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,430
You're welcome

234
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,990
There's nothing a lollipop

235
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,070
can't solve

236
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,950
If there is, then eat two

237
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,630
Goodbye, teacher

238
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:50,750
Goodbye, class

239
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,270
Let's go to the cafeteria together

240
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,230
Let's go

241
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,550
Oh, I'm not going

242
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,470
How can you not eat?

243
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,950
No one can live without food

244
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,110
If you continue like this

245
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,030
I don't wanna eat

246
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,150
You guys go ahead

247
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,390
Forget it

248
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,190
He's already being crazy

249
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,910
Us mortals can't understand

250
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,190
Let's go eat first

251
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,310
Bring him some food

252
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,830
Let's go and bring him some food

253
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,310
Alright

254
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:20,950
Let's go

255
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:29,670
Oh my god

256
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,030
Did you see the trending video yesterday?

257
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,310
Brother Jia is really handsome

258
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,550
I saw it

259
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,030
His voice is amazing

260
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,070
It's so great

261
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,430
I was even nervous

262
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,670
Yeah

263
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,910
That transition is just...

264
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,750
Let's go, Brother Hui

265
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,350
Let's go play basketball

266
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,750
That's all for today's class

267
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,030
Just learn it by yourself

268
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,790
Class dismissed

269
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:57,670
Stand up

270
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,830
Goodbye, teacher

271
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:49,830
No, no

272
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,590
It's oppressive to do problems with him

273
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,390
Ling Dong, you...

274
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,550
Do you know what experts say?

275
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,070
If you don't eat well

276
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,790
it'll affect your intelligence

277
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,390
If you wanna rank first

278
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,110
You must eat

279
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,990
Experts also say

280
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,910
that you can't drink hot water

281
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,630
Why?

282
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,030
Because it burns your mouth

283
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,110
Don't argue with me

284
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,230
Anyway, now

285
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,990
You have to eat it

286
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,630
Hurry up and eat it

287
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,390
I'll eat

288
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,910
Health is the foundation of revolution

289
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,070
So you must eat well

290
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,150
I know the solution now

291
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:04,630
Give it to me

292
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,670
Problems are problems

293
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,270
You can't neglect your sleep and meals

294
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,430
Eat them together

295
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,270
I'm sorry

296
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,870
Just this once

297
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,150
Monitor, why haven't you gone home yet?

298
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,630
What's up?

299
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,750
Do you still have candy?

300
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,150
There's only one left

301
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,070
But seeing how pitiful you are

302
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,150
I'll give it to you

303
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,750
Monitor

304
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,870
What's been going on with you lately?

305
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,710
Actually, nothing much

306
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,950
This is for you

307
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,270
Sunny doll

308
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,390
When you see it

309
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,790
It's like seeing me

310
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,150
But this is yours

311
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,310
It will replace me

312
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,390
granting you power

313
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:21,950
Good luck in the physics competition

314
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:27,870
Thank you

315
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,710
Ling Dong

316
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,950
Ling Dong, something's wrong

317
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,670
What happened?

318
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,630
Lan Jinghui is...

319
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,990
Take your time, tell me what happened

320
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,470
Lan Jinghui...

321
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,510
He got into a conflict with someone

322
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,470
Where is he?

323
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,910
I'm sorry, Ling Dong

324
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,830
I lied to you

325
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:58,830
No, wait...

326
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,830
I still have one question left to answer

327
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,670
Since you're here, don't leave

328
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,790
Lan Jinghui

329
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,830
No

330
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,790
Xiaohua

331
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,710
How did you learn bad things from him?

332
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,910
Don't blame her

333
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,230
It was my idea

334
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,390
Sit down

335
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,710
Sit down

336
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,390
Since you study day and night like this

337
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,310
You've really worked hard

338
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,470
Look at how thin you are

339
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:27,670
Come on

340
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,230
I specially prepared this for you

341
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,710
A brain-boosting feast

342
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,950
Tomorrow you're going to Beijing

343
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,390
Consider this meal as my farewell gift, bro

344
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,590
Bro?

345
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,670
Is your seniority a bit messed up?

346
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:43,990
It's about right

347
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,150
Plus, like treats like

348
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,030
Try this dish

349
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,030
that I specifically ordered for you

350
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,670
Clear soup with pig brain

351
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,070
Scrambled eggs with pig brain

352
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,110
Braised pig brain

353
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,270
Boiled pig brain

354
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,550
Roasted pig brain

355
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,870
And boiled fish

356
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,230
That's perfect

357
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,110
You should eat more

358
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,190
Like treats like

359
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:00,670
Come on

360
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,230
Thank you

361
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,670
Thank you instead

362
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,310
It's me, Ms. Fang

363
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,910
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhao

364
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,070
I'm sorry

365
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,070
It's alright

366
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,390
It's nothing

367
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,190
Why are you here?

368
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:50,910
Where is Mr. Guo?

369
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,630
I'm going to Beijing with you

370
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,270
Mr. Guo had something come up at home

371
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,390
So the director sent me instead

372
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,430
I'm really sorry about earlier

373
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:00,950
It's okay

374
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,390
Well

375
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,310
Shall we go get the high-speed train tickets first?

376
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:04,910
Alright

377
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:05,790
Let's go then

378
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,350
Ms. Fang is really agile

379
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,190
Surprise

380
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,190
Surprise

381
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:24,990
Why are you all here?

382
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,630
We...

383
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,070
We, of course

384
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,230
are coming to play in Beijing

385
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,510
It's the May Day holiday

386
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,230
She has never been to Beijing

387
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,550
And then

388
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,670
I wanna take her out to see the world

389
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:36,670
Right?

390
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,790
Yes

391
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,430
What about you, Qingtian?

392
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:40,990
How did you come here?

393
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:41,830
Of course,

394
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,390
I'm going to attend the food festival

395
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,670
to check-in at all online hot spots

396
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:56,870
Here you go

397
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,830
Thank you, Qingtian

398
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,950
Professor Yang's physics lecture at PKU

399
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,790
What's wrong?

400
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,670
Nothing

401
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,550
I just noticed that you've been holding onto it

402
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:11,910
I just wanna take a glance

403
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,750
Are you interested in this?

404
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,110
It's nothing, just casually looking

405
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,190
Ling Dong

406
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,950
Ms. Fang

407
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,350
Ms. Fang

408
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,030
Mr. Zhao

409
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,190
What brings you two here?

410
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,550
We...

411
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,350
We...

412
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,150
We're just...

413
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,550
We're going to play in Beijing

414
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,550
All three of you are here to play?

415
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,710
Yes

416
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:33,910
Do your parents know

417
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,870
that you're going to Beijing?

418
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,510
Yes, of course

419
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,630
Not only do they know,

420
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,750
they have made all the arrangements

421
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,550
They have taken care of everything

422
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,030
Let's go

423
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,350
Really?

424
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:40,790
If we don't leave now,

425
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,350
we won't have enough time

426
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:42,550
Okay

427
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,110
Let me tell you

428
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,670
You can go have fun

429
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:46,910
But there's one thing

430
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,870
I need to make clear to you

431
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,150
Don't cause any trouble

432
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,270
If I find out

433
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,150
that you guys are causing trouble,

434
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,750
I'll immediately send you back

435
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,270
Let's go

436
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:53,990
Let's go

437
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,070
Go get the tickets

438
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,470
Hurry

439
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,070
We don't have much time

440
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,870
How is it?

441
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,150
The European Sky Dome, Ecological Lobby

442
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,270
Do you feel the air has become fresher?

443
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,990
It does feel fresher

444
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,270
But it's a bit cold

445
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,670
Really?

446
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,070
Look

447
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,830
There are two peacocks here

448
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,470
They are indeed beautiful

449
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,230
Really?

450
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,070
Lan Jinghui

451
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,470
Is this the hotel

452
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,790
you arranged for us?

453
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,310
Yes, that's right

454
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,390
Isn't it great?

455
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,430
Not really

456
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,910
First of all, I'm here for business

457
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,470
They are here to study

458
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,150
It's just the three of us

459
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,190
who are here for travelling

460
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,230
Staying in such a nice hotel

461
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,030
Do you think it's appropriate?

462
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,380
Also

463
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,870
We don't have the budget for it

464
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:54,710
Ms. Fang

465
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,150
Ms. Fang

466
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,710
I know

467
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,510
But this hotel in Beijing

468
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,030
has a very close business relationship

469
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,110
with my father

470
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,510
The price we can get

471
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,110
is the lowest price below the group purchase price

472
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,470
It's no different

473
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,790
from an ordinary hotel

474
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,710
And secondly,

475
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,350
I'm sure you two math geniuses

476
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,750
and physics geniuses

477
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,710
are quite tired

478
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,790
So we need

479
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,270
a quiet and elegant place to rest

480
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:12,870
Do you agree?

481
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,670
Yes

482
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,230
Ms. Fang

483
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,070
Let's stay here

484
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,470
Are you sure it won't exceed the budget?

485
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,990
Not a penny over

486
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,910
I'm telling you in advance

487
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,990
Since I brought you out,

488
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,230
I have to take responsibility for you

489
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,470
You have to...

490
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,710
Keep in touch with me at all times

491
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,750
Let me know your whereabouts

492
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,190
No problem

493
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,150
Also,

494
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,430
you must return to the hotel

495
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,270
before 8 pm

496
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:36,790
Understood?

497
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:38,710
Furthermore,

498
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:39,670
this time,

499
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,670
we are mainly here

500
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,430
to accompany Ling Dong and Chen Luyang in their exam

501
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:42,870
So,

502
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,110
in order to provide them with a quiet

503
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,830
environment for studying,

504
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,670
without my permission,

505
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,750
you are not allowed to approach

506
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,670
Chen Luyang and Ling Dong's rooms

507
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,660
You hear that?

508
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:54,790
Especially you

509
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,710
Lan Jinghui

510
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,270
No problem

511
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,550
Let's go check-in first

512
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,150
Let's go

513
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,990
Wait

514
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,670
This is so cute

515
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,950
Don't you think it looks like you?

516
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,270
Really?

517
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,310
Smile

518
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,270
Exactly the same

519
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,710
Right?

520
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,870
Very similar

521
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,110
Isn't this Foolish Ling?

522
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,350
You're right

523
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,910
You've really got the essence

524
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,110
Right?

525
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,470
Isn't it?

526
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,070
And Ma Yiming

527
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,710
Ma Yiming

528
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,990
It looks just like him

529
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,030
Lan Jinghui

530
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,590
Is that you?

531
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,510
Exactly the same

532
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,470
Imitate it

533
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:32,750
Really

534
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,310
Is that me?

535
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,310
That's just like you

536
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,550
It doesn't look like me at all

537
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,470
Looks just like it

538
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,670
Exactly Lan Jinghui

539
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,110
Which one is me?

540
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,950
You all have one

541
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,310
I think this one looks like you

542
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,110
Yes, it does

543
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,470
Am I really that cute?

544
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,670
Yes

545
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,190
So noisy

546
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,470
Why is it so noisy?

547
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,710
It's fine to dance at night

548
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,870
But why dance during the day?

549
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:08,870
So annoying

550
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,080
What time is it?

551
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Why isn't he here yet?

552
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,800
Why are both of us

553
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,040
slower than two girls?

554
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,800
Did he oversleep?

555
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,200
I'll give him a call

556
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,760
Coming

557
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,040
Sorry, I'm late

558
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,680
Why did you take so long?

559
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,680
Overslept

560
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,560
We came back early yesterday

561
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,600
Why do you still look tired?

562
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,600
I stayed up all night playing games

563
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,480
Zelda is really addictive

564
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,200
It's really hard to beat

565
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:51,920
I don't understand

566
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,240
Let's go

567
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,720
We'll be too late for breakfast

568
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,200
Let's go

569
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,360
Let's go

570
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,640
Let's go

571
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,040
Ms. Fang

572
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,160
Do you think we bought

573
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,000
too much?

574
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,440
Can we finish all this?

575
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,480
Just some vegetables

576
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,680
And they're both

577
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,080
going to have exams soon

578
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,840
We've been eating takeout these days

579
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,720
It's greasy and salty

580
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,160
So I bought more vegetables

581
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,480
and planned to cook for them tonight

582
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,520
Let me see

583
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,120
if anything is missing

584
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,120
How are you? Did you get cold?

585
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,480
I think it's because

586
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,080
the hotel air conditioning was too cold

587
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,160
I caught a chill

588
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,480
Here, the cold medicine

589
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,520
Take it when you get home

590
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,520
Thank you, Ms. Fang

591
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,800
You care about me so much

592
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,920
It's not that I care about you

593
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,360
It's just a critical moment

594
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,240
Don't spread this cold

595
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,600
to Ling Dong and Chen Luyang

596
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,760
Don't worry, it won't happen

597
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,600
Okay

598
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,560
By the way

599
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,440
I need to go buy some spare ribs

600
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,200
Wait for me

601
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,400
I'll go. Wait for me

602
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,920
Okay, get small ribs

603
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,320
Alright

604
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,160
Miss

605
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,800
Are you buying groceries to cook?

606
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,720
Yes, Auntie

607
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,040
You're so great

608
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:13,640
Miss

609
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,720
What do you do for a living?

610
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,840
I'm a high school teacher

611
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,240
Being a teacher is great

612
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,000
I have a son

613
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,560
who's tall and handsome

614
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,600
But he's too busy with work

615
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,080
He hasn't found a partner yet

616
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,800
Maybe you two can get to know each other

617
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,920
Scan me

618
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,040
Let's go

619
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,640
The children are waiting at home

620
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,880
Really? Miss?

621
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,280
You look so young

622
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,640
How can you have children?

623
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,360
Auntie, she looks young

624
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,520
We already have five children

625
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,600
I can't tell

626
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,200
Goodbye, Auntie

627
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,200
Let's go

628
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,920
How dare you even say that?

629
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:48,640
No, wait

630
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,840
How can there be five children?

631
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,880
Two of them are studying

632
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,960
The other three went to play

633
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,920
Isn't that five?

634
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,680
I'm just solving your problem

635
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,640
Well

636
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,920
What if I wanna get to know him?

637
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,440
So, where's Lan Jinghui?

638
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,600
I haven't seen them all day

639
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,520
Did they call you?

640
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,260
Nope

641
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,560
You should call them quickly

642
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
Don't worry, they won't get lost

643
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,520
Okay

644
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,200
They must be having fun

645
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,360
I'll do it

646
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:15,840
Okay

647
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,800
Call them later

648
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,840
Tell them to come back for dinner

649
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,320
Don't let them come back too late

650
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,200
Here's the soup

651
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:26,960
Coming

652
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,640
Ms. Fang used the hotel kitchen

653
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,720
to cook personally

654
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,760
Eat while it's hot

655
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,200
Study well tomorrow

656
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,560
Thank you, Ms. Fang

657
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,240
Thanks, Ms. Fang

658
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,800
Come on, Chen Luyang

659
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,600
It's really delicious

660
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,800
I've noticed

661
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,080
that you haven't been eating well recently

662
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Come on, eat quickly

663
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,040
Come on, Ms. Fang

664
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,120
I've been eating well these days

665
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,680
Thanks to Ms. Fang's late-night snacks

666
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,520
Late-night snacks?

667
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,320
Is there any?

668
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,960
I didn't send you

669
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,040
any late-night snacks?

670
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,840
Ms. Fang

671
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,600
Ms. Fang

672
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,320
Xiaohua, Qingtian

673
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:53,960
Come sit down

674
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,960
Ms. Fang

675
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,440
Did you make all these?

676
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,160
They look so delicious

677
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,800
Just eat

678
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,480
Thank you

679
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:07,840
By the way

680
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,920
Why is it just the two of you back?

681
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,880
What about Lan Jinghui?

682
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,040
Did he not come back?

683
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,920
He said he had something and went back to the hotel

684
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,080
He left early

685
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,160
Call him and ask

686
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,000
Eat

687
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,560
You guys eat first

688
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,160
Ms. Fang

689
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,920
You're good at cooking

690
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,680
Really?

691
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
Then if you wanna eat,

692
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,160
come to my house

693
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,040
I'll cook for you

694
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,560
Eat more

695
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,480
Have you two eaten?

696
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,280
Okay

697
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,280
Then you two

698
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,200
Go back and rest early today

699
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,800
Don't stay up too late studying tonight

700
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,080
The exam is tomorrow

701
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,080
I hope

702
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,200
that you can achieve good results

703
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,200
Then go back quickly

704
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,320
I'll eat a little longer

705
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,480
Eat more, Qingtian

706
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,320
Go ahead

707
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,080
Goodbye, teacher

708
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,560
Bye

709
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,080
Bye

710
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:56,600
Rest well

711
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,680
Thank you, teacher

712
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,240
Bye

713
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,560
Bye

714
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:58,840
Bye

715
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,680
Rest early

716
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,440
Qingtian

717
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,760
What kind of food do you usually like to eat?

718
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,120
There's nothing I don't like to eat

719
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,880
Why did it take so long

720
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,600
to make a phone call?

721
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,760
I just went to the room to look for him

722
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,320
But he wasn't there

723
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,880
Then I went downstairs to the hotel

724
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,240
and looked around

725
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,760
He wasn't there either

726
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,000
Where did he go?

727
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
He's not answering his phone either

728
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,440
Give me your phone

729
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,280
Okay

730
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,280
I knew he wouldn't

731
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,320
make it easy for me

732
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,920
Anything unusual

733
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,800
with him these past two days?

734
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,600
He seems fine

735
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,720
I actually feel like something's off with him

736
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,600
Did he say anything before he left?

737
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,800
He just said he'd go back to the hotel

738
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,920
His phone turned off

739
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,600
Alright, you two keep eating

740
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,080
Wait in the room after you finish

741
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,520
If Lan Jinghui comes back,

742
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,560
inform me immediately

743
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,760
Zhao Yun, stop making phone calls

744
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,720
Let's go out and look for him

745
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,200
Let's go

746
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,480
Alright

747
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,020
We're leaving

748
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,440
Notify me immediately

749
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,280
if he comes back

750
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:49,880
Okay

751
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,640
Qingtian, let's stop eating too

752
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,280
Let's go back to our room quickly

753
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,720
If Lan Jinghui comes back,

754
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
we can inform Ms. Fang right away

755
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,520
Let's go

756
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,240
Why hasn't he come back yet?

757
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,360
What are you two doing here?

758
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,400
We're not doing anything

759
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,400
We're just chatting

760
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,680
We're just bored

761
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,920
So we're taking a walk here

762
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,240
Where's Lan Jinghui?

763
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,320
He hasn't come back yet

764
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,240
Maybe he went shopping or something

765
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
What did he go shopping for?

766
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,180
Where did he go for shopping?

767
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,920
He went to...

768
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,440
I'll go find him

769
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,440
He's gone missing

770
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,080
What?

771
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,280
Come on

772
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,800
The brain-enhancing feast

773
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,280
I specially prepared for you

774
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,360
Clear soup pig brain

775
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,760
Egg-fried pig brain

776
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,800
Braised pig brain

777
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,600
Boiled pig brain

778
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Roasted pig brain

779
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,880
The pig brain dish is indeed impressive

780
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,840
How's Fool going now?

781
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,360
Well. After eating,

782
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,800
is your stomach okay?

783
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:17,920
I'm fine

784
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,120
That's good

785
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,640
I wanna finish it all

786
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,040
Everyone, let's cheer up

787
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,000
We'll have an exam later

788
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,600
Teacher, my stomach hurts badly

789
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,520
I need to go to the restroom

790
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,320
It won't be like

791
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
that carp back then, right?

792
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,720
Recurring the next day

793
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,960
Hey, apprentice

794
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,440
Yes

795
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,840
I have something urgent to tell you
