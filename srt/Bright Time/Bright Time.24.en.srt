[Episode 24]

3
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,710
Look

4
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,270
What do you think

5
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:20,910
she's doing?

6
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,470
Just looking at her phone

7
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,430
Keep quiet

8
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,390
I don't mean

9
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,190
that she's looking at her phone

10
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,030
Don't you remember?

11
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,590
That's just how we felt

12
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,310
when we were dating

13
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,270
We were holding onto pagers all day

14
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,190
being afraid of missing a message

15
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,110
When a message came

16
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,430
we would look at it

17
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,030
And smile foolishly

18
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,150
We need to find a way

19
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,030
to look at her phone

20
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,870
Oh

21
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,550
Oh

22
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,990
My stomach hurts

23
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,870
What's wrong?

24
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,190
I can't take it anymore

25
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,350
This brat...

26
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,310
I'll see who he is

27
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,670
Oh, Datu

28
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,190
Why is it the must-read English for the college entrance exam?

29
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,070
She's actually studying

30
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,910
So, you're overthinking it

31
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,710
That day on the bus

32
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,830
I clearly saw

33
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,910
she was being intimate

34
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,350
with a male classmate

35
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,510
Looks can be deceiving

36
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,910
What you saw may not be true

37
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,390
What about the drawing and the photo?

38
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,350
The photo

39
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,630
It means they have a good relationship

40
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,790
It's normal to have a photo together

41
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,470
But it's just the drawing

42
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,710
When I was young

43
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,790
I drew countless beautiful girls

44
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,990
But it doesn't mean

45
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,710
there's something between us

46
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,670
Xiao Datu, what do you mean?

47
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,670
Except for you

48
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,430
Everyone else is just a drawing tool

49
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,710
Look at our daughter

50
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,950
She wakes up early and stays up late

51
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,910
All she does is the study

52
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,710
How could she possibly have a boyfriend?

53
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,990
Furthermore

54
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,230
Ling Dong

55
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,390
And Lan Huihui

56
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,150
She wouldn't be interested in them

57
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,550
Right?

58
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,110
You do have a point

59
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,670
Could it be that I'm really overthinking it?

60
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,150
Guo Ying

61
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,590
You're just too sensitive

62
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,230
Alright

63
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,190
Hurry up

64
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,470
Mop the floor

65
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,950
I'm done mopping

66
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,630
Go and wipe it again

67
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,550
Come on

68
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,830
How many times should I wipe it?

69
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,430
Come on, have some milk

70
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,390
Old Xiao

71
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,430
Tell me

72
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,630
Did you ever betray me?

73
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,110
Report

74
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,310
Not at all

75
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,910
What were you doing secretly

76
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,030
with my mom recently?

77
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,550
Did she find out

78
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,670
about me studying art?

79
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,270
I happened to have a question for you

80
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,750
We can exchange answers

81
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,630
Have you been having an early romance?

82
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,870
Romance?

83
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,830
So your parents misunderstood

84
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,830
that one of us is your boyfriend

85
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,310
Yeah, I didn't expect that either

86
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,030
It's just a coincidence

87
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,270
It dispelled Auntie's worries

88
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,630
So they asked both of us

89
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,630
to have dinner at their house

90
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,150
They were testing us,

91
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,190
to see who is your first love

92
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,790
Is that so?

93
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,510
Then, who do you think she guessed?

94
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,950
Here's what they say

95
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,350
They could tell at a glance

96
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,390
that we have an unbreakable

97
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,310
revolutionary friendship

98
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,710
It should be me, right?

99
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,910
After all, I'm so cute and charming,

100
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,190
witty and handsome

101
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,350
You're thinking too much

102
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,990
They ruled you out from the beginning

103
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,710
Why?

104
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,630
Didn't you see auntie?

105
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,470
It's been on me all the time

106
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,670
Narcissism is a disease

107
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,310
that needs to be treated

108
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,150
I'm sorry

109
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,550
Confidence is a gift

110
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,630
that can't be cured

111
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,350
I don't have time to see you two argue anymore

112
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,230
I have to go

113
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,310
The joint entrance exam is next week

114
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,750
If I really don't pass,

115
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,550
I'll have no hope in my studies

116
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,310
That won't do

117
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,230
We all agreed

118
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,470
to go to the PKU together

119
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,430
We can't let all our efforts

120
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,270
go to waste

121
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,830
What will you be tested on

122
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,830
in this joint exam?

123
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,670
It's color, sketch, and drawing

124
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,470
Color is easy to handle

125
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,710
But I don't know

126
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,350
what kind of questions

127
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,470
will be asked for sketch and drawing

128
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,510
It's okay

129
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,150
It's like the cultural exams

130
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,070
Use the strategy of tackling previous questions

131
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,230
Practice everything

132
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,990
that can be practiced

133
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,830
Disciple

134
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,030
Are you okay?

135
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,670
I can't hold on much longer

136
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,990
Almost there

137
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,350
Just ten more minutes

138
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,550
Ten minutes

139
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,070
No, three minutes

140
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,870
Seven minutes, will that work?

141
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,710
Five minutes

142
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,030
I really can't hold on anymore

143
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,990
Six minutes then

144
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:58,950
Hurry up

145
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,070
Lan Jinghui

146
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,230
Hold on

147
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,110
You do have a conscience, idiot

148
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,430
Done

149
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,710
Lan Jinghui

150
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,950
This is...

151
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,190
A kettle

152
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,750
Will they really ask this kind of question in the exam?

153
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,590
Come on. It's a prediction

154
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,430
Tackling previous questions

155
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,190
We can't let anything go

156
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:14,630
Mom

157
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,310
Hey

158
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,550
Are you okay?

159
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,310
I'm fine

160
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,470
I'm trimming vegetables for cooking

161
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,950
Study hard

162
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,670
Mr. Wang

163
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,790
Did you read

164
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,350
the collection of essays

165
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,510
I sent you last time?

166
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,150
Oh, you're...

167
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,030
Xu Mengyu

168
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,070
Oh, I remember

169
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,270
I don't have much time

170
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,190
So I'll be brief

171
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,710
Your essays are good

172
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,230
Your mom has mentioned it to me many times

173
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,430
It's a good thing that you're interested in literature

174
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,670
But there's still a gap

175
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,670
between publishing a book

176
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,230
You're welcome to submit again

177
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,510
That's it. Bye

178
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,030
Mengyu

179
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,710
You're...

180
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,670
I'm Ma Mao

181
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,350
You forgot?

182
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,150
Back in middle school,

183
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,950
I took composition classes

184
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,590
from your mom

185
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,750
Senior Ma Mao

186
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,230
Long time no see

187
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,270
I almost didn't recognize you

188
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,310
Yeah

189
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,510
If it wasn't for me keeping an eye on you,

190
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,870
I might not have recognized you either

191
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,550
You've been more beautiful

192
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,780
You've been keeping an eye on me?

193
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,470
Yes

194
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,750
I even checked your Weibo just now

195
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,750
I've read the posts

196
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,590
you shared

197
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,510
I really like them

198
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,550
I've noticed that through words,

199
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,390
you can understand a person

200
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,830
I think you're talented

201
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,100
Thank you, senior

202
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,480
Actually, I just randomly

203
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,100
write those posts

204
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
Let's sit and chat

205
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,680
Sure

206
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,310
I think

207
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:57,910
in the future,

208
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,870
you'll definitely be a writer

209
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,910
I'm already signing up

210
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,790
to be your biggest fan

211
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,150
Have you read the articles I wrote?

212
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,070
Of course

213
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,910
I even wanted to leave a comment

214
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,390
But I was afraid you wouldn't remember me

215
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,510
By the way

216
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,430
Let's exchange contact information

217
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,830
Sure

218
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,230
When you have new works,

219
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,110
remember to share them with me

220
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:13,950
We can discuss them together

221
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,390
I actually need someone

222
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,110
who can give me advice on writing

223
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,750
It's been so long since we met

224
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,510
Yeah

225
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,750
You've changed a lot

226
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,310
Yes

227
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,430
I almost didn't recognize you earlier

228
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,350
I walked over

229
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,470
Only then did I realize you were sitting here

230
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,470
Oh, really?

231
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,150
Look at you

232
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,870
No overeating meat

233
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,750
Why hasn't Xiaohua come back yet?

234
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,230
Let's call her and ask

235
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,070
Oh

236
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,910
She said

237
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,430
she won't be coming home for dinner today

238
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,230
Wasn't there no extra class today?

239
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:42,990
Oh

240
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,910
Here's the thing

241
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,110
They've got academic stress

242
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,030
So

243
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,390
She said she'd study at school

244
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,070
Really?

245
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,190
Honey, what are you doing?

246
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,510
Didn't you say Xiaohua is at extra class?

247
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,270
I think

248
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,030
she has been studying very hard recently

249
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,150
I'm afraid she might be malnourished

250
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,710
So I'll make ome fish soup to take to her

251
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,190
Let her replenish her energy

252
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,670
Well, help me hold it

253
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,750
By the way

254
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,630
After I leave,

255
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,870
you can't eat too much meat

256
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,070
You have fatty liver

257
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:33,830
Did you hear me?

258
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,670
I'll just take it away

259
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,190
Did you hear me?

260
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,630
Daughter, answer the phone

261
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,510
Answer the phone quickly

262
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,350
Oh my goodness

263
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,550
Hello

264
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,750
Where are all of you?

265
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,870
Where are you?

266
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,110
What are you doing?

267
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,870
Come out to eat

268
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,950
Time to eat

269
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,110
I think I saw

270
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,310
someone I'm very familiar with

271
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,670
Hello, Auntie

272
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,110
Qingtian

273
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,150
Are you out of class now?

274
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,750
Yes

275
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,070
But we still have self-study class later

276
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,190
Where's Xiaohua?

277
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,110
Is she still in the study room?

278
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,510
Yes

279
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,030
Auntie, why are you here?

280
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,870
Here's the nutritious soup

281
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,670
for Xiaohua

282
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,870
She's studying too hard

283
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:55,990
Auntie

284
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,310
Shall I go up with you?

285
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,630
No need

286
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,790
I'll find her myself

287
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,470
You can go and keep studying

288
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,590
Goodbye

289
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,310
Why didn't you answer the phone?

290
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,670
Xiaohua's mom is here

291
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,710
Alarm

292
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:23,950
What should we do now?

293
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,870
Others, go intercept Auntie

294
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,150
Lan Jinghui and I'll go find Xiaohua

295
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,950
Roger that

296
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,390
Why don't you go first?

297
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,510
No, auntie

298
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,350
Go ahead please

299
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,790
Auntie, are you looking for someone or...

300
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,710
No

301
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,230
I thought of going to the

302
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:51,870
self-study room at your school

303
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,710
Your school is so big

304
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,310
I can't find the self-study room

305
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,230
Oh, the self-study room

306
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,110
Where is it?

307
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,710
Let me take you there, okay?

308
00:16:59,190 --> 00:16:59,630
Thank you

309
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,030
It's okay

310
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,830
Auntie, go ahead please

311
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,350
Go ahead

312
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,190
Thank you

313
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,870
It's okay

314
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,670
Such a big school

315
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,110
It's okay

316
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,230
Where is she?

317
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,190
I don't know

318
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,190
These buildings all look the same

319
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,310
Yes

320
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,350
They've got the same style

321
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,190
Is that so?

322
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,950
Do we go this way?

323
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,270
No. We go that way

324
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:36,910
That way

325
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,590
Yes

326
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,110
The school is really big

327
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,630
Without you, I wouldn't have found it

328
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,270
It's okay. I'm always kind

329
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,390
No, wait

330
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,910
Aren't we going in circles?

331
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,790
No, we're not

332
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,870
No...

333
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,070
When we walked past earlier,

334
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,030
I saw these

335
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,750
Now we're back here

336
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,710
Auntie, you must be mistaken

337
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,590
These weren't here earlier

338
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,150
No way

339
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,310
Student

340
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,070
It seems you're not familiar with the way

341
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,030
No, it's just...

342
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,870
It's okay

343
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,350
You go ahead. I'll find it myself

344
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,350
No, Auntie

345
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,150
I'll take you there

346
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:06,630
It's okay

347
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,110
Auntie

348
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,670
Auntie

349
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,190
No need

350
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,790
Thank you

351
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,870
You're a good student

352
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,430
Very good

353
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,030
You can go now

354
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:11,710
No, Auntie

355
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,350
She's heading towards the art building

356
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,190
To the art building

357
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,670
Where is she?

358
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,350
When is she coming?

359
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:31,870
She's coming

360
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,790
She's here

361
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,190
Hurry

362
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,750
Why are these steps so dirty?

363
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,190
We need to clean it

364
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:50,990
Auntie

365
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,670
I'm sorry

366
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,270
I'll clean it for you

367
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:52,990
Come here

368
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,470
No, no, no

369
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:53,990
No, no, no

370
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,950
It's okay

371
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,750
No,

372
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,430
It's dirty

373
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,710
I'll use my hand. I can do it

374
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,350
Auntie, don't worry

375
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,110
Chen Luyang

376
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,470
I need some water to wash my brush

377
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,150
Well...

378
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,990
Shut up

379
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:34,950
Mom

380
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,990
Sorry, I was wrong

381
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,070
What did you do wrong?

382
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,070
I shouldn't have lied to you

383
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,390
I shouldn't have lied

384
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,950
What else?

385
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,430
Nothing else

386
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,230
Why didn't you even tell me

387
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,140
for learning art?

388
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,150
As for this...

389
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,430
I don't think I did anything wrong

390
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,190
Xiaohua

391
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,190
I don't oppose you painting

392
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,790
But now...

393
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,390
The college entrance examination is about to come

394
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,590
You need to focus on

395
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,030
your study

396
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,510
As for the art

397
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,230
Or anything else

398
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,790
They can only distract you

399
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,390
You are a student now

400
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,590
You should focus on studying

401
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,270
and prepare for the college entrance examination

402
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:15,910
Got it?

403
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,550
I'm studying art

404
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,670
for the college entrance examination

405
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,030
I want to go to the PKU of Arts

406
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,830
Go to the PKU of Arts

407
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,870
You're just impulsive

408
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,750
Now you find drawing fun

409
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,190
But what about after the initial excitement wears off?

410
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,710
What then?

411
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,430
I'm not impulsive

412
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,390
It's not just a passing interest

413
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,670
I've thought it through

414
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,830
I'm serious

415
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,310
Xiaohua

416
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,630
Not everyone is an artist

417
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,910
Treating your passion

418
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,750
as a career

419
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,590
It's not as easy as you thought

420
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,190
Ask your father if you don't believe me

421
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,390
The hardships involved

422
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,070
You, at your age

423
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,990
can't understand at all

424
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,910
I know it's not easy

425
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,190
That's why I need to draw now

426
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,790
So that I can be capable

427
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,430
to do what I want

428
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,950
and what I like

429
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,230
You're still young

430
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,510
You don't have the ability

431
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,630
You're not even capable

432
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,790
to pay for your passion

433
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,750
Do you know that?

434
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,070
Mom, I don't...

435
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,110
Alright, let's not talk about it anymore

436
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,230
Stay at home this weekend

437
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,270
Just stay at home

438
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,150
Don't go anywhere

439
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,830
No way

440
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,310
I have an aptitude test tomorrow

441
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,270
I have to go

442
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,550
What's the aptitude test?

443
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,150
No, nothing is allowed

444
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,150
Reflect on your actions at home

445
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,070
I'll take away your phone

446
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,070
Honey

447
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,190
What's wrong with you?

448
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,670
Why are you meddling in this?

449
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,990
You've hurt her

450
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,880
Don't you know that?

451
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,030
Dad

452
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,950
You'll help me, won't you?

453
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,790
Actually

454
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,350
What your mom said is true

455
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,070
From our perspective

456
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,950
We just want your future

457
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,950
to be smoother

458
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,950
Xiaohua

459
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,870
Sometimes

460
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,150
Dreams are just words

461
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,430
When you grow up

462
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,070
you'll know what we mean

463
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,030
What do we do now?

464
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,310
Xiaohua is locked at home by her mom

465
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,510
She can't take the exam

466
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,870
It's like giving up on the art exam

467
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,230
Let's try to convince Auntie Guo

468
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,190
It's impossible

469
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,710
Auntie Guo is very firm

470
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,470
Or we can get Xiaohua out first

471
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,710
Then distract Auntie Guo

472
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,670
Do a bait and switch

473
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,710
Clamor in the East, attack in the West

474
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,150
Sounds feasible

475
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,710
But how do we actually do it?

476
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,790
Like in a spy film

477
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,990
This is when we come in

478
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,790
But now we only have

479
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,750
less than three hours until the exam

480
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,630
Oh no

481
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,030
It's fine

482
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,070
There's always something wrong

483
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,470
with our home's connection

484
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,950
There is one way

485
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,350
How do we do it?

486
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,510
That depends on our acting skills

487
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,270
and our coordination

488
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:47,990
Honey

489
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,510
She has been in her room

490
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,350
for such a long time

491
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,550
She must be hungry

492
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,990
I'll prepare some food for her

493
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,750
Hold on

494
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:57,830
Sit down

495
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,190
Someone's here

496
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,110
Oh...

497
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,190
I'll go

498
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,110
Who is it?

499
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,790
Who is it?

500
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,430
Who is it?

501
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:16,990
Who is it?

502
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,110
Hello

503
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,470
Hello

504
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,470
Here's the thing

505
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,790
The upstairs residents

506
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,670
said their circuit breaker tripped,

507
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,870
They asked me to come and check

508
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,910
What's the situation at your place?

509
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,990
Oh, okay

510
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:31,710
You're the electrician, right?

511
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,830
It's me, uncle

512
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,110
Datu, who is it?

513
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,390
Electrician

514
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,790
He's here to inspect the wiring

515
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,870
Our home has always had

516
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,710
some issues with this circuit, right?

517
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,750
Just take a look

518
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:44,950
What's the situation?

519
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,070
What's the reason?

520
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,550
Yes

521
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,830
This is your kitchen, right?

522
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,510
Kitchen

523
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,430
I need to check that

524
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,550
Okay

525
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,150
I'd check that socket plug

526
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,280
Follow me

527
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,790
Let me take a look at this

528
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,230
Uncle

529
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,310
I'm here to save Xiaohua

530
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,270
I know

531
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,350
Take a good look

532
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:08,950
at this wiring

533
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,230
I'll use a voltage tester

534
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,030
Well, this...

535
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,430
Where is Xiaohua now?

536
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,550
She's locked in her room

537
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,230
by her mother

538
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,710
I'll take you to see her

539
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,150
in her room

540
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,230
Sure

541
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,470
Take a good look, okay?

542
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,270
What's wrong?

543
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,350
It's broken

544
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,630
So what do we do?

545
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,470
No way

546
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,550
What about the other rooms?

547
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,560
I need to take a look

548
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,390
Got it

549
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,510
Where is your bathroom?

550
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,350
How about this?

551
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,630
Let's go to the inner room first, alright?

552
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,110
We need to take a look

553
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:42,830
-Yes, that's it -Stop

554
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,390
Do you really need to

555
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,310
check every room?

556
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,070
That's right

557
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,670
Exactly, just to be safe

558
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,310
Yes, to be safe

559
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,030
The sooner we finish, the better

560
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:10,830
Honey, just have a seat

561
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:11,710
Let me deal with it

562
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,310
It's fine

563
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,870
Have a seat

564
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,790
Okay, the keys

565
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,030
The sooner, the better

566
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,110
Just sit down and rest

567
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:19,670
Let me do it

568
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,270
Master, over here

569
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:21,990
Over here

570
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,510
This way?

571
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,070
This way

572
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,710
Let's check inside first

573
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,910
Let's check inside first

574
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,990
Just take a look if there's anything wrong

575
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,390
Take a look

576
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,430
Hey!

577
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:31,590
What's wrong?

578
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,510
Oh

579
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,950
Where is the socket?

580
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,270
Over here

581
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:36,950
Over here

582
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,830
I need to check it

583
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,270
Keep quiet

584
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,070
Lan Jinghui and others

585
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:44,750
are already downstairs

586
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,910
Quickly pack your things

587
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,150
Uncle will help us

588
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,190
He will take you out with us

589
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,030
Wait a moment

590
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,430
I'll find a way to distract your mom

591
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,190
You guys hurry up and go

592
00:27:59,230 --> 00:27:59,990
Anything wrong?

593
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,870
Why is this broken too?

594
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,830
It's broken too

595
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,150
Then what should we do?

596
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:05,950
Well...

597
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,710
There's another possibility

598
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,350
It's possible that there's a leak upstairs

599
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,790
that's affecting the wiring

600
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,510
You know that?

601
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,550
A water leak

602
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,550
Yes, a water leak

603
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,430
Right, we need to check the house

604
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,710
for any leaks, right?

605
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,510
Yeah, we need to take a look

606
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,470
Take a look

607
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:18,870
Let's just see

608
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,470
Take a look, where is it leaking?

609
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,670
Honey

610
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,310
Honey, come here

611
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,150
Come here

612
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,030
Take a look

613
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,830
Here

614
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,750
When did this start leaking?

615
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,310
It's leaking

616
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,990
How did it start leaking there?

617
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,350
Look, it's leaking

618
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,070
Isn't it strange?

619
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:41,950
Really?

620
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,070
I've never seen this before

621
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:43,910
Is there a leak here?

622
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:44,710
How did it start leaking?

623
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,310
How did it start leaking?

624
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,270
What's going on?

625
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,310
It's you

626
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,910
What's going on?

627
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,550
What's going on?

628
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,310
Nothing happened

629
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:54,990
Nothing happened, Honey

630
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,990
Xiao Datu

631
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:56,710
Move aside

632
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,270
Honey

633
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,070
Xiaohua

634
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,830
Honey

635
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,150
They're here

636
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,350
They're here

637
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,310
Get in the car quickly

638
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,310
Let's just go

639
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:14,950
Start the car please

640
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,670
Xiaohua, don't go

641
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,390
Xiaohua

642
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,870
Mom, don't chase after me

643
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,590
I'll regret it for the rest of my life

644
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,830
if I'm not going

645
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,950
Xiaohua, don't go

646
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,830
Xiaohua

647
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,230
Stop the car

648
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,910
Xiaohua

649
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,710
Don't go, Xiaohua

650
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,190
Mom, are you okay?

651
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,350
I just wanna ask you one thing

652
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,550
If you couldn't paint,

653
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,590
would you regret it for the rest of your life?

654
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,630
If I couldn't go,

655
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,350
I would regret it for the rest of my life

656
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,910
I'll take responsibility

657
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,510
for my dreams

658
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,830
Is this your responsible attitude

659
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,910
towards your dreams?

660
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,030
You don't even have your ID card

661
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,710
How can you take the exam?

662
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:26,950
Thank you, Mom

663
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,510
I'll work hard

664
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,430
I'll not let you down

665
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:35,990
Alright

666
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:36,590
You see

667
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:37,830
They're all waiting for you

668
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,670
Go quickly

669
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,110
Okay

670
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:42,990
Go for it

671
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,470
Okay

672
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:44,710
Come on

673
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,990
All the love in the world

674
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,470
is meant to be together

675
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,830
If there's a love

676
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,950
that is meant to be apart,

677
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,390
it's probably

678
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,950
the love of parents for their children

679
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,430
Every parent hopes

680
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,150
their child learns to be independent

681
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,230
and be strong

682
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,470
But before that,

683
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,350
a parent's love

684
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,510
is the wings

685
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,630
armor,

686
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,430
and a fortress

687
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,790
It is everything they can do

688
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,230
I'm not impulsive

689
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,350
It's not a momentary passion

690
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,750
I have thought it through

691
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,790
I'm serious

692
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,990
I know it's not easy

693
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,670
That's why I need to

694
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,190
seize the time to paint

695
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,870
That way, I'm capable

696
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,470
to do what I love

697
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,110
and what I wanna do
