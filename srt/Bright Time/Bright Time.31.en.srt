00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,120
Class

4
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,080
We are gonna have a test

5
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,000
Today, all the students

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
who are sitting in this examination room

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,720
are top students in our school

8
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,480
Although you are already excellent,

9
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,320
I still hope that you

10
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,120
can try your best

11
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,920
and have the right attitude towards the test

12
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,680
I believe in all of you

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,120
Today, there are four test papers

14
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
and one answer sheet

15
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,920
I'll distribute them now

16
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,200
Oh my god, Ling Dong actually

17
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,120
dropped to the remedial class

18
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,280
Did he take the test with his eyes closed?

19
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,520
Did he only write down the answers

20
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,480
without showing his work again?

21
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,320
Lan Jinghui also made it to the remedial class

22
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,200
Qingtian,

23
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,920
we have to work harder

24
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,240
What about our goals?

25
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,560
Yes

26
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,120
Next time, we will do better

27
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,520
Yes

28
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,080
Come on

29
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,120
Come on

30
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,840
I really don't understand

31
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,200
For English and comprehensive science,

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,160
you only answered

33
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,400
half of the multiple-choice questions

34
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,480
You have to tell me why

35
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
I read the serial number wrong

36
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,320
By the time I noticed it,

37
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,200
it was too late to change it

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,720
You read the serial number wrong?

39
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,560
You read it wrong for both subjects, right?

40
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,800
Yes

41
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,400
I was careless this time

42
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,800
I will pay more attention next time

43
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,760
Go back to class now

44
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,800
Goodbye

45
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,800
How did Dongdong end up in the remedial class?

46
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,880
Dagang

47
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,800
Sister-in-law

48
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,720
You...

49
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,920
After so many years,

50
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,520
you'd still never be late

51
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,840
I'm fifteen minutes early

52
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,520
and I'm still late

53
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,760
Please sit down

54
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,160
Have a seat

55
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,360
Well, coffee

56
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,600
Which one would you like?

57
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,120
Black coffee

58
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,280
Okay

59
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,040
Sister-in-law, what would you like to drink?

60
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm not used to the coffee

61
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,880
I'll just have water instead

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,440
Okay

63
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,600
Dagang

64
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,800
Being a teacher is hard, right?

65
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,760
Look, your hair has turned white

66
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,280
I'd have to worry so much

67
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,000
These kids nowadays,

68
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,480
they are cunning and clever

69
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,520
I can't control them anymore

70
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,160
Yes

71
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,520
Hello, your coffee please

72
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:32,960
Thank you

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,200
Thank you

74
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,520
Alright, leave it here

75
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,440
You suddenly contacted me

76
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,000
Is it because of Ling Dong, right?

77
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,080
Yes

78
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,360
Dongdong has been struggling

79
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,760
with his academic performance lately

80
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
He's always deep in thought

81
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,320
I dare not ask

82
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,640
I'm afraid of putting pressure on him

83
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,080
Later on, I was thinking

84
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,840
if there's something at school

85
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,440
Well

86
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,160
I thought about it

87
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,400
I wanted to get some information

88
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,760
from you

89
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,640
Dagang, sorry for bothering you

90
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
No, sister-in-law

91
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,920
We've been friends for so many years

92
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,800
If you call it a bother

93
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,640
then it must be a joke

94
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,200
I've mentioned you to Shangjin

95
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,560
many times over the years

96
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,640
We just didn't know

97
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,320
how you were doing

98
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,480
Dagang, we're doing well

99
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,480
Dongdong is always sensible

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,360
He doesn't give me any worries

101
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,720
Besides

102
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,160
You know I have a lot of pride

103
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,960
And you're Dongdong's teacher

104
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm afraid if he finds out

105
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,400
about our relationship

106
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,600
It won't be easy for your work

107
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Sister-in-law, you're considerate

108
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,560
Don't worry about Ling Dong

109
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,880
He's kind and righteous

110
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,880
And he's very motivated

111
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,720
His grades declined this time

112
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,200
It's all my fault

113
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,920
Here's the reason

114
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,120
Shangjin's son

115
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,440
His academic performance dropped slightly

116
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,640
Coincidentally

117
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,560
These two kids are in the same class

118
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,920
So I thought

119
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,520
why not create

120
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,280
a study group for them

121
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,480
So that Ling Dong can

122
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,520
improve his son's academic performance

123
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,160
Through this,

124
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,960
they became close Like brothers

125
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,880
So I guess

126
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,760
Ling Dong intentionally scored lower

127
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,880
to be in the same class

128
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,680
as Shangjin's son

129
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,800
and continue helping him

130
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,160
If that's the case,

131
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,800
causing Dongdong's grades to decline

132
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,200
I'm not worried

133
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,800
By the way, Dagang

134
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,040
I brought you a gift

135
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,800
This is the music sheet

136
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,440
when Ling Kun and you

137
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,440
formed a band back then

138
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,960
I brought it over

139
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,400
As a memento for you

140
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,480
You're always so thoughtful

141
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,800
Well, um...

142
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,000
It's getting late

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,880
I have to go back

144
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,360
Dongdong will be getting out of school soon

145
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,800
Sister-in-law

146
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,120
We haven't seen each other for so many years

147
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,720
When you're free some other day,

148
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,440
I'll invite Shangjin

149
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,320
Let's just get together

150
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,040
Sounds good

151
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,400
When there's a chance

152
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:11,960
Sure

153
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,520
Since you said so

154
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,480
Well, there's no chance

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,560
Alright then

156
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Let's schedule a time today

157
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,640
What do you think about the weekend?

158
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,240
Or maybe next...

159
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,800
Dagang

160
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
I know what you mean

161
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,840
But don't worry

162
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,480
We're really doing well

163
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,960
We have everything we need at home

164
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,480
Ling Kun is lucky

165
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,480
to have such good friends like you

166
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,520
Thank you on his behalf

167
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,960
Well, it's getting late

168
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
I really have to go back now

169
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,720
Sister-in-law

170
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,360
Take care

171
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,160
Goodbye

172
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,920
Hello

173
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,240
How's it going? I've made progress, right?

174
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,960
Indeed

175
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,920
But you still have to work hard

176
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,440
to get into the rocket class

177
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,520
I passed the advanced class

178
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
but there's still some pressure

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,240
Does Auntie know about you

180
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,120
getting into the advanced class?

181
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
Auntie is not in good health

182
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,960
Won't she be worried?

183
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
Don't worry

184
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,240
She knew

185
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
I already told my mom

186
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,380
we're gonna go to the PKU together

187
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,640
Don't let me down, okay?

188
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,380
Don't worry

189
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,960
Look at the second question

190
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,040
It's a typical

191
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,480
conic curve

192
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,000
I know

193
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,440
Solve it by combining the line and the curve

194
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,680
and then simplify to find the roots

195
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,040
Why didn't you finish it?

196
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,400
This kind of big problem

197
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,720
If you really can't solve it

198
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,520
there's no need to struggle

199
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,240
and waste time

200
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,800
Just write down the formulas

201
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,840
and get partial credit for the steps

202
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,880
Xiaohua

203
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,640
Your score is much higher than mine

204
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,200
It's not bad

205
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,280
You're improving too fast

206
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,760
We'll definitely do well

207
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,920
in the upcoming mock exam

208
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,200
See you in the advanced class

209
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,320
Qingtian

210
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,320
Your error rate cloze

211
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,080
is still high

212
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,960
Actually, it has its techniques

213
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,320
Essentially, it's a process of

214
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,360
logical reasoning

215
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,600
The key is to know

216
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,320
what it's testing you on

217
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,760
Reasoning?

218
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,480
Give it a try

219
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,440
See if you can

220
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960
identify all the key words

221
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:15,540
Okay

222
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,720
This is already

223
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,440
the simplest sequence problem

224
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
I've told you all

225
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,200
I'm not cut out for studying

226
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,480
I shouldn't be here

227
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,960
I should be on the basketball court

228
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,080
Why am I here?

229
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,480
What are you gonna do, Ma Yiming?

230
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,200
This place isn't suitable for me

231
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,120
I'll go play basketball

232
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,160
Bye bye

233
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,280
Bye bye

234
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,680
Bye

235
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,440
Look at him

236
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,720
He just left

237
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Speaking of which,

238
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,440
there's another mock exam coming up

239
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
We have exams every week

240
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,640
We'd better get used to it early

241
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,160
I'm just worried about you

242
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,960
I'm afraid you'll have problems with the exam

243
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,840
Then you'd better

244
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,760
take care of yourself first

245
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,600
I'm telling you the truth

246
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,240
Lately it feels like

247
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,720
I have a divine intervention in everything

248
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,200
Everything goes smoothly

249
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,720
There's nothing I can't accomplish

250
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,760
When did you become so shameless?

251
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,960
Apprentice

252
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,440
Apprentice

253
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,760
I'm studying

254
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,440
Genetic mutation is essentially

255
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,520
a substitution, addition,

256
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,240
and deletion of base pairs

257
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,240
Has she gone crazy lately?

258
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,080
Learn from her

259
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,280
Study more when you go back

260
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,880
Alright. Someday, with my sail piercing the clouds;

261
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,680
I'll mount the wind, break the waves, and traverse the vast, rolling sea

262
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,800
Keep studying

263
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,480
I can't do it anymore

264
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,520
Given that

265
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,240
the square of cos B divided by

266
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,880
the square of cos A plus

267
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,400
the square of sin B divided by

268
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,120
the square of sin A equals 1

269
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,440
Prove that...

270
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,960
Excuse me

271
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,760
Thank you

272
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,400
Xiaohua, I'm actually here

273
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,760
I joined the advanced class

274
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,040
Let me see

275
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,920
Chen Luyang is still in the rocket class

276
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,560
Lan Jinghui

277
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,440
Lan Jinghui

278
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,240
He made it into the rocket class

279
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,200
Ling Dong is with him again

280
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
How did this happen?

281
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,320
Xiaohua

282
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,960
Xiaohua

283
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,880
Xiaohua

284
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
This time

285
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,360
maybe you didn't perform well

286
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,320
You're usually very good

287
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,160
It's okay

288
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,120
It's nothing

289
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,560
Study well for the next one

290
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,120
You'll definitely make it into the advanced class

291
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,880
The college entrance exam is coming soon

292
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,160
I still have a few more chances

293
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Ling Dong, I knew you'd come back

294
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,320
Here's the seat for you

295
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,000
Thanks

296
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:40,880
Brother Hui

297
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,760
Hey, you seem to

298
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,720
be sitting in my seat

299
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,640
Who are you?

300
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,560
Ruosi

301
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,480
You don't even know him?

302
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,800
He's Brother Hui

303
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,240
He was once

304
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,480
stared at someone

305
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,360
by the restroom door

306
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,360
On a dark and stormy night,

307
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,680
under the drizzling rain,

308
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,120
he fought against ten people

309
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,760
No

310
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,200
Fifty people

311
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,560
got blocked at the door

312
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,760
And he just let them go right

313
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,320
How is that possible?

314
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,280
Are you making up stories?

315
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,080
If you don't believe me, ask Chen Luyang

316
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,880
It's true

317
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,360
So, just now

318
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,560
Did you make eye contact with him?

319
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
No, no, no

320
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,280
I'm gonna use the restroom

321
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,880
Fifty?

322
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,360
Qingtian, what's wrong?

323
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,880
I'm worried about Xiaohua

324
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,080
She's been working so hard

325
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,280
Why does she always perform poorly on exams?

326
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,680
Exams aren't just about ability

327
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,960
Mental attitude is also important

328
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,760
I think your mindset for studying

329
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,480
is pretty good

330
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,320
Maybe that's the only

331
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,880
advantage I have

332
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,120
How possible

333
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,480
You have many other advantages

334
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,000
What are they?

335
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,580
Optimistic and cheerful

336
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,120
They're essentially the same

337
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,600
I'm leaving now

338
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,000
Thanks for taking me home today

339
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,080
Sorry for the bothering

340
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
It's not a bother. It's on the way

341
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,400
Goodbye

342
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,880
Goodbye

343
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,520
Where is my bus pass?

344
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,640
Alright, time's up

345
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,640
Good job

346
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,680
You only got two multiple-choice questions wrong

347
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,760
That's a high accuracy rate

348
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,040
Great

349
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,840
You just put too much pressure on yourself

350
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,600
Stay calm

351
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,520
There's no problem

352
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,560
In the next exam,

353
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,160
you'll definitely get into the advanced class

354
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,760
No, that's not it

355
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,440
Clearly, something's wrong

356
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,120
What's wrong with her?

357
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,680
She might really have some problems

358
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,560
Why is it that every time I cry,

359
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,080
you're the one who saw it?

360
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,240
Why don't you ask me anything?

361
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,240
Naturally, you'll tell me

362
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,840
whenever you want

363
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,360
As long as you don't wanna say it,

364
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
no matter how others persuade you, it won't work

365
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,760
I have no problem doing exercises normally

366
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,000
but I get nervous during exams

367
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,040
Even questions I know, I get wrong

368
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,440
It'll be even worse in college entrance exam

369
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,120
I'm really scared

370
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,720
What are you afraid of?

371
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm especially afraid

372
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,360
that I won't get into the PKU

373
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,080
This is the first time I've gone against

374
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,200
my mom's wishes

375
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,160
and chose to pursue art

376
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,600
What if I don't get in?

377
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,600
I'm afraid she'll be disappointed

378
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,240
It's not possible

379
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,800
to always satisfy them

380
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,040
You can't even

381
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,560
always satisfy yourself

382
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,320
Think about it, perhaps the worst outcome

383
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,600
is that you don't get into the PKU

384
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,000
But even if that happens,

385
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,280
you can still choose

386
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,120
other schools

387
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,480
You can still continue to pursue art

388
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,440
But this is already

389
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,360
the worst outcome

390
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,240
So

391
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,880
What are you still afraid of?

392
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,080
You make a good point

393
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,720
You know what?

394
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,520
There was once

395
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,120
an Olympic champion in long-distance running

396
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,760
A reporter interviewed him

397
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,400
and asked him

398
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,000
What kind of perseverance makes you

399
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,280
to complete this 10,000 meters race?

400
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,600
Do you know how he answered?

401
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,920
I don't know

402
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,640
He said

403
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,680
I don't know

404
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
I don't think about anything

405
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,960
I just think about completing this step

406
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,800
and then taking the next step

407
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,640
Like that

408
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,880
Step by step

409
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,000
It's already finished

410
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,720
Step by step

411
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,520
Unknowingly, it's already finished

412
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,640
Xiaohua, you're the best

413
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,720
Yes, I am the best

414
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,840
Xiao Xiaohua

415
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,760
You'll definitely get into the PKU

416
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,840
I, Xiaohua

417
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,880
Will definitely get into the PKU

418
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,080
You are the champion

419
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,320
I'm the champion

420
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,160
The Roof Squad

421
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,600
Charge!

422
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,280
I heard you're Ma Mao's girlfriend

423
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,840
A while ago, Ma Mao bet on a game with us

424
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,600
and lost money

425
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,120
So you have to pay for him, right?

426
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,360
I don't know him

427
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,600
You don't know him?

428
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,600
But I heard it directly from Ma Mao

429
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,880
You're Xu Mengyu, right?

430
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,280
Yes, it's her

431
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,360
I saw you

432
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,280
at the basketball court last time

433
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,080
What are you pretending for?

434
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,040
I don't know him

435
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,760
You don't know him?

436
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,840
Don't go. Let me tell you

437
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,080
Stop

438
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,480
Let go of me

439
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,440
If you don't give me money, don't even think about leaving

440
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,360
Did you hear that?

441
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,040
Sounds like Ma Yiming

442
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,640
Is that Ma Yiming?

443
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,040
Ma Yiming

444
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,680
What's wrong?

445
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,960
Brother Hui

446
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,720
What's wrong?

447
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,440
They're causing trouble for Mengyu

448
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,400
Are you okay?

449
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,680
So what? Why are you so anxious?

450
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,160
Lan Jinghui

451
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,920
Just leave if you don't wanna make a mess

452
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm only looking for her

453
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,200
I'm being polite with you

454
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,680
You dare to talk to me like that?

455
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,400
You know I'm Lan Jinghui

456
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,280
And you talk to me like this?

457
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,360
You don't know

458
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,680
I'm the one who specifically causes trouble

459
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,920
How can you even bully girls?

460
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,320
Come at me

461
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,520
So what?

462
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,440
You have a helper now

463
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,520
I won' t accept it

464
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,120
I won' t accept it

465
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,360
Alright

466
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,240
There are a lot of you, huh?

467
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,080
You guys just wait

468
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:17,880
Come on

469
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,680
I thought

470
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,440
bad people were something special

471
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,280
Lan Jinghui, where's your bag?

472
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,320
Here

473
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,680
My mom bought it for me

474
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,680
It's brand new

475
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,760
You scared me

476
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,480
We're awesome

477
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,800
Actually, you don't have to walk me home

478
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,640
I can go by myself

479
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,160
I'm afraid they'll come after you again

480
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,360
You asked me before

481
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,960
which college I wanna apply to

482
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,920
I didn't have an answer then

483
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,080
But now I have a goal

484
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,400
I wanna go to Rong University

485
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,000
Rong University

486
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,160
I've thought about it for a long time

487
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:21,760
I feel like

488
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,120
I really like writing

489
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,480
I wanna major in Drama Literature at Rong University

490
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,280
This major

491
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,760
is Rong University's flagship program

492
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,800
But the score requirements

493
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,560
are also very high

494
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,440
I don't know if I can make it

495
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,600
You'll definitely be fine

496
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
If you can't get in,

497
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,200
then who else can?

498
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,800
Right?

499
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,040
My house is just up ahead

500
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,760
Thank you for walking me home

501
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,560
No problem

502
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,680
See you tomorrow

503
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,840
See you tomorrow

504
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,840
Ma Yiming

505
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,920
Thank you today

506
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,520
You're welcome

507
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,120
How many do I need to get into Rong University?

508
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,680
Look at this question

509
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,280
Don't say it

510
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,720
You won't be there during the exam

511
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,840
I have to rely on myself

512
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,720
You can't help me forever

513
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,080
Is anyone here?

514
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,480
These are my notes

515
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,160
If you don't understand anything,

516
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,800
you can ask me

517
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,520
Ma Yiming

518
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,480
The future is uncertain

519
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,160
We're both dark horses

520
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,360
Is it true or not?

521
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:28,920
It's true

522
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,760
Jia Letian

523
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,560
Stop spreading rumors, okay?

524
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,000
I've clearly lost weight

525
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,520
Unfortunately,

526
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,920
this isn't how our

527
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,440
class 5 of grade 2 used to look

528
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,480
We can never go back, right?

529
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,480
Who said that?

530
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,280
Look

531
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,720
The seats are still here

532
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,520
Everyone is still here

533
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,040
We can still hang out together, right?

534
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,120
Class begins

535
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:05,880
Stand up

536
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,840
Hello, teacher

537
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,720
Hello, class. Sit down please

538
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,120
Long time no see, everyone

539
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,800
Long time no see

540
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,280
The college entrance exam is coming soon

541
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,960
There are a few things

542
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,000
I need to explain to you all

543
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,960
Remember to bring your

544
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
ID cards and admission tickets

545
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,080
Especially for those

546
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,840
who are always absent-minded

547
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,160
Jia Letian

548
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,920
Don't look around, I'm talking about you

549
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,360
Of course, there are also some

550
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,360
who tend to get nervous easily

551
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,080
and easily get emotionally anxious

552
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,680
Actually, it's okay

553
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,640
It's not a big deal

554
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,880
You have all been through

555
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,200
countless exams already

556
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:47,760
Right?

557
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,440
Yes

558
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,120
Good

559
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,320
As usual

560
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,120
I've brought you some gifts

561
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,760
Another test paper

562
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,080
Okay, stop

563
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,000
Okay

564
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Students whose names are called

565
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,160
come up and get your test papers

566
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,720
Lu Yao

567
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,400
Yu Chen

568
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,160
Fu Luwen

569
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,640
Li Ruosi

570
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,680
Lin Keke

571
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,840
Xu Chao

572
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,160
Zhu Ming

573
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,200
Yang Xuan

574
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Liu Chenyu

575
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,320
Jiang Jing

576
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,320
Lan Jinghui

577
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,720
Thank you, Ms. Fang

578
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,720
Ling Dong

579
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,680
This test paper looks familiar

580
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,160
Alright

581
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,000
Everyone has received

582
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,640
your test papers, right?

583
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
Yes

584
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,360
This is the diagnostic test

585
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,000
you took when you entered high school

586
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,040
Think about how you did back then

587
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,440
with these questions

588
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,160
I was really foolish back then

589
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,120
I even made mistakes on such simple questions

590
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,040
This test paper

591
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,720
proves your transformation

592
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,840
over the past two years

593
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,240
Remember

594
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
You have already experienced

595
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,480
countless exams

596
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,840
So from now on

597
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,800
You must be in the best condition

598
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
and go with the most brilliant battle

599
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The college entrance exam is approaching

600
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,120
Let me say something more

601
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,480
You will soon leave

602
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,360
this classroom

603
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,360
Do you know there is a gentle term

604
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,600
in mathematics,

605
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,000
it's called "one and only"

606
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,360
So in these years at Chenjun

607
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,800
You have the "one and only" youth

608
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,640
During these years

609
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
You have shed sweat

610
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,480
filled with youthful vitality

611
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,000
And we've grown together

612
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,400
Maybe our time together

613
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,560
hasn't been so smooth

614
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,160
Because I often criticize you But

615
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,160
But...

616
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,920
I wanna say

617
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,800
You are like my friends

618
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,640
Like my teachers

619
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,440
I've grown up with you

620
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,000
Youth is like a train

621
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
that won't look back

622
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,680
I am honored to be part of

623
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,960
the best time of your youth

624
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,520
Accompanying you through

625
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,120
the years of being young students

626
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,160
And in the future

627
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,360
I won't have the chance

628
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,560
to take you on training trips anymore

629
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,080
Nor will anyone secretly

630
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,240
watch you outside the classroom

631
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,080
to see if you are sleeping

632
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
I won't suddenly

633
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,480
walk into the classroom

634
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,680
and confiscate your phones

635
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,320
But I wish you

636
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,600
every day in the future

637
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,600
to be healthy and happy

638
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,320
and to achieve all your dreams

639
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,640
I hope your youth

640
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,560
will be without regrets

641
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,120
Come on!

642
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,320
Alright

643
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,040
Now, I announce

644
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,440
the last class

645
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,640
for Class Five of Grade Three

646
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,840
Class dismissed

647
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,320
Stand up

648
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,840
Goodbye, teachers

649
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,320
Goodbye, class

650
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,000
Now let's find a classmate

651
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,960
to interview

652
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,880
Hello, classmate

653
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,040

Yes

661
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,720
Okay

662
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,040
Let me think for a moment

663
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,160
Hello

someone else's role model

669
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,680
Do you feel proud?

670
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,600
Very proud

671
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,160
You can be proud

672
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,000

00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,720

683
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,400
to your high school self

684
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,280
Well

I did gain a lot, right?

686
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,080
What did you gain?

687
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,360
I gained

688
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,440
a group of friends

689
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,120
and a nephew

690
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,120
Interview

691
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,000
I wanna say too

692
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,160
This is a mic

693
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,120
Ma Yiming

694
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,320
You are good at basketball

695
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,360
But don't be arrogant

696
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,040
And never give up

697
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,120
on the things you wanna do

698
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,320
Like saving money

699
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,080
to buy sneakers

700
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,160
Alright, you've finished speaking

701
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,040
Chen Luyang, it's your turn

702
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,600
I haven't finished speaking yet

703
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
You're done talking

704
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,560
Be careful

705
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,280
Let me say something

706
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,000
I think the biggest change

707
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,840
in my high school life

708
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,840
is that

709
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,880
my life is filled with sunny days

710
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,720
Here

711
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,840
Xia Qingtian

712
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,200
You're amazing

713
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,000
Finally, under the leadership of the monitor,

714
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,920
your math grades

715
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,200
have surpassed your weight

716
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,600
You only got that many

717
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,560
What are you saying?

718
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,240
Come on, sister Meng, your turn

719
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:08,960
Xu Mengyu

720
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,520
Occasionally being down-to-earth

721
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,320
is not a bad thing

722
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,520
After all,

723
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,880
you'll have fans

724
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,480
Come on

725
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,720
Alright, I know

726
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,800
Come on

727
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,360
Come on, say something

728
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,920
I...

729
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,080
You've been here for a long time

730
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,760
Say something

731
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,000
I have so much to say

732
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,200
I don't know what to say

733
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,400
Then say what you most wanna say

734
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,720
Xiaohua from high school

735
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,520
You are the unique existence

736
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,320
in this world

737
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,920
Paint your own colors

738
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,800
with determination
