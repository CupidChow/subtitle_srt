1
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,440
According to this inequality

2
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,000
Root quarter number two AB

3
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,840
Less than or equal to root two quarters

4
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,440
Time two plus the root two R square

5
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,960
Equal to the root of two plus one

6
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,680
The square of R

7
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,920
Then when A equals B

8
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,400
Maximum area of

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
Do you understand all this question

10
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,280
Got it

11
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,280
Understood, understood, understood

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,760
Well, it's getting late today

13
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,720
Let's stop here

14
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,800
Lan Jinghui

15
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,840
Don't you leave

16
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,640
I

17
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,520
Review it again and again

18
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,240
Did I hear you right

19
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,760
What's wrong

20
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Are you afraid that my grades will get better if I steal away

21
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,640
Preferably

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,520
Hear no, it's best to be

23
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,160
You two look down on me together

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,520
Everyone looks down on me so much

25
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,400
Young man, you

26
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,040
Keep an eye on the road when you ride your bike

27
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,880
Sorry, sorry

28
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,600
Can you still eat this, this, this

29
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,520
Okay, let's leave it alone. Let's go

30
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,640
Sorry, sorry

31
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,000
Go to school

32
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,760
Okay

33
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,160
Be careful on the road

34
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,320
Sorry, sorry

35
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you

36
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,560
Let's go, let's go

37
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,000
We can't just let this go

38
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,960
You can't beat people even if you study well

39
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,000
impossible

40
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,400
My son, he couldn't hit anyone

41
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,760
There must be a misunderstanding here

42
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,400
You're the fucking mother

43
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,720
Covering your son, of course

44
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,720
This matter must be made clear to me

45
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,360
Don't cry Don't cry Don't cry

46
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,520
Just in time for your son to come back

47
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,400
Winter, winter

48
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,200
You came over and made it clear to me

49
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,000
What's wrong

50
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,240
I made it clear to you

51
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,880
I invited you here to teach my children

52
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,920
I didn't ask you to hit him

53
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,440
Don't cry, baby

54
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,000
Not

55
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,520
He won't, can't you teach him well

56
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,440
Have to fight

57
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,080
Auntie

58
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Please don't worry, okay

59
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,200
Don't cry Don't cry baby

60
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,080
Little bear

61
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,760
Brother asked you

62
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,560
The thing is that your mom

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,080
Is that what you say

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,360
Little bear

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,440
Little bear, listen to your brother

66
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,000
Later, my brother will have one

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,320
Something very important to do

68
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,240
So we now

69
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,520
Do the questions first, okay

70
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,200
Come on, Little Bear, don't eat it

71
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,080
Eat after finishing

72
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,280
Look at this question

73
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,240
Little bear, look

74
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,680
This connection question is very simple

75
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,040
Let's finish class, okay

76
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,120
Come on, Little Bear, do the problem quickly

77
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:21,840
Do it quickly

78
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,880
No, I don't want to study

79
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,280
No, I don't want to study

80
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,880
Little Bear, Little Bear, don't cry

81
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,800
No, don't cry, don't cry, little bear

82
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,640
What happened to the bear

83
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,680
Little Bear

84
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,240
How did you hit him

85
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,640
Where did the bear hit?

86
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,600
Not Auntie Auntie

87
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,240
Let me explain

88
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,480
He won't, can't you teach him well

89
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,360
Why did you hit him

90
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,480
No aunt, I didn't hit him

91
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,280
You don't hit him

92
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Why is he crying so hard

93
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,040
Bear, don't cry, don't cry

94
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,240
Don't cry Don't cry Don't cry

95
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,880
Forget it, auntie

96
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,760
Auntie like this

97
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,320
Make it clear to me before you leave

98
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,160
Yes, yes, yes, aunt

99
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,120
Here's what it looks like

100
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,760
I have a piece today

101
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,480
Something very important

102
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,320
I must do it now

103
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,200
Make it clear to me before you leave

104
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,120
Why did you hit him

105
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,480
It's really too late now

106
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,640
I can't say a sentence or two clearly

107
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,560
Make it clear before you leave

108
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,280
I'm sorry aunt

109
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,120
I have to go now

110
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,080
I'll explain it to you another day

111
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,400
Little Bear

112
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,760
Good

113
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Don't cry, don't cry

114
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,640
Don't cry

115
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,400
Young man, are you okay

116
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,960
You're riding too fast by yourself

117
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,800
You can't blame me for that

118
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,000
It's okay, I'm leaving first

119
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,960
Did you

120
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,560
Fear of being scolded

121
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,560
That's why I cried

122
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,720
How is that possible

123
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,600
My child is so young

124
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,480
Why don't you hit him

125
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
How could he possibly scratch you

126
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,320
Don't be afraid, little bear

127
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,800
My son couldn't have hit anyone

128
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,160
You're still shielding your son

129
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,640
Auntie

130
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,920
Actually, you can check

131
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,160
Is there any injury on the bear

132
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,240
You still want to hurt him

133
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,120
Why don't you hit him

134
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,280
How could he cry so hard

135
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,560
Bear, don't cry

136
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,280
I said Mom Bear

137
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,000
Are you a little misunderstood

138
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,440
Dongdong, but we're here

139
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,000
A famous good boy and a good student

140
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,520
That's why I introduced him

141
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,640
It's tutoring for your children

142
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,600
Sister Ma

143
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,160
I'm just looking at them

144
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,000
Orphans and widows are pitiful

145
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,080
I was kind enough to let Ling Dong

146
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Tutoring for our children

147
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,720
Then the class fee is not less, right

148
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,600
Here's the class fee you gave

149
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,200
You take it

150
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:27,880
Mom

151
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,680
But let me tell you

152
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,480
My son couldn't lie

153
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
And even less likely to hit someone

154
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,040
How can she say that about you

155
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,600
Mom, it's okay

156
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,720
I don't care what she says about me

157
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,600
It's all up to me, up to me

158
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,560
Let's go back to the house first

159
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,680
Walk, walk, walk

160
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,560
Yes, mom

161
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Go back first, go back

162
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,120
Let's go, mom

163
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,760
Good morning bye bye

164
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,320
It's too slow

165
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,680
Good morning, Chairman

166
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,320
Lan Jinghui

167
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,960
Are you making a mistake

168
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,000
You're alone

169
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,680
Occupy so many parking spaces

170
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,480
How do you ask people to park

171
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,000
Move me away

172
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,200
I'm seriously

173
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,160
Let me tell you about this problem

174
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,880
Move me away

175
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,160
I'm doing it for your own good, do you know

176
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,840
Move me away

177
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,480
unreasonable

178
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,080
Riding so slowly, you can count it

179
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,320
Seventeen No Seventeen

180
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,280
Where's the vigor it deserves

181
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,240
Specially grabbed a parking space for you

182
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,240
Pick one

183
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,360
In traffic accidents every year

184
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,760
There are a lot of people who die in car accidents

185
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Among them, non-motor vehicles

186
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Accounting for 80%

187
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,280
It can only be said that I cherish my life more than you

188
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,080
I said you the person

189
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,080
That's strange

190
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,160
I'll help you grab a parking space

191
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Forget it if you don't thank me

192
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,920
And you curse me

193
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,520
What did you do after school yesterday

194
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,120
I

195
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,680
What didn't I do

196
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,120
I

197
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
I went to play ball with Ma Yiming

198
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,800
I won't tell you anymore

199
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,840
It's rare to come early

200
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
If I don't go, hurry up

201
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,440
The teacher stopped praising me

202
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,680
By the way

203
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,320
I bought too much for that breakfast

204
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,280
You eat a little too

205
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,720
Bye-bye

206
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,040
I haven't finished copying

207
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,760
No, I'm sorry

208
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,840
My hands are too fast

209
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,320
Wipe it, wipe it, wipe it

210
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,560
It's wrong here

211
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,800
Atomic energy generating heat-generating spectrum

212
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,320
How could it be 1s22s1

213
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,280
WHAT

214
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,520
What's wrong

215
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,160
Here

216
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,120
1s22s1 is the ground state atom

217
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,520
1s22s22p1

218
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,840
and 1s22s22p3 are ground states

219
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,280
No electronic transition occurs

220
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,240
So I should choose 1s22s22p1

221
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,160
Ground state non-transition

222
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,880
What is a ground state

223
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,760
So this atom

224
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,960
Why does it excite

225
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,120
Why do electrons jump

226
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,000
K layer 1s

227
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,760
L layer 2s 2p

228
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,400
Anyway, just remember this sort

229
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,120
Other than that, it's not the ground state

230
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,680
Either ground state or excited state

231
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
The excited state will transition

232
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,320
Do you understand

233
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,840
Write it down

234
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,480
Good

235
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,520
1s

236
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:16,880
L layer

237
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,880
2s 2p

238
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,640
K layer

239
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,480
It's getting late

240
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,320
This chemistry note

241
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,040
Take it back and have a look

242
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,320
There are some key points in it that I remember

243
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,960
Review well

244
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,840
I'm leaving first

245
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,040
You wait for me to go together

246
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,440
What?

247
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,680
Cell phone? What

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,400
Why don't I want it

249
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,040
What? Why don't you want it

250
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,280
Isn't your phone broken

251
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,120
My house happens to be extra

252
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,040
You take it

253
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,160
I said I didn't want it

254
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,280
I have extra at home

255
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,000
Why don't you just hold it and use it first

256
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,560
Lan Jinghui

257
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,440
That day at my doorstep

258
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,560
Have you seen it all

259
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,640
I

260
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,200
I happened to be passing by

261
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,920
pass by

262
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,240
You're really self-righteous

263
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,760
You know what

264
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,600
This is not

265
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,840
A problem of self-righteousness

266
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,360
It's just that I happen to

267
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,120
I have an extra cell phone

268
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,040
You just take it

269
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,720
It's okay to put it in

270
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,840
I told you I didn't want it

271
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,840
It's okay

272
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,000
Lan Jinghui

273
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,040
I'm really not bad with this phone

274
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,160
You just use it first

275
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,200
Your phone is broken

276
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,880
Don't make me say it a second time

277
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,320
Lan Jinghui

278
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,760
You use it first

279
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,680
I don't want to say it again

280
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,560
You just put it first

281
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,400
Lan Jinghui

282
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,480
Did I mention I needed a cell phone

283
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,720
And before in the carport

284
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,280
In the canteen

285
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,160
I'm telling you

286
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,480
I don't need your handouts

287
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,160
You don't want it, don't you

288
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,560
Good

289
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,680
I don't have to give it to you

290
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,200
Ling Dong

291
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,320
You can take your chemistry notes

292
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,120
Can you lend me a minute

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,320
I'll give it back to you right away

294
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,440
Ling Big Nerd

295
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,640
Good intentions are treated as donkey liver and lungs

296
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,320
Ling Big Nerd

297
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,280
You have a grudge against the basket

298
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,880
Why are you silent when you walk

299
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,360
Are you with someone else Ling Dong again

300
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:33,920
Had a quarrel

301
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,320
Brother Grey, I'm not talking about you

302
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,840
Be a man

303
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,400
You should be magnanimous

304
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,400
Don't always have trouble with others

305
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,520
Go

306
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,000
What do you know

307
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,840
I think you bully people all day long

308
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,120
They used to bury the hatchet before

309
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,320
Come and help you set up a band

310
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,840
Just stopped for two days

311
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,720
Here we go again

312
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
In total, I'm the only one

313
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,880
Dog bites Lu Dongbin

314
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,960
Don't know good people's hearts

315
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Not knowing good people's hearts

316
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,480
So what's the fire doing

317
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,200
I was kind enough to say that you

318
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,960
Such a fire

319
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,760
Here we go

320
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,920
You study and I'll go

321
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,520
Who

322
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,960
What are you guys doing here

323
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:39,920
Come on in

324
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,920
Classmate Ling Dong is also here

325
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,280
Little Bear, quickly apologize to your brother

326
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,760
Brother I'm sorry

327
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,760
That day I didn't mean to

328
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,280
Scratch your face

329
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,880
You didn't hit me either

330
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,640
It's because I'm so scared

331
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,560
Just cried

332
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,280
He kept crying that day

333
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,880
I don't know what's going on

334
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,480
I must have misunderstood Ling Dong

335
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,600
Excuse me

336
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,160
He's your child

337
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,520
It is your duty to educate him well

338
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,440
You can't indiscriminately

339
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,640
Come and wrongly accuse our children

340
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,800
Is it true

341
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes Yes Yes

342
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,120
Children are ignorant

343
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,360
I'm giving you trouble

344
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,960
You still have this money

345
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,600
Other

346
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,840
It's a little of our heart

347
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,720
We don't need this, thank you

348
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,640
Apologies I accepted

349
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,920
But I only take what I deserve for the money

350
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,960
Other thoughts are avoided

351
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:53,640
This

352
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,400
that

353
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,440
Then don't bother

354
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,280
Wait a minute, auntie

355
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,960
Can I ask

356
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,800
Why did you suddenly

357
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,560
Did you change your mind

358
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,880
This matter says

359
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,120
Little Bear

360
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,920
Why don't you tell your brother

361
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,360
It was uncle A, a passer-by, who asked me to come

362
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,960
He said if I didn't come

363
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,040
will

364
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,320
It will be notorious for thousands of years

365
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,280
We're leaving first

366
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,120
I'm sorry

367
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,800
I'll send you

368
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,440
Goodbye

369
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,000
What are you thinking

370
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,320
Nothing

371
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,960
Then I'll keep doing my homework

372
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:48,880
Go ahead

373
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,000
Young master is really a genius

374
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:58,680
Got it all

375
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,760
Don't you believe it

376
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,960
You went looking for the little bear

377
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,400
I have something to say to you

378
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,120
Come to the racing circuit

379
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,800
Mom, let me go out

380
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,160
Where are you going

381
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,360
Take care of something and I'll be back soon

382
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,680
How about it

383
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,200
Awesome!

384
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,800
Pretty fast

385
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,480
Required

386
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,520
Wearing red is running fast

387
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,400
Required

388
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,920
Lan Jinghui

389
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,800
I've always felt like

390
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,600
I'm the best

391
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Ah, then where do we put it

392
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,360
So powerful

393
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,640
Both of us are very good, too

394
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,600
Lan Jinghui

395
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,280
What's wrong

396
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,760
The little bear thing

397
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,440
What?

398
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,080
I said about the bear

399
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:50,960
What's wrong

400
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,600
Thank you

401
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,760
Actually, the main thing

402
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,640
No matter what

403
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,840
Completely understand

404
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,760
Do you think that's what happened

405
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,720
And

406
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,280
What's wrong

407
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,320
I was really impulsive that day

408
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,120
What?

409
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,320
I said that day

410
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,440
It's really impulsive

411
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,920
I can't hear you. What

412
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,880
I said that day

413
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,720
It's really impulsive

414
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,320
Impulsive, hear clearly

415
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,800
And

416
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,800
And what

417
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,280
What I'm saying is indeed

418
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,120
It's a little serious

419
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,280
So

420
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,160
Right

421
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,120
So what

422
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,600
It's okay

423
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,400
Finished talking

424
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:55,800
Goodbye

425
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,480
Talk a few words and leave

426
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,680
There is no sincerity at all

427
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,480
Who wrote it

428
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,400
Who wrote it

429
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,440
Who wrote this

430
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:36,840
Who

431
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,600
Don't know

432
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
When you come, you will have it

433
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,400
You're right, you don't know

434
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,160
Because this

435
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,840
Obviously, someone made a big mistake

436
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,120
In front of the whole class

437
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,480
So brazen to apologize

438
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,520
What a mistake do you think this is

439
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,480
What a hard person to mess with

440
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,800
There are only so many big characters

441
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,720
Are you overthinking

442
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,640
I just wrote it casually

443
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,600
Can't

444
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,920
Let me tell you

445
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
I know better than anyone else

446
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,080
This kind of mistake

447
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,360
The mood of writing a review

448
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,640
That kind of

449
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,000
After knowing that you have done something wrong

450
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,760
A feeling of regret

451
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,240
That kind of kindness is regarded as a donkey's liver and lungs

452
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,440
Chagrin afterwards

453
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
That kind of claws that scratch the heart

454
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Be ashamed to admit mistakes

455
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,760
complicated feelings of

456
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,080
Think of this

457
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,280
I'm really on behalf of that classmate

458
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,280
Feel sad

459
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,800
What did you do earlier

460
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,440
Now take this out

461
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,600
Lan Jinghui

462
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,160
You said it as if it was written to you

463
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,240
Do you know who wrote it

464
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:36,920
Don't know

465
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,240
I dare not even sign my name

466
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,160
How do I know who it is

467
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,880
How good do you think that handwriting is

468
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
It's a pity to wipe it

469
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,400
You read and write so well

470
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,200
Who do you think wrote it

471
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,440
You help me advise the staff

472
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,600
Staff Officer

473
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,840
Mid-term is coming soon

474
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,880
These are some key and difficult points

475
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,960
Give it to me tomorrow when you're done

476
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,480
Don't want to do it

477
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm in a bad mood

478
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,880
Hand weakness

479
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,360
What about your previous homework

480
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,800
I'm not like some people

481
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,880
So stingy

482
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,280
Lan Jinghui

483
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,160
I'll always be your second cousin

484
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,640
Who cares

485
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:48,800
Give me a pen

486
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,680
Low-energy atoms

487
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,720
Called ground state atoms

488
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,520
When the electrons of a ground-state atom

489
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,360
After absorbing energy

490
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,120
The electron will jump to a higher energy level

491
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,920
into an excited state

492
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,400
geometry

493
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,640
Number sequence

494
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,120
geometry

495
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Number sequence

496
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,920
It must be geometry

497
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,240
It must be a sequence of numbers

498
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,800
The big problem must be geometry

499
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,720
The big problem must be the sequence of numbers

500
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,880
Geometry bar

501
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,840
General mid-term exams

502
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,280
Are all geometric finales

503
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,360
Teacher Fang recently

504
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,040
I've been talking about sequences

505
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,520
I think it must be a sequence of numbers

506
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,800
I'm also sure it's a sequence

507
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,440
I bet on the sequence

508
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,640
I think it's geometry

509
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,160
It's geometry

510
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,200
geometry

511
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,960
Mengyu, what do you think

512
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,360
Geometry and Number Sequences

513
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,200
Are all my strong points

514
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,800
It doesn't matter what the test is

515
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
If I could talk to Sister Meng

516
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,360
An examination room would be nice

517
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,280
What are you thinking

518
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,280
How could I possibly

519
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,040
In the same examination room as you

520
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
The squad leader has already bet on a series of numbers

521
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,680
I change my ticket

522
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,400
I change it too, I change it too, I change it too

523
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,040
Number sequence Number sequence

524
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,240
What do you think? What do you bet on

525
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,160
What to bet on

526
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,080
You want to know

527
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,840
Think about it

528
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:32,880
geometry

529
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,760
geometry

530
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,560
geometry

531
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,720
geometry

532
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,160
The first place is to bet on Ling Dong

533
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,400
Are you still running numbers

534
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,720
What are you counting

535
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,280
Definitely geometry

536
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,520
geometry

537
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,560
It must be a sequence of numbers

538
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,560
It must be geometry

539
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,200
Small painting

540
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,240
This is specifically for you

541
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,240
Big elbow

542
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,880
I heard that I eat this before the exam

543
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,040
Can get high marks

544
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,880
So big

545
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,480
I'll take a bite

546
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,360
No way

547
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,160
This is specially for small paintings

548
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,880
But it's so big

549
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,800
I couldn't finish it by myself

550
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,920
You must finish eating

551
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,680
I still have to finish this

552
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,480
You can get full marks for eating eggs

553
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,960
People are all

554
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,840
Eat fried dough sticks and eggs together

555
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,440
You'll get zero for eating like this

556
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,080
Unfortunately, there is no koi in the canteen

557
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,640
I heard that eating koi fish before the exam can transport you

558
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,640
And it's very effective

559
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,440
Isn't koi an ornamental fish

560
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,440
Can still be eaten

561
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,080
Eat carp, stupid

562
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,640
My cousin was admitted to Beijing University last year

563
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,280
It's because

564
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,560
What about the carp that's been eating all year

565
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,520
Real or false

566
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,440
This theory

567
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,160
Without any scientific basis

568
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,800
Of course it's fake

569
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,320
Metaphysics cannot be trusted

570
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,600
Otherwise, why do you have to go to school

571
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,040
Is it right

572
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,240
Mom

573
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,960
Why is it full of fish today

574
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,840
I want to eat

575
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:01,680
Yeah, yeah

576
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,640
My precious grandson wants to eat it

577
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,800
Look at the thin one

578
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,720
Eat more

579
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,560
Today I want it all

580
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,200
Eat them up

581
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,320
Students, all cheer up

582
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,200
Prepare for the exam later

583
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,600
What's wrong Lan Jinghui

584
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,640
Teacher, I have a terrible stomachache

585
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,120
I, I want to go to the bathroom

586
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,920
It's almost an exam

587
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,920
I couldn't hold it any longer

588
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,040
Okay, go quickly, come back quickly

589
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,760
I'll be right back

590
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,040
Hurry up

591
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,640
Immediately, immediately

592
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,960
Students, get ready

593
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,160
Don't be too nervous

594
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,280
Play well

595
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,840
Okay, come on, classmates

596
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,920
Put your phone on silent mode

597
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,560
Put it on the podium

598
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,920
Hurry back to your seat and sit down

599
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,280
Come back

600
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,080
Come back

601
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,480
Hurry up and answer the questions

602
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,000
Good

603
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,800
Bi Peng

604
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,200
Stand up

605
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,560
Teacher

606
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,200
Stand up

607
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,400
Stand up

608
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,000
That's outrageous

609
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:55,840
You

610
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,360
And you

611
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,200
Hurry up, hand it in

612
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,280
Is there anything else you want to say

613
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,560
Teacher

614
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,280
Lan Jinghui didn't hand in his mobile phone either

615
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,200
Stop

616
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,160
You

617
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,920
What are you gonna do

618
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,800
I'll give you all my pocket money

619
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,440
No need

620
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,320
Brother, I have plenty of pocket money

621
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,240
You come here

622
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,640
Brother, I just want to ask you

623
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,320
A question

624
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,040
I heard my brother bullied you

625
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,560
That's the one surnamed Ling

626
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,000
I usually give you tutorial homework

627
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,360
Did he really hit you

628
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,880
Did he really hit you

629
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,320
It's useless

630
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,960
This trick doesn't work for me at all

631
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,080
Say

632
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,440
To be honest

633
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,600
Last chance

634
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,320
Did he hit you or not

635
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,120
It seems there is no

636
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,320
And the wounds on his face

637
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,080
What's going on

638
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,080
I scratched it with a ruler

639
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,360
Take this matter bravely

640
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,640
Is it hard to tell adults

641
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,160
After going back

642
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,480
Tell me what you told me

643
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,800
Tell your mother, too

644
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,080
Do you remember

645
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,840
If you didn't say

646
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,680
I know that

647
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,960
And you know

648
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:19,920
Go ahead

649
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,480
By the way

650
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,200
Later, if someone asks you

651
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,680
Who am I

652
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,720
You just tell him

653
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,480
My name is

654
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,440
Passerby A
