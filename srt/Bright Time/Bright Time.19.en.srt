[Bright Time]

[All answers got right. Yet lost the mind]
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,030
Chen Luyang, hand out the papers

4
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,590
Okay

5
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,070
I only printed

6
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,030
17 copies of papers

7
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,150
So two students can look at it together

8
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:57,670
Okay

9
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,070
Okay, students who have the papers

10
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,110
Let's look at this question

11
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,390
I don't know when they

12
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,870
started fighting

13
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,990
And what caused it this time

14
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,950
The world of boys is always strange

15
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,550
But I know

16
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,910
they'll definitely make up

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,990
It's just...

18
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,230
When

19
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,990
and how will it happen

20
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,870
Forgot to add salt

21
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,270
Ling Dong

22
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:48,910
Ling Dong

23
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,590
Ling Dong

24
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,910
Everyone, be quiet

25
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,110
Today we will be testing

26
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,070
women's 800 meters

27
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,030
and men's 1000 meters

28
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,110
Long jump, sit-ups

29
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:26,630
What's wrong?

30
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,550
What is it?

31
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,070
Be mentally prepared

32
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,910
The school attaches great importance

33
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,510
to this physical test

34
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:32,830
Lan Jinghui

35
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,590
Yes

36
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,990
You are in charge of guiding them

37
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,470
in their own training

38
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,270
Got it

39
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,350
And for those who's capable

40
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,350
You can help other students

41
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,790
Ling Dong, team up with Lan Jinghui

42
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:42,790
Warm up

43
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,270
Come on

44
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,470
Come on

45
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,590
Very good

46
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,430
Chen Luyang, hurry up

47
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,790
Come on, Xiaohua

48
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:46,870
Time's up

49
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:47,910
Free time

50
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,550
A few days ago, I went to the city

51
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,270
for a meeting

52
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,830
A major issue was raised

53
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,990
A part of high school students

54
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,110
didn't meet the physical fitness standards

55
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,390
If that's the case

56
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,030
even the physical education scores

57
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:11,870
will fail

58
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,270
So our principal

59
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,110
issued an order

60
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,590
This weekend, the whole grade 11

61
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,870
will have collective outdoor training

62
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,270
All the students in Grade 11

63
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,110
must participate

64
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,350
Take a look at this chart first

65
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,390
There are very few excellent scores

66
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,470
Thirty percent are failing

67
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,070
Okay, I know

68
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,750
Everyone, be quiet

69
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,150
I have something to tell you all

70
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,870
We'll have an outdoor activity

71
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,350
All students in the class must participate

72
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,870
Okay, stop

73
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,510
This outdoor activity

74
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,470
is mainly for physical training

75
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,110
It'll be a field training activity

76
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,990
in this weekend

77
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,430
Anyone who doesn't wanna go

78
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,390
Raise your hand

79
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,310
No one? Alright

80
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:02,750
None

81
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,550
Okay, then the whole class will participate

82
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,110
Class begins

83
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,990
Come on, students

84
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,390
After you get on the bus later,

85
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,910
find a seat for yourself and sit down

86
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,830
Don't play around on the bus

87
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,350
Got it?

88
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,190
Yes

89
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,950
Alright, get on the bus quickly

90
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,230
Everyone, pay attention

91
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,910
For this outdoor training activity,

92
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,710
the school has assigned an instructor

93
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,470
to each class to train us

94
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,990
This means that

95
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,070
this training activity

96
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,350
will be conducted

97
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,910
with semi-military management

98
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,710
This is our instructor

99
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,590
for Class 5, Instructor Wu

100
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,350
Let's welcome him

101
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,510
Hello, students

102
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,510
Hello, Instructor

103
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,950
Welcome to our training camp

104
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,190
I know

105
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,790
you're all princess

106
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,190
and even mama's boy at home

107
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,870
But once you're here,

108
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,750
you need to

109
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,510
leave all your bad habits behind

110
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,350
During the training,

111
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,630
phones, tablets, snacks,

112
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,230
and other entertainment devices

113
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:25,990
are not allowed

114
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,390
Please hand them over voluntarily

115
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,550
My snacks, beef jerky,

116
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,430
instant noodles, potato chips,

117
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,390
Goodbye, I'll miss you

118
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,150
Okay

119
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,750
The students who have packed up

120
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,510
Follow Instructor Wu to the dormitory

121
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,830
We'll take turns to guard at night

122
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,710
Remember,

123
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,830
Follow the instructor's orders strictly

124
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:12,990
Especially

125
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,030
Do not leave the camp without permission

126
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,030
Got it?

127
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,310
Yes

128
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:16,870
Let's go

129
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,670
Dismissed

130
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,550
I want this

131
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,550
I'm on top

132
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,150
Sit on your bed for a while

133
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,990
This bed is quite hard

134
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,590
Let me explain

135
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,430
Let's start with

136
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,230
the three-legged race

137
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,030
Now,

138
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,510
we'll divide you into groups

139
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,540
First row

140
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,190
Odd numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7

141
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,110
Take two steps forward

142
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,310
Boys at the back, fill in the gaps

143
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,550
Pay attention

144
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,030
Stand in a horizontal line, with taller and shorter students alternating

145
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,030
Form a straight line

146
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,550
Faster

147
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,830
Sister Meng, don't worry

148
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,110
I'm strong enough

149
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,110
If you can't run later,

150
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,550
I'll carry you

151
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,950
You're all divided into groups

152
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,790
Don't slow me down

153
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,030
The ground has strips for tying legs

154
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,110
Boys, help the girls tie them

155
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,710
Be quick

156
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,670
Yes

157
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,310
Should we tie our legs first?

158
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,110
Tied together and run

159
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,630
It's to train

160
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,190
team collaboration

161
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,390
So, during the competition,

162
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,270
besides paying attention to safety,

163
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,790
you must also pay attention to

164
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,710
your partner's rhythm and speed

165
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:17,790
Understood?

166
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,070
Yes

167
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,830
Understood?

168
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,150
Yes

169
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,830
Practice on your own

170
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,870
Don't rush

171
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,630
Let's follow the slogan and go

172
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,670
One, two, one, two

173
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,670
On my side

174
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,270
Left, right

175
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,830
Left

176
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,750
Be careful

177
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:41,710
Are you okay?

178
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,630
I'm fine

179
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,430
Are you okay?

180
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,990
I'm fine

181
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,190
One, two, three, go

182
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,590
One, two...

183
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,190
No, no, no

184
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,430
Slow down

185
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,030
Why are you

186
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,990
following his rhythm?

187
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,550
Didn't I ask you

188
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,630
to follow my rhythm?

189
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,430
Xiaohua

190
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,510
Tell Lan Jinghui

191
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,630
that he's walking too fast

192
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,070
Ling Dong said it's because you're walking too fast

193
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,230
Tell Ling Dong

194
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:03,870
It's actually him

195
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,870
walking too slowly

196
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,230
Lan Jinghui said it's you

197
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,350
walking too slowly

198
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,350
Tell him

199
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,430
this is a collective activity

200
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,030
He should consider

201
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,790
the feelings of others

202
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,070
Ling Dong said,

203
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,550
this is a collective activity

204
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,790
You should consider others

205
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,590
Tell him

206
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,110
Enough

207
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,230
What are you two doing?

208
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,150
Ask him

209
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,910
What's the matter?

210
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,510
Ask him

211
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,990
Is he worthy of me?

212
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,630
What do you mean by "worthy"?

213
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,430
Ask him what he means

214
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,470
What does he mean?

215
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,790
How dare he ask me what it means?

216
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,670
Why don't you ask

217
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,670
what he means by saying that?

218
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,190
Xiaohua

219
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,910
I think this is so meaningless

220
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,230
Just let him speak out

221
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,110
I can't say it

222
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,590
I'm not his prisoner

223
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,390
Why should I figure it out?

224
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,750
Why should I?

225
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,470
Stop

226
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,830
Let's take a break first

227
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,230
Then we'll continue practicing

228
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,710
This time, I'll definitely beat Ling Dong

229
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,470
Let's continue

230
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,950
Left, right

231
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,230
Left, right

232
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,350
Chen Luyang, you're too fast

233
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,390
We can't keep up

234
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,270
We're so slow

235
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,270
There's no way we can get first place

236
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:14,990
Let's try again

237
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,350
Start

238
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,710
Left, right

239
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,670
Left, right, left

240
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,110
Qingtian, are you okay?

241
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,030
It hurts

242
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,110
I'm sorry

243
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,670
I hurt you

244
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,230
I was too impatient just now

245
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,630
Is getting first place all you think about?

246
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,150
Always settling for second place

247
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,510
makes you crave first place even more

248
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,990
Fine then

249
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,550
I'll try harder

250
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,430
Even though I can't help you with grades

251
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,350
But maybe this time,

252
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,630
I can help you get first place

253
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,190
Give me your hand

254
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,230
What for?

255
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,590
Why are you giving me candy?

256
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,230
Because I'm gonna apply medicine for you

257
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,390
It might hurt a bit

258
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,390
Eat the candy

259
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,270
I'm sorry

260
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:28,910
I...

261
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,470
I sprayed too hard

262
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,710
Is this the way?

263
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,070
Left, right, left

264
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,550
Are you okay?

265
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,350
I'm fine

266
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,230
Let's take a break

267
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,550
Left, right

268
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,990
Left, right

269
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,390
Left, right

270
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,710
Left, right

271
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,590
Ms. Fang

272
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:16,750
Instructor Wu

273
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,190
What's wrong? Not feeling well?

274
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,070
No, I'm fine

275
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,110
Just sitting for too long makes my shoulders sore

276
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,550
Sore shoulders?

277
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,590
Let me massage them for you

278
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,550
I know how to do it

279
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,350
No need

280
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,110
It's okay, I can do it myself

281
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,430
Come on

282
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,670
Well, thank you

283
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,830
Don't be so polite with me

284
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,590
How's that?

285
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,590
It really works

286
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,630
Of course

287
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,790
In our special forces brigade

288
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,990
We have a specific class

289
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,150
called Rehabilitation Training

290
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,950
Really?

291
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,190
Do you usually attend that class?

292
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:40,990
Of course

293
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,390
We need relaxation and balance

294
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,390
Balancing work and rest

295
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,070
Here

296
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:45,630
Here

297
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,990
Yes

298
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,910
Yes

299
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,710
Your muscles are a bit tense

300
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:52,590
Really?

301
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,190
It's probably because of work

302
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,110
Excuse me

303
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,910
Instructor Wu

304
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,150
Look at these students

305
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,350
They've trained pretty well too

306
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,630
Should we let them rest for a while?

307
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,110
That's enough

308
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:16,910
Gather

309
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,110
That's it all for today's training

310
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,670
Great job, everyone

311
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,190
Dismissed

312
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,390
You worked hard too, Ms. Fang

313
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,150
It's you who worked hard

314
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:31,990
Instructor Wu

315
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,710
You've also had a long day

316
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,630
How about...

317
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,070
Just eat something

318
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,190
Together?

319
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,070
-Sure -Not for me

320
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,670
Mr. Zhao, are you not eating?

321
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,550
Instructor Wu...

322
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,190
Let's go eat first

323
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:43,630
Let's go

324
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:43,910
Go

325
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,750
We'll go first, Mr. Zhao

326
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,950
Instructor, teach me later

327
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,430
how to do the massage

328
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,190
No problem

329
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,270
You haven't slept yet, right?

330
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,790
Come on

331
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,350
Come on

332
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:14,510
Come on

333
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,790
Here

334
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,790
Candle

335
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,630
Get down

336
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,950
What are you doing?

337
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,110
Why aren't you getting down?

338
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,350
Don't light it on the bed

339
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,190
Let me tell you

340
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,990
This happened to me personally

341
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,670
In my aunt's hometown

342
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,430
A man cheated

343
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,070
He abandoned his wife

344
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,230
Then his wife

345
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,310
jumped off a building and died

346
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,150
And then

347
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,910
Strange things started happening

348
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,390
This man would always see

349
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,590
his wife's shadow in bedroom

350
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,190
It's just...

351
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,150
on the wall

352
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,590
Swaying...

353
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,470
Swaying...

354
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,390
He was so scared

355
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,350
So he sought help from a master

356
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,350
The master told him

357
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,070
As long as he hides under the bed...

358
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,430
He'll be fine

359
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,190
as long as he hides under the bed

360
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,350
Sure enough

361
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,670
The same thing happened

362
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,710
One night

363
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,190
While this man was sleeping,

364
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,430
he heard

365
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:44,310
a knocking sound on the roof

366
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,950
It must be his ex-wife

367
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,870
who came to find him

368
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,750
He quickly blew out the candle

369
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,030
and hid under the bed

370
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,180
Just a knocking sound

371
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,740
A face upside down

372
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,180
appeared in front of him

373
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,220
And whispered in his ear

374
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,960
Whispered...

375
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,660
Finally, gotcha

376
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,750
He was so scared

377
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,150
Are you alright, Brother Hui?

378
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,790
I'm going on duty

379
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,110
You're so timid, Brother Hui

380
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,070
I'll kill you

381
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,470
You really scared me

382
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,070
You scared me

383
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,950
Are you okay?

384
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,390
Why did you come out?

385
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:27,830
So what?

386
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,550
Do you still have to take care of me even if we're not at school?

387
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,350
I'm your uncle

388
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,870
Of course I have to take care of you

389
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,030
What if you're not?

390
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,270
What?

391
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,390
I said if we

392
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,310
have no relationship at all

393
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,350
would you still force me to study

394
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,110
and care about me like this

395
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,430
and be good to me?

396
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,990
I don't want that either

397
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,110
Who wants such a big nephew?

398
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,230
That's not what I'm asking

399
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,870
Then what are you asking?

400
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,190
Don't you know what I'm talking about?

401
00:19:59,470 --> 00:19:59,750
I...

402
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,030
Lan Jinghui

403
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,310
You know what?

404
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,150
I've been waiting for you

405
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,430
to say this for so many days

406
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,670
I really didn't know

407
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,510
what the hell you're talking about

408
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,630
Come on, explain it to me

409
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,510
What's wrong with you these days?

410
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,750
Why are you acting so strangely?

411
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,510
How did I offend you?

412
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,630
I just wanted to

413
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,470
help you improve your grades

414
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,470
and let you stay in China

415
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,750
and prove yourself to your father

416
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,350
Yes, that's right

417
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,350
You just wanted to prove to my dad

418
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:29,830
What?

419
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:30,590
I'm asking you

420
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,710
Did my dad give you a scholarship?

421
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,750
So you think

422
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,190
I care about you

423
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,070
because I got a scholarship from your dad

424
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,630
No

425
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,310
Then you...

426
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,190
So

427
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,350
So you

428
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,390
So tell me first

429
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,670
Did you or did you not receive

430
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,390
the scholarship?

431
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:55,590
I did

432
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,150
You did

433
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,830
So how could you be so smug?

434
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,030
What gives you the right

435
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,390
to act so superior?

436
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,030
How can't I?

437
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,750
I have confidence in my own abilities

438
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,950
I earned it

439
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,510
because I can

440
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,830
How can't I be confident?

441
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,070
But the whole purpose of this...

442
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,380
becomes impure

443
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,990
So what do you think my intentions are?

444
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,190
I thought

445
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,590
I thought you genuinely

446
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,430
considered me a friend

447
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,230
Then I...

448
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,350
Then I genuinely wanted to befriend you

449
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:28,790
Isn't that right?

450
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,310
But now it sounds like

451
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,910
my dad is giving you

452
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,710
an assignment

453
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,390
So what you did is like

454
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,270
a proposition essay

455
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,750
rather than speaking from the heart

456
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:39,990
I'm asking you

457
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,270
Why did I participate in the talent show?

458
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,630
Why?

459
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,190
Because that time

460
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,590
you assigned me a competition topic

461
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,070
and I answered it

462
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,950
At most,

463
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,590
it's an exchange of equal value

464
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,150
Okay, what about the changing room?

465
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,670
The changing room...

466
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,950
How did I manage to arrive on time?

467
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,590
And then I'll prove it for you later

468
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,070
Alright

469
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,510
That only proved that

470
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,590
you are a good person

471
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,390
Indeed, that's the case

472
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,430
Even so,

473
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:11,950
basketball game

474
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,030
Why should I participate in the basketball game?

475
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,230
Maybe...

476
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,150
Maybe you just wanna show off

477
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,310
Yes

478
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,070
That's right, I wanna show off

479
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,510
That's right, you got it

480
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,230
I have nothing more to say

481
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,630
No, no, no

482
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,150
It's not like that

483
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,990
No, I...

484
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,950
Let me think about it

485
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,870
Calm down first

486
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,750
Listen to me first

487
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:49,870
I...

488
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,990
Today, I just wanna

489
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,630
discuss this with you

490
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,110
I didn't mean to

491
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,190
seek any answers

492
00:22:59,630 --> 00:22:59,950
And also,

493
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,910
you're a bit strange, isn't it?

494
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,550
You get angry so easily

495
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,830
I just wanted to

496
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,310
talk to you about this

497
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,230
From...

498
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:12,750
Hey, you...

499
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,180
Don't come over

500
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,430
Ma Yiming, come out and stand guard

501
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,830
What are you doing? Jumping into the lake?

502
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,590
I'm just exercising

503
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,750
Brother Hui, I have to tell you

504
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,870
Ling Dong is really good to you

505
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,510
Just apologize to him

506
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,150
You also think I'm wrong?

507
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,790
Definitely

508
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,070
No, wait

509
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,310
You don't even know

510
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,790
what happened, and yet...

511
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,870
Yet you just think I'm wrong?

512
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,270
Look at you, so absent-minded

513
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,110
I don't even need to know what happened

514
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,190
That I know that you're wrong

515
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,310
Let me tell you, Brother Hui

516
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,310
Ling Dong is really good

517
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,950
Look at how he

518
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,670
helped you in the talent show

519
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,830
and the basketball game

520
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,790
Think about it with your heart

521
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,510
This is the stomach

522
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:19,590
The heart is here

523
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,430
You can't see the truth

524
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,150
with your eyes

525
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,430
You have to use your heart to feel it

526
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:28,790
No...

527
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,110
You come up with a wilderness training

528
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,710
Suddenly you become so philosophical

529
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,950
by the lake

530
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,390
Me, son of the lake

531
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,070
Ma Yiming

532
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,590
This is bad

533
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,870
Come on

534
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,110
A little bit smaller, give me some space

535
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,910
A little bit more

536
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,070
Ling Dong

537
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,070
Can you see if this is okay?

538
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,030
Or should it be higher?

539
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,110
It's fine, is there enough gap?

540
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,390
What's the situation?

541
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,670
Just help me say something good

542
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,990
Shall we start?

543
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,070
Sure, let's begin

544
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,590
No, wait

545
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,190
Okay

546
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,070
Come on

547
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,270
You shout the slogan

548
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:33,590
Me?

549
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,350
You shout the slogan

550
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,590
This side is one

551
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,590
This side is two

552
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,070
No problem

553
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:38,710
Come on

554
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,430
One

555
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,310
One

556
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:41,710
Two

557
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,790
Slow down

558
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,190
I'll just change it

559
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:45,990
I walked too fast

560
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,150
I'm sorry

561
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,430
Then how about this?

562
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,510
Well, Ling Dong

563
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,870
How about you shout the slogan?

564
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,030
And we'll follow your rhythm

565
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,710
What do you think?

566
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,190
Xiaohua

567
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,430
Then I'll shout

568
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,110
Okay

569
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,910
Come, get ready

570
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,190
One, two

571
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,550
One, two

572
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,910
Slow down

573
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,750
Lan Jinghui, what's wrong with you?

574
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,350
Can you even do it?

575
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,110
I...

576
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,550
I really...

577
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,190
It's fine

578
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,710
Let's not practice

579
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,150
No, no, no...

580
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,310
No, no, no

581
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,430
I'm begging you

582
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,430
How about this?

583
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,510
Let's not practice for now

584
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,630
Neither of us will practice

585
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,830
We'll continue practicing

586
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,390
whenever you want

587
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,790
Rest and practice, okay?

588
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,150
And it's really hot now

589
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:27,430
Xiaohua

590
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,870
Actually, I think it works

591
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,910
Just let two of us coordinate first

592
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:32,950
No, no, no

593
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,790
Listen to me

594
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,870
We're practicing

595
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,630
three-legged race

596
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,630
So, this's just...

597
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,030
Move your hand

598
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,190
Move your hand

599
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,390
Move your hand

600
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,870
Okay

601
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:52,430
Start

602
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,790
No, no, no, I...

603
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,550
Wait a moment

604
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,510
I just came over

605
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,150
I'm not ready yet

606
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,070
Just give me five seconds

607
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,510
Are you ready?

608
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,310
Wait

609
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,750
Wait a moment

610
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,550
It's okay, come on

611
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:00,390
Okay

612
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,630
Get ready

613
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,270
One

614
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,030
One

615
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,830
Two

616
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:04,430
Two

617
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,430
Very good

618
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,510
Two

619
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,190
Right, one, two

620
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,310
One, two

621
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,110
One cannot make mistakes

622
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,110
How pitiful those who make mistakes are

623
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,230
How humble and miserable

624
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,590
And even feeling uneasy

625
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,670
Be in a state of chaos

626
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,550
Who can understand me?

627
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,110
What do you want?

628
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,150
I...

629
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,150
I don't want anything

630
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,070
I just want a drumstick

631
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:35,950
Just a drumstick

632
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,550
Yes

633
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,350
Is that enough?

634
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:38,950
Enough

635
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,310
What a coincidence

636
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,390
You're hungry too

637
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,470
We're hungry at the same time

638
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,230
What are you eating?

639
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,470
Only drumsticks are missing, huh

640
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,310
I happen to have too many drumsticks

641
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:00,910
Let me get one for you

642
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,350
No need

643
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,510
Don't, you have to eat

644
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,350
You're the backbone of our team

645
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,310
You need to replenish

646
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,350
this high-quality protein

647
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,350
Lan Jinghui

648
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,590
You're bothering me like this

649
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,590
Just to know the answer?

650
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,270
Okay, I'll tell you now

651
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:21,630
No

652
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,030
I'll tell you now

653
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,670
Don't tell me

654
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,590
No need, really

655
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,550
There must be a reason and a purpose

656
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,070
for you to do this

657
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,510
Right?

658
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,070
Based on our relationship

659
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,270
Can others easily sow discord?

660
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:32,990
No

661
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,590
You think I approached you

662
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,230
just for the scholarship

663
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,630
No, definitely not

664
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:37,870
Listen to me

665
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,870
Your words make me feel...

666
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,510
You must be...

667
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,270
What do you think of me?

668
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,950
What do you think of yourself?

669
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,590
Then what kind of person are you?

670
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,390
What do you think of me?

671
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:58,710
A bit dull

672
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,670
Yes, that's right, very accurate

673
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:03,990
My grandma often says that to me too

674
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,350
Dull-headed

675
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,270
Not dull

676
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,070
I think you're silly

677
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,310
Yes, silly

678
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,630
Very silly

679
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,030
Silly boy

680
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,550
Ask them, they often say that

681
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,670
Silly isn't quite accurate

682
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,430
I think it should be...

683
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,630
Carefree

684
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,190
Well

685
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,070
I...

686
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,070
I'm carefree, dull-headed

687
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,190
Silly and clueless

688
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,430
What you said must be true

689
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:30,870
Okay?

690
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,030
Speak a little louder?

691
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:40,950
No, there isn't

692
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,390
This is your sincerity, huh

693
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,350
I am sincere

694
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,750
If you're sincere, say it louder

695
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,190
I...

696
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,830
Say what I just said again

697
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,270
No, it's just...

698
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,150
It's just...

699
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:52,710
You dare not do it?

700
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,150
No

701
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,350
You just can't say it, huh

702
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,470
Alright, eat it yourself

703
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,190
Bye

704
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,390
Wait...

705
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,670
Too difficult

706
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,070
Too difficult

707
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,790
This question from Ling Dong

708
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,030
is really too difficult
