00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,060
[Bright Time]

2
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,160
[We won't be apart since we've seen the first snowflakes together]
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,400
Here you are

4
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,320
I found a good book

5
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,720
It's called "Border Town"

6
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,120
It's the commemorative edition

7
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,280
Do you want me to give you a copy?

8
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,400
You can follow along with it

9
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,720
We can see it later

10
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,400
Thirty-day sprint during winter break

11
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,160
Is that necessary?

12
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,080
Here you go

13
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,240
Can't you take it?

14
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,160
Basic exercises

15
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,400
You still need to do them

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,200
It's so thick

17
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,440
And it's called basic exercises?

18
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,080
I think you have a

19
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
misunderstanding of "thick"

20
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,200
It's so heavy

21
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,520
Alright

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,120
These should be enough for now

23
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,800
Enough for now

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,800
You top students

25
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,720
For the sake of getting first place

26
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,200
You've suffered a lot

27
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,880
that we ordinary people can't bear

28
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
What are you thinking?

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,840
This is for you

30
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,960
What's wrong?

31
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,880
Do you think slogans

32
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,960
are just for show?

33
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
To improve your college entrance exam scores

34
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,440
I'll give you extra lessons

35
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,520
But winter break just started

36
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,400
But didn't you just say

37
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,600
that you wanna go to the PKU?

38
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,320
What? Or do you wanna go abroad?

39
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,520
No, I don't

40
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,120
Then that's settled

41
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,040
Work hard,  nephew

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,040
Can't you just let me go?

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,760
Take it step by step

44
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,840
Start with...

45
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,640
One-third. Is that okay?

46
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,600
Just pay the textbooks first

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,360
By the way

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,720
This book, "Border Town," is really good

49
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,160
Bring me a copy

50
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,360
Do you like it?

51
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,280
Xiaohua

52
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,240
Why are you here?

53
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,240
We...

54
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,720
Lan Jinghui came to thank you

55
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,880
Thank me?

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,880
Thank you

57
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
for helping him

58
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,720
You also helped

59
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,240
I wasn't the only one

60
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,880
Alright, let's not argue anymore

61
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,880
Well

62
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,520
Today, I mainly came

63
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,680
to express my gratitude

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,400
And to give you a special gift

65
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,720
Such good news

66
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,640
What kind of gift?

67
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Must-do questions

68
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,200
I don't want them

69
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:48,880
Disciple

70
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,800
This is full of knowledge

71
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,440
New Year's is coming soon

72
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,080
It's the most precious New Year gift

73
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,640
I can only give you

74
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,680
I won't accept gifts this year

75
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,840
I...

76
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,160
I can't afford such an expensive gift

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,000
Starting tomorrow

78
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,600
Let's just enjoy ourselves

79
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,360
in the sea of knowledge together, shall we?

80
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,580
Let's row our boats

81
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,600
Get to the point

82
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,240
Starting tomorrow

83
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,800
come to my house for tutoring together

84
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,720
Tutor at your place?

85
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,200
The three of us?

86
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:16,800
That's right

87
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,960
The previous study group

88
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,280
has been fully validated

89
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,680
that studying together

90
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,400
will be more efficient

91
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,400
Of course

92
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,480
If you don't want it,

93
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,400
we won't force you

94
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
No, it's okay

95
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,120
Not forcing at all

96
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm willing

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,440
Then

98
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,000
You agreed?

99
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,960
Friends forever

100
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,080
Whoever studies is the dog

101
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,640
Study together, be dogs together

102
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,240
Woof

103
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,160
So childish

104
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,120
Didn't you make me say that?

105
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,200
Then that's settled

106
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
Let's work hard together

107
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,400
and strive for a good university

108
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,560
Okay

109
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,080
Three

110
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:54,920
Two

111
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,280
One

112
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,800
Let's get it

113
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,440
Coming

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,200
Aren't you Ling Dong?

115
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,800
Hello, Grandma

116
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,880
Looking for Xiaohui?

117
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,440
We agreed to study together here

118
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,640
Hello, Grandma. I'm Xiao Xiaohua

119
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,520
Lan Jinghui's classmate

120
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,880
Xiaohua, come in quickly

121
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,240
Xiaohui hasn't woken up yet

122
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,480
Grandma, what's for breakfast today?

123
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,400
Why are you here?

124
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,960
Didn't you invite us

125
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,520
to study together here?

126
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,480
Didn't you forget?

127
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,480
Where are you going?

128
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,840
To change clothes

129
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,720
Don't change

130
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,120
This outfit suits you

131
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,840
Shut up

132
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay, not bad. You've improved

133
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,640
I actually got them all right

134
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,400
What about me?

135
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,720
Why are there so many wrong answers?

136
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,560
Take a look for yourself

137
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,640
Those basic questions

138
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,520
I've explained them to you twice already

139
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,040
Why can Xiao Xiaohua get them right

140
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,840
But you can't?

141
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,760
Haven't you heard that saying?

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,080
There are no bad students

143
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
Only teachers who can't teach

144
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,200
So it must be your fault

145
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,360
But it's Ling Dong who taught us the same

146
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,200
So why can I get them all right?

147
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,960
Xiao Xiaohua

148
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,040
You're really

149
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,840
exatcly the same as Ling Dong

150
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,400
Just you wait

151
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,760
Half-time break, huh?

152
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,120
I've already told you

153
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,200
the same types of questions before

154
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,360
You did

155
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,720
Alright, look at this question

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,880
The question is to choose the correct

157
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,560
option

158
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,800
I chose option C

159
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,560
Tell me why it's correct

160
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,720
There's no reason

161
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,000
ABCD is...

162
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,800
Come on, tell me

163
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,560
Why is it like this?

164
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,560
Choose the shortest of the three long ones

165
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,440
Sorry

166
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,640
Get me a towel

167
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:55,880
Follow me

168
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,200
What are you doing?

169
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,320
Is it uncomfortable with wet pants?

170
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,960
Put this on

171
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,880
It's much better now

172
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,280
I won't wear this

173
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,760
Don't move

174
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,480
I found that this outfit

175
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,400
suits you well

176
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,600
It really suits you

177
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,760
But...

178
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,760
I feel like something is missing

179
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,800
It's just a little bit

180
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,360
Perfect

181
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,520
I'll go get you a new pair of pants

182
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,320
And I'll wash your pants

183
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,920
You must keep this secret for me

184
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,800
Do not tell anyone else

185
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,880
Let's pinky swear

186
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,040
What are you looking at?

187
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,600
Is this when you were a child?

188
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,280
Come on

189
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,480
I was cute

190
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,760
and charming as a child, okay?

191
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,920
Yes

192
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,800
You're almost the same as now

193
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,280
Childish Lan

194
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,440
Childish Lan? Are you mature?

195
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,240
Hurry up and change

196
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,440
I'll wait downstairs for you

197
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,280
Let's play together

198
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,840
He doesn't speak at all

199
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,320
We won't play with him

200
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,200
He's a little monster

201
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,320
Little monster, I'll play with you

202
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,960
I'm the clownfish

203
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,920
I'm the clownfish

204
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,960
I'm the clownfish

205
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,640
I'm the clownfish

206
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,080
I'm the clownfish

207
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,480
I'm the clownfish

208
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,280
Little monster, what's wrong?

209
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,160
His Rubik's Cube is missing

210
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,880
Don't be sad. I'll help you find it

211
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,440
Little monster, I found it

212
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:47,800
Here

213
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,080
Thank you, clownfish

214
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,720
So you're the clownfish

215
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,200
Look at this

216
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,280
What is it?

217
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,120
It says

218
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,240
this year in our Xiangbei City

219
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,000
there will be a grand

220
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
fireworks show on New Year's Eve

221
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,640
I've never seen

222
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,640
such a grand fireworks show

223
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,080
in my whole life

224
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,920
Do you wanna go?

225
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,960
I'll go with you

226
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,840
And Ling Dong

227
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,200
Of course I wanna go

228
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,360
But can we go out

229
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,440
on New Year's Eve?

230
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,480
Why not?

231
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,640
What's wrong with New Year's Eve?

232
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,680
Of course we can

233
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,800
We can just say we'll study together

234
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,760
Can't we?

235
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,120
I'm fine with it

236
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,760
Then...

237
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,640
What about you?

238
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,760
If you really can't

239
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,720
I'll go find Auntie

240
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,760
I'll beg her

241
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,400
Forget it

242
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,760
You're just making things worse

243
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,080
I'm taking the lead here

244
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,840
Alright, I'll talk to my mom

245
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,200
We'll spend the New Year at your place

246
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,080
Okay

247
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,360
So it's settled then

248
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:25,960
New Year's Eve

249
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,520
Yeah

250
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,320
Fireworks show

251
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:27,840
Yeah

252
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,640
We'll see together

253
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,200
Okay

254
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,120
Yeah!

255
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,720
Finish the paper first

256
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,080
Okay

257
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,200
Hurry and finish it

258
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,200
Doudou

259
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,040
I'm sorry

260
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,560
I won't be able to accompany you

261
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,520
for New Year's Eve this year

262
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,240
Look at you

263
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,720
You seem to be so happy

264
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,240
You're not even sorry

265
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,840
Just the thought of spending time with Ling Dong

266
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,480
makes me happy

267
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,120
Right?

268
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,360
Hey

269
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,120
The first snow is coming soon

270
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,240
You've missed

271
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,360
so many opportunities before

272
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,120
Make sure to seize it this time

273
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,320
Not many days we'll go back

274
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,480
Why do you have so many things?

275
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,520
Finally, you get to go back

276
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,000
It's okay to bring more

277
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:14,840
Xiaohui

278
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,680
Have you packed your things?

279
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,160
Grandma, I won't be going back

280
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,320
with you guys for the New Year this year

281
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,120
What are you saying?

282
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,920
What are you up to do?

283
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,360
Grandma, this year

284
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,120
I made plans with Ling Dong

285
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,760
for them to come to our house for tutoring

286
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,040
I've already talked to him

287
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,320
The upcoming assignments are demanding

288
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,160
We have to work against the time

289
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,000
Work against the time, indeed

290
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,560
Work against the time playing games

291
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,360
I'm just taking a break

292
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,320
To enjoy a bit

293
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,840
a little time before they arrive

294
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,880
Alright

295
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,960
You talk a big game

296
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,040
I know you

297
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,520
You'll just mess things up

298
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,080
without us

299
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,360
Pack your bags quickly

300
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,160
Come back with us

301
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,600
So if you don't understand

302
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,840
I don't wanna argue with you

303
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,240
During the holiday

304
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,080
I don't wanna argue with you

305
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,320
I...

306
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,120
Xiaohui just got into the studying

307
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,640
We should encourage him

308
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,360
Xiaohui

309
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,240
Study well with your uncle

310
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,160
Call me if there's anything

311
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,000
Alright, grandma

312
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,680
I have one more bag

313
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,960
I can't find it

314
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,960
Go and bring it for me

315
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,400
Where is it?

316
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,120
Over there

317
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,440
The one next to the bed

318
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,440
That one

319
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,280
The next to the coffee table

320
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,440
Don't argue with your dad

321
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,240
Be good, okay?

322
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,080
It's the New Year's day

323
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,040
And we're still doing homework

324
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,440
Isn't that a bit mean?

325
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,240
Who promised his Grandma

326
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,960
that you would study hard

327
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,080
So, what's our plan for tonight?

328
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,320
Let's go traditional

329
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,760
Have hot pot and see fireworks

330
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,640
Should we make dumplings too?

331
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,040
We have to eat dumplings for the New Year

332
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,400
Sure, of course

333
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,040
You'll handle the wrapping, I'll handle the eating

334
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,800
Clear division of labor

335
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,080
You're dreaming

336
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,120
What do you mean, I'm dreaming?

337
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,240
It's my mom. I need to take a call

338
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,040
Go ahead

339
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll take it

340
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,400
Go quickly

341
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,360
It's the New Year's day

342
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,000
Can't we take a day off?

343
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,840
Does your eyes not hurt from doing questions every day?

344
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,320
What does doing questions have to do

345
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
with celebrating the New Year?

346
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:20,800
Yes

347
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,880
No necessary connection

348
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,320
But during the New Year's Eve

349
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,320
we should enjoy it

350
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,640
I think doing questions is enjoyable

351
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,440
Okay then

352
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,120
What I consider enjoyable

353
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,880
is celebrating with you guys

354
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,520
but not this kind of question

355
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,280
No

356
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,280
We've already agreed

357
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,520
But, Mom

358
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,760
Mom

359
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,400
What's wrong?

360
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,600
My mom wants me to go home

361
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,720
No, why do you have to go home?

362
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,960
Didn't you already talk to your mom?

363
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,320
Yes, we did

364
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,440
But she suddenly changed her mind

365
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,440
She said I have to go home for the New Year's Eve dinner

366
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,000
My mom also messaged me

367
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,840
She said I should come home

368
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:28,880
No

369
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,040
You don't have to worry about me

370
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,000
Just go back

371
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,840
Then...

372
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,880
What about you?

373
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:40,720
What?

374
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,240
What will I do?

375
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,680
You don't have to worry about me

376
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:44,960
Why...

377
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,120
Why do you have to worry about me?

378
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,440
I've been through everything

379
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,000
Right?

380
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,480
And I'm used to

381
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,480
spending the New Year alone

382
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,280
I'm okay with it

383
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,320
Besides

384
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,080
My grandma and dad already

385
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,360
left a lot of things for me

386
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,680
I can't finish eating them alone

387
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,640
And I have a lot of

388
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,880
entertainment at home

389
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,240
Right?

390
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,520
Don't worry about me

391
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,560
Seriously, don't worry about me

392
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,960
Stop caring about me, really

393
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,040
I mean it

394
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,720
Can you stop looking at me?

395
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,080
Can we start doing questions, okay?

396
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,600
Finish the questions early and go home early

397
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,160
Okay

398
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,080
The dumplings will be ready soon

399
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Do not eat meat

400
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,080
Eat less, Datu

401
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,040
Mom, I'm hungry

402
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,080
Okay, sweetheart

403
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,680
Ready soon

404
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,200
Hurry up

405
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,960
Eat something else first

406
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,560
Wait a moment

407
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
It'll be ready soon

408
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,880
The dumplings are almost ready

409
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,320
Hurry up

410
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,880
Here come the dumplings

411
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,280
Here come the fish

412
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,000
Come on, there's a fish

413
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,640
Wish us a lucky year

414
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,680
You've worked hard

415
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,080
It's nothing

416
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,000
You're the lucky one

417
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,640
Come on

418
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,720
Pour auntie Ma some

419
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,160
Auntie Ma

420
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,520
Okay

421
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,440
Thank you

422
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,920
You're too happy to be confused

423
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,640
You're too polite

424
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,280
Come on

425
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,880
Alright

426
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,560
Here, Mom

427
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,880
Here, pour some for me

428
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,000
Happy New Year

429
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,840
Happy New Year

430
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,960
I'm hungry

431
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,880
Let's get something to eat

432
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,800
Hey

433
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,200
Xiaohui

434
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,600
What are you doing?

435
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,400
What delicious food are you making?

436
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,640
Grandma

437
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,640
We're having hot pot

438
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,520
And Ling Dong and Xiao Xiaohua

439
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
can really eat

440
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,800
If I eat slowly,

441
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,480
I won't be able to get any meat

442
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,560
Right, I won't talk to you anymore

443
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,200
The meat needs to be cooked

444
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,800
If I don't grab it now,

445
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,880
I won't be able to get any

446
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,640
Alright

447
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,360
Eat more

448
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,520
Right

449
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,480
Send my regards to them

450
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,720
Wish them a happy New Year

451
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,360
Thank you, Grandma. Bye

452
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,680
Happy New Year, Grandma

453
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,920
Happy New Year

454
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,000
Look what we brought for you

455
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,680
What's wrong?

456
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,720
Are you gonna cry?

457
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,120
Are you so moved that you wanna cry?

458
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,440
Don't let the tears fall

459
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:30,920
No, I don't

460
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,400
Mind your own business

461
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,160
Happy New Year

462
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,800
Hey

463
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,680
It's almost time for the first snow

464
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,720
You've missed it before

465
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,840
so many times

466
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,600
This time, you must seize it

467
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,480
Ling Dong

468
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
I wanna tell you something

469
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,400
I heard

470
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,840
that during the first snow

471
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,280
it's the most suitable...

472
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,760
the most suitable

473
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,680
What do you wanna tell me?

474
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,160
I wanna tell you...

475
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Happy New Year

476
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,160
Happy New Year

477
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,280
Happy New Year

478
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,560
Happy New Year

479
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,360
Happy New Year

480
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,480
Happy New Year

481
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,800
Happy New Year

482
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,280
There're not many

483
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,040
beauties in this world

484
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,400
The fireworks tonight

485
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,080
And you smiling under the fireworks

486
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,920
There are some words

487
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,760
that I don't have the courage to say now

488
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,720
But...

489
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,160
This New Year's night when I am 17

490
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,280
I think I'll remember it forever

491
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,720
So cool

492
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,720
Who else can be so cool?

493
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,480
I envy him so much

494
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,880
I envy myself

495
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,000
Xiaohuihui

496
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,720
What are you doing?

497
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,200
Being self-absorbed, huh

498
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,040
Is this your classmate's book?

499
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,240
It fell onto the dining table

500
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,640
Yes, Xiao Xiaohua, my classmate

501
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,360
Remember to

502
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,440
give it to her tomorrow

503
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,080
Okay, don't worry, Grandma

504
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,600
Have some fruit

505
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,600
Okay

506
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,560
The first day of school

507
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,240
Ling Dong talked to me

508
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,040
Although...

509
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,400
it was a bit awkward

510
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,160
I was there that day too

511
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,200
Why didn't she draw me?

512
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,720
If Ling Dong knew

513
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,240
the meaning of the starry sky

514
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,200
The meaning of the starry sky...

515
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,280
Ling Dong

516
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,200
The meaning of the starry sky

517
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,360
I'm willing to be a supporting role

518
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,920
continuing to love you secretly from everyone

519
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,880
I bring the stars of the sky to give you

520
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,400
But I still feel that the stars are not enough

521
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,040
What's going on?

522
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,240
Xiaohua is a bit unconventional

523
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,320
Does she like Ling Dong?

524
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,760
Come over after class to do the questions

525
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,480
Just not this feel
