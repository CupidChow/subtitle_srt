[Misunderstanding]
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,040
All on the front line

4
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,880
At this moment, we must

5
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
express our gratitude to those

6
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,400
who are still working

7
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,720
in various industries...

8
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,680
Dongdong, you're back!

9
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,240
Hello, Auntie

10
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,440
Happy New Year

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,600
Happy New Year

12
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,040
Auntie

13
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,640
You look familiar

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,000
You seem to be very kind

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,040
Look at how well your classmates speak

16
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,200
Our meeting is fate

17
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, I feel like I've seen you somewhere

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,120
Really?

19
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,920
Oh, right, Dongdong

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,200
Just have a seat here

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,720
Have some fruit and melon seeds

22
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,520
I'll cook some dumplings for you

23
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,080
No need

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
I just ate with him

25
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,120
Is that so?

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,840
We also ate dumplings

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,920
It's okay, Mom. I'm hungry. I'll eat

28
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,720
Have some fruit or something

29
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,360
Okay

30
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,840
Take care of your classmate

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,560
Thank you, Auntie

32
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,360
Change your shoes

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,800
Auntie's dumplings are still the best

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,880
They're not the same

35
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,360
as the ones I make

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,840
It tastes better

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,920
Dongdong

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,240
You two go ahead and eat

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,920
After you finish, go take a shower

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,520
Today is New Year's Eve

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,400
Tomorrow is New Year's Day

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,560
You need to be clean

43
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Auntie, I won't take a shower

44
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,880
I didn't bring my pajamas

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,640
What's the big deal?

46
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,120
Just wear Dongdong's

47
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
No, Mom, I won't let him wear mine

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,880
You silly child

49
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,840
Isn't he your good friend?

50
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,960
Let him wear it

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,240
Thank you, Auntie

52
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,320
Mom

53
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
Wait for me

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,760
Let me lay the table

55
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,400
It's okay, I'll do it

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,760
I'll sleep on the sofa tonight

57
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,080
That won't do

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,160
You're a guest

59
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
You can't sleep on the sofa

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,200
It's okay

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,200
Then,

62
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,840
you two can sleep on the bed

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,200
The bed is quite big

64
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,320
Is that okay?

65
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,440
Yes, that's settled

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,200
Go sleep on the bed. Don't bother with the sofa

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,080
Eat more, Xiaohui

68
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,400
Okay

69
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,720
How's your sleep stance?

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
Very nice, of course

71
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,160
I never crowd when I sleep

72
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,320
Do you snore?

73
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,640
I, Lan Jinghui,

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,120
never snore when I sleep

75
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,320
It's cold

76
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,320
Xiaohui

77
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,240
Come quickly

78
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,320
Hurry and eat

79
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
The dishes will get cold

80
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,440
Thank you, Auntie

81
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,120
This is for you

82
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,080
This is too sumptuous

83
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,040
This fish

84
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,360
It was made by Dongdong

85
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,680
He's better at cooking than me

86
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,280
Try it

87
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,760
Did you make it?

88
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,840
What's wrong?

89
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
It's actually quite delicious

90
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,040
Of course

91
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,720
At least you can be a chef

92
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,520
You won't starve

93
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,600
Of course

94
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,640
Auntie

95
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
You and Ling Dong both cook

96
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,040
I definitely can't eat for free

97
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,440
I'll wash the dishes

98
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,400
No, you're a guest

99
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,360
Eat more of this fish

100
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,480
It's good for your brain

101
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,840
For studying

102
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,400
It's important to have enough nutrition

103
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,320
Eat more

104
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,920
You should also eat more

105
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,000
By the way, not only do you have a poor brain,

106
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,800
but your feet also smell

107
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,480
Rumor

108
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,400
It's completely nonsense

109
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,200
It's fine to say that I'm not clever

110
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,720
But smelly feet

111
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,720
is entirely your own problem

112
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
I'm just telling the truth

113
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Don't mind him. Auntie, eat more vegetables

114
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,840
Xiaohui

115
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,240
Is that torn?

116
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,240
Under your elbow

117
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,600
Where?

118
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Pull it back. Do you see it?

119
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,280
Look, right?

120
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,320
Yes, I see it

121
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,280
It's okay

122
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,760
Maybe it got scratched

123
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,960
when I played basketball the other day

124
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,920
I didn't notice it

125
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,240
I'll throw it away

126
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,840
and buy a new one

127
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,760
Don't...

128
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,440
After we finish eating,

129
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,760
I'll sew it for you

130
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,880
Let's eat first

131
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,000
Eat more

132
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,360
Eat more

133
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,880
Dongdong, you should eat more too

134
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,200
Okay

135
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,360
If you like it,

136
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,720
come to our house often in the future

137
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,080
It's okay

138
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,520
Wait

139
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,680
Don't move

140
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,760
Can you hear the sound of the sea?

141
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,080
Yes, I can hear the echoes of wisdom

142
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,600
Shouldn't it be all water?

143
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,480
How is that possible?

144
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,400
I know the water you're talking about

145
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,360
The ocean of knowledge

146
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,960
You won't see it at all

147
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,240
Mom, have one

148
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,160
Xiaohui

149
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,200
Your clothes are too thin

150
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
But you can't just focus on looks

151
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,480
It's important to stay warm too

152
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,960
No, Auntie, I...

153
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,880
I'm actually quite warm wearing it

154
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,520
I'm not cold at all

155
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,240
That's true

156
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,640
You young guys have strong firepower

157
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,560
Dongdong didn't like the clothes I bought for him

158
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,000
He thought it was too warm

159
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,120
I like it

160
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,840
Okay

161
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,160
The thermal underwear

162
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,720
I bought for you last time

163
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,960
you didn't wear it

164
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,240
I was afraid you would be cold

165
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
I specifically bought

166
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,360
the thicker version for you

167
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,520
Are you asleep?

168
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,000
I can't sleep

169
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,880
If you can't sleep, ount sheep

170
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,440
My grandmother is coming back tomorrow

171
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,240
Thank God

172
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,240
You're finally leaving

173
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,000
If you don't leave

174
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,960
I'll be mentally weak

175
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,720
How can you say like that?

176
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,680
That's too much

177
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,160
Weren't you complaining about the hot water

178
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,240
and hard bed in my house?

179
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,080
Leave if you want

180
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,040
But speaking of it

181
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,600
I still quite like

182
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,640
staying in your house

183
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,240
It feels like a home

184
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,280
Good night

185
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,600
My precious grandson

186
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,840
Miss me?

187
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,800
Yes

188
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,160
I miss you so much

189
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,240
Your father has some business at the company

190
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,000
He went on a business trip abroad

191
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,320
He left early this morning

192
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,040
Who cares about him?

193
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,080
Come on, let's go inside

194
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,720
Let's go, Grandma

195
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,880
I'll take it

196
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,720
It's alright

197
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,680
Come on, let's go

198
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,600
You've lost weight

199
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,400
No, I haven't

200
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,840
I've been eating well at someone else's house

201
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,480
You definitely haven't been eating properly

202
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,160
I really have been eating

203
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,240
My classmate made it for me

204
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,680
Look, it's true

205
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,520
Brother Hui

206
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,040
Brother Hui

207
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,720
Ma Yiming

208
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,080
Do you miss me?

209
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,600
Come on, just stop it

210
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,120
Brother Hui

211
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,480
You've changed

212
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,120
What's wrong?

213
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,560
You don't love me anymore?

214
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,800
Go away

215
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,560
Brother Hui

216
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,560
Ling Dong

217
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,040
I brought breakfast for you

218
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,240
Try it, is it delicious?

219
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:45,920
Thank you

220
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,400
How is it? Is it delicious?

221
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,600
It's delicious

222
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,960
What do you wanna eat tomorrow?

223
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,680
I'll bring it for you

224
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
No need, I can buy it myself

225
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,800
It's fine, I'll buy it for you

226
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,560
There are breakfast shops downstairs

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,400
I see

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,680
Thank you

229
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,360
By the way

230
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,160
Did you finish the assignments?

231
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,080
I finished it

232
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,560
I saw it yesterday

233
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,960
There are two questions that are prone to mistakes

234
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
Let me take a look later

235
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,480
Great

236
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,200
Sometimes

237
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,560
helping others

238
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,920
is also a virtue

239
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,360
What did you say?

240
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,880
I didn't even understand

241
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,360
You'll know when you grow up

242
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,760
Brother Hui

243
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,480
Why are you bullying your disciple again?

244
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,120
How is this bullying?

245
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,560
If she wasn't my disciple,

246
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,520
would I go this far?

247
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,240
Let's go play basketball

248
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,160
You go first

249
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,360
Keke

250
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,400
Have you watched the newly released movie?

251
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,360
No, is it good?

252
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,920
It's really good

253
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,760
Let me tell you

254
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,920
It's the best movie

255
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,880
I've seen this year

256
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,320
Who did you watch it with?

257
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,040
My mom

258
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,320
It was so awkward

259
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,640
Oh my god

260
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,000
Shouldn't you watch it

261
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,400
with your crush?

262
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,400
Yeah

263
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,280
I envy those who go as a couple

264
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,720
Lan Jinghui, what are you doing?

265
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,960
The weather is so good today

266
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:35,920
Isn't it?

267
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,520
Let me tell you

268
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,960
The movie is so good

269
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,760
A must-watch for couples, the blockbuster of the year

270
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,640
Just that?

271
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,560
Saturday night, 7:30

272
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,040
Two tickets, sitting together

273
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,520
Deal

274
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,120
Good morning, disciple

275
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,480
Your breakfast

276
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,240
Since you give me

277
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,920
delicious breakfast every day,

278
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,520
as a master,

279
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,000
I have good news for you

280
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,480
I'm not interested in which team

281
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,960
or which player won the game

282
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
Or who became the MVP

283
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
It's not about basketball

284
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,800
It's Ling Dong

285
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,560
What about Ling Dong?

286
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,480
Well, Ling Dong...

287
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,700
He wanted to invite you to watch a movie

288
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,200
but he's too shy to ask

289
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,600
So he asked me to help him

290
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,000
I reluctantly agreed to help him

291
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,360
Good news, right?

292
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,320
In any case, I've already sent you

293
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,200
the ticket code

294
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,680
Remember to be on time

295
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,200
Beauty in common things

296
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,920
Beauty in common things

297
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,520
Each different part of China

298
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,000
Each different part of China

299
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,160
Let's go watch a movie this weekend

300
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,200
Why?

301
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,680
Newly released. Don't miss it

302
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,640
I'm asking why

303
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,320
Just a normal team building

304
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,200
Come on, an entertainment

305
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,280
Why so many questions?

306
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,440
Are you going or not?

307
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,520
Just the two of us. I've already got the tickets

308
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,840
Can you finish your homework?

309
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,120
Yes, I promise

310
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,840
Alright, send me the tickets

311
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,200
Okay

312
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,520
The most common things

313
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,040
The most common things

314
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,240
Excuse me

315
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,520
Excuse me

316
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,840
I'm sorry

317
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,440
Ling Dong

318
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,000
Xiaohua

319
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:48,880
You...

320
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,640
Sorry, bro

321
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,800
I have urgent matters

322
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,720
I really can't leave

323
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,360
So I gave Xiaohua the movie ticket

324
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,000
Remember to tell me the plot when you're back

325
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,360
Watch it first

326
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,760
Such a good movie

327
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,840
I can't miss it

328
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,400
Monitor

329
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,320
Qingtian, you're here

330
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,320
You asked me out today

331
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,400
I thought

332
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,800
you'd take me to make up lessons

333
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,440
I didn't expect to watch a movie

334
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,800
Then I'll go buy popcorn first

335
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,800
It's still early

336
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,680
Or let's go somewhere first

337
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:22,960
Hurry up

338
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,200
Okay

339
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,960
Let me show you

340
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,480
One more time

341
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,200
You can do it

342
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,000
You can do it

343
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,320
Forget it

344
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,920
It's not meant to be mine

345
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,000
Let's go watch the movie

346
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,800
Wait

347
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,200
Let me help you

348
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,880
That panda

349
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,680
Forget it, it's normal not to catch it

350
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,240
They make money from this

351
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,440
Let's go watch the movie

352
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,080
No, I can definitely take it

353
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,640
I got one

354
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,240
Here it comes

355
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,560
Lan Jinghui

356
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,680
Lan Jinghui

357
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,280
Don't think we don't know

358
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,080
what you're thinking

359
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,440
How can you do this?

360
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,920
To achieve your own goals

361
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,880
by any means necessary

362
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,280
Are you still worthy to call yourself

363
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,080
the Light of Chenjun?

364
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,640
Are you still worthy to call yourself

365
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,320
a member of Class 5?

366
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,080
Are you still worthy

367
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,240
of me calling you master?

368
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,240
-Despicable -Shameless

369
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,760
-Despicable -Shameless

370
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,080
-Despicable -Shameless

371
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,440
-Despicable -Shameless

372
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,680
-Despicable -Shameless

373
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,040
-Despicable -Shameless

374
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,080
Monitor

375
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,000
When can we leave?

376
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,240
I promised you

377
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,320
I will definitely do it

378
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,440
The coins you put in

379
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,200
are enough to buy 20 dolls

380
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,120
You've been catching them all night

381
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,200
I caught one

382
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,560
I caught one

383
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:20,880
So ugly

384
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,280
No, no...

385
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
I wanna catch the one you like

386
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,040
No need

387
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,360
One more time

388
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,640
This's already good enough

389
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,760
Really?

390
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:32,720
But...

391
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,480
No "but," let's go with this one

392
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,200
We've been catching all night

393
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,720
We missed the movie

394
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,800
I've always been told

395
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,280
that things must be done to the best

396
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,480
And then...

397
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,600
And then I got used to it

398
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,480
Don't force yourself

399
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,200
Be cool, just like me

400
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,280
I'll go buy a movie ticket

401
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,760
I've already told you

402
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
As a person, you should be like me

403
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,520
Be cool

404
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,200
Yes

405
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,040
What should we do next?

406
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,520
We're tired, let's go home

407
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,520
Morning, disciple

408
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Where's my breakfast?

409
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,480
Disciple

410
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,680
What about my breakfast?

411
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,560
Second disciple

412
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,960
The movie was good yesterday, right?

413
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,880
Was the movie good yesterday?

414
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,200
Was yesterday's movie good?

415
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:06,840
No

416
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,600
Why are you ignoring me?

417
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,400
Hey

418
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,840
Hey

419
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,240
No...

420
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,360
Xiaohua

421
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,840
Xiaohua

422
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,840
Xiao Xiaohua

423
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,600
I'm sorry, okay?

424
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,120
I'm sorry

425
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,040
I really had something yesterday

426
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,920
I got delayed and couldn't go

427
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,600
Okay?

428
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,200
Childish

429
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,080
Disciple

430
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,120
Don't do this in the future

431
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:53,760
You hurt me

432
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,880
What?

433
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,160
Nothing

434
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,920
What about my breakfast?

435
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,240
It depends

436
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,040
No, no...

437
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,120
Disciple

438
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,200
Leave me an egg white

439
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,680
Or even a yolk

440
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,680
You two don't even bring your school bags

441
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,440
Where can you go?

442
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,000
No one appreciates my kindness

443
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,880
Kindness wasted

444
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,760
Look at you two

445
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,120
Grandma, I'm back

446
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,760
Hey, grandson

447
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,240
Wash your hands and come eat

448
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,960
Tired from studying?

449
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,880
Why do you look so tired?

450
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,880
No, not really

451
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Maybe I'm just really hungry

452
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,640
Grandma, what's for today's meal?

453
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,920
It's all your favorite dishes

454
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
Your dad's back

455
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,000
He's in the study

456
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,960
Call him down for dinner

457
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,040
-Okay -Be good

458
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,800
Just go

459
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,760
Xiao Wang

460
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,440
Remember to transfer the money to the school today

461
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,320
Ling Dong is quite responsible

462
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,400
He's always dedicated

463
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,200
to helping Xiaohui

464
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
with his homework

465
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
So make sure to

466
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,800
give him the money on time

467
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,880
I won't remind you anymore

468
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,120
Just keep it in mind

469
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,000
Okay

470
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,480
Morning, Brother Hui

471
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,040
You're here

472
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,640
Do these questions first

473
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,240
I'll tell you when I make a mistake

474
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,040
I don't wanna do it

475
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:13,920
What's wrong?

476
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,200
Nothing

477
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,080
Do I need a reason to not wanna do it?

478
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:21,760
You have to do it

479
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,680
Let's go

480
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,600
Ma Yiming, let's go for a walk

481
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,360
It's too stuffy

482
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,480
I can't stand it for a minute

483
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,160
No, wait

484
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,160
Do I need a reason to not wanna do it?

485
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,400
What's it to you?

486
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:37,920
Let's go

487
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,320
Let's go

488
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:39,840
Brother Hui

489
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,440
Brother Hui

490
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,360
What's going on? Are you two arguing?

491
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,720
What's wrong with Lan Jinghui?

492
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,360
I don't know

493
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,360
What's wrong with...

494
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,160
Did you sleep?

495
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,360
Morning

496
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,800
Morning

497
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,280
The key points here

498
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,120
I've already marked them

499
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,760
Take a look

500
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
You flipped it

501
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,560
Didn't you ask me to read the book?

502
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,400
You didn't mention flipping it

503
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,880
Finish this paper today

504
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,480
I'll wait for you in the study room after school

505
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,880
Did you do this on purpose?

506
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,160
Nope

507
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,200
Didn't you tell me not to write? I finished it

508
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,160
I don't know why

509
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,560
you suddenly wanna act like a child

510
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,160
I don't have to help you, anyway

511
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,200
Look at you now

512
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,880
Who do you wanna show it to?

513
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,080
Lan Jinghui

514
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,360
You've finally made some progress before

515
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,920
Now you just wanna give it up?

516
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,720
Let me tell you

517
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,520
Studying is something

518
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,480
you have to do on your own

519
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,280
If you don't wanna learn,

520
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,120
no one can help you

521
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,720
Let me tell you

522
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,280
This is my own thing

523
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
It's not even your business

524
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,320
Fine, I'm off

525
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,120
Ling Dong

526
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,440
Ling Dong

527
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,120
Ling Dong

528
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,480
What's wrong?

529
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,600
It's cold

530
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,640
Just wait a few seconds

531
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,280
Okay

532
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,440
Ling Dong

533
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,960
Ling Dong

534
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,080
What's wrong now?

535
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,720
Towel

536
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,960
Don't use mine

537
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,040
I'll get you one

538
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,840
Which one is yours?

539
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,760
Are they all yours?

540
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,280
I told you not to use mine

541
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,520
I'll find you another one

542
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,560
What if I'll use it?

543
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,360
So cool
