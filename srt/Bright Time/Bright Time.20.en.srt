[Uncle forever.]
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:53,950
Hehe

4
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,110
Hahaha

5
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,230
Hahaha

6
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,830
Oh...

7
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,470
You're warming up, huh

8
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,470
Let me add some firewood

9
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,710
Hahaha

10
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,470
Hey

11
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,670
Isn't this laughing louder?

12
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,070
Hahaha

13
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:07,910
Hey

14
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,270
Oh no

15
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,070
Quite warm

16
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,710
Well

17
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,750
Xu Chao and Ruosi

18
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,790
have diarrhea

19
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,830
So I'm volunteered

20
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,750
to cover their shift

21
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,030
I can't leave you alone

22
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,550
Right?

23
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,390
The weather is really nice today

24
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,590
With moonlit and starry

25
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,670
It's quite foggy

26
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,830
Rarely such good weather

27
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,790
How about I sing a song for you?

28
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,070
I'll just sing that...

29
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,670
I won't listen

30
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,110
That works too

31
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,790
It's okay if you don't wanna listen

32
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,110
That's strange for singing at night

33
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,350
How about I tell you

34
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,110
a ghost story?

35
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,310
It must be coming from my stomach

36
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,550
I must have an upset stomach

37
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,510
It must be me...

38
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,350
Shut up

39
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,070
I need to go to the bathroom

40
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,230
How did you get in?

41
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,750
Hey

42
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,590
Hey

43
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,270
Hey

44
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:54,830
Hey

45
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,350
Why are you here?

46
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,230
If you keep talking, go stand outside

47
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,870
Just as I thought

48
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,710
You can't just leave me alone

49
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,990
It's so dark here

50
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,670
Cellphone

51
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,470
Flashlight

52
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,390
No

53
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,030
Isn't it more obvious like this?

54
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,230
It's fine

55
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,510
Convenience store, huh

56
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,550
Be quick

57
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,630
That's right

58
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,470
Just take this

59
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,350
Don't hide, I see both of you

60
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,990
Let's go, we still have time

61
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,350
Instant noodles, ham sausage

62
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,590
What?

63
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,950
Let's go

64
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,710
And instant noodles, ham sausage

65
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,790
What's wrong with you?

66
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,430
Lan Jinghui

67
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,790
Xiaohui

68
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,630
What about the instant noodles and ham sausage?

69
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,510
Forget it, let's just go for it

70
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,550
Stop

71
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,230
Stop

72
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,590
Which class are you from?

73
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,790
Which class are you from?

74
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,830
Stop

75
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,390
Stop

76
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,670
Stop

77
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,230
Stop

78
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:22,950
Don't run

79
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,910
You...

80
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,190
It's fine now

81
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,470
Pretty fast, huh

82
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,750
You...

83
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,350
You're pretty fast too

84
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,070
Of course

85
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,870
Where did you go?

86
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,950
Why so much nonsense?

87
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,390
Hurry up and eat

88
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,190
Are you gonna eat or not?

89
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,350
Or I'll throw it into the fire

90
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,150
I'll eat

91
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,750
They made up

92
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,390
Who's there?

93
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,430
Xiaohua

94
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,710
Instructor Wu

95
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,550
What are you doing here so late?

96
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,550
I'm on night duty, Instructor Wu

97
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,150
Alright

98
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,590
It's getting late

99
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,750
Go back and rest

100
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,590
Thank you, Instructor Wu

101
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:19,990
Wait

102
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:22,950
Contraband

103
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,030
Don't litter after eating

104
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,390
Okay

105
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,510
Thank you, Instructor Wu

106
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,270
She runs so fast

107
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,150
Thank you just now

108
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,670
Why are you thanking me?

109
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,270
Anyway, no matter what I do,

110
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,070
at most it proves

111
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,070
that I'm not a bad person

112
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,230
You're still angry

113
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,030
Why am I angry?

114
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,510
I'm just someone who does things for money

115
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,470
I was wrong

116
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,710
Actually, at first,

117
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,870
when I found out about this,

118
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,190
I was furious

119
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,390
You are my best friend

120
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,950
I just wanted to know

121
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,550
And I just need an answer

122
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,430
from you

123
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,550
An answer

124
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,390
I admit

125
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,110
that initially

126
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,430
it was because of your father

127
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,030
that I agreed to supervise you

128
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,630
Otherwise,

129
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,110
you were so arrogant

130
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,030
and annoying

131
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,950
at first

132
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,950
you always caused troubles

133
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,270
And you still wanted me

134
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,790
to approach you from the beginning,

135
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,910
to actively help you

136
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,910
Was I really that annoying?

137
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:55,830
Indeed

138
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,670
You were quite annoying

139
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,270
But,

140
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,990
as I gradually got to know you,

141
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,950
and understood you,

142
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,870
I realized what it means

143
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,790
to have a friend

144
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,550
You know what? Lan Jinghui

145
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,150
Although sometimes

146
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,430
you don't seem reliable

147
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,230
Sometimes you're quite foolish

148
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,350
You're always wholehearted

149
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,990
to friends

150
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,030
Whether it's Xiaohua, Ma Yiming,

151
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,350
or me,

152
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,110
you're always there for us

153
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,310
I used to be alone all the time

154
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,470
You slowly changed me

155
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,870
Well, as for you

156
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,470
either you don't speak,

157
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,830
or when you do,

158
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,910
it's always cheesy

159
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,030
Actually, I have had a question all along

160
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,990
I wanted to ask you something

161
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,390
What?

162
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,990
Why did you do that?

163
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:14,950
What?

164
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,110
Earlier in the changing room

165
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,750
I'm just afraid of the dark

166
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:27,870
I'm afraid of the dark

167
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,710
Okay

168
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,630
Not just afraid of the dark

169
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,470
Maybe

170
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,510
I'm also afraid of enclosed spaces

171
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,830
I'm also afraid of the time

172
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,110
when a beam of light suddenly shines on me

173
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,710
Afraid of light?

174
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,430
When I was little,

175
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,510
my parents got divorced

176
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:53,870
At that time,

177
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,190
my mom insisted on taking me abroad

178
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,710
But I didn't wanna go

179
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,950
So, I made a pact with a friend

180
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,750
who I used to play with a lot back then

181
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,590
We agreed to hide together

182
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,510
until my mom left

183
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,590
So, does that mean

184
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,830
we'll never see each other again?

185
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,990
I don't wanna go

186
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,310
What if your mom insists on taking you?

187
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,470
What would you do?

188
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,710
I can hide

189
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,070
Hide?

190
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,190
Where?

191
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,830
But then, he betrayed me

192
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,110
He told all my little secrets

193
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,390
to the adults

194
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,510
So, you have to keep my secret

195
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,550
You can't tell anyone else

196
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,870
Let's pinky promise

197
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,310
Looking back, it was childish

198
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,030
I just

199
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,390
hid myself in an abandoned warehouse

200
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,070
behind the kindergarten

201
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,630
with no light

202
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,870
no food

203
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,030
no water

204
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,430
All I can remember is that...

205
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,990
I heard footsteps all around

206
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,670
Countless flashlights were shining in

207
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,110
And then?

208
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,630
And then, they found me

209
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,350
Then they took me back

210
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,700
Maybe...

211
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,430
subconsciously, it's been trying to tell me

212
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,430
to stay there

213
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,550
So, I'm still afraid

214
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,990
of enclosed spaces

215
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,710
and bright lights

216
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,470
Do you still remember that kid

217
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,670
who betrayed you back then?

218
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,510
I don't remember

219
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,110
I was too young, I forgot

220
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,230
And besides,

221
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,110
people like him

222
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,710
It's better not to remember

223
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,910
Maybe he didn't mean it that way

224
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,830
What?

225
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,390
Nothing

226
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,110
Wait

227
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,070
I've told you everything

228
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,030
No, it's not right

229
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,310
No, no

230
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:55,910
No, no

231
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,590
You have to tell me a secret

232
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,990
Now, right now, immediately

233
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,070
I I don't have any secrets

234
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:03,870
I don't believe it

235
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,430
Your expression doesn't look like

236
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,510
one without any secrets

237
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,990
There really isn't any

238
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,270
Did my dad already tell you

239
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,230
that you're not my uncle

240
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:19,950
Yes, I am

241
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,230
Do you know who he is?

242
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,030
Who is he?

243
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:25,990
He is...

244
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,390
He is your uncle

245
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,510
Uncle?

246
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,350
Go out

247
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,150
Get out

248
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,870
Ling Dong, what I just told you

249
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,470
Is it okay or not?

250
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,270
Mr. Lan

251
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,470
We are not related, right?

252
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,550
And also, the director said

253
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,830
that my sponsor is coming to see me

254
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,430
It must be you, right?

255
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,990
Can I ask

256
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,310
why sponsored me?

257
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,950
Well...

258
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,950
It's just...

259
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,190
This is a long story

260
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,230
Ling Dong, sit down and talk

261
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,950
Come here

262
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,950
Come here and have a seat

263
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,550
Actually

264
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,190
You and Uncle Lan

265
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,550
You don't have any relationship at all

266
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,870
But...

267
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,150
Uncle Lan and I

268
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,030
and Old Ling,

269
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,470
who's your dad

270
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,950
We three

271
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,790
have been friends for over ten years

272
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,350
With with my dad?

273
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,990
I won't go into details

274
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,660
Xiaoling

275
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,830
You know your mom quite well

276
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,470
She is quite strong-willed

277
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,350
She actually didn't wanna

278
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,350
accept our sponsorship

279
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,510
So, this matter

280
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,470
hasn't been told to you all along

281
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,350
I was afraid you would feel burdened

282
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,550
I came to find you

283
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,710
I just wanna...

284
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,710
Uncle Lan just wanna ask you...

285
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,390
to help Lan Jinghui more in his study

286
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,990
And of course,

287
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,190
as long as it doesn't affect

288
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,390
your studies

289
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,470
Indeed, Lan Jinghui is really

290
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,310
not doing well now

291
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,190
But actually,

292
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,950
he used to be a good kid

293
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,990
Why did he become like this now?

294
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,670
His mom and I

295
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,510
We really have a big responsibility

296
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,790
And now, it's a coincidence

297
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,230
You transferred here

298
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,150
You two are classmates now

299
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,510
and also desk mates

300
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,070
So I just

301
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,790
want you to help him more

302
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,230
in your free time

303
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,350
And besides

304
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,440
You have a different status now

305
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,560
As the uncle

306
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,960
Yes, you're his uncle

307
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,040
You can fully utilize this identity

308
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,870
When he doesn't listen to you

309
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,230
just let me know

310
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,990
Right?

311
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,230
He has to listen to you

312
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,270
If you can

313
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,670
help Lan Jinghui with his studies

314
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,110
Uncle Lan will feel relieved

315
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,310
He's kind

316
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,230
This counts as a promise

317
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,830
Look, what a good child

318
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,150
Thank you

319
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,830
Keep it up

320
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,590
What's wrong?

321
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,510
Ling Dong

322
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,390
You're too much...

323
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,070
Too much

324
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,150
Why didn't you tell me?

325
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,710
You...

326
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,350
Are you okay?

327
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,430
What's wrong?

328
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,070
It's nothing, my leg is numb

329
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,270
I'm fine, really

330
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,030
Are you silly?

331
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:37,750
Numb?

332
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,710
Still numb?

333
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,630
No, it's okay

334
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,510
Much better now

335
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,230
Nice view, huh

336
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,030
With a clear moon and few stars

337
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,230
Lan Jinghui

338
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:05,910
I've said it

339
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,550
I wanna be your uncle for life

340
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,830
I mean it

341
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,950
You wanna take advantage of me for life, huh

342
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,990
Dream on

343
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,270
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

344
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,190
You're annoying

345
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,150
You're pressing on me

346
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,110
You're pressing on me

347
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,430
You're pressing on me

348
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,190
You're pressing on me

349
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:52,870
Get off

350
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:54,870
No

351
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,350
The last time

352
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,910
Get off

353
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,710
Cheer up

354
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,270
Haven't you eaten?

355
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,390
Stay safe

356
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:18,470
I'm fine

357
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:18,830
Are you okay?

358
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,190
No one left behind

359
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,230
Left

360
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:28,830
Right

361
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,710
Left, right

362
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,630
Pay attention to arm swinging

363
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,870
No, wait

364
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,590
I think we should not move the arm

365
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,430
that much

366
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,350
Because if it's too big

367
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,070
it will affect the balance

368
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,990
and the speed

369
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,710
No...

370
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,750
Her body

371
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,750
is still a bit uncoordinated

372
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,030
She needs to swing her arms widely

373
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,270
to keep up with her pace

374
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,790
Right?

375
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,670
You have to do it like this

376
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,630
No, no, no

377
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,550
He's wrong

378
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,190
Listen to me

379
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:51,710
No, wait

380
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,910
You can't listen to him

381
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,550
You have to listen to me

382
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,550
You have to get used to your body

383
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,950
and follow your own feeling

384
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,070
No, why do you think

385
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,470
what you said

386
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,590
is more mature than mine?

387
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:00,950
I never felt

388
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,830
that my theory is more mature than yours

389
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,990
I just follow my heart

390
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,150
Follow your heart

391
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,390
You still have a heart?

392
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,710
Let's go

393
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,950
But I think, you know

394
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,030
you still need to approach it

395
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,470
rationally

396
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,190
You know what?

397
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,790
You can't just follow your heart

398
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,070
Humans are all emotional

399
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,670
Come on

400
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,790
Get ready

401
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,630
Go for it

402
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,550
Go for it

403
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,470
Go for it

404
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,510
Go for it

405
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,350
Go for it

406
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,310
Go for it

407
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,030
Go for it

408
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,590
Go for it

409
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,310
Go for it

410
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,710
Go for it

411
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,790
Go for it

412
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,670
Come on

413
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:45,910
Go for it, Ruosi

414
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,430
Are you ready?

415
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,670
Be careful, everyone

416
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,910
Come on

417
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,630
Come on

418
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:53,870
Come on

419
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,470
This time, our team

420
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,950
will definitely come in first

421
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,910
We will definitely win

422
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,190
Because he doesn't wanna lose

423
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,470
We'll win

424
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,030
You...

425
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:02,750
We'll win

426
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,270
You

427
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,230
We will definitely win

428
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,870
Class 5

429
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,470
Pay attention to the techniques

430
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:07,990
during training

431
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,190
Stay safe

432
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,870
Get ready

433
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,630
Three

434
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:12,990
Two

435
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,670
One

436
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,110
Come on

437
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,710
One, two

438
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,150
Come on

439
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,310
One, two

440
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,110
Come on

441
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,670
One, two

442
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,230
One, two

443
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:30,870
One, two

444
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,470
One, two

445
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,590
Come on

446
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:33,990
One, two

447
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,550
One, two

448
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,110
One, two

449
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,430
One, two

450
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:39,870
Are they hurt?

451
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,470
I'll go check

452
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,910
Is everything alright?

453
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,750
Let them handle it themselves

454
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,590
They're used to being pampered

455
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,990
Let them suffer

456
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,030
They need to toughen up

457
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,030
On this matter,

458
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,710
I fully agree with Ms. Fang

459
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:56,630
How are you feeling?

460
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,230
Can you still go on?

461
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,070
My foot twisted

462
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,790
Can you still run?

463
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,390
Yes, of course

464
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,430
But...

465
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,750
Qingtian, we got first place

466
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,470
We were so close to winning

467
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,350
I promised you

468
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,710
that I would help you get first place

469
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,670
It's okay, Qingtian

470
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,270
Now,

471
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,750
I quite like second place too

472
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,030
We were just a little bit short

473
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,870
Just a little bit

474
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,150
Just a little bit and we would have won

475
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,510
We've practiced for so long

476
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,350
One, two

477
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,310
One, two

478
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,030
Come on

479
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,910
Come on

480
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,990
Slow down

481
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,990
Come on

482
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:38,870
Come on

483
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,470
One

484
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,390
Almost there

485
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,990
Come on

486
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,270
Come on, Xiaohua

487
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,190
One, two

488
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,510
Come on

489
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,070
Come on, Xiaohua

490
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,870
Come on

491
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,550
Two

492
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,070
Be careful

493
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,790
One, two

494
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,150
It's okay

495
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,470
Take it slow

496
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,030
Take it slow

497
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,110
One, two

498
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,270
One, two

499
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,710
One, two

500
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,550
Come on

501
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,830
Come on

502
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,510
Come on

503
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:00,990
Be careful

504
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,750
You guys are the best

505
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,230
Great job

506
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,390
It's my fault

507
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,230
We practiced for nothing

508
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,990
How can that be your fault?

509
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,630
As long as we cross the finish line,

510
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,830
it's a victory, right?

511
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,470
And look at him

512
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,270
who'd always get first place

513
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,150
He didn't say anything, right?

514
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,870
Isn't it the first place?

515
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,030
It's just a different kind of it

516
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,830
Actually, for me,

517
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,190
it's quite interesting

518
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:23,990
Listen

519
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,150
Our team is just too strong

520
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,590
We should give other teams a chance, right?

521
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,310
Brother Hui

522
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,270
Thank you

523
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,470
You're just picking up the leftovers

524
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:45,750
Qingtian

525
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,430
There's a bonfire party later

526
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,670
Let's go make a fire together

527
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,270
No, I'm not in the mood

528
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,150
You're still upset about

529
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,990
losing the race

530
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,830
I promised you first place

531
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,870
It's okay

532
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,790
Qingtian

533
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:11,790
Look

534
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,230
Where did you get this?

535
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,950
I just passed by the kitchen

536
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,430
Oh my god...

537
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,390
I didn't realize

538
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,470
you look so honest

539
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,790
Actually,

540
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,790
it was given by Auntie

541
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,990
But this is raw

542
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,990
So I asked you

543
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,910
to start the fire

544
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,630
Then I'll eat roasted sweet potatoes

545
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,310
Let's go

546
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:36,750
Let's go

547
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,190
Come on

548
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,150
Run

549
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,790
Hurry

550
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,790
Be quick and nimble

551
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,550
Ma Yiming, hurry up

552
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,710
Be quick

553
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,310
Hurry up, be fast

554
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:03,990
Okay

555
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,510
Now let me tell you

556
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,350
the rules of the game

557
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,670
This's called "King's Game"

558
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,270
If you get the King card

559
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,350
you'll be very powerful

560
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,910
You can randomly designate

561
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,790
a combination of numbers

562
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,870
The King can specify

563
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,390
what this combination does

564
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,710
If this combination

565
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,750
cannot be completed

566
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,670
then you'll be punished with black garlic juice

567
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,430
So now...

568
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,710
Who got the King card?

569
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,150
Me

570
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,590
Brother Hui

571
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:56,710
Okay, then I choose...

572
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,790
10 of diamonds

573
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,230
and 8 of spades

574
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,190
I am 8 of spades

575
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,190
Who is 10 of diamonds?

576
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,710
Where is 10 of diamonds?

577
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,310
Where is 10 of diamonds?

578
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:13,750
Who is it?

579
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,870
10 of diamonds

580
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,910
Who is 10 of diamonds?

581
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,670
Well...

582
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,750
This is just...

583
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,790
A duet of love songs

584
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,230
Sing

585
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,030
Sing

586
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,430
Sing

587
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,030
I accept the punishment

588
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,270
No, no, no

589
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,750
I cheated, let me do it

590
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,350
Did you go too far with this game?

591
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,470
Is it really that bad?

592
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,990
Well...

593
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,350
Come on, let's continue

594
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,150
Let's collect these cards first

595
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:00,510
Come on

596
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,950
Go back to our positions

597
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,550
Come on

598
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,270
Collect the cards

599
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:04,870
Come on

600
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,110
Come on, card please

601
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,190
Come on, card please

602
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,550
Alright

603
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,470
Brother Hui

604
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:23,910
This black garlic juice

605
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,110
really tastes terrible

606
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,070
Who came up with such a punishment?

607
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,390
Luckily it's not Sister Meng drinking it

608
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,790
Sister Meng

609
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,070
Who allowed you to do this?

610
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,670
You deserve it

611
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,670
Sister Meng

612
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:49,790
Okay

613
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,190
So, in this round

614
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,350
who is the King?

615
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,510
It's me

616
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,550
Choose the number you wanna say

617
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,830
Jack of hearts

618
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,430
Jack of hearts

619
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,990
Carry her on your back

620
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,630
Run around our field

621
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,270
for a lap

622
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,190
Ma Yiming

623
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:08,990
Ma Yiming

624
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:17,950
Come on

625
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,710
Who is the new king this round?

626
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,470
Me

627
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,310
Quite active

628
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,150
Then, King

629
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,830
choose the numbers you wanna say

630
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:31,430
I choose the two of spades and...

631
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,950
The eight of spades

632
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,230
What do you want them to do?

633
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,550
I want them to hug

634
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,670
Embrace tightly

635
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,670
Okay, number 8

636
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,590
Step forward

637
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:49,630
Okay

638
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,470
Okay

639
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,390
Ling Dong

640
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,310
Okay, now the eight of spades

641
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,910
has already entered the field

642
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,430
Now, please welcome the two of spades

643
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,430
Two of spades

644
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,870
Is that a girl?

645
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,550
This is too exciting

646
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,670
Who is it?

647
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,910
Embrace in public

648
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,350
That's so awkward

649
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,230
Yeah

650
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,590
Two of spades

651
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,630
Two of spades

652
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,990
Two of spades

653
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,270
If you don't show up soon

654
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,630
I'll fold all my cards

655
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,390
Three

656
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,270
Two

657
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,670
It's me

658
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,230
Hug

659
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,430
Congratulations

660
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:31,670
Hug

661
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,590
Hug

662
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,590
Hug

663
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,630
I can't breathe

664
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,950
I can't even catch my breath

665
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,470
Here's a big one

666
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,390
Auntie, I want two ice creams

667
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,030
Two

668
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,590
Two

669
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:09,630
Auntie

670
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,350
Auntie, I want six

671
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:10,910
Six

672
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,630
Yes, six

673
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,230
Thank you, Auntie

674
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:16,630
Auntie

675
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,230
I want that one

676
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:17,950
I want three ice creams

677
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,630
Three

678
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,190
Only two left

679
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,510
Only two left

680
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,510
Two is fine

681
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,270
It's okay

682
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,270
Have a drumstick

683
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:29,990
You don't want vegetables

684
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,470
Here

685
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,390
What is it?

686
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,030
Why are there only two?

687
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:34,950
Where's yours?

688
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,070
I already ate it

689
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,310
I feel like I'm coming back to life

690
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,430
Is it delicious?

691
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,630
Take a bite

692
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,270
Once cold and once hot

693
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,470
Be careful of getting diarrhea
