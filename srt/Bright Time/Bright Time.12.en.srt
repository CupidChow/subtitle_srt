[Bright Time]

00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,880
[It's shameless and useless to avoid.]
[Episode 12]

3
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,230
Xiaoyu, have something to eat

4
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,270
Mom, I'm not hungry

5
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,870
You didn't take notes in physics class, did you?

6
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,470
Take mine to copy

7
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,550
No need to thank me

8
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,670
Defense, be more aggressive

9
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,030
Block

10
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,070
Inside

11
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,790
Nice

12
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,630
Well done

13
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,510
Rebound

14
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,430
Good

15
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,070
Pay attention to the open space

16
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,350
Why didn't you give me the ball?

17
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,270
Oh well

18
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,070
Come on, pass

19
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,630
Ma Yiming

20
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,310
Ma Yiming

21
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,670
Are you two still not getting closed?

22
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,590
Stop talking

23
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,870
He's so stubborn now

24
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,030
What was that saying?

25
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,150
That something makes people lose their minds

26
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,510
So what do we do now?

27
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,110
The best way now

28
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,110
is to find evidence

29
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,030
to prove that someone else did this

30
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,110
How do we find it?

31
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,150
Keep quiet

32
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,710
Anyone around us now

33
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,190
could be the one

34
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,709
So we need to find a place

35
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,869
that is absolutely hidden

36
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,800
Since this article was posted

37
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,300
early in the morning

38
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,380
Does it mean

39
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,360
it was posted late at night?

40
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,310
Even if we know

41
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,470
it was posted late at night

42
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,830
we still don't know

43
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,120
who did this

44
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,590
There's another way

45
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,310
What?

46
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,310
Xu Mengyu said

47
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,350
that she didn't bring that many stylebooks

48
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,790
So she must know

49
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,710
who she gave them to

50
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,790
We just need to

51
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,470
find those people

52
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,070
and see who's missing

53
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,750
the page that was plagiarized

54
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,560
That person is the one we're looking for

55
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,430
Sister Meng

56
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,390
We've all been waiting for you

57
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,030
Sister Meng

58
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,070
I've taken notes for today's class

59
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,430
Sister Meng

60
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,110
You can tell me if anything happens

61
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,470
Sister Meng

62
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,190
Are you coming today?

63
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:27,750
Sister Meng

64
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,350
Will you come back tomorrow?

65
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:45,870
Sister Meng

66
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,030
I'm at the subway station below your house

67
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,150
Can we meet?

68
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,790
Sister Meng

69
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,550
Tell me

70
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,670
What's the matter?

71
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,750
I just wanted to see you

72
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,110
Now you've seen me, right?

73
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,030
You can leave now

74
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,030
Xu Mengyu

75
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,510
I heard you're transferring schools

76
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,150
Can't you stay?

77
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,430
What's it to you?

78
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,750
In our first year

79
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,630
I told the teacher

80
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,590
my homework got blown away by the wind

81
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,110
Actually, I didn't write it

82
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,230
And there was a time when I was late

83
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,830
I told the teacher I had a stomachache

84
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,670
But actually, I didn't get up

85
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,510
And there was another time during an exam

86
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,030
I looked at someone else's answers

87
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,270
So you mean

88
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,670
plagiarism is not a big deal, right?

89
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,710
I wanna tell you

90
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,470
that everyone makes mistakes

91
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,310
They made mistakes in the past,

92
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,750
They'll make mistakes in the future

93
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,270
They will make many mistakes

94
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,390
But when they realize their mistakes,

95
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,190
they will correct them

96
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,470
It's not a big deal

97
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,070
Right?

98
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,310
One mistake cannot define

99
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,710
your whole life

100
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,470
If

101
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,550
you know you made a mistake

102
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,390
and you continue to hide in a safe house

103
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,990
avoiding facing it,

104
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,150
that's truly shameful

105
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,550
Just go home

106
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,309
Hello to all the teachers

107
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,590
and students of Chenjun High School

108
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,270
I am Xu Mengyu

109
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,030
I'm here

110
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,510
to apologize to you

111
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,590
I'm sorry, I cheated

112
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,270
For all these days,

113
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,870
I've been asking myself over and over again

114
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,990
what is the meaning of my writing

115
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,630
Is it to gain

116
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,150
superficial praise and glory,

117
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,830
or is it to express myself?

118
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,390
But in the midst of honor and praise,

119
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,230
I lost sight of my true self

120
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,950
I lost myself

121
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,710
But I'm fortunate

122
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,390
that I have the chance to make up

123
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,430
to find myself again

124
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,670
No shortcuts to success

125
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,390
It requires double the effort

126
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,990
I apologize to the

127
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,190
student Union and all my classmates

128
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,710
I set a bad example

129
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,390
So, starting from today,

130
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,430
I will step down

131
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,950
from all my positions in the Student Union

132
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,750
Once again, I apologize

133
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,790
to all my classmates and teachers

134
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,790
I'm sorry

135
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,550
Sister Meng is back

136
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,470
You come back

137
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,310
Mengyu

138
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,070
Mengyu, you're finally back

139
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,390
Where did you go?

140
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,910
I thought you transferred

141
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,750
I was so worried

142
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,150
It's okay. I'm here

143
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,230
It's good to be back

144
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,590
It's good to be back

145
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,510
Let me carry your backpack

146
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,790
Hello, everyone

147
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,950
I'm back

148
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,110
Xu Mengyu

149
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,070
You misunderstood Xiao Xiaohua

150
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,710
She didn't do what you thought

151
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,110
If you really wanna find the person

152
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,230
who posted on the bulletin board,

153
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,550
it's very simple

154
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,740
This is Xiao Xiaohua's book

155
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,280
It's complete

156
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,440
The missing page is on page 35

157
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,540
Whoever is missing it is the one who did it

158
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,190
I've got the page

159
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,350
Everyone, bring out the book

160
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,070
Luckily, I brought mine

161
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,870
Here, page 35

162
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,190
So do I

163
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,590
I didn't receive anything at all

164
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,790
So what about the rest of you?

165
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,630
Bring out your book

166
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,430
Let's compare

167
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,310
Stop searching, everyone

168
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,110
I don't wanna know who he is

169
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,110
Why?

170
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,670
Don't you know

171
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,550
what they talk about you?

172
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,910
It's because I know

173
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,630
I don't want that person

174
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,390
to have what I've been through

175
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,190
again

176
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,550
Whether it's me or not,

177
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,030
it doesn't matter

178
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,470
Nothing can be changed anymore

179
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,950
And Mengyu,

180
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,110
she paid the price

181
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,910
for her mistakes

182
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,270
I agree with what Xiaohua said

183
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,510
That person didn't do anything wrong

184
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,070
I did

185
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,150
Even if he didn't say it,

186
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,670
I was still wrong

187
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,070
Let's just end this here

188
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,710
Mengyu, welcome back

189
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,110
Mengyu

190
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,310
Welcome back

191
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,630
Mengyu, welcome back

192
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,470
Xu Mengyu, welcome back

193
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,710
Welcome back

194
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,470
Welcome back

195
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,190
Do you remember what you said to me

196
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,190
on the rooftop last time?

197
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,430
Yes

198
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,950
Actually, when we were on the rooftop

199
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,630
I was afraid that this

200
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,830
would be discovered by others

201
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,350
Every day, I was afraid

202
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,270
of not knowing

203
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,550
when it would be exposed

204
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,310
The more I hid it,

205
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,710
the more I lost the courage to confess

206
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,150
But you still came back

207
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,190
So, you are not a coward

208
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,820
I thought when I came back this time,

209
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,350
everyone would blame me

210
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,710
and look down on me

211
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,710
But I didn't expect them

212
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,150
to accept me again

213
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,350
I'm quite surprised

214
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,630
and touched

215
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,310
Sometimes, the hardest part

216
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,430
is the barrier in our own hearts

217
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,910
When you gather the courage

218
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,430
to take that step,

219
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,630
you'll realize that things aren't

220
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,270
as terrifying as you imagined

221
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,430
I also wanna tell you

222
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,150
I'm sorry

223
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,070
That's what I wanna say for a long time

224
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,430
I finally said it today

225
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,910
You're right

226
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,830
Taking this step

227
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,870
doesn't seem as difficult as I imagined

228
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:31,990
Xiaohua

229
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,990
Have you ever thought

230
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,710
that if we never find

231
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,630
that person,

232
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,910
everyone might think

233
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,350
that you're the one who forced

234
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,070
Xu Mengyu away?

235
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,950
And for the next year,

236
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,070
the two of us

237
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,590
will be blamed because of you

238
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,070
Look at you

239
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,270
Both of you

240
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,870
aren't doing this for me,

241
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,230
but for yourselves

242
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,310
Is it?

243
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,030
So I don't know

244
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,390
what's going on in your mind

245
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,150
I know you two

246
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,510
are doing this for my sake

247
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,710
But I believe that person

248
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,990
has no ill intentions

249
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,470
He just lacks the courage

250
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,870
to say it out

251
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,990
Actually, I'm just like him

252
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,190
I also knew

253
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,430
that Xu Mengyu plagiarized,

254
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,070
but I didn't point it out either

255
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,310
So what does that make you,

256
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,350
if not a saint?

257
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,150
I don't care if I'm a saint

258
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,110
or something else

259
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,470
That's just how I think

260
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,710
and what I've done

261
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,310
Everyone has their own

262
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,830
way of dealing with problems

263
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,630
Maybe it's not right

264
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,750
Maybe you'll regret

265
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,310
Who knows?

266
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,030
It's easy to be accepted,

267
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,030
but sometimes,

268
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,070
it takes courage to be disliked

269
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,590
for being true to yourself

270
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,590
Alright

271
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,390
No matter what the outcome is,

272
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,630
I will firmly be with

273
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,710
youe, my disciple

274
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,190
And Ling Dong

275
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,750
No comment

276
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,790
But...

277
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,440
I am willing to be with you all

278
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,150
Xiaohua, I'm sorry

279
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,150
Ling Dong

280
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,150
I'm sorry

281
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,310
And me?

282
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,670
I don't need to apologize to you

283
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,830
Finally, I escaped

284
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,150
from the confines of my own cage

285
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,390
Breaking the facade,

286
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,870
I found that weak side of myself

287
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,030
For the first time,

288
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,030
I feel the breeze on my face,

289
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,469
with a sweet scent

290
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,630
Let's get to know each other again

291
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,550
Hello, Xu Mengyu

292
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,870
You were born to be someone great

293
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,710
You just need to endure for now

294
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,190
Keep going, Xu Mengyu

295
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,830
Follow your dreams

296
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,830
Take it seriously, everyone

297
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,430
Look at you

298
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,470
You're usually

299
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,470
so cheerful in class

300
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,030
but now you all look down

301
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,110
Let me make an announcement

302
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,950
The basketball game at our school

303
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,030
has been scheduled

304
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,190
Next week

305
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,510
But our physical education classes

306
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,920
have been taken up by other subjects

307
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,190
So we don't have time to train

308
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,350
We won't play well

309
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,510
No, you're still young

310
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,660
Just be confident, alright?

311
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,070
You're so passionate

312
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,230
and sports are full of excitement

313
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,670
Who in your class volunteers

314
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,510
to organize it?

315
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,510
It's about to be the end of the term

316
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,110
No one steps forward, I'll take attendance

317
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,910
Lan Jinghui

318
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,430
Yes

319
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,470
You and Ma Yiming

320
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,710
will be responsible for your basketball team

321
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,470
Yes

322
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,110
Everyone, free time

323
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,070
Alright, students

324
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,750
Our school's basketball league

325
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,830
is about to begin

326
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,430
I'll give a brief explanation of the rules

327
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,670
In this competition,

328
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,710
all the classes from grade 10 and grade 11

329
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,470
will participate

330
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,790
Each class will have five players

331
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,750
If there are not enough players,

332
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,710
it will be considered a forfeit

333
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,630
The competition will be elimination-based

334
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,630
Later, we'll draw lots

335
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,590
to determine your opponents

336
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,110
Any questions?

337
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,270
Nope

338
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,750
Alright, let's start the draw

339
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,150
Your class goes first

340
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,270
Disperse

341
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,790
Lan Jinghui

342
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,670
There're a few players in your class

343
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,710
Didn't you hear what the coach said?

344
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,590
If there are not enough participants,

345
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,110
it will be considered a forfeit

346
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,190
It's a shame if it's like this

347
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,950
How about this?

348
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,430
Just withdraw from the competition

349
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,390
It will be embarrassing

350
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,230
without enough players

351
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,110
Bi Peng, let me tell you

352
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,510
we don't have that many players,

353
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,630
but

354
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,150
every one of us

355
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,430
can beat all the players in your class

356
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,710
so easily

357
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,790
Dribbling like this

358
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,950
It's okay if there's no one

359
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,750
Don't act so arrogantly

360
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,950
You may even not make it to the preliminaries

361
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,150
Alright

362
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,430
Good luck

363
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,430
Don't get eliminated in the preliminaries

364
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,670
Our class and your class

365
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,310
won't make it to the finals

366
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,190
Don't speak too soon

367
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,070
Otherwise, you'll embarrass yourselves

368
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,190
What's that smell?

369
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,430
Can you smell it?

370
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,910
It smells like cumin, doesn't it?

371
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,750
Can't you smell it?

372
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,390
Yeah, there is

373
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,750
That's too smelly

374
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,630
Stop talking nonsense

375
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,910
I'm not talking nonsense

376
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,150
Buddy

377
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,830
We're tired from practicing basketball

378
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,350
Right?

379
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,390
You need to pay attention to personal hygiene

380
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,950
Yes

381
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,870
Yes

382
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,390
It's not good

383
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,350
We should pay attention

384
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,630
Right?

385
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,190
Use the toilet cleaner more

386
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,430
Toilet cleaner might not clean it properly,

387
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,790
We'd better use disinfectant

388
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,630
Okay

389
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,430
Goodbye

390
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,270
Barbecue Boy

391
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:52,950
Cumin Boy

392
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,750
I didn't smell it

393
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,670
Okay

394
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,190
Jiang Jing

395
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,950
Don't you consider being a forward?

396
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,430
The forward

397
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,030
refers to someone

398
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,990
who charges ahead in our team

399
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,510
inside the basketball team

400
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,390
I need to solve this problem properly

401
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,390
Chen Yu

402
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,470
What's up, Brother Hui?

403
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,830
What do you think about

404
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,590
being a SG?

405
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,790
Let me tell you

406
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,270
Brother Hui

407
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,590
I might have a stomachache

408
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,470
No

409
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,110
Brother Hui

410
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:34,910
I feel it

411
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:35,750
I feel it, Brother Hui

412
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:37,590
It hurts too much

413
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,510
Xiao Wu

414
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,030
Don't think that I don't know

415
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,630
just because you wear glasses that...

416
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,630
Xiao Wu

417
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,710
Xiao Wu, where are you?

418
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,990
Xiao Wu

419
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,910
Could it be

420
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,030
I know you

421
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,550
Brother Hui

422
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,830
You were looking for Xiao Wu just now

423
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,910
You should have told me earlier

424
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,990
I'll help you find him

425
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,550
Xiao Wu, where are you?

426
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,590
Xiao Wu

427
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:59,390
Zhu Ming

428
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,430
Xiao Wu

429
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,630
Xiao Wu

430
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,030
Ruosi

431
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,950
I remember the head teacher

432
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,950
told me to do something

433
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,550
I forgot

434
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:12,950
It should be

435
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,910
His office is on the opposite side

436
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,510
You just can't help

437
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,030
Don't look at me I don't know how to

438
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,350
I'll teach you

439
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,350
I can teach you

440
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,870
I'll teach you step by step

441
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,270
No

442
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,470
Let me tell you

443
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,710
Basketball is a sport

444
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,710
that is good for your physical health

445
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,110
And it has many techniques

446
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,190
Many moves

447
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,630
It's adaptable

448
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,670
Did you finish your homework?

449
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,310
No

450
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,870
I'll teach you how to play basketball

451
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,150
It's totally different

452
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,550
So, let me tell you

453
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,550
you must

454
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,590
learn basketball from me

455
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,070
I...

456
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:00,990
I'll guide you

457
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,830
I'll guide you personally

458
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,390
I'll teach you, hey

459
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,190
Let me tell you

460
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,150
I won't charge you for it

461
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,230
Ling Dong

462
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,190
Can you help me with this?

463
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,310
I already substituted the formula,

464
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,190
but I still can't solve it

465
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,830
You mixed up two formulas

466
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,870
The formula for vertical upward motion

467
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,990
and the formula for free fall

468
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,630
are not the same

469
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,990
Take a closer look at the variables

470
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:29,950
Okay

471
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,830
Did you finish today's task?

472
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,990
He's asking you

473
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,230
Did you finish today's task?

474
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,190
No, I didn't

475
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,270
The task was never completed

476
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,830
Basketball game

477
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,510
is about to start

478
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,630
We still need two more players

479
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,870
Or we can't make it anymore

480
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,470
What should we do?

481
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,350
There is a way

482
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,150
What way?

483
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:56,750
How about this?

484
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,630
First, finish memorizing

485
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,270
today's vocabulary

486
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,470
Make sure to complete the task

487
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,190
Apple, Fairness

488
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,110
Restrict, Fasten

489
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,350
Complete, Concert

490
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,910
Correct, Star

491
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,790
Start, Connect

492
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,420
Xu Chao

493
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,350
I remember you were on the basketball team

494
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,030
in your freshman year

495
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,550
So, are you interested in

496
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,430
joining our basketball team?

497
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,100
I still have to study

498
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,580
The final exams are coming up soon

499
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,950
I don't have time to play basketball

500
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,750
I know

501
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,470
The top-grade notes of the year

502
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,510
Containing the secret exam guide

503
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,550
Only one copy available

504
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,990
Really?

505
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:52,990
Really

506
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,550
It's just a basketball team

507
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,150
I'll join

508
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,030
Come on

509
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,310
What are you all doing?

510
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,390
Jian Zhiqiang

511
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,790
Height: 186 cm

512
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,790
Nickname: Optimus Prime

513
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,670
You participated in city-level competitions

514
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,710
in junior high school

515
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,870
With such good conditions

516
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,190
and such a handsome appearance,

517
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,670
it's a waste not to play center

518
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,320
I won't play

519
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,630
I've been studying so hard lately

520
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,310
I wanna play games for a while

521
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,110
Isn't it fun?

522
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,870
I'll personally guide you to conquer the game

523
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,630
Honor of King

524
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,910
I'm really not interested

525
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,030
I'll personally play with you

526
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,470
This is the highest rank

527
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,830
I'll play with you for the whole semester

528
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,150
And a bottle of cola every day

529
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,910
Deal. Come for training every day

530
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,750
No problem

531
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,990
I announce

532
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,630
Class 2-5's basketball team

533
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,710
begins!

534
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,700
Great

535
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,750
So handsome

536
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,790
Let's go watch

537
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:53,550
We're here

538
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,310
What are you doing?

539
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,710
Class 1 formed a boy band called 188

540
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,310
They went to see Class 1

541
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,390
What?

542
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,950
How could they do this?

543
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,270
It's only you few who have good taste

544
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,430
Hurry, Xiaohua

545
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,830
My shoelace came undone

546
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,150
It took so long. Let's go

547
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,510
Hurry, let's go

548
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,630
Let's go, 188 boy band

549
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,190
I'm here

550
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,670
I'm here

551
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:18,830
I didn't expect Xiao Xiaohua

552
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,830
to be like this

553
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,350
They are all 188

554
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,950
What's wrong with being 188?

555
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,510
Impressive-looking but useless

556
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,710
We are talented

557
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,230
Exactly

558
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,470
We can't let them underestimate us

559
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:28,990
That's right

560
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,550
But we still need

561
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,550
brother Hui to train us

562
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,310
You can count on me

563
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,150
I've mastered all basketball tricks

564
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,390
Good

565
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,710
I'll go do some exercises first

566
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,070
What are you doing during self-study?

567
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,230
What are you doing?

568
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,030
In the whole grade building

569
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,030
Only you're chattering endlessly

570
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,950
Enough!

571
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,030
I have an announcement

572
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,950
In the last exam

573
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,270
if you fail three or more subjects

574
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,110
you are not allowed to participate in the basketball game

575
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,990
No, director

576
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,190
This is unfair

577
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,110
What's unfair about it?

578
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,350
No, the last exam...

579
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,910
What is the responsibility of a student?

580
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,310
Answer me

581
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:02,910
To study

582
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,070
Sit down

583
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,110
The final exams are coming soon

584
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,990
Feel the pressure

585
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,030
Let your grades speak

586
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,750
Xiaohua, I posted the letter

587
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,030
After I discovered that Xu Mengyu

588
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,830
had plagiarized

589
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,270
I thought she was wrong

590
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,670
So I made her plagiarism public

591
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:12,870
But I didn't expect

592
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,230
things would have happened to this

593
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,030
And I didn't expect you

594
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,510
to suffer so much

595
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,060
When you were criticized

596
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,750
I hesitated many times

597
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,070
if I should speak up

598
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,910
In the end, I dare not do it

599
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,670
But you did

600
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,670
You bravely stood up to protect me

601
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,070
Thank you

602
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,790
And Xiao Xiaohua

603
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,190
I'm sorry
