00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:51,790
Director

4
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,510
Come in

5
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,110
Director

6
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,270
As for the basketball team members

7
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,110
who failed three subjects

8
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,350
can't play in the game

9
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,510
I'd like to ask for

10
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,310
another chance for them

11
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,670
Give us another chance, please

12
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,150
What's the reason?

13
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,950
The whole grade is the same

14
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,270
Are you that special?

15
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,870
I can vouch for them

16
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,030
Ling Dong, let me remind you

17
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,190
You'd better not

18
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,630
get involved in this

19
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,110
Director

20
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,990
As Lan Jinghui's uncle,

21
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,070
and also

22
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,190
the leader of the study group

23
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,790
I should be responsible

24
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,230
for his academic performance

25
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,590
So I guarantee

26
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,350
that in the final exam

27
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,750
Lan Jinghui's ranking

28
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,550
can improve by 100 places

29
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,030
Please give him a chance

30
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,990
100? Are you crazy?

31
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,710
I have confidence in you

32
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,710
That's right, 100 places

33
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,710
Lan Jinghui, do you know

34
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,670
that in our school, we're pretty much

35
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,510
in the intense competition

36
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,270
With your current grades

37
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,630
It's almost an impossible task

38
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,070
Director

39
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,550
Please give me this chance

40
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,990
I can do it

41
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,310
Ling Dong, can he do it?

42
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,550
Of course

43
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,950
It seems that in your basketball team

44
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,150
apart from Lan Jinghui,

45
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,550
there are a few others

46
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,430
who don't meet the requirements

47
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,950
The others are the same

48
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,430
Okay

49
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,790
I really wanna see your skills

50
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,750
Lan Jinghui

51
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,910
Show me this time

52
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,070
Go back to the classroom

53
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,310
Thank you, Director

54
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,510
Ling Dong

55
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,430
Homing pigeons secrete pigeon milk to feed their chicks

56
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,190
And baby chicks follow their mother hen

57
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,430
and scratch the ground for food with their claws

58
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,350
Which one

59
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,830
is directly related to pituitary function

60
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,070
The homing pigeon feeding its chicks

61
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,790
is because the pituitary gland secretes prolactin

62
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,990
While the baby chicks are just imitating behavior

63
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,350
Got it

64
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,430
Ling Dong, what about this?

65
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,670
Can chlorine gas react with elemental sulfur

66
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,710
to form sulfur chloride?

67
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,470
Yes, it can

68
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,190
Chlorine gas can directly react with most

69
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,630
non-metallic elements,

70
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,230
including sulfur

71
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,950
to form disulfur dichloride

72
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,270
When there is excess chlorine gas

73
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,310
sulfur dichloride can be formed

74
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,310
Good

75
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,630
Ling Dong, in today's physics class

76
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,270
I didn't quite understand

77
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,470
the universal gravitation

78
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,030
It's simple

79
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,510
I understand now

80
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,830
There is an attractive force

81
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,110
between two objects

82
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,990
This attractive force

83
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,750
is universally present in

84
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,630
all things in the universe

85
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,070
This is called universal gravitation

86
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,710
Ling Dong, is that correct?

87
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,790
Basically yes

88
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,310
In the future, for these simple questions

89
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,510
Don't bother him

90
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,870
Bother me

91
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,870
Isn't this Lan Jinghui?

92
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,310
You're all here

93
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,670
And none of you passed

94
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,550
What to do now...

95
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,750
You can't even pass the tests

96
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,670
How can you

97
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,470
play basketball against our class?

98
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,910
Shouldn't we all

99
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,710
develop comprehensively

100
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,590
Right?

101
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,390
Brother Peng, we didn't pass either

102
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,710
Ling Dong

103
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,830
Can you help me with this?

104
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,870
How do you solve this problem?

105
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,670
Which one?

106
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,870
This... The first one

107
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,550
That's it all for today's lesson

108
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,110
There's a lot of content

109
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,470
You should review it again

110
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,470
Dismissed

111
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,350
Stand up

112
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,070
Goodbye, teacher

113
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,750
Mr. Guo

114
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,270
I might have

115
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:52,870
some other things recently

116
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,230
I don't have time temporarily

117
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,150
to attend the physics competition class

118
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,990
Does your head teacher know?

119
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,550
Ms. Fang already knows

120
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,230
Okay then

121
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,070
I'll give you the materials

122
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,790
for this period of time

123
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,390
Take a careful look at it at home

124
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,630
Ask me if you have any questions

125
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,950
Thank you, teacher

126
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,180
Ling Dong

127
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,950
I wanna talk to you properly

128
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,390
Why?

129
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,070
Don't you think I don't know that?

130
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,870
Actually, I know

131
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,310
why you quit the competition class

132
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,830
I just want you

133
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,630
to tell me in person

134
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,390
I don't need to report everything

135
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,030
to you, President Chen

136
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,630
Don't call me President

137
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,230
Since you hang out

138
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,590
with Lan Jinghui

139
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,190
You don't value me

140
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,510
as the student council president

141
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,550
This will affect you

142
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,270
Do you know that?

143
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,550
Whether it affects me or not

144
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,910
Seems like it has nothing to do with you

145
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,310
It does matter

146
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,750
Let me tell you, Ling Dong

147
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,270
In the entire grade 11

148
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,030
only you and I

149
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,310
The two of us

150
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,950
can truly be

151
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,310
academic competitors

152
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,110
If you willingly degrade yourself

153
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,990
and give up your future

154
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,270
Don't blame me for being impolite

155
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,070
Alright, how about this?

156
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,390
How about a bet?

157
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,750
What kind of bet?

158
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,340
This semester's final exams

159
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,190
If I can let Lan Jinghui's score

160
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,030
advance by a hundred places

161
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,950
And you, advance by just one place

162
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,430
Ling Dong, you've gone too far

163
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,830
It's really too much, Ling Dong

164
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,470
This is just too much

165
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,870
Come on

166
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,070
Lower your center of gravity. Don't rush

167
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,950
Take a breath and then shoot

168
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,070
Alright

169
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,310
Got it

170
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,510
Come on

171
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,430
All objects are subject to a

172
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,870
constant and unchanging force

173
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,790
The initial velocity

174
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,430
is not in the same line

175
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,430
as this force

176
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,590
Therefore, the object's trajectory

177
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,830
is a parabola

178
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,870
What are you saying, Brother Hui?

179
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,390
I don't know

180
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,110
Parabola

181
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,790
A basketball in the air

182
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,870
is only affected by gravity

183
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,070
its magnitude and direction remain unchanged

184
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,630
And the initial velocity's direction

185
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,830
is not collinear with gravity

186
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,710
So, the basketball's

187
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,990
trajectory in the air

188
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,390
is a parabola

189
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,790
As long as you get the principles

190
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,350
your shooting accuracy will greatly improve

191
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,910
Classmate

192
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,350
I didn't expect

193
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,470
that you're so capable

194
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,510
These are the essences

195
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,790
verified by countless scientists

196
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,350
If we apply them

197
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,070
to practical situations

198
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,870
it will greatly help improve

199
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,950
shooting accuracy

200
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,030
Can it improve accuracy?

201
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,270
So tell me more about it

202
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,230
What is this?

203
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,870
The parabolic principle?

204
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,790
In the math class this afternoon,

205
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,830
it's about the quadratic functions

206
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,870
It includes

207
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,870
knowledge in this area

208
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,390
You better listen carefully

209
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,630
I know

210
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,310
Listen to me

211
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:00,990
Ling Dong

212
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,070
Since you have such rich

213
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,190
knowledge and expertise

214
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,390
Why not

215
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,830
become our assistant coach

216
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,630
Right?

217
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,190
You have the knowledge, I have the skills

218
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,390
Let's join forces

219
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,350
We'll be unbeatable, right?

220
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,670
Yes, exactly

221
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,550
No, wait

222
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,430
Don't go

223
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,470
Can't you at least just say yes or no?

224
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,790
Assistant coach

225
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,830
Because I'm the head coach

226
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,710
No, no, no...

227
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,990
How about this?

228
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,310
Head coach

229
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,990
You're the head coach, okay?

230
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,710
It's all up to you

231
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,750
Is that okay?

232
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,190
Then it's up to you

233
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,830
No, it's all up to me

234
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,870
Why are you leaving?

235
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,590
No

236
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,510
At least stay and teach us more

237
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,190
Right?

238
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,110
You're the head coach

239
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,550
Right?

240
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,990
You...

241
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,790
No, why are you in such a hurry?

242
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,430
Where can you go?

243
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,510
Today is your first day at work

244
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,230
And you're already laid off

245
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,430
No, just stay

246
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,230
Let's take a look

247
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,470
at this standard equation

248
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,990
Y squared equals 2P

249
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,670
Here's a graph for you

250
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,790
In the plane, there is a point F

251
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,870
and a straight line L

252
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,150
Points where their distances are equal

253
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,270
are called the trajectory of a parabola

254
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,990
So, the fixed point F

255
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,670
is called the focus of the parabola

256
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,310
Lan Jinghui

257
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,590
Do you have any questions?

258
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:21,710
No

259
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,350
Ms. Fang, I think

260
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,190
you explained it very well

261
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,390
As if you opened

262
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,310
the door to a new world

263
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,790
Okay, please sit down and continue listening

264
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,070
Class

265
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,230
I just wrote down

266
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,910
the formula for

267
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,670
the focus of the standard equation

268
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,870
Take a good look at it

269
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,750
Take some notes

270
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,310
Review the content of this lesson

271
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,150
when you go back home

272
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,390
You'd better read the text first

273
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,870
Then find this type of

274
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,200
comprehension

275
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,630
Pay attention

276
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,750
to this question

277
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,510
An electron is excited

278
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,950
from the ground state to the excited state

279
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,430
requiring 9 eV of energy

280
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,230
So,

281
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,110
what wavelength of light is needed for the transition?

282
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,750
So who's gonna

283
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,310
come up and solve this question?

284
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:52,790
Teacher, my name is Ling Dong

285
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,430
Ling Dong

286
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,310
Call Lan Jinghui

287
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,830
Teacher is calling you

288
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,270
Lan Jinghui

289
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,110
Come up and solve this question

290
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,230
Why, can't you solve it?

291
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,470
Like this formula,

292
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,190
ε = hv,

293
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,190
it can be used to calculate

294
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,430
the energy needed

295
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,950
for an electron to be excited

296
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,110
from the ground state to the excited state

297
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,070
ε = hv

298
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,790
Yes

299
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,030
Even Lan Jinghui knows how to solve it

300
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,150
Really?

301
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,550
No way

302
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,630
I don't know how to solve it

303
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,790
Lan Jinghui answered it correctly

304
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,350
You may go back

305
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,550
Light is also an electromagnetic wave

306
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,510
And electromagnetic waves

307
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,070
are composed of energy quanta

308
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,590
Each energy quantum

309
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,070
carries energy of Hv

310
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,910
This is Planck's hypothesis

311
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,510
Here, v represents frequency

312
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:20,790
And H...

313
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,950
Anyone wanna join

314
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,910
the cheerleading team?

315
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,350
Come here to sign up

316
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,350
Will she be the captain?

317
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,590
Is she good enough for it?

318
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,790
Xiaohua participated in the talent show

319
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,790
and she even won prizes

320
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,870
What's wrong with that?

321
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,790
Last time it was because of Ling Dong

322
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,510
I wanna sign up

323
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,230
So do I

324
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,430
So do I

325
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,110
Qingtian, so do I

326
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,750
No, you're a boy

327
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,830
Look at you

328
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,150
Then, count me in

329
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,910
But nobody asked you

330
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,790
I'm just afraid

331
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,630
that you're not good at it

332
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,110
Then our class will be embarrassed

333
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,630
Shushu knows ballet

334
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,510
with good body shape

335
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,790
But I'm not good at choreography

336
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,470
What should we do then?

337
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,430
Wait, I think of someone

338
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,310
She will definitely do it

339
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,190
Mengyu

340
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,150
I knew you would be here

341
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,230
I don't know why but...

342
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,790
recently, I just like to

343
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,190
come to the rooftop and daydream

344
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,390
Is there something?

345
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,990
The basketball competition

346
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,310
is about to begin

347
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,670
I wanna invite you

348
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,790
to join our cheerleading team

349
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,390
Why did you come to me?

350
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,030
Can you really trust me

351
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,110
to lead the team?

352
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,630
You know

353
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,150
Besides being tone-deaf

354
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,550
I'm not even good at dancing

355
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,750
What if we'll get laughed

356
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,790
by others

357
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,230
Do you really need me?

358
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,470
Being so indecisive

359
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,030
It's not the Xu Mengyu I know

360
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,470
Alright, I'll agree

361
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,950
But let's make it clear

362
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,950
If I join the cheerleading team

363
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,030
you'll have to listen to me

364
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,950
Music, costumes, dances

365
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,190
All need to be well-designed

366
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,870
Okay, it's a deal

367
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,790
It's a deal

368
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,870
Four, two, three, four

369
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,310
Five, six, seven, eight

370
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,110
Five, two, three, four

371
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,470
Five, six, seven, eight

372
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,790
Six, two, three, four

373
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,910
Alright, everyone look at this problem

374
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,390
Given A is greater than 0

375
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,350
B is less than 0

376
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,630
And A is not equal to B

377
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,670
You're so considerate

378
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,670
Just have some drinks

379
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,350
Be quick

380
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,070
Here's yours

381
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,110
Thanks

382
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,790
Qingtian

383
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,710
Jia Letian

384
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,790
I don't know

385
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,430
Nope

386
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,990
Okay

387
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,270
Then let me explain it to you

388
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,430
Two, two, three, four

389
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,310
Xiaohua, that's not

390
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,350
the right movement

391
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,950
Shift your center of gravity back

392
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,510
Six, seven, eight

393
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,350
Two, two, three, four

394
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,270
Five, six, seven

395
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,030
Mr. Zhao

396
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,430
Ms. Fang, do you have time?

397
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,350
Yes, I do

398
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,070
Well, here's the thing

399
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,310
I have a small favor to ask

400
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,310
I want you to help

401
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,550
What's the matter with you, Ms. Fang?

402
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,470
Just tell me

403
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,110
Well, the basketball game

404
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,070
is coming up

405
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,190
So I was wondering if you could

406
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,430
spare some time

407
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,870
to give some guidance

408
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,550
to our Class 5

409
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,590
This is...

410
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,990
Is it difficult to handle?

411
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,110
Ms. Fang

412
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,070
Actually, it's not fair

413
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,670
If I only help Class 5,

414
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,030
without helping other classes,

415
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,430
it doesn't sound good

416
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:50,990
That's right

417
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,150
Forget it. I'll leave now

418
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:53,670
Take your time

419
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:55,590
Ms. Fang

420
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,590
I'll think of a way

421
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,950
Five, six, seven, eight

422
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,670
One, two, three, four

423
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,590
Five, six, seven, eight

424
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,150
Two, two, three, four

425
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,870
Five, six, seven, eight

426
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,670
Three, two, three, four

427
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,230
Five, six, seven, eight

428
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,870
Four, two, three, four

429
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,270
Five, six, seven, eight

430
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,270
Five, two

431
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,310
Are you finished practicing?

432
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,390
Finish and leave quickly

433
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,910
We need the space

434
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,190
Xiao Xiaohua

435
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,590
Just leave quickly

436
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,190
No way

437
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,750
What did you say?

438
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,190
We're already here first

439
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,670
And, my name is Xiao Xiaohua

440
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,430
Don't get the name wrong

441
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,390
You've been using the space for so long

442
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,270
Now it's our turn

443
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,110
Yes

444
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,510
This space is so big

445
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,990
Can't you just practice over there?

446
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,030
Why?

447
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,750
You've been using it for so long

448
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,070
And we're just here

449
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,110
What's so great about having more people?

450
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,230
You've practiced for so long

451
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,430
Yet you didn't do that good

452
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,510
Why occupy the space?

453
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,710
It's our turn now

454
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,070
Why don't you just stop it?

455
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,550
Are you bullying us?

456
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,230
Move aside

457
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,950
What are you doing?

458
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,550
They've been occupying the space all along

459
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,030
They won't let us use

460
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,310
What do you mean occupying?

461
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,750
It's our turn now

462
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,430
Then make them move

463
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,630
How do we make them?

464
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,830
Yes

465
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,150
This doesn't even belong to you

466
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,190
Say that again

467
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,630
So what?

468
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,350
Can you just shut up?

469
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,390
I told you to move aside

470
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,070
Brother Hui

471
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,430
Lan Jinghui

472
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,190
Brother Hui

473
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:17,870
Apologize

474
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:19,990
What did you say?

475
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:20,990
I told you

476
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,390
to apologize to the girls in our class

477
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,670
What if I'll say no?

478
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,750
Lan Jinghui

479
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,190
I've had enough of you

480
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,710
Are you looking for a beating?

481
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,070
Are you looking for a beating?

482
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,470
Come on

483
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,150
Come on

484
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,830
Enough

485
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,350
Stop arguing

486
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,390
Is there gonna be a fight?

487
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,030
What's going on?

488
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,470
Everyone, just calm down

489
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,270
Ms. Chai

490
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,790
They've been occupying the space

491
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,350
We also need to rehearse

492
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,790
What do you mean, occupying?

493
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,030
It's a public space

494
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,950
Alright, stop arguing

495
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,430
Let me ask you

496
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,710
Which class was using the space just now?

497
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,710
Our class

498
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,310
Teacher

499
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,590
It was originally ours to use

500
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,990
But...

501
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,830
Alright, fine

502
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,510
Since your class

503
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,510
has already used the space

504
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,550
then it's time for another class

505
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,070
to use it

506
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,470
We haven't finished practicing yet

507
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,670
Alright

508
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,990
Just calm down, okay?

509
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,230
Let's take turns using it, okay?

510
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,550
Students from class 8, hurry up

511
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,910
Hurry up and leave

512
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,110
No manners

513
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,230
Class 5, take a break for a while

514
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,430
Class 8, start training

515
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,310
Hurry up

516
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,630
Don't let it affect your mood

517
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,550
Class 8, let's train hard and cheer up

518
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,590
Why didn't you let me speak just now?

519
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,430
They've gone too far

520
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:43,790
Exactly

521
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,710
The most despicable one is Bi Peng

522
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,430
He's impolite

523
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,590
He even hit girls

524
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,030
If Ms. Chai isn't here

525
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,950
I'll definitely do something

526
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,190
Alright

527
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,910
Do you wanna be expelled?

528
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,150
If you don't want it,

529
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:56,830
then think about

530
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,110
how to win the competition

531
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,830
Ling Dong is right

532
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,190
We should now

533
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,950
win against Class 8

534
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,190
Then hold the trophy

535
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,310
and go to their class

536
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,390
Xiao Xiaohua

537
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,630
You're so much different

538
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,710
while talking now

539
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,950
Is it?

540
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,270
We'd better think about

541
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,470
how to win against Class 8

542
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,590
Easier said than done

543
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,590
They're the expected champion winner

544
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,510
Don't let others' spirit

545
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,470
reduce our own confidence

546
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,550
Every dog has its day

547
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,030
We need to be confident

548
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,510
Brother Hui is right

549
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,910
I should be holding

550
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,590
the championship trophy

551
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,550
and let them see

552
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,990
Ms. Chai is still with their side

553
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,190
Let's go

554
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,630
Let's go

555
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,270
Nice shot

556
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:49,990
What's going on?

557
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:50,790
Defend!

558
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,550
I can't even do that

559
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,310
Amazing!

560
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,510
Ms. Fang

561
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,990
What are these things?

562
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,830
The basketball game

563
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,910
is about to start

564
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,190
I prepared props

565
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:00,990
for our cheerleading team

566
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,870
In my opinion,

567
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,270
all this preparation is unnecessary

568
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,950
It affects the students' attention

569
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,110
It affects their studies

570
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,390
I think

571
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,950
they should study seriously

572
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,870
when they need

573
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,350
Of course, when it's time to play,

574
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,350
we should enjoy ourselves

575
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,550
Anyway, you're still young

576
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,910
The students in our class

577
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,750
are very self-disciplined

578
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,350
I don't even need to worry about them at all

579
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,190
Some of them

580
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,350
handle cheerleading matters

581
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,590
Some of them win the game

582
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,110
I don't have to worry at all

583
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,190
I trust them completely

584
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,790
I'd say...

585
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,070
You shouldn't even

586
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,990
have appointed Lan Jinghui

587
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,590
as captain

588
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,350
He's such careless and foolish

589
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,630
How can he lead a team

590
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,710
How can he manage the teammates

591
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:41,830
Good

592
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,670
Ms. Fang

593
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,030
I'm talking to you

594
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,070
Why are you so distracted?

595
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,470
No, I'm not

596
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:52,910
Ms. Chai

597
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,110
Just now, I was thinking

598
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,070
why did you even say that?

599
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,470
I didn't mean anything else

600
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,510
I know

601
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,350
I'm not that experienced as you

602
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:05,830
I'm still young

603
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,830
But I have a different opinion

604
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,710
from you

605
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,190
First of all,

606
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:09,670
I don't think

607
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,710
Lan Jinghui is careless and foolish

608
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,630
Of course, I don't think

609
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,070
he's fooling around as captain

610
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,390
After all, you don't know him

611
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,270
What reason do you have

612
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,950
to say he's not capable?

613
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,470
Well

614
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,390
Why is it raining heavier?

615
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,110
I'm going back first

616
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,190
Lan Jinghui, go for it!

617
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,670
Come on

618
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,710
Class 5, let's go!

619
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,430
Class 5, we must win!

620
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,430
Class 5, we must win!

621
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,310
Class 5, we must win!

622
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,230
Class 1's overall strength

623
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:01,910
is average

624
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,830
But those tall players on the other team

625
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,350
are particularly difficult to defend

626
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,190
Especially their center

627
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:04,910
We need to pressurize him

628
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,990
Ma Yiming, Jian Zhiqiang

629
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,030
You two should cooperate

630
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,710
But try to minimize

631
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,390
get the ball

632
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:11,990
Keep him away from the penalty area

633
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,710
Xu Chao

634
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,870
We'll rely on you during the game

635
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,430
Everyone, relax

636
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,550
They're not that scary

637
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,710
Show the level of your usual training

638
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,190
That's okay

639
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,270
Don't worry

640
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,510
We weren't afraid to begin with

641
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,870
With Chen Jun's brilliance

642
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,310
Okay, come on

643
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,950
Class 5, let's get it

644
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:29,630
Come on

645
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,390
Come on

646
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,070
Three, two, one

647
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,110
Class 5, win

648
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,750
Come on

649
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,990
Come on, class 5

650
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,230
Class 5

651
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,950
Class 5, come on

652
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,150
Go, class 5

653
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,230
Brother Hui, take it

654
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,590
Good

655
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,950
Defend, Ma Yiming

656
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,270
Foul

657
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:28,990
Reasonable collision

658
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,590
Come on

659
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,910
Come on, Class 1

660
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:31,950
Come on

661
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,510
It's been three minutes since the start

662
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,630
No goals yet

663
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,310
Both teams are eager to win

664
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,750
If it continues like this

665
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,390
physical energy will be consumed quickly

666
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,110
Come on

667
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,230
Come on

668
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,710
With Ling Dong's shooting secret,

669
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,510
our shooting accuracy

670
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,550
will definitely improve greatly

671
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,030
X equals 2PX

672
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,030
P is greater than 0

673
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,190
F0 equals 1/2P

674
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,430
Y equals negative 1/2P

675
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,030
Let's try again

676
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,990
Coach

677
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,990
Who's the coach?

678
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,630
Coach

679
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,150
Lan Jinghui

680
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,350
Yes, Lan Jinghui

681
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:52,750
Coach

682
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,070
Coach, please don't leave

683
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,350
Teach us some more
