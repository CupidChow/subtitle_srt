2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,010
Let's go!

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,520
Mr. Aran

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,880
please stay calm.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,370
Besides the missing necklace,

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,100
the jewelry we got back from the debtor, the model,

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,250
has all been swapped with fakes.

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,400
Argh.

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,100
What on earth is going on?

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,340
Why am I even paying you?

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,950
You can’t even catch a single thief!

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,070
If you can’t find them,

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,010
and my father hears about this,

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,010
You, you, and you

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,000
You’re all dead, for sure!

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,240
Hurry up, go quickly!

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,340
Rak, Yom, you two come with me.

18
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,770
And you, make sure you handle this.

19
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,770
Don’t mess it up!

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,100
Let’s go.

21
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,240
Hey, stop right there!

22
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,430
Hey, stop!

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,370
Where do you think you’re going?

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,430
We’ve found him—third floor.

25
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,600
We’ve got him!

26
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,700
It’s you, isn’t it?

27
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,240
Jack!

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
Why does it always have to be you?

29
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,920
Each year, over a hundred thousand students compete

30
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,490
to achieve their dreams.

31
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,970
But how many will actually succeed?

32
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,300
What you see in front of you

33
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,329
are this year’s admission exam papers.

34
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,950
As you probably already know,

35
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,640
I am one of the five professors who created these admission exam questions.

36
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,000
So today, we will be studying these actual questions,

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,150
along with the methods to solve them and the correct answers.

38
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,010
One rule: none of you are allowed

39
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,590
to take any notes on these questions out of this room!

40
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,740
Do you understand?

41
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,210
Hey, you in the glasses, are you listening to me?

42
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,420
Sorry, teacher.

43
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,130
I was just lost in thought.

44
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,460
Then try answering this for me:

45
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,650
Out of one hundred thousand students,

46
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,660
what do you think is the probability that every student who takes my course will pass?

47
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,930
A high probability.

48
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,350
Do you think my course is a joke?

49
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,019
Do you realize how many students would love to be in your seat right now?

50
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,980
I’ve carefully selected

51
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,820
only the smartest and most dedicated students to join my course.

52
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,340
If that’s the kind of answer you’re going to give,

53
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,810
then just leave.

54
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,810
Go home.

55
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,310
Have you dropped your wallet?

56
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,780
Answer me!!!

57
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,010
Students who take my extra classes have..

58
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,010
A one-in-thirty-two chance of passing the exam.

59
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,250
Yeah.

60
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,450
Now that’s more like it.

61
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,450
This isn’t a game.

62
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,970
Alright, today

63
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,370
we’re going to review the concepts of sin, cos, and tan.

64
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,040
Wait, where did the exam papers go?

65
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,880
Teacher,

66
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,130
I don’t think this course is really suited for me.

67
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,430
I’m leaving.

68
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,240
Hey,

69
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Isn’t that my exam paper?

70
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,930
What? I didn’t steal anything!

71
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,170
It was just lying here.

72
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,120
What’s going on?

73
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,780
How could you steal it?
Steal?

74
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,350
Come on, calm down!
How could you do this?

75
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,890
It was like this already.

76
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,360
Stop, stop!
It was already like this, professor.

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,400
What are you quarreling about?
He blames me.

78
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,230
This is my exam paper!

79
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,880
What exam paper?

80
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,470
What's missing?

81
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:57,100
If I remember all of this, what do you think my chances of passing would be?

82
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,770
Two out of five—that’s my chance

83
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,770
of making it through to the final selection for the national team.

84
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,580
I really want to be part of the national team.

85
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,650
I hope the judges will show me some mercy.

86
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,360
By the way, who are you?

87
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,920
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.

88
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,090
My name is Jack.

89
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,420
Good!

90
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,420
Kick, kick, good!

91
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,990
Hey Jack, seriously,

92
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,990
why do you have to do the Bruce Lee voice?

93
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,030
Oh man, Coach, it’s called making an impression.

94
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,030
That way, the judges will remember me.

95
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,120
I’ll do anything to make it onto the national team.

96
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
I'd do it all.

97
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,370
To be honest, you’ve got a real shot.

98
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,850
Look around, the others can’t hold a candle to you.

99
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,180
Are we talking about my looks, Coach?

100
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,300
I mean your determination to succeed, man!

101
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,430
Well, Coach,

102
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,770
but life just keeps throwing punches back at me.

103
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,330
This is my last year as a youth player,

104
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,340
so please, just let me make the national team once.

105
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,550
Then I can finally pay off all my debts and live comfortably.

106
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,820
And how do you know that making the national team will make you rich?

107
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,480
I don't know.

108
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,680
But one thing I know for sure—it’s better than now.

109
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,770
Hey, Coach, it’s already 4 PM!

110
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,110
Four o'clock? Four o'clock! I’ve got to go to my part-time job.

111
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,560
I’m not changing, Coach.

112
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,610
See you later.

113
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,940
Go, go, take care.

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
How's your tutoring going?

115
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,850
Same as usual.

116
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,140
The teacher isn’t really following the curriculum,

117
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,830
but I did manage to get some hints for the exam.

118
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,330
Fish.

119
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,270
If all you got were hints for the exam,

120
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,930
you’re still not going to pass

121
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,450
if you don’t understand the material.

122
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,870
Just leave him.

123
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,770
If he doesn’t pass again this year,

124
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,429
then let him go out and earn his own money.

125
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,700
Your younger brother never made me spend a dime on extra tutoring.

126
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,730
Oh, Top, you’re just in time, I already put rice on the plate for you.

127
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,970
Let’s have dinner.
Yes, Mom.

128
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,920
So, Top, how was the first week back at school?

129
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,500
The material isn’t too heavy yet, Dad.

130
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,020
Nothing much.

131
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,160
If there's anything you don't understand, you can ask me.

132
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Yes, sir.

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,390
You should share some of that intelligence with your brother.

134
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,070
Sometimes, when he does something foolish,

135
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,460
I can’t help but wonder if I’m raising someone else’s kid.

136
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,450
He didn’t get anything from either of us.

137
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,560
Why can’t you handle a little criticism?

138
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,660
Honey, calm down.

139
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,500
Yelling won’t do any good.

140
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Come on, Top, let’s eat.

141
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,940
Raising him was a waste of time.

142
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,470
I think we should just watch TV instead.

143
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,130
(We now continue with the ongoing robbery case that the police suspect)

144
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,420
(might be the work of the so-called thieft "Joker.")

145
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,400
(Yesterday, around 4 PM,)

146
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,090
(there was a solo robbery at a noodle shop,)

147
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,540
(where several hundred thousand baht worth of gold chains, cash,
and watches were stolen.)

148
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,420
(The only clue left behind was a spray-painted frown.)

149
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,960
(Police have linked this symbol)

150
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,040
(to five previous unsolved robbery cases.)

151
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,490
(Some are even speculating that this thief might be a hero who stands for justice.)

152
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,630
(Local residents claim)

153
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,960
(that the noodle shop was just a front,)

154
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,070
(and that it was actually involved in shady dealings, purchasing stolen goods.)

155
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,390
This thief is pretty cool, huh?

156
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,000
Have some fish, honey.

157
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,530
Eat up.

158
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
You guys are training early.

159
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Didn't even invite me.

160
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,000
It's not training.

161
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's more like getting beaten up.

162
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
Enough, man. That’s enough.

163
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,650
What's wrong with you?

164
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,580
There's still time left, just hang in there.

165
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,000
What’s the deal?

166
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,200
Isn't this too much?

167
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,930
I’m training too, you know.

168
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,750
If you want to train, why not find someone more at your level?

169
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,150
Who’s that?

170
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,000
Huh?

171
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
You?

172
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,370
What kind of move is that?

173
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,370
You look like a kid just learning Taekwondo.

174
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,430
Are you really a black belt? Huh?

175
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
In that case, you’re probably a white belt.

176
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,900
Not bad for a rookie.

177
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,510
So, what’s up?

178
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,510
Want to train some more?

179
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,200
Huh?

180
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,910
Let's have another go.

181
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
Nah, I’m done for today.

182
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,960
I'm just too lazy, and no matter what, you can't beat me.

183
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,850
Feeling tough, huh?

184
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,570
What’s going on here?

185
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,710
Face it, you’ll never beat me.

186
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,090
Our family backgrounds aren’t the same.

187
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,130
My family has supported me since I was a kid.

188
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,760
But your family? They probably can't do much more than this.

189
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Don’t you dare insult my family!

190
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,680
Damn it!

191
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,830
Stop it!

192
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,270
That’s enough, Jack.

193
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
But he started it!

194
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Carbon.

195
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,480
My guy here might not have been the best host.

196
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,490
I apologize for that.

197
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
Why are you bowing to him, Coach?

198
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,200
Jack,

199
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,040
this is Mr. Carbon,

200
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,300
the son of a politician who supports this gym.

201
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,300
He’s going to be training here too.

202
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Apologize to him.

203
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
It’s okay, Coach.

204
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,280
It’s not like I just stood there taking hits.

205
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
I gave him a beating too.

206
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,849
So, let's call it even, alright?

207
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:12,369
Hey.

208
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,170
I'd have to apologize again.

209
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,840
I'm back, Grandma.

210
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,380
You're back just in time, I just finished cooking.

211
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,310
It's hot and fresh—come sit down and eat.

212
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,520
Great! How was practice with your friends today?

213
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,740
Were your opponents able to keep up with you?

214
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,620
Oh, Grandma, no one can defeat Jack the Invincible!

215
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,620
There's no one out there who can take me down.

216
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,770
No one.

217
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,500
Then what happened to your eyebrow?

218
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,350
Oh, this?

219
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,220
Well, you see, I was doing some fancy flips,

220
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,890
and I landed a hit on my opponent’s neck

221
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,690
But when I was coming down, I didn’t land so well.

222
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,410
Did it hurt?

223
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,440
This?

224
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,180
Just a little, Grandma, nothing to worry about.

225
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,000
Why?

226
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm sorry, Jack,

227
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,830
that I'm not wealthier,

228
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,000
and that you have to struggle like this.

229
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,220
Wait, Grandma, what’s this about?

230
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,430
Why are you getting all dramatic out of nowhere?

231
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,700
I never said I was struggling!

232
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,700
Really.

233
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,050
I’m so mad at myself.

234
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,380
Grandma, what are you doing?

235
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,000
Having only one grandchild,

236
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,550
and I can’t even take care of you well enough to make you happy.

237
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,330
Oh...

238
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,190
You have to struggle like this.

239
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,320
Grandma.

240
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,880
I should be angrier at himself than at you, Grandma.

241
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,150
You're almost seventy,

242
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,150
and you still have to wake up early to sell chive dumplings.

243
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,800
But don't worry, Grandma—Jack here

244
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,670
will be the one to help pay off Dad and Mom's debts.

245
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,040
No need to worry.

246
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,520
But why do you have to pay off a debt you didn’t even create?

247
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,080
I told you, Grandma, don't worry about it.

248
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,290
Besides, even if we’re poor,

249
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,440
you still have me, your incredibly handsome Jack!

250
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,450
How about this, Grandma?

251
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,840
I'll find a rich girlfriend

252
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,460
to pay off the debt.

253
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
I’ll even put our bank account number on a sign-out front!

254
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,840
Don’t joke around like that.

255
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,860
Actually, that doesn’t sound like a bad idea, Jack.

256
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,860
Do you want to try that?

257
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,510
Wait, what? I was just joking! Why are you taking it seriously?

258
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,510
You only have one grandchild.

259
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,510
I'm not talking to you anymore.

260
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,000
Why did you only bring chicken tendons and cashews?

261
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I have gout, you know.

262
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,040
Well, look, Grandma, all you have is stir-fried chive dumplings and liver.

263
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
I'm getting tired of eating the same thing too.

264
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,710
Let's eat together!

265
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,240
Aren't you used to it?

266
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,790
I'm used to it, that's why I'm bored.

267
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,640
Let's eat.

268
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,310
Here.

269
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,930
One piece won't hurt, right?

270
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,080
Eat a lot, dear. Make sure you're full.

271
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,780
Joke, how did your exam results go?

272
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,430
He's locked himself in his room.

273
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,430
Don't tell me you failed the exam again.

274
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,910
Joke,

275
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,070
open the door right now!

276
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,440
Are you trying to avoid me or what?

277
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,460
Open the door!

278
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Go get the key.

279
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
What on earth are you doing?

280
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,260
I'm just trying to figure out

281
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,260
how to tell you and Mom.

282
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
Don't tell me that you...

283
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,660
I passed the exam.

284
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,910
That's amazing, Joke!

285
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,490
You're the best, my dear!

286
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,420
I'm so proud of you, son.

287
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,000
We definitely need to celebrate tonight.

288
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,010
That's my boy!

289
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,910
Woohoo!

290
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,830
Hey, our best friend made the national team, we need to celebrate!

291
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,100
Which place should we go to?

292
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
I think we should go to a place nearby.

293
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,540
Let's eat to our hearts' content, it's on me.

294
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,500
But we're not even old enough to get in.

295
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,830
Will we even be allowed?

296
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,730
Who do you think I am?

297
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,680
Let's go!

298
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,490
I'm sorry.

299
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,570
About what?

300
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:09,610
That I couldn't help you make it onto the national team.

301
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,640
Maybe it was just meant to be this way from the start.

302
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,190
You're really talented, Jack.

303
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,050
But the only reason you couldn't go further is because you're poor.

304
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,990
If you were as rich as Carbon,

305
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,990
you could afford top coaches

306
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,240
and train in better gyms.

307
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:35,780
Coach, even if I can't beat Carbon,

308
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,940
does that really mean my skills

309
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,710
aren't good enough for the national team?

310
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,230
Carbon doesn't like you,

311
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,540
so the judges were too afraid to vote for you to join the national team with him.

312
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,180
He's the favorite this year anyway.

313
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,520
Then don't blame my poverty, Coach.

314
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,560
Blame your own principles.

315
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:11,170
You don't understand how conflicted I feel.

316
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,270
I know, Coach.

317
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,270
I understand everything.

318
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,380
And I also know how terrifying the power of money can be.

319
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,470
If you had chosen me,

320
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,930
Coach, you would have lost Carbon's father's support.

321
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,580
But you need to understand me too, Coach.

322
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,300
If from now on, I start hating you.

323
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,110
Hey, guys, let's raise our glasses!

324
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,140
Cheers!
Come on,

325
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,560
drink up!

326
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,310
You've had so much to drink, do you need me to take you home?

327
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,890
Can you take me home?

328
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,210
No problem.

329
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,570
Are you drunk too?

330
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,440
Yes, I am.

331
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,450
Hey, waiter!

332
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,230
Yeah, you!

333
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,320
Fill up my glass, would you?

334
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,710
Make it strong this time,

335
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,680
it’s as weak as your face!

336
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,480
Hey, waiter, why don’t you have a drink with us?

337
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Come on, join us!

338
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,160
You know, this guy here

339
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,420
is actually my friend.

340
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,420
We’ve done Taekwondo together.

341
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,470
But do you guys know something?

342
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,320
The truth is, my friend here doesn’t come from a wealthy family.

343
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
Oh.
But he's a hard worker, you know.

344
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:10,000
It's just a shame he didn't make the cut.

345
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,210
That's why he's stuck working this part-time job.

346
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,890
Hey, come on, get a glass and drink with us.

347
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,360
It's on me.

348
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
Yeah, yeah.

349
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,370
Go grab a glass.
Come one.

350
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,260
there's space here for you.

351
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,260
Well?

352
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,000
No, thanks.

353
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,630
I need to check on the other tables.

354
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,780
Forget it, let’s just raise our glasses.

355
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,780
Cheers!

356
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,190
Can you top me off?

357
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,740
Sure thing.

358
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,220
Keep it going,

359
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,970
let's go all out.

360
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,740
Here you go.

361
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,530
Did you come here alone?

362
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,350
Had a rough day?

363
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,050
Probably no different from yours.

364
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,250
Let's go, this is a strong one!

365
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,250
Got bullied by your friends?

366
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,130
No, not my friends.

367
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,680
Come on,

368
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,580
drink up, drink up!

369
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,730
If I get drunk and start acting like those dumbasses,

370
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,700
make sure to tell me, okay?

371
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:16,080
You? Act like a dumbass?

372
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,080
I don’t think that’s possible.

373
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,560
Oh, it is.

374
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,040
Really?

375
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,250
But the people we act like that towards

376
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,000
are bad people anyway,

377
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
so it doesn’t matter.

378
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,150
Tell me more about it.

379
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,030
Only if you pour yourself a glass too.

380
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,850
No, thanks.

381
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,540
What I mean is...

382
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,010
I’ve never had a drink before.

383
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,040
Plus, I’m underage.

384
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,360
How about this, I’ll pour for you,

385
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,730
Come on.

386
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,860
And I’ll just drink water.

387
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,920
Alright, pour it down your mouth!

388
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,340
Go! Go! Go!

389
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,500
Yeah, so that guy made it to the national team,

390
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,080
and here I am, just a busboy. End of story.

391
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,510
Shall we spin the bottle again?

392
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,250
Sure.

393
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,120
Hey...

394
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,510
Come on!

395
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,030
Dare.

396
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:01,200
Dare again?

397
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,040
That's no fun.

398
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,150
Dare anything to me, and I'll do it all.

399
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,780
How about a truth instead?

400
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,570
Isn't the person who spins supposed to choose?

401
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,570
Yeah, but...

402
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,820
Come on, truth, please.

403
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,820
Please,

404
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,440
please, please—truth!

405
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Alright, ask anything you want.

406
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,080
Finally!

407
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,110
Um..

408
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,360
So, what's been stressing you out?

409
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,630
Heartbroken?

410
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,650
I told my family that I passed the medical entrance exam.

411
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,280
Oh, I thought it was something else.

412
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,000
That’s good, then why are you sitting here feeling sad?

413
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,530
But actually, I didn’t pass.

414
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,060
I was just afraid they’d be disappointed,

415
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,060
so I lied.

416
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,070
But after lying, it got even worse.

417
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,680
It turns out they liked something I’m not.

418
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:16,110
Now it feels like I'm living in this world alone, with a story I made up.

419
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,160
But now you’ve told me this, right?

420
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,660
So that means in this world you created,

421
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,660
there’s me too.

422
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,610
I believe that someday,

423
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:50,000
your family will accept and value you they way you are.

424
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:57,860
So, someday you won’t have to lie to anyone anymore.

425
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:09,770
See, now you’re smiling and looking so much cuter.

426
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:27,280
So, from now on, don’t frown anymore, okay?

427
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,270
Smile.

428
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:40,000
Jack, go check on your friends' table.

429
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,239
They are drunk, you can settle the bill.

430
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,840
Okay, I got it.

431
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,489
Wait a minute, I’ll be right back.

432
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,830
Hey, where’s my wallet?

433
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,480
Hey, did you see if it’s behind?
Where is it?

434
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
Did it fall?

435
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,870
Can you really accept me?

436
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,130
Because the thing I do best

437
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,160
is this.

438
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,510
Help!

439
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,830
Help!

440
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,070
Help! Help!

441
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,550
Anyone, please help!

442
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,180
Help!

443
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,300
Help!

444
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,720
Help!

445
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,730
What?

446
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,340
Help me, the thief is coming after me.

447
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,600
There he comes.

448
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,240
Get behind me.
Okay.

449
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,340
Stop right there.

450
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:02,130
If you want to bother this woman,

451
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,900
You’ll have to go over my dead body first.

452
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,060
Isn’t that an old-fashioned saying?

453
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,820
I couldn’t think of anything else.

454
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,210
What did you say?

455
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,210
I have to step over your dead body first, right?

456
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,280
Sorry, bro.

457
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,000
Go ahead.

458
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,060
How can you leave me like this? Help me first!

459
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,690
Oh, three people, six feets, I'm not doing that.

460
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,960
And you want me to do it alone? Help me first!

461
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,170
Just do something, anything, quickly!

462
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,170
Anything?

463
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,900
Hey, do you know that today,

464
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:15,380
I got selected for the national youth taekwondo team?

465
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,950
If you don’t want to get hurt,

466
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,640
Just leave and stop bothering us.

467
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,750
Hey, what he’s saying might be true.

468
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,040
It seems like the national team is celebrating around here.

469
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,360
Yeah, we’re drinking over at that bar.

470
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,890
But if you’re really hungry for some ass beating,

471
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:37,740
let me give it to you.

472
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,920
Just a sec.

473
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,920
Hello, we have a situation.

474
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,430
It’s on the alley next to the bar.

475
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,430
How many of us are there? Twelve, right?

476
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:52,400
Huh, twenty-two?

477
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Then get everyone here.

478
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,840
Don’t forget to bring bottles.

479
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,110
Things are looking bad, we should head back.

480
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,680
Oh, just because you’re big, you’re trying to intimidate me?

481
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,160
He probably doesn’t know my taekwondo nickname.

482
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,440
My nickname is “Joke the Giant Slayer.”

483
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,440
Three times bigger than me,

484
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,610
but I took him down.

485
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,560
I’ll smash his face.

486
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,330
Let’s go.

487
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,970
Hey, national team guy,

488
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,550
Do you know taekwondo doesn’t kick across weight classes?

489
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,640
Oh, really?

490
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,810
I didn’t know that.

491
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,190
The plan’s ruined.

492
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,810
Count to three and then run.

493
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,720
One.

494
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,120
Hey!
Already gone.

495
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,690
Wow, so now you can run fast?

496
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,640
I went out of my way to help.

497
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,240
Hey, you two, follow the woman.

498
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,000
I’ll deal with this bragger myself.

499
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,510
Let me see your skills to prove if you're really on the national team.

500
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,720
Hey.

501
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,860
I really can’t help people.

502
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,230
Help!

503
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,540
Ouch.

504
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,210
Don’t come any closer.

505
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,940
Help!

506
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,770
Someone help!

507
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,120
Hey, are you okay?

508
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,160
Hey, are you okay?

509
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,940
You should stand up first.

510
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,830
Are you alright?

511
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,450
Does it hurt anywhere?

512
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Oh, no.

513
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,230
Thank you.

514
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,010
Hey.

515
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,280
Ouch.

516
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Stop kicking me.

517
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,300
I’m completely beaten up.

518
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,320
The round isn’t even over yet.

519
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,760
In case you hit me in the final moments.

520
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,890
National taekwondo team.

521
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,630
You're really rubbing it in.

522
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,940
You really cleared me up.

523
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,560
Oh, really with a stick too?

524
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,960
Hey, hey.

525
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,080
Hey, hey, stop already or he'll die.

526
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,200
Come on.

527
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,330
Hey, hey.

528
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,450
Are you okay?

529
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,040
I’m fine.

530
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,070
Hold on.

531
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,080
You’re not really good at fighting, and you thought of going to help him?

532
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,240
Didn’t talk to us.

533
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
But I’m really fine.

534
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,180
Well, that’s good.

535
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
Did you hear what I said?

536
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,120
Um, got it.

537
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,800
By the way, was it cool earlier?

538
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,130
Oh, if we’re rating coolness,

539
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,900
I’d give you a full ten for bravery.

540
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,490
But next time, don’t get into trouble like this again.

541
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,560
Yeah, got it.

542
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,250
So, should we go to the hospital?

543
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,900
Just a minor wound, it’s fine.

544
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,800
Oh.

545
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,280
If it’s fine,

546
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,780
The more I clean it, the worst it gets. You do it.

547
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,280
Oops.

548
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,490
As for you, do you need to go to the hospital?

549
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,410
I'm totally fine.

550
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,140
That's great.

551
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,130
You're the only one who is messed up.

552
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,100
Actually, there are a lot of people

553
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,740
who want to kidnap me for ransom.

554
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,920
But my father doesn’t like me going anywhere alone.

555
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,450
If I go out, I have to have a bodyguard with me.

556
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,450
But I felt suffocated,

557
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,320
so I ran away.

558
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,630
Oh, what a mess.

559
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,630
Not much different.

560
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:27,060
You know, my father is actually a big shot,

561
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,060
more than you’d expect.

562
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,030
Well, you can return it to me later if you want.

563
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,030
Are you even listening?

564
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,920
Yeah, I’m listening.

565
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,350
And I’m wondering why you’re out walking alone.

566
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,610
I wanted to go out and see the world.

567
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:48,060
Wanted to meet people.

568
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,850
Wanted to know how ordinary folks live.

569
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,270
She's off her rocker.

570
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,520
She got hit on the head?

571
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,520
I don’t know.

572
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,280
Uh, I just remembered,

573
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,270
I meant to return your bag, you left it behind.

574
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,070
But I didn’t look inside,

575
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:14,600
I swear. I swear, I didn’t check anything inside.

576
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,600
Here, it’s yours.

577
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,480
Thanks a lot.

578
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,180
It’s not very private to talk here.

579
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,620
So, could you please ask for my number?

580
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,640
Then we can talk later.

581
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,800
You mean you want me to ask for your number?

582
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,800
Yes.

583
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:48,070
Wait, hold on!

584
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
I haven’t even asked your name yet.

585
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,600
My name is Rosé, nice to meet you.

586
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,340
Oh, I’m Jack.

587
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,080
Miss Rosé, are you okay?

588
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,960
We’ve found Miss Rosé.

589
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,280
The suspect is likely around here.

590
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,680
Surround the area and capture him.

591
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,000
If he tries to escape, shoot to kill.

592
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,760
We should get in the car.

593
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,430
If there’s anything I can help with, just let me know.

594
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,430
I’m happy to help you with anything.

595
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,720
Once I get home, I’ll message you.

596
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,590
Keep in touch, my hero.

597
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,630
Grandma, take it easy.

598
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,480
Come on.

599
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,520
Ouch, wait!

600
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,890
Hang in there, hang in there.
Okay, okay.

601
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,580
Big as a giant, but a heart as small as an ant.

602
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,800
And you didn't hurt when you fought?

603
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:08,400
Grandma, I wasn’t causing trouble, I was helping someone.

604
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
Is it still not over?

605
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,810
You should go get five talismans tattoo

606
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,680
to ward off bad luck.

607
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,120
At the beginning of the month, you got your eyebrow cut,

608
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,120
at the end of the month, your lip got cut.

609
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,800
What’s going to get cut next month?

610
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:27,730
Hmm.

611
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:31,280
Eyebrow cut, lip cut… will it be your head next, Grandma?

612
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,400
Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it myself, no need to wait for someone else.

613
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,000
Calm down, I was just joking.

614
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:44,080
But you know, Grandma, even though I got hurt,

615
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,080
my heart is full.

616
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,350
I just realized that being a hero feels this good.

617
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:57,150
You know, Grandma, to help someone,

618
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:00,000
you don’t have to be the best.

619
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You don’t need to be on a national team.

620
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,270
You don’t need anything at all.

621
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:09,200
You just need to be brave.

622
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,050
We help in the way we can, right?

623
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,720
Grandma, Jack’s going to open a school.

624
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,080
Why?

625
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,080
Come on, let me tell you all about it.

626
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,690
Wait a moment, there has to be a visual aid.

627
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,710
Here it is.

628
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:40,660
A school, right, Grandma? We’ll start with the desks

629
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,200
there are six seats.

630
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,040
And this is the blackboard.

631
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,790
Here’s Teacher Jack standing right here.

632
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And a taekwondo pose too.

633
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,740
There will be kids sitting here

634
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:00,520
and I'll have you outside the room.

635
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,260
What?

636
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,730
So you can sell Chinese chive dumplings;

637
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,090
What happened to your face?

638
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,450
I fell.

639
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,210
Do you think I’m stupid?

640
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,610
Who did you get into a fight with?

641
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:50,560
I helped a woman who was being kidnapped for ransom.

642
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,240
Are you crazy?

643
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,200
Have you lost your mind?

644
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:58,760
You risked your life on the streets just to be a hero?

645
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,550
Have you been drinking?

646
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:07,160
So, you got into a fight at the bar and then came back with this lie to me.

647
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:13,920
Your habit of stealing and lying since you were a kid,

648
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,180
it hasn’t gone away, has it?

649
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,260
Are you even listening to me?

650
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,140
Are you hearing what I’m saying?

651
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,060
I helped someone!

652
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,720
And if we’re talking about the past

653
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:31,310
the people I stole from or did bad things to

654
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:34,300
weren’t they bad people?

655
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,840
What’s your problem, Dad?

656
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:40,880
Oh, so you think you’re a hero now?

657
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,000
Yes.

658
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:50,390
A petty thief like you just goes around

659
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:54,010
Get upstairs and let your brother clean up your wounds.

660
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:56,010
And you’re not leaving the house.

661
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:58,010
The day after tomorrow, you’ve got an interview,

662
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:01,830
can you handle that for once?

663
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,610
Helping a women from being kidnapped for ransom

664
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,690
is still too pathetic to you?

665
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:21,560
Fine.

666
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:45,400
(The entire scenario is fictional.
It has no connection to the actual safety protocols
or operations within a bank.)

667
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,820
So,

668
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,640
this is the bank they say is corrupt?

669
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:14,040
Hello, how can I help you today?

670
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,350
I don’t recognize you.

671
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,460
I’m the manager sent from the headquarters.

672
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,900
I’m here to oversee things today.

673
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:28,080
Oh, the manager? No one informed us.

674
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:38,470
Let’s just say I won’t report to the headquarters

675
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:44,440
that the staff at this branch isn’t diligent in their communications.

676
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,240
Oh!

677
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:51,510
Oh, yes, someone did inform us.

678
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:52,910
Sorry, I must have forgotten.

679
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,910
Please, this way, Manager.

680
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:56,200
Right this way sir.

681
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,960
The new manager is here from headquarters.

682
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,780
Hello.

683
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,600
Hello.

684
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,480
You look a bit stressed.

685
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,580
Is there anything I can help with?

686
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:47,240
I accidentally transferred a check amount to the wrong customer,

687
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,130
and now I can’t reach them.

688
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:51,760
What should I do?

689
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,760
Let me take care of it for you.

690
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,690
But could you go buy me some coffee?

691
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,000
Of course.

692
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,430
By the way, what's the security code here?

693
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,250
Hmm...

694
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,610
I'll go back to my work now.

695
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,610
It's 9876.

696
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,830
But please don't tell that person that I messed up again.

697
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,440
I swear I won’t tell.

698
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,280
Alright, I’ll go get some coffee.

699
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,300
Oh!

700
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,160
Aren't you going to work?

701
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,320
Yes.

702
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,320
I'm on my way right now.

703
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:34,800
Oh, I forgot to ask earlier.

704
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:36,130
Yes?

705
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,680
What coffee would you like?

706
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,600
I'll have an Americano.

707
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,660
Sure.

708
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,560
Hot or iced?

709
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,800
Iced, please.

710
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:55,910
Sweet or unsweetened?

711
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:56,820
No sugar at all, please.

712
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,690
Okay.

713
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,050
Thanks.

714
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:04,040
Someone just came in to inquire about a loan,

715
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,590
but I think you should see them.

716
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Is she going to come back?

717
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,510
You’re in luck today.

718
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:24,500
The branch manager is here, so please head to counter two.

719
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,220
Thank you.

720
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,580
Sure.

721
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,060
Hello.

722
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:34,720
Oh, hey!

723
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,050
Hey, remember when we met the other day?

724
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,280
I didn’t think I’d see you again.

725
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:43,360
Same here.

726
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,180
Damn,

727
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,830
this feels like fate or something.

728
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:47,830
So, do you work here?

729
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,880
Whoa, hold on a second.

730
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,080
You’re a bank manager,

731
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,160
and you’re still worried about disappointing your family?

732
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,870
I bet your family puts a lot of pressure on you.

733
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:04,350
Yeah, something like that.

734
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:07,490
So, what brings you here? Looking for a loan?

735
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:09,600
Tell me about it.

736
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,920
Let me show you the plan I’ve put together for you.

737
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,320
What is it?

738
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,270
You can’t tell by looking?

739
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,860
No, not really.

740
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:38,250
Alright, I’ll explain,

741
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,770
but don’t laugh at me.

742
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,580
I want to create a fully integrated learning center

743
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,580
for the kids in my community.

744
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,640
Why?

745
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:54,160
It’s a bit of a long story.

746
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,000
You see, I was really good at school,

747
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,280
but after my parents passed away, I couldn’t continue my formal education.

748
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:04,710
So, I’ve been learning from donated books,

749
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,420
just picking things up here and there.

750
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:10,360
I also picked up some skills from side jobs.

751
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,360
But the Taekwondo you saw...

752
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,380
My dad's friend, who’s a coach, taught me.

753
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,560
Even though I didn’t study formally,

754
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:20,590
I’ve achieved this much.

755
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,280
So, think about it

756
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:24,870
if the kids in my community

757
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:29,120
had someone to teach them properly,

758
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,010
to let them learn through trial and error,

759
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:36,800
just imagine how bright their futures could be.

760
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:40,670
This is what a true superhero school is all about.

761
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,220
It’s a really great project.

762
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:49,790
So why didn’t you come for a loan earlier?

763
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,020
I’m in debt—hundreds of thousands to loan sharks.

764
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,670
The only way I can pay it off is by becoming a national athlete.

765
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,720
But as you know...

766
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,790
That’s why I need to borrow money from the bank.

767
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,120
But so far, no bank has approved my loan.

768
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:13,980
No one believes I’ll be able to pay them back.

769
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,080
But someone told me

770
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:20,100
that if I came here, I might have a chance.

771
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:23,930
Do you have anyone to co-sign for you?

772
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:32,290
It might be tough to get approval.

773
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,480
But it just so happens

774
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,880
that our bank has a new policy.

775
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,280
It’s called the “Return the Smile” program.

776
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,600
Wait, what program is that?

777
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,600
Are you smiling?

778
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:54,720
I believe that your dream will definitely come true.

779
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:57,370
Someone like you, who fights through life,

780
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:00,070
there's nothing you can't achieve.

781
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,440
Wait a moment, I’ll go get the money for you.

782
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,800
Here you go.

783
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:33,000
This should be more than enough to pay off your debt and open the school.

784
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,490
Plus, you’ll have enough left over for dinner tonight.

785
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:36,750
Wait, is this for real?

786
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:37,470
It’s real.

787
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:41,250
I’m so grateful to you, man.

788
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:45,470
You’re like someone sent from heaven.

789
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:48,730
If it weren’t for you, I’d be in big trouble.

790
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:49,880
Thank you so much!

791
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:57,160
But wait, can it really be this easy?

792
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:00,030
Yep, it’s usually this easy.

793
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:00,750
Really?

794
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:01,250
Really.

795
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,720
I honestly didn’t think we’d meet again,

796
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:07,920
but now that we have...

797
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:09,910
It’s washed.

798
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,090
You can keep it, soon I’ll have enough money to buy a new one anyway.

799
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,640
By the way, what’s your name?

800
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:19,870
My name’s Joke.

801
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:21,160
P’ Joke.

802
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:23,310
Let me give you my contact.

803
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:25,710
I’d love to go out for drinks with you again.

804
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,710
Grandma, I got approved for the loan!

805
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,790
We’re going to be debt-free, Grandma.

806
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:58,500
So, go ahead and prepare dinner!

807
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,500
Jack, can we have shark fin soup, Grandma?

808
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,340
Make it hammerhead shark, Grandma!

809
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:03,350
See you later!

810
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:04,860
Hey Jack.

811
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,170
Uncle Ting.

812
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,040
Jack, I finally got approved, Uncle Ting!

813
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:11,570
So, I’ll treat you to dinner tonight.

814
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:12,880
Come over to the house, okay?

815
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,190
Alright, I’m happy for you!

816
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:15,600
See you, Uncle.

817
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:19,570
Thank you!

818
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,240
Grandma...

819
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:34,580
Jack,

820
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,230
What’s going on here?

821
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:40,270
We’ve been informed that there’s been an embezzlement at the bank.

822
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:42,800
The testimony from those who were there

823
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:47,160
you at the bank around the same time the money went missing.

824
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,160
We’re here to search you to make sure, sir.

825
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:50,940
Embezzlement?

826
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,190
What embezzlement?

827
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:53,980
I didn’t do anything!

828
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:55,980
Permission to search, officer.

829
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,840
Let me see.

830
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:07,420
It’s money, Chief.

831
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,280
Jack, did you really do this?

832
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,030
Grandma, stay calm...

833
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,160
Oh, Officer!

834
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:17,850
Jack didn’t do it!

835
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:19,390
Then what’s with all this money?

836
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:22,610
I got this through a regular loan application.

837
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,080
It’s true.

838
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,690
The only loan approved today

839
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:29,360
was for fraudulent transactions.

840
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:35,030
Hey Grandma, wait!

841
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,410
Seriously, are you the Joker Thief?

842
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,280
If so, just confess.

843
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,150
No, officer, this is getting out of hand.

844
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:52,640
What’s the Joker Thief?

845
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,290
This is the first time I'm hearing about this.

846
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:55,460
Jack,

847
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,770
Grandma, I'm not the Joker Thief.

848
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:00,800
No, officer, it’s not true.

849
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,120
What is the Joker Thief?

850
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,120
I didn’t do anything.

851
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,080
Well,

852
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,410
I need to take you in for further questioning at the station.

853
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:09,720
No, officer!

854
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,360
Permission to go, Grandma.

855
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,090
Jack didn’t do it.

856
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,700
Yes, Grandma, I really didn’t do it.

857
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,580
Please release him.
Jack,

858
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,580
Trust me.

859
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,600
Please.
Officer, Jack didn’t do it.

860
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,600
Please let go.

861
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,100
Let go.

862
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,590
Officer.

863
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:26,880
Jack.

864
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,880
Ok, ok.

865
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:30,310
Jack.

866
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:32,310
But you have to trust me.

867
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,360
Let go.

868
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,980
Jack.

869
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:38,890
Please let go.

870
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:40,230
Nothing is going to happen.

871
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:44,040
Officer, Jack didn’t do it.
Please.

872
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,180
Please, go ahead.

873
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,400
Get him out of here quickly.

874
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,400
Get in the car, let’s go.
Jack,

875
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,070
Jack,

876
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,730
Jack,

877
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:11,480
Jack,

878
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,960
Joke, where did you get this outfit from?

879
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,260
I just scolded you recently.

880
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,010
Did you just go out again?

881
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:43,700
Are you challenging me?

882
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:45,770
Stop it, please.

883
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Joker, go talk inside the house.

884
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,440
Go on, go.

885
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,980
I probably can’t go in now.

886
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,520
I’m sorry everyone.

887
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,800
I didn’t become what everyone hoped for.

888
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,260
I now believe what you warned me about.

889
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:27,420
That I’m just a petty thief on the street

890
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:30,590
Who foolishly thought of himself as a hero.

891
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:32,220
Get up.

892
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:36,370
Are you trying to be sarcastic to get something out of this?

893
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:37,660
Huh?

894
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,280
Go, go prepare for the interview tomorrow.

895
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,370
There's no need for that.

896
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:49,390
I didn't pass the test in the first place.

897
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,640
The letter you saw,

898
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,820
It was fake.

899
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:03,710
I made it up.

900
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:09,540
Because what I’ve always been good at

901
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,960
Is lying and stealing.

902
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,360
I robbed a bank.

903
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,680
Huh?

904
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:39,670
Lie to me again

905
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:41,640
that you didn’t do it.

906
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,980
I've already confessed.

907
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,050
Where is the Joker Thief?

908
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:04,190
On the second floor, in my bedroom, there’s all the evidence

909
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:06,190
That ties me to that name.

910
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,790
And where are the team members?

911
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:09,590
Tell them to surrender.

912
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:13,860
I don’t have a team. I work alone.

913
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,380
Why did you do this?

914
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:19,380
Aren’t you ashamed?

915
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:22,979
It’s the only thing

916
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:26,800
That can make up for all the wrongs I’ve done

917
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,670
And prevent others from getting in trouble because of me.

918
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,850
Take him into custody and head to the police station.

919
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:36,350
No,

920
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:38,779
It’s not true.

921
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:40,000
It’s not true, is it, son?

922
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,040
It’s not true.

923
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:55,390
It’s good you’re alright.

924
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:58,479
The perpetrator has been caught already.

925
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:00,790
Don’t worry.

926
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:16,490
Who’s here so late?

927
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,279
Hello, Grandma.

928
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:32,279
Hello, Uncle Boss.

929
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:35,029
Long time no see, how have you been?

930
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:37,120
I’ve been good.

931
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,240
Shall we get straight to the point?

932
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,560
Sure.

933
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:48,310
Did you find the money?

934
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:50,910
No.

935
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:54,880
Then, let’s go with what was agreed upon before.

936
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:04,590
Mr.Boss,

937
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:06,920
Can I go instead?

938
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:11,050
I can be a housekeeper or a cook,

939
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,750
But please let Jack live the life he wants.

940
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,820
That might not be possible, I need Jack.

941
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:25,120
He’s the right person for the position I want to fill.

942
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,500
I’m begging you.

943
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:31,170
Please don’t make him the debt collector.

944
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,520
He doesn’t want to use force to...

945
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,210
Grandma,

946
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,640
It’s okay, Grandma.

947
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:46,620
Anyway, it’s something I'm good at.

948
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,530
That’s good, what about the collateral?

949
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:56,530
Is it ready?

950
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:30,000
Shall we start the work, Boss?

951
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,960
It’s okay, Grandma.

952
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,050
Joke, you're not like that, right?

953
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:55,480
Joke, you're not...

954
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:59,470
Please take me to inspect the evidence inside the house.

955
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:26,540
Next time we meet, I will do everything to apologize to you, Jack.

956
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,560
I hope I never see you again, Joker.

957
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,440
You're in debt,

958
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,440
But you're trying to pull a fast one on me?

959
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:48,110
Don't!

960
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,520
I just wanted to apologize for deceiving you.

961
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,500
Over the past five years, I've thought of hundreds of ways to make it up to you.

962
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,830
What the hell happened to you?

963
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:03,220
Someone like you isn’t cut out to be such a despicable, rotten, lowlife.

964
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,600
You really want my forgiveness, huh?

965
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,040
Then why don't you try dying?

966
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,720
Go ahead, do it.
