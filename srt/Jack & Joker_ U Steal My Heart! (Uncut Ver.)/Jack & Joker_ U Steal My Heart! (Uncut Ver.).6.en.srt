00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,670
This series is purely a work of fiction
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,040
I found out

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,750
the necklace was sent to a secret underground auction.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,080
Arun will pose as a Hong Kong billionaire to get in.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,330
Thirty million.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,520
The necklace of Miss Morakot is now the property of Miss Rose.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,390
The only thing left is for me to rob the goods truck.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,720
If you want to win against them.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,800
You have to team up with me.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,000
And now, where is my necklace?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,480
This person is the one who stole it.

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,680
Sorry for dragging you into something you’re not even involved in.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,920
Can you start over?

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,130
I've forgiven you.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,360
You have to eat noodles on this auspicious day!

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,360
Can I have some too?
Of course, darling.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,360
Me too!
Of course.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,080
Eat up!

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,400
Is it good?

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,830
Why did the house suddenly look so nice?

21
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,000
Someone came to tidy it up for P' Jack.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,720
Who was it? P' Jack's boyfriend?

23
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,760
Not his boyfriend, but someone P' Jack asked to protect.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
Well, that’s basically a boyfriend!

25
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,210
It's so hot!

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,610
Look at how you're dressed!

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,550
You're the same!

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,789
There, that’s the person P' Jack is keeping his eye on!

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,039
What's going on here, you little troublemakers?

30
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,890
This is my friend, have you all greeted him yet?

31
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,060
Hello!

32
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,550
Hello!

33
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,650
So, are we friends now?

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,890
Let’s shower and then have dinner.

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,840
Let’s eat together!~

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
I'll be right back.

37
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,580
P' Jack has a boyfriend now!

38
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,360
Stop teasing, just eat.

39
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,290
Make sure to eat well.

40
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,829
Hey, Jack, have you taken your painkillers yet?

41
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,829
Do you take them before or after eating?

42
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,540
I've taken them, but have you taken yours yet?

43
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,240
I'm out of my medicine.

44
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,079
I was thinking of calling the doctor at your company

45
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,079
to ask for a refill.

46
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,320
No need, I'll handle it myself.

47
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,160
And from now on, you don't get involved with Boss' people anymore, okay?

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,750
Do you understand?

49
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,079
Alright, Joke, sit down and eat, feel free to relax.

50
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Why can’t I deal with them anymore?

51
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,740
I always went through them for orders.

52
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,530
Just leave it alone Grandma.

53
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,880
I’ve got some money now,

54
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,880
so I'll take care of it.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,159
You're really good at saving money, you'll pay off the debt this year.

56
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,640
Nothing can change your fate,

57
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,350
except for this.

58
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,700
Oh dear!

59
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,520
The fish is reversed like this,

60
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,890
will fate also be reversed?

61
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,380
You're taking such good care of me, but I can handle it myself.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,440
No way, old people are superstitious about fish.

63
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,280
They'll think it's bad luck.

64
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,690
You have to remove the bones like this.

65
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,440
By the way, when you went for your last check-up,

66
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,180
what did the doctor say?

67
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,640
The doctor said I’m in good health, I’ll live long!

68
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
You’ll live long,

69
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,880
except for today, it's definetly my last day.

70
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,260
Oh, Joke! Chinese people don’t cut their noodles!

71
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,140
Eat it all up!

72
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,300
I didn’t know.

73
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,000
I’m sorry.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,080
It’s okay, you didn’t know, it’s not your fault.

75
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,950
Eat, eat.

76
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,730
So, Joke, where will you go after this?

77
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,080
I don’t know yet.

78
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,250
Aren't you going back home?

79
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,720
They probably don’t want me back.

80
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,780
Actually, it's just the two of us at home.

81
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,140
Some days, there’s no one to help me with chores.

82
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,000
I think Joke should stay with us for a while longer.

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,110
It's not a problem, right, Jack?

84
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,950
Though he brings bad luck,

85
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,950
his personality isn’t all that bad.

86
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,200
So, do you want to stay here for a while?

87
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I do!

88
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,470
Alright, eat up. I’ll serve you some noodles,

89
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,780
and you can help yourself to the rest.

90
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,920
I don’t mind.

91
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,940
Eat up.

92
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,550
What’s wrong, Joke?

93
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
It’s delicious.

94
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,790
I never thought eating together like this

95
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,790
would be so good.

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,040
Normally, when I eat in a group,

97
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,310
I just want to finish quickly.

98
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,360
When I eat out, I eat alone.

99
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:18,550
The last time I ate in a group like this was when I was in prison.

100
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,020
Huh?

101
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,930
But you’re not a thief anymore,

102
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,810
right?

103
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,020
Yes.

104
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,000
From now on, we’ll be here to eat with you, alright?

105
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,280
Thank you.

106
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Eat up, eat well.

107
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,730
But he really quit, right?

108
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,610
I think so.

109
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Is it you, causing all this?

110
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,700
What do you mean, Rose?

111
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
Don’t play dumb.

112
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,360
You had this guy steal the diamond necklace for your son, right?

113
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,890
Wait a minute, who stole what?

114
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,050
Who stole what necklace for whom?

115
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,240
You mean Jack stole the necklace for Arun

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,880
because I ordered it?

117
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,090
Someone like me would never do such a thing,

118
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,190
and neither would those two.

119
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,610
Don’t be too sure about your people.

120
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,550
We have witnesses.

121
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,010
Bring them in.

122
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,500
Did this man assault you

123
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,660
while trying to retrieve the stolen goods?

124
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,350
Yes.

125
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,490
Then may I ask a few more questions, if that's alright, Rose?

126
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,140
What did the person who assaulted you look like?

127
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,760
Like this, around this height.

128
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,560
I mean, what did the real person look like?

129
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,200
He was good-looking, radiant, very edible.

130
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,000
When he assaulted you, how did he do it?

131
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,570
Like this, I think.

132
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,990
Who are you supposed to be?

133
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,520
Huh?

134
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,860
I'll be you and you be him.

135
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,580
What? I'll be me and you be him!

136
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,090
Can you start?

137
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,430
Fine!

138
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,430
Alright, so he dodged like this, and I moved,

139
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,940
and then he elbowed me right in the face like this!

140
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,940
And it smelled great.

141
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,920
Then he finished me off with this move!

142
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,510
That’s Jack’s signature move.

143
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,240
Rose, don’t worry.

144
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Jack is my guy.

145
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,390
I’ll summon him for questioning and make sure he’s punished.

146
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,360
No,

147
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,120
you can’t punish him.

148
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,520
The only one at fault is Arun!

149
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,650
Why are you so sure

150
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,650
that Arun was involved?

151
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,000
Because Arun and Jack attended the auction together,

152
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,650
and Arun really wanted that necklace.

153
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,990
He was even bidding against Rose for it.

154
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,230
One more question.

155
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,480
What does the necklace look like?

156
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,680
(The three little pigs)

157
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,880
(Arun: Thank you all for returning it.)

158
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:58,280
(Arun: Good you returned it! Otherwise, you'd all be dead.)

159
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,090
I lowered myself to talk to you,

160
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,000
and you respond with just that?

161
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,070
Arun, I saw a flicker of light from your suit just now.

162
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,070
What? From my suit?

163
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,440
Yeah.
Hurry!

164
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,870
Wait, Arun.
Quick, before it electrocutes me!

165
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,730
All done.

166
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,730
Thanks, if there's another gig,

167
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,880
I’ll hire you again.

168
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,760
This thing could take down an elephant in 10 seconds.

169
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,480
Hey!

170
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,680
Tattoo!

171
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,800
Tattoo!

172
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,260
Worried about me?

173
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,620
I’m just kidding.

174
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,150
Let's not meet ever again in this lifetime.

175
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,600
Yes, Dad?

176
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,830
The necklace you gave to the jeweler for polishing,

177
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,480
do you still have it?

178
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,680
My necklace? Of course, it has to be with me.

179
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Where else would it be?

180
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,110
Alright, see you at home.

181
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,380
This problem really had to reach you.

182
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,740
Rose, I’m sorry.

183
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Please stay calm.

184
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,520
I’ll compensate you and the shipping company.

185
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,400
Please give me time to handle this.

186
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,190
I need my necklace back,

187
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,190
but you can’t punish Jack.

188
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,790
Don’t dock his pay,

189
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,760
don’t scold him.

190
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,640
I’ll call him in for questioning.

191
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,670
You can't do that too.

192
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,880
Then I’ll call him...

193
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
You can’t do that either!

194
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,000
Hasn’t his life been hard enough?

195
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
Please.

196
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,970
Okay.

197
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:45,140
I hope your son returns the necklace to Rose

198
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,470
without needing to tell her father about this.

199
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,780
What are you looking for?

200
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,000
I was wondering if I sleep on the bed,

201
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
where will you sleep?

202
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,620
I made the bed for myself.

203
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,620
As for you.

204
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Sleep over there.

205
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,640
Why should I sleep on the floor?

206
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,750
I used to be a proper rich kid, you know!

207
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,740
Why should I sleep on the floor?

208
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,740
Because this is my bed!

209
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,000
What kind of host are you? Let me sleep comfortably!

210
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,120
Nobody's ever slept in my bed.

211
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,110
Who do you think you are?

212
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,730
I’m the legendary thief!

213
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:13,930
Well, I’m the legendary debt collector who takes down those running off with money!

214
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,760
You're lucky I let you sleep inside!

215
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
I’ll kick you out on the street.

216
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,000
I’m not going.

217
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,140
No matter how much you kick me out, I’m not leaving.

218
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,740
Fine!

219
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,020
Get out, Joke!

220
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,300
Hey, I want to sleep.

221
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,700
Get out!

222
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,600
I’m not leaving!

223
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,520
Ow!

224
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,620
Hey, Jack, I’m sorry.

225
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,120
Alright.

226
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,620
Take off your shirt. I’ll check your wound.

227
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,600
I’m fine.

228
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,340
Come on, take it off, or the blood will soak through.

229
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,660
Joke.

230
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,660
I said I’m fine!

231
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,690
I’m okay.

232
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,760
Are you shy?

233
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,520
Why are you shy, you've told me to take it off before.

234
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,040
You're shy.

235
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,020
Come on, take it off.

236
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,940
Don't be so loud, my grandma's asleep.

237
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,300
There's blood.

238
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,130
So, what’s the deal?

239
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,160
Who's going to be on top or bottom?

240
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,550
You stay on top, I'll be on the bottom.

241
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,040
Jack,

242
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
when you were praying to the gods,

243
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,930
what did you wish for?

244
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,570
I wished that I could pay off my last debt this year

245
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,990
so I can finally do what I want to do.

246
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,660
Is that thing you want to do

247
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,770
still the same as before?

248
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,330
Yeah,

249
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,420
you still remember?

250
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,890
Of course I do.

251
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,890
So, tell me again, what is it?

252
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:27,350
I want to open a learning center for kids in the community, both academic and physical training,

253
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,160
so they can have a bright future.

254
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,150
Man, you've got a great memory.

255
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,780
I even remember your old hairstyle.

256
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,570
And what did you wish for?

257
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,300
I wished that I could stop being a burden

258
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:58,010
so the people I love don’t have to suffer or be sad because of me.

259
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,810
But today, you’ve seriously messed with my grandma’s fortune!

260
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,160
Let’s hope both our wishes come true.

261
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,000
Amen.

262
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Amen.

263
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,280
Turn off the lights, I’m going to sleep.

264
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,270
Hold on, I’m still brushing my teeth.

265
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,350
Hey!

266
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,510
What the...

267
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,880
I’m brushing my teeth, why did you come in?

268
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,950
I forgot to put on my face cream.

269
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,860
What are you looking at?

270
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,020
Is my face too handsome or something?

271
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,650
You're ridiculous.

272
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,650
Finish up and get out already.

273
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,540
I’m still brushing my teeth, go.

274
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,960
Geez!

275
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,800
You were born just to destroy everything I built!

276
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,810
You're always saying I’m not good enough.

277
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,950
You’re the one who’s...

278
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,120
Are you talking back to me?

279
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,600
I’ll soon be meeting with some of the elite,

280
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,210
the most influential group in the country,

281
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,360
and you’ve gone and stolen a necklace from Rose, their daughter!

282
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
How am I supposed to face them now?

283
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,440
Are you stupid?

284
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,010
But that necklace belonged to mom.

285
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,480
You want me to just let Rose have it?

286
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,100
You know how valuable that necklace is,

287
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,100
but you've lost it,

288
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,730
how can I trust you with the future of the company and our Suphanimit?

289
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,180
I don’t want to be like you, Dad.

290
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,140
I understand now.

291
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,140
Please stop, Dad.

292
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,980
Please.

293
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,980
I’m sorry.

294
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,640
If you weren't my flesh and blood,

295
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,340
you’d be the one to pay the price, remember that.

296
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,000
I’ve always thought it would’ve been better

297
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
if I had a different son.

298
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,610
Fine, I’ll leave.

299
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,980
And if I don’t make something of myself,

300
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,980
I’ll never come back.

301
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,040
Then this will be the last time I see you.

302
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,930
Good luck.

303
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,870
Dad!

304
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
You’re not dead, are you?

305
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
Let me ask you something.

306
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,980
Who's really to blame for all the chaos?

307
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,090
Happy Chinese New Year.

308
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,090
Thank you, Grandma.

309
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,060
And here’s a gift for Joke for wishing you good luck,

310
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,380
happiness, a long life and look after each other for a long time.

311
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,660
Thank you, Grandma.

312
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,680
And what about yours?

313
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,760
What about mine?

314
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,650
Hey,

315
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:17,510
when someone’s older, they’re the elder,

316
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,980
Wow.

317
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,670
Now you’re suddenly treating me like your elder!

318
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,760
Yeah, you. You’ve been freeloading here, eating and living for free,

319
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,130
without giving any red envelopes.

320
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,240
If I had known, I wouldn’t have picked you up in the first place.

321
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Watch it!

322
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,630
Jack, be nice!

323
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:43,080
Alright, alright, it’s a special day! Speak nicely and do good things.

324
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,840
Just joking, Grandma.

325
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,080
And don't lend anyone money today,

326
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,600
or it’ll disappear for the whole year.

327
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,230
Got it?

328
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,330
Yes, Grandma, understood.

329
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,960
Come here, give me a hug.

330
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,430
Same to you, Grandma.

331
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,220
I wish you good health and that you stay with us for a long time.

332
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,480
Richer and richer!

333
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,220
My dear grandchildren, giving me their blessings.

334
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,220
Thank you, same to you, Grandma!

335
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,230
My dear grandchildren, I love you so much.

336
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,460
Have lots of happiness, Grandma.

337
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,600
Oh no, Toey Ting!

338
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,230
Toey Ting!

339
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,060
What’s wrong?

340
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,060
Did someone bully you?

341
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:26,480
My old classmates said I’m uneducated.

342
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,240
Wow, that hurts.

343
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,890
There, there, calm down, calm down.

344
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,680
What’s with kids nowadays, saying such harsh things?

345
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,770
Why don’t you show them your math skills, Toey Ting?

346
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,650
Even if you didn’t go to school,

347
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,650
you’re still smarter than them, right?

348
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,680
I can’t! I’ve forgotten everything.

349
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,780
I’m dumb now.

350
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,110
There, there, Toey Ting.

351
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,020
Why don’t I get to school like the others?

352
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,080
Listen,

353
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,990
ever since I first met you,

354
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,210
I’ve always thought of you as a superhero, you know that?

355
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,640
You're strong,

356
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,880
brave, and talented.

357
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,120
Do you know what all superheroes have in common?

358
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
Capes?

359
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,630
No, not that.

360
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,710
All superheroes have been through tough times

361
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:45,000
and bad things in their lives,

362
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,040
but those tough times make them stronger,

363
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,820
turning them into heroes.

364
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,310
That’s not true! How would you know?

365
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,680
Believe it or not, I’m a superhero too.

366
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,880
I’ve been through rough times, just like you.

367
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,370
Maybe not exactly the same,

368
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,170
but enough to give me my own special power.

369
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,760
And I believe that one day,

370
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,520
you’ll discover your special power too.

371
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,410
But for now, no more tears,

372
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,070
okay?

373
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,000
Okay.
Good.

374
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,480
Good job, Toey Ting. You’re so strong!

375
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,840
What about this?

376
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Hey, why don’t you come study at my house for now?

377
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,270
I’ll teach you myself.

378
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,220
I’m about to start a superhero school,

379
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,740
and you can be my first student.

380
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,480
How’s that?

381
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,160
Wow! That sounds amazing!

382
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,730
Are you serious?

383
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:57,080
Of course, I’m serious.

384
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,590
And here,

385
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,320
take this as your scholarship.

386
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,900
That’s so much money, I can’t take it.

387
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,220
You're giving like you're rich.

388
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,320
Oh, don’t worry, if you don’t want it as a gift, you can treat it as a loan.

389
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,420
Just pay it back when you have extra.

390
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,730
I won’t charge interest.

391
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:35,610
Thank you, Jack, Joke, Grandma.

392
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,830
Oh no, oh no.

393
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,240
Why did I have to get the same room again?

394
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,400
This room's feng shui is terrible,

395
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,190
it’s unlucky.. Oh my!

396
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,090
I’ll have to get new offerings for the spirits now.

397
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,880
Oh, mom, stop it already!

398
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Don't go making more debts, mom!

399
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Before I could pay off all your debts,

400
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,470
I almost died!

401
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:14,310
Son, wasn’t it because of the divine spirits that you survived last time?

402
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,320
Huh?

403
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,800
Oh my god, mom,

404
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,690
I’m serious.

405
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,640
I have no money left to give you.

406
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,410
No money left?

407
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:25,780
What about the money from last time? Where did that go?

408
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,000
This corner is bad, it doesn’t invite blessings at all.

409
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,090
Where did all that money go?

410
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,290
And are you staying here?

411
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,510
I heard someone else took your old room.

412
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,740
No way, I just moved my stuff to the shrine.

413
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,100
I'm too lazy to move back.

414
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,360
I'll going to be there for a while.

415
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,720
Hoy, Hoy, I'm coming with you!

416
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,020
You can’t stay here,

417
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,000
it's way too unlucky. I can't handle it.

418
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,530
Fine, go stay at the shrine.

419
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,940
Don’t come back.

420
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,310
Go.

421
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,310
Wait, Hoy.

422
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,760
Open it.

423
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:21,800
Mom, all the money I gave you was wasted on this nonsense!

424
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,110
I'll smack you, calling this nonsense! These are sacred items!

425
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,440
Please don’t be mad at your son, this is all about respect for blessings!

426
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,010
What kind of son calls sacred things nonsense?

427
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,130
Stay here.

428
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,200
Where are my shoes?

429
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,690
Goodbye, man.

430
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,220
Good luck.

431
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,260
Don’t come back.

432
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,260
Fine!

433
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,160
My dad’s gone nuts!

434
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,250
I ran away for one night,

435
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,250
and he seized my car and condo.

436
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,730
I bet he wants me to apologize and crawl back.

437
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,570
Now, go get me a new outfit

438
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,110
and book me a three-star, four-star hotel.

439
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,730
I’m staying for a month or two.

440
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,120
It seems that you don't know yet.

441
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,470
Boss has given out his official order

442
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,170
that he has officially cut ties with you.

443
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,340
Everyone’s been informed

444
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:43,560
not to help you if they see you.

445
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,000
Wow, my dad’s really going all out!

446
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,530
In that case, we'll show him

447
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,530
We can stand on our own.

448
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,250
I’m going to take the Arun brand global!

449
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,710
It seems like you don't understand

450
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:04,420
that I no longer work for you.

451
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:12,400
More importantly, you’ve been fired from the Arun shop.

452
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,000
Wait, I’ve been fired?

453
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,680
Fired from a shop that bears my own name? Are you insane?

454
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,730
I hired you!

455
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,400
Not my dad, remember that.

456
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
But the one paying my salary is your boss.

457
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,840
You should remember that too.

458
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,930
Huh?

459
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,460
You traitor! You want to turn your back on me?

460
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,260
Fine, do whatever you want.

461
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,420
I built this brand, I can build a new one.

462
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,360
Pharaoh, you have to help me.

463
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,630
Don't tell me you forgot who you are?

464
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:50,110
I turned you from a nobody live-seller

465
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,840
into a fashion influencer.

466
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,570
Now you’re turning me down?

467
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,570
A nobody live-seller?

468
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,130
Arun, excuse me,

469
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,150
but with such poor taste, do you really think you can build anyone else?

470
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:08,820
This bitch.

471
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,230
What?! Why?!

472
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,760
We’ve only tolerated this because of Boss

473
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,690
, but now you don’t have him protecting you anymore.

474
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,540
So if you slap us, we’ll slap back!

475
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,710
Oh, not paying for the food?

476
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,530
Wait,

477
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,889
your bank account’s frozen.

478
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:49,050
I doubt the card will work.

479
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,159
Is he going to make it?

480
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,739
Of course he can't!

481
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,740
Well, that’s obvious!

482
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,100
Of course not.

483
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,800
You’ve known me for so long.

484
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
I’ve helped you a lot, right? Whatever bad things I've done,

485
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:20,050
I’m really sorry.

486
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:26,920
But today, can you pay for my meal?

487
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,760
Can you?

488
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,120
Fine, sure.

489
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:36,050
Lately, we haven’t really gotten up for morning alms anyway,

490
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,050
so I kind of feel bad.

491
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,970
So let’s consider it charity

492
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,070
and don’t come asking for blessings later!

493
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,330
So satisfying!

494
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,420
Thanks.

495
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,210
Bye!

496
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
(Hope.)

497
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,580
(The number you’re trying to reach is not available at the moment.)

498
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,330
Hope?

499
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:35,790
Hope?

500
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,260
Hope!

501
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,260
What’s going on?

502
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,770
Hope, wake up!

503
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,920
Hope, get up.

504
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,370
Come on, get up slowly.

505
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,370
What happened?

506
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:55,160
Huh? What happened to you?

507
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,410
You’re covered in bruises.

508
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,860
Hold on, let me take this off.

509
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,590
Coming in and stripping me naked right away isn’t a good look, is it?

510
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,590
You’re still joking?

511
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,950
I’m asking what happened!

512
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,240
Huh?

513
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,820
Nothing.

514
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,230
Don’t worry.

515
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,920
Go to work, or you’ll be late.

516
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,640
I'm asking who did you get in a fight with?

517
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,160
Huh?

518
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,450
Boss beat me up.

519
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
He was really angry last night.

520
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,210
Tell me everything.

521
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,810
What?

522
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,810
You're going to open a school?
You're opening a school?

523
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:58,280
Sorry, but what exactly are you going to teach kids?

524
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,240
You idiot, did you forget?

525
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,280
He didn't make the national team once!

526
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,080
You fool, he almost made it, not on the team.

527
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,760
But if he teaches Taekwondo like that,

528
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,960
the kids at Supanimit will be tough as nails.

529
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,800
It’s not like that. I’ll just teach regular subjects,

530
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,200
but if any kid wants to learn Taekwondo,

531
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
we’ll deal with that.

532
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,000
Hey, I’m pretty smart too.

533
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,550
I’m not just good at fighting, okay?

534
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,410
I don’t believe it.

535
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,600
Besides basic subjects,

536
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,390
I’ll also teach survival skills.

537
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,680
So when they grow up, they’ll have some skills.

538
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,750
If you’re serious about opening a school,

539
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,540
it’ll cost a lot more.

540
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,650
You’ll need a location, teachers,

541
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,850
and most importantly, books.

542
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,850
It’s not easy at all.

543
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,800
Yeah, you’re right.

544
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,960
Don’t worry, we’ll help you teach.

545
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,860
You? What could you possibly teach?

546
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,980
How to Be Confused in a Fight 101?

547
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,770
Hey, I’m a driving master, okay?

548
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,770
Ask Joke, did I teach him well?

549
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,560
So they can have driving skills.

550
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,350
The kids can learn how to drive too.

551
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,720
might even turn it into a job.

552
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,680
Alright, I’m in. I’m good with tools, I can help.

553
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,730
There, one problem solved.

554
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,360
The other issues, we’ll figure out along the way.

555
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,430
For now, just think about paying off the boss

556
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,430
and quitting.

557
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,700
We’ll handle the money.

558
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:57,790
Wait, you guys aren’t going to…

559
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,960
rob someone, are you?

560
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,220
No way, man,

561
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:04,190
I’ve quit that life, I’m not robbing anyone.

562
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,160
Promise me.

563
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,000
I promise.

564
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,070
Alright then.

565
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,530
I never thought life would be like this.

566
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,420
Dad!!

567
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,110
Well, here goes nothing.

568
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,000
Speaking of money,

569
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,360
money just walked right in!

570
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,900
Everyone!

571
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,900
Everyone!

572
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,520
Tissue.

573
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,780
And that’s everything.

574
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,720
Please, can I crash at your place tonight?

575
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,300
Please?

576
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:31,070
Uh, sorry, Mr.Arun. You don’t need to call me like that

577
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,830
just call me bro.

578
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,360
Well, bro, my place is full.

579
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,000
Sorry, man.

580
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,180
How about staying with me at the shrine?

581
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:54,120
There’s plenty of food and people, so it won’t be lonely.

582
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,280
No way, I don’t want to sleep at a temple.

583
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,280
It’s not a temple, it’s a shrine!

584
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,570
Your room’s free, right?

585
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,330
What do you mean free?

586
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,680
I live with my mom.

587
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,450
Your mom’s staying with me at the shrine.

588
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,170
Shut up!

589
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,590
Really, Tattoo?

590
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,320
Can I stay over just one night?

591
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,530
Please, just one night!

592
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,560
No.

593
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,720
Come on, Tattoo,

594
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,610
please?

595
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:28,610
No!

596
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,610
Tattoo, just for one night?

597
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,350
No!

598
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,180
No, I want to be alone.

599
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,380
I’m not staying with you no matter what.

600
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,070
No way in hell!!

601
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,940
I told you that his room is in that building.

602
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,940
Just walk there yourself.

603
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,060
I don’t want to burden Hope anymore.

604
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:02,280
So you’re bringing your problems to me?

605
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,640
Great.

606
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,830
Take it.

607
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,880
The bathroom’s over there.

608
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,530
What’s wrong?

609
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,510
Even after all the crap I’ve put you through,

610
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,460
you’re still this kind to me?

611
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,720
Me?

612
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,570
What did I do?

613
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,580
When I’m in a bad place,

614
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,160
you let me shower and sleep right away.

615
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,100
You care more about me than my own dad does.

616
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:28,310
That thing I gave you was an old rag.

617
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:40,530
I told you to use it to wipe the table, I haven't been here so long that the place is dusty.

618
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:41,760
I don't know how to clean it.

619
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
If you don't know how then learn how to do it.

620
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:45,560
Look,

621
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,040
this isn’t your palace anymore.

622
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,560
You’re in my place now.

623
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,800
You better start learning.

624
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,000
Pick it up.

625
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,370
If you don’t, I’ll send you to the shrine.

626
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,720
Fine, I’ll do it.

627
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,560
Go.

628
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:35,600
Hey, what are you doing in the men’s bathroom?

629
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:38,270
This is the women’s bathroom!

630
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,640
Shoot, I knew something felt off.

631
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,470
Hey.

632
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,840
How'd you get in here?

633
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,840
Hey, don’t take it to heart.

634
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,160
I’m just not familiar with the area.

635
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,990
I didn’t see it, really.

636
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,040
I didn’t see it.

637
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,540
Have we met before?

638
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,000
No, but you seem familiar.

639
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,360
Never? Then why are you at my shrine?

640
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:09,930
She's the owner.

641
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:12,700
Help!
You pervert!

642
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,000
Help!
Stop! You pervert!

643
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,450
You pervert!
Stop! You pervert!

644
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,130
Hey, pervert!
Stop right there!

645
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,280
Why did you spy on us while we were bathing?

646
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,790
No, wait, wait!

647
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,790
I...

648
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:29,790
I can explain!

649
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,740
The signs look the same!

650
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,660
How was I supposed to know?

651
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,570
Last time I didn’t get caught!

652
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,490
Oh, so you’ve done this before?

653
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,000
This can’t be allowed to continue.

654
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,840
Let’s catch him!

655
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,750
Wait, wait.

656
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,320
I mean, I’ve never gone into the wrong room before!

657
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,900
Excuses!

658
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,780
Go ahead.

659
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,780
Hey, wait...

660
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,030
Oh!

661
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,570
What’s going on here?

662
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,840
He’s the son of a friend.

663
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,680
Actually, he’s my son’s friend.

664
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:04,410
How long has he been staying here?

665
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,480
Just a day or two.

666
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,270
Living here for free, eating for free, bathing for free, but never helping around the shrine?

667
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:12,370
Seems like he’s been here a while.

668
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,480
Then work to pay it off!

669
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,160
What can you do?

670
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:20,990
I can only do one thing.

671
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,240
I can drive.

672
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:28,620
Good, then drive me around

673
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,620
while I ask you some questions.

674
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,560
Ready to start work today?

675
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:40,070
Yeah, in this outfit?

676
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:42,070
Go get changed.

677
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,550
Sorry!

678
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,740
Alright, students, pay your respects!

679
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,630
What’s up with you?

680
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,630
Uh... Hello, teacher!

681
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:09,720
Excuse me... wait, what? You're the teacher, I'm the student!

682
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,880
I should be asking where you got all this stuff from!

683
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,520
Oh, I bought it!

684
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,140
Just because I look like this doesn’t mean I don’t save money.

685
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,800
You, saving money?

686
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,690
Yep.

687
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,790
I think you just kept someone else's ...

688
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,230
Fine, I'll return it and get my money back.

689
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:37,090
Hey, hey, I was just kidding, relax!

690
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:42,440
Anyway, thanks a lot, Mr. Class President.

691
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,030
Please, take a seat, Mr. President.

692
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,030
Go ahead, sit down.

693
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,280
So, before the others arrive,

694
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,160
let’s test the class president’s knowledge first.

695
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,160
Bring it on, teacher!

696
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,600
Do you still remember the old stuff?

697
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,540
Of course!

698
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:12,600
How about English?

699
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,660
Oh, yes, no, okay, you’re welcome, thank you.

700
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,670
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

701
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,640
Okay.

702
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:24,840
Wait a sec...

703
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,750
English, huh?

704
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,380
Here we go, Grade 3.
(Grade 3 English Workbook)

705
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,400
Let me see that book.

706
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,660
Why?

707
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:19,120
It’s the one I donated when I was a kid.

708
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:40,840
(English Workbook)

709
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,420
(I will not misspell...)

710
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,200
(I will not misspell anymore.)

711
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,200
(I will not misspell anymore.)

712
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,940
Why is everything misspelled?

713
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:20,700
It’s hard, I’m not as good as others.

714
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:27,310
Don’t cry, I’ll fix it for you.

715
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,050
I’ve fixed it for you now.

716
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,060
You again, huh?

717
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,730
I’m glad it’s you.

718
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,520
Well, since we’re here...

719
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,180
These exam questions,

720
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:43,410
can you do them?

721
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,880
Huh? After all these years, you think I haven’t improved?

722
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,880
Wow.

723
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,400
Alright, smarty pants,

724
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,080
bring it on.

725
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,010
I’ll test you first.

726
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:53,900
Okay.

727
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,240
How do you pronounce L O V E?

728
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,000
L O V E... Love, it means “love.”

729
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,260
Not bad.

730
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:09,840
Alright, how about C O N F E S S?

731
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,110
C O N F E S S...

732
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:17,130
Con....fess?

733
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,360
Confess

734
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,280
Confess

735
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,980
And what does it mean?

736
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,290
It means...

737
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,250
It means...

738
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,560
I like you.

739
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:40,660
Huh?

740
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,510
It’s a clue, I’m giving you a hint!

741
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:50,260
If I wanted to tell you I liked you, what would it be?

742
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,380
Confession?

743
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,430
Not bad, confession!

744
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,840
Last one.

745
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,200
Come on!

746
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,310
P R O M I S E?

747
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:09,990
P R O...

748
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:11,440
P R O... Prom...

749
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,510
I S E...

750
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,400
Promise.

751
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,290
It means “promise.”

752
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,860
Promise?

753
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:34,750
Yeah, I’ve promised you a thousand times that I’d stop being a criminal.

754
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:42,320
Promise you won’t disappear until I achieve my dream.

755
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,360
Yeah,

756
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,280
I promise.

757
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,210
Promise!

758
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,880
Alright, promise.

759
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,960
Okay, get down here.

760
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:32,270
Go down and take a right.

761
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,680
Then just walk straight.

762
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:40,580
No, no, still further.

763
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:42,510
Not yet, not yet...

764
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:43,160
Almost there...

765
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,210
Stop, stop!

766
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,730
We’re here!

767
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:47,090
Alright, you ready?

768
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:47,820
Let’s go!

769
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,100
Three, two, one...

770
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,570
What’s this?

771
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,570
It’s a gym!

772
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,260
Yeah, I know it’s a gym.

773
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,940
But why’d you bring me here?

774
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:11,330
You said you wanted a place to open a school, right?

775
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,640
Well, I got it for you!

776
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,530
Did you steal this?

777
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:30,900
Are you crazy?

778
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,200
I talked to them!

779
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:35,940
It's a shame.

780
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,360
Huh?

781
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,970
This is the first time I actually wished you had stolen something.

782
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,990
Figured you wouldn’t forgive me that easily.

783
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:54,510
Coach.

784
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,580
Go ahead, talk. I’ll look around.

785
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,060
I always thought

786
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:20,280
I’d want a good teacher to take this place over,

787
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:23,720
so it could finally be put to good use.

788
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:28,690
The deed is in your name now.

789
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,690
But if you don’t want it,

790
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:38,350
just leave it like that, I understand.

791
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,360
Sorry again, and I wish you the best.

792
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,420
Coach.

793
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,260
I wouldn’t be here today

794
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,600
if you hadn’t taken me on as a student.

795
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:21,930
Back then, I was too young to accept the truth of the world.

796
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,720
But I’ve forgiven you for a long time now, Coach.

797
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,600
I could never hate someone who’s done so much for me.

798
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,080
I’ll take everything you taught me

799
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,300
and teach it to the kids at Suphanimit.

800
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,740
And Coach,

801
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:50,650
if one day any of these kids make it to the national team...

802
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:55,140
I want you to know it’s because of you.

803
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:00,840
Thank you so much for everything, Coach.

804
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,180
Thank you.

805
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,430
Thanks a lot.

806
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,560
Amazing, I think your learning project

807
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:52,080
could launch smoothly without needing any loans.

808
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:59,260
And if we combine this with my bank account,

809
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,260
I think I could settle Boss’s debt this round.

810
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:12,370
Congrats, man!

811
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:16,480
What are you gonna do next?

812
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,480
You still gonna work for Boss?

813
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:25,600
Probably not, but whether Boss will let me quit,

814
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,960
that’s another story.

815
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,120
Either way, I’m rooting for you.

816
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:38,760
Hey, why’d you suddenly get money, a teacher, and a place?

817
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,760
Tell me your secret!

818
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,660
It’s a red envelope.

819
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:49,410
Luck’s been on my side.

820
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:04,120
Wait, is the clown in your fortune slip talking about this guy?

821
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,800
Hey, it’s done already?

822
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,690
Yeah, this is Joke.

823
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:18,760
He’s my cousin, he’ll help me with the school.

824
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:25,600
Didn’t your grandma say

825
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,840
he’s an electrician?

826
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,940
Well, I do a lot of things.

827
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:33,940
Nice to meet you again.

828
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:40,760
Hey, what should we do with the remaining money?

829
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:44,970
Put it in a bank for interest?

830
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:49,480
These days, interest isn’t worth it.

831
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,710
It’s better to open an investment portfolio for better returns.

832
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:58,360
Can you take care of it for me?

833
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:00,000
Sure,

834
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,720
but it’ll take a while before you can withdraw profits.

835
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,880
That’s okay, right?

836
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,940
Alright, please take care of it,

837
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,300
and thanks for always advising me.

838
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:19,500
No need to thank me, I’m happy to help.

839
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,650
I think that should be all for today.

840
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:22,490
Alright, I’m off.

841
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:23,430
Okay.
See you.

842
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:24,000
See you.

843
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:47,020
Your offer to pay full damages

844
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:50,800
to the auction company and Ms. Rose

845
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:57,520
in exchange for keeping the necklace

846
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:04,560
is not acceptable.

847
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,560
Why not?

848
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,960
You know Ms. Rose well.

849
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,240
That necklace belongs to her.

850
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,240
But it’s my wife’s necklace!

851
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:21,530
It’s Ms. Rose’s by law.

852
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,320
Please, Nang, I’m begging you.

853
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:34,440
You know that necklace is all I have left of my wife.

854
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:39,040
If I lose it, I’ll have nothing left.

855
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,040
Please, have mercy on me.

856
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,280
It's me.

857
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,520
How about this?

858
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,520
If love for love,

859
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:59,110
then maybe Ms. Rose will agree.

860
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,210
What do you mean?

861
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:11,800
Ms. Rose has liked Jack for a long time.

862
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:16,610
If Jack becomes her companion,

863
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:24,490
she might just give you the necklace for free.

864
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,880
Geez!

865
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,440
Who would’ve thought?

866
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,500
That Ms. Rose would ask for so little.

867
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,930
If she wants Jack, that’s easy!

868
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,880
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

869
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,680
I’ve been stressed out for nothing.

870
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,890
Easy?

871
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:54,480
I heard he’ll be debt-free soon.

872
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:58,590
It’s not that simple.

873
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:37,770
Grandma, take care of your health.

874
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:39,610
Stay with your Grandchildren for a long time.

875
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:43,490
Oh, Jack, just in time.

876
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:46,240
Go ahead and talk.

877
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,900
Of course.

878
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:51,910
Here's your medicine.
Thank you.

879
01:05:57,350 --> 01:05:58,480
Boss.

880
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,000
Yes, Jack?

881
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:07,270
I just want to thank you

882
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:09,270
so much for everything.

883
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:13,680
For treating me like family,

884
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,620
teaching me so much,

885
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:18,620
and giving me opportunities.

886
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,880
Thank you, Boss.

887
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:33,140
But this will be my last month

888
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:37,350
working to pay off my debt.

889
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,880
Here’s the last payment.

890
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,980
You mean you’re quitting?

891
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:58,670
Yes.

892
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:01,930
Where are you going?

893
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:08,160
I’m opening a small school in this community.

894
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,440
With who?

895
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,420
A friend.

896
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,880
Which friend?

897
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:25,800
Doesn’t matter, I probably don’t know them.

898
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,480
Well, thank you.

899
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:34,650
I wish you luck in everything you do after this.

900
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,840
Then don't act distant from me.

901
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,200
Come and visit me sometimes.

902
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,520
I love you like a son.

903
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:48,230
Oh, I almost forgot.

904
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:52,840
I'm returning this to you.

905
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,260
Thank you very much, boss.

906
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:04,100
I'm going now.

907
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,160
Is it dark already?

908
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,330
I'll go to work first.

909
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,220
Just rest.

910
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:18,750
No, Boss is waiting.

911
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,979
I've already taken care of everything.

912
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,360
This is really the end.

913
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,560
Right?

914
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:07,070
It must be like that.

915
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:12,340
From now on, I'll be able to do something peaceful.

916
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,340
Like I've always wanted to do.

917
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:20,480
Oh, what's the English word for this?

918
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,860
Ending, right?

919
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,040
Hey!!
Grandma!

920
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,460
Grandma!
Grandma!

921
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,780
Grandma!

922
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:40,450
What the fuck?!

923
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,000
Grandma!

924
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,520
Would it be ok

925
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,760
if I can come back to work for you?

926
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,480
Jack, can I ask you for something?

927
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:57,100
Today, I want everyone to draw their dreams.

928
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:58,570
You too.

929
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:02,040
That's why you want to open a school?

930
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:06,350
Hey, sorry I'm a bit late.

931
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:07,640
It's ok.

932
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,890
Can I go to bed first?

933
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:12,320
The person carrying the water jugs from this morning,

934
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,240
you seem like you like him.
