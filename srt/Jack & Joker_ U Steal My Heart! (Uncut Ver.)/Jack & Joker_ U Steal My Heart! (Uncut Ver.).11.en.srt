This series is purely a work of fiction
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,010
Jack, do you know that we were the ones who returned the ring to Boss?

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,390
That's why he has powers like Thanos.

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,590
Sis
What happened?

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,750
A lot of things in the contract are exactly what you suggested to me.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,010
Shit

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,360
Let go.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,530
Help.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,000
Help.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,550
Toi Ting!
This whole thing happened because Save betrayed us.

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,410
It wasn't Save.

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,690
I was the one who gave the ring to Boss.

13
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,040
Why does it have to be you again?

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,210
What the hell did you do?
Hey, calm down!

15
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,210
Calm down, man!

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,330
Damn it!

17
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,440
Calm down, okay?

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,880
You promised me!

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,460
Didn’t you promise me that you wouldn’t do this again?
I’m sorry.

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,000
Do you see what you’ve done?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,950
Do you see Toi Ting?

22
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,630
And you expect me to stay calm?

23
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,610
What if it were your mother?

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,000
Calm down, Jack. Everyone’s upset right now.

25
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,590
This is a hospital, let’s talk it out calmly.

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,590
I’m not talking.

27
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,650
I don’t want to see your face again.

28
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,600
Don’t let me see your face ever again!

29
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,410
Fuck!!!

30
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,240
Hey, Jack, what’s your deal?

31
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,390
Where’s Boss?

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,410
Where’s Boss?

33
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,540
Hey,

34
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,300
Someone come down here and help! Jack’s heading up!
Boss, where are you?

35
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,200
Jack!

36
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,690
Hurry up!

37
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,440
Doctor, how is the patient?

38
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,230
She's in critical condition.

39
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,990
Multiple fractured ribs, severe internal bleeding,

40
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,260
and possible brain trauma.

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Prepare to move to the operating room immediately.

42
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,960
We must save this child.

43
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,810
Go!

44
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,660
Boss, come out!

45
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,780
I told you to come out!

46
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,270
Calm down.

47
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,160
Boss!!

48
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,890
I said calm down.

49
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,650
Has everything been a lie up until now?

50
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,950
The patient is losing a lot of blood, and their blood pressure is dropping.

51
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,340
What’s happening in the OR?
Toi Ting!

52
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,490
How’s Toi Ting doing?

53
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,980
Please wait outside and have a seat.

54
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,600
Can I go in and see her?
I’m sorry, but you’ll have to wait outside.

55
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,000
Toi Ting!
Toi Ting!

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,080
You stay here!

57
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,630
Let me go!

58
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,910
Calm down!

59
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,290
If you go in, you’ll only make it harder for them to work.
Stay here!

60
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,570
Calm down!
Toi Ting!

61
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,510
Boss, come out!

62
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,340
Boss!

63
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,280
Go!

64
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,050
Stop it already!

65
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,780
I’m sorry.

66
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,500
Joke.

67
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,090
It’s all my fault.

68
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,780
Hey, don’t hurt yourself.

69
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don’t give up, Toi Ting.

70
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,870
Grandpa knows you can do it.

71
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,600
Toi Ting, I'm so sorry.

72
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,420
I brought you into my family,

73
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,590
but you chose those people instead.

74
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,659
Then I’ll destroy your entire family.

75
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,930
Oh,

76
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,460
how’s it going with Toi Ting? Feeling good?

77
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
I’ll kill you!!!

78
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,570
Hey, remember me?

79
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,670
Your skills are as pathetic as ever.

80
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,470
With skills like that, who could you possibly teach?

81
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,180
Enough chit-chat, drag him out of here

82
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,180
and get the car ready.

83
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,240
You’ll never beat me and my crew.

84
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,409
But for now, I think it’s time you got some rest.

85
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,980
How’s Toi Ting doing?

86
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,700
Are you Toi Ting’s family?

87
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,640
Yes.

88
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,680
I’m here to let you know you should go home and rest for now.

89
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,040
Come visit again tomorrow.

90
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Why? Is something wrong?

91
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,210
Let me go in and see for myself.

92
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,920
Family members aren’t allowed in the OR.

93
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,110
I’m not leaving until I see Toi Ting today.

94
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,540
Calm down, man!

95
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,200
You should listen to the nurse’s advice.

96
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,730
What’s all this commotion so late at night?

97
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,680
Dad, how’s Toi Ting?

98
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,360
She's not fully recovered yet, but she's out of danger.

99
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,250
A few more days of observation, and she’ll be able to recover at home.

100
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,460
Toi Ting’s safe now! Yes!

101
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,500
Keep it down. Haven’t you been warned enough already?

102
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,880
As for the expenses, I’ll cover them.

103
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,970
Thank you, Dad.

104
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,660
Thank you.

105
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,000
You can go home now, come back with your boyfriend tomorrow to visit your child.

106
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,630
Toi Ting!

107
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,020
Jack!

108
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,580
Toi Ting!

109
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,570
Don’t rush to get up.

110
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,290
Rest first.

111
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,770
Rest, rest!

112
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,730
How is Toi Ting?

113
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,930
Toi Ting’s fine, don’t worry.

114
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,700
We’ll visit tomorrow, okay?

115
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,000
How do you know?

116
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,310
Are you sure?

117
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,020
Joke called and told me himself.

118
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,820
Jack, I think that...

119
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
Grandma.

120
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
Don't say that name again.

121
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,950
I don't want to hear it.

122
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,540
Grandma,

123
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
how did I even get back here?

124
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,290
Don’t tell me that guy brought me back.

125
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,650
I’m the one who brought you back.

126
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:04,260
Jack, you’re awake?

127
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:11,800
You should thank Save, he’s the one who helped treat your wounds.

128
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,290
Grandma..

129
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,720
How can you expect me to thank him?

130
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,240
It’s already good enough that I didn’t beat him up right here.

131
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,580
The reason Grandma ended up in the hospital, why Boss oppresses us like this...

132
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,200
It’s because of him, Grandma.

133
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,350
Jack, you should speak more kindly.

134
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,350
What more do you want from him?

135
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,350
Save is also a victim of Boss.

136
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,680
Have you forgotten that when you hadn’t paid off your debt yet,

137
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,340
you were also forced to do things you didn’t want to do?

138
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,900
Jack, I’m sorry for betraying you.

139
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,170
Grandma, I’m sorry.

140
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,150
This room hasn’t been used for a while.

141
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,000
Try and see if you can sleep here.

142
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,750
Ok.

143
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,540
Wow, of course you can, your room is even cleaner than mine.

144
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,940
When Dad and Mom heard you were coming back,

145
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,580
they immediately had the housekeeper clean it up.

146
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,020
Here are the keys.

147
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,870
This family misses you.

148
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,760
Thank you.

149
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,760
Now that you’re back, this house won’t feel so empty anymore.

150
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,090
But seriously, if there’s anything, tell me.

151
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,800
Don’t keep it to yourself, I’m here to listen.

152
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,600
I don’t want to see your face again.

153
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,650
Don’t let me see your face again.

154
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,599
(Learning Center closed indefinitely)

155
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,300
Let me ask you something.

156
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:23,000
You’ve been standing here for five minutes, and you haven’t done anything?

157
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,310
We’re trying to figure out what to do about Boss,

158
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,700
how to bring him down from power.

159
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:37,310
Oh, now you think of that?

160
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,860
Why didn’t you think of it when you were helping him?

161
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,840
Come on, when you betrayed us,

162
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,230
we still forgave you, didn’t we?

163
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,230
I’m serious here!

164
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:57,430
And how can you be so sure he won’t go and tell Boss about our plans again?

165
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,850
Boss hired Hope as his right-hand to keep me under control.

166
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,630
I had to keep making money for Boss so Hope wouldn’t suffer.

167
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:16,210
Now Boss has the ring and Carbon.

168
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:23,940
And my new contract, it means that neither Hope nor I are necessary to him anymore.

169
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,840
I can’t run away because I know too many of Boss’ secrets.

170
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:38,990
I’m not here to save you all, I’m here to save him.

171
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,760
Huh?

172
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,560
Turns out you haven’t changed, just two scared little cowards.

173
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,840
Hey, I’ve been listening to you insult Save for a while now.

174
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,960
Do you want to get punched?

175
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,070
And what if I do?

176
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,840
Hey, calm down!

177
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,530
I’m here to help you, so why are you complaining?
Calm down, guys!

178
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,650
Enough!

179
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,490
That's enough!

180
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,740
You can beat each other to death, and you still won’t beat Boss.

181
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,460
Let’s think of a better plan together.

182
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,390
Having two extra heads to think should be better than just us, right?

183
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,440
True.

184
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,310
I can’t take this anymore!

185
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,540
It’s so frustrating!

186
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,980
Why do I have to help everyone figure out how to bring down my own father?

187
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
This is my father we’re talking about!

188
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Your father’s the worst.

189
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,330
Fine, don’t help if you don’t want to.

190
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,020
But I can’t stand watching him hunt you all down one by one.

191
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,720
If Joke were here, it’d be great.

192
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,750
He always had ideas for things like this.

193
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,820
Oh, sorry, forgot.

194
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:20,760
I gotta go, there’s a monthly meeting with the Four Horsemen today.

195
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,550
Wait, so they’re playing a game dividing the spoils again today?

196
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:32,180
That means Boss has to attend the meeting too.

197
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:38,000
If my father wins this game, everything will get worse.

198
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,060
Yeah.

199
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,820
Save, I’ve got something I need your help with.

200
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,670
You’re probably the only one who can do it.

201
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,640
Are you ready to fix your mistakes?

202
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
But this is going to be super dangerous.

203
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,560
I’m ready.

204
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,080
Okay, follow me.

205
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,900
Where are you going?

206
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,460
To do what needs to be done.

207
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,030
Hope, you stay here.

208
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,030
I’ll be back soon.

209
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,250
Can’t I come too?

210
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,650
I can’t take all of you with me.

211
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,650
Even just two of us will be tough enough.

212
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,000
Hope, don’t worry.

213
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,560
Jack and I will be safe.

214
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,250
Aren’t you going?

215
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,310
No, Sister Nang said today’s my day off.

216
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,050
But honestly,

217
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,510
are we just going to sit around

218
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,960
and just do nothing?

219
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,480
I’ve been thinking all night.

220
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,710
If Boss has power because of the ring,

221
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,030
then let’s just steal the ring from him and end it.

222
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Easier said than done,

223
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
how do we steal it?

224
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,740
Joke’s not here.

225
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,250
Jack’s not here.

226
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,610
We can barely manage as it is.

227
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,110
If we try to steal it, we’re all dead.

228
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,110
Then we’ll do it our way.

229
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:57,560
Each of us comes up with a plan, and we discuss it.

230
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,870
Alright.

231
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,470
Sounds good.

232
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,440
Let's hear your plan first.

233
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,270
If it's my style,

234
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,950
I want to name our first plan

235
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,920
Plan A: Attack.

236
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,620
(Boss usually only has one person with him during meetings)

237
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,090
(Which is the driver, if all four of us ambush him at the car)

238
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,450
(Before he leaves, we might get the ring.)

239
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:47,330
Boss is alone, he's so done.

240
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,560
Let’s do it!

241
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,420
What are they doing

242
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,370
Looks like a gang fight, Boss.

243
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,660
Didn’t you say he'd come alone?

244
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,390
How was I supposed to know?

245
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,610
Almost died back there, you see?

246
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,570
Let’s change the plan, switch to another one.

247
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,480
Then it’s gotta be my plan.

248
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,390
I’ll name my Plan B... Block.

249
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,510
Hey, why are you guys fighting here?

250
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,510
Go away!!

251
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,440
Sorry, sir.

252
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,480
Sorry, sir, I didn’t do anything, I swear.

253
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,950
Sorry, sir.

254
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,460
(If we don’t want Boss to make it to the meeting,)

255
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,470
(we just have to block the roads and wait until the meeting ends.)

256
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,760
(Since I know this area well,)

257
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
(we’ll block the front and back of Boss.)

258
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,070
(Once Boss reaches the one-way section,)

259
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,130
Why are we stopping?

260
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
There’s a car blocking the way ahead, Boss.

261
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Hey, what’s going on up there?

262
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,260
No idea, sir. The car’s empty.

263
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,870
Then let’s turn back.

264
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,820
Yes, sir.

265
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,050
Can’t go back, sir.

266
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,240
What now?

267
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,940
Back up!

268
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,270
We can’t pass, sir.

269
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,320
This road’s one-way in, no way out, sir.

270
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,970
Why block it now?

271
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,970
Roadwork, my apologies.

272
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,030
Seems to be going well.

273
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,070
Now we’re stuck in this alley due to the roadwork. We can’t get out.

274
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:44,920
Damn it! Well, sort it out quickly.

275
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,650
Yes, sir.

276
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,590
Hey, can you let us through?

277
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,030
Sorry, sir. No can do.

278
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
Just a little problem, Boss.

279
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:00,860
Let it go, you wanted to see what power feels like, right?

280
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,050
Sir, just give us a moment, please.

281
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,380
The road wasn’t blocked earlier, you know.

282
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,080
It’s an order, sir. It’ll be done soon.

283
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,080
It’s just a few cars, please open it up quickly.

284
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,230
What?

285
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,900
Well, I’ll get scolded, sir.

286
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,510
You’ll get scolded? What about me?

287
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Oh crap, cops are here.

288
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,390
Hey, what are you doing?

289
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,250
J-just doing roadwork, sir.

290
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,130
Do you have a permit? Let me see it.

291
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,200
Uh... no permit, sir. I’m not on drugs, though.

292
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,630
Let’s have a little chat. Move the sign.

293
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,120
This alley is for important people to pass, you can’t block it like this.

294
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,400
But I’m fixing the road, sir.

295
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Move the sign!

296
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,240
We’re screwed, the cops are here.

297
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,060
All done, Boss.

298
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,650
Okay.

299
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,020
I’ll be on my way then, sir.

300
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,470
Wait a second. You, stop.

301
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,320
Let me check your papers.

302
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,160
I don’t have any, sir.

303
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,020
You’re coming to the station with me.
Again? Really?

304
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,970
Come on.

305
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,390
Why’s it always me?

306
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
More like Plan B-Bah bye!

307
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,250
What’s next? Who’s got a plan?

308
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,800
Here comes my plan.

309
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,440
Plan C: Call!

310
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,000
Wow, took so long enough to deal with the cops.
Hoy, shut up.

311
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,940
Hello, who is this?

312
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,680
Dad, it’s me, Arun.

313
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,390
How are you, Dad? Are you doing well?

314
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,590
I really miss you and want to see you.

315
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Everyone’s been talking about you so much.

316
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:30,000
Please, don’t be the scary person everyone says you are.

317
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,060
(I don’t have a son.)

318
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Dad!!

319
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,650
Gossiping about dad now...

320
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,490
What do we do, guys?

321
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,600
There's no father anymore.

322
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,180
What are you waiting for? Blow it up!

323
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,930
Plan D: Dynamite.

324
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,880
Hey, when did you plant a bomb?

325
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,580
When Boss turned out of the alley.

326
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:14,320
Are you nuts? That was so quick.

327
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
What are you, The Flash?

328
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,000
Blow it up!

329
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,610
Don’t hurt my dad!

330
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,440
After everything your dad’s done, you still call him Dad?

331
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,120
I still love him, Tattoo.

332
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,690
If you have a dad like that, I say blow him to pieces.

333
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,680
Don’t hurt my dad, I don’t want him to die.

334
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,880
Your dad’s dead!!

335
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,960
I’ll be your dad.

336
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
I only have one dad.

337
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,280
Everyone only has one dad.

338
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,320
Me too.

339
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,560
Blow it up already!

340
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,770
Hey, Tattoo, don’t! That’s my dad!

341
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,100
I’m blowing it up!

342
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,350
Hey, stop fighting, you guys.

343
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,950
You don’t need to fight anymore.

344
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,950
Boss is here.

345
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,800
What the hell?!

346
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,590
Fast car.

347
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,450
See? Because you two were busy fighting,

348
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,450
we couldn’t stop Boss.

349
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Hope, what’s with the attitude?

350
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,710
Sorry, but your Plan A failed first.

351
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,220
Ouch, harsh.

352
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,490
Damn it!

353
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,230
Everything’s a total bust.

354
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,740
Anyone got any other plans?

355
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,900
A, B, C, D... Anyone got a Plan E?

356
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,640
Rose!

357
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,810
Rose?

358
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,290
Huh?

359
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,600
Give me my ring back.

360
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,000
Don’t think that just because I’m nice, I’ll let this slide.

361
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,500
Hey, is Rose part of our plan now?

362
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:40,910
Catch Boss, he’s the one who stole my father’s ring.

363
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,220
But technically, the ring’s with Boss now.

364
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:50,150
That means Boss has all the rights the Four Horsemen have, right?

365
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,660
You have no right to enter this house.

366
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,220
What do you mean? I’m Rose.

367
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,900
I’ve come and gone from this house countless times, don’t you remember?

368
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,130
Let me talk to Lompran.

369
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,130
Mr. Lompran, Rose wants to talk to you.

370
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,510
Hurry up!

371
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:15,300
Lompran, it’s me. Can you check this out?

372
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,590
I’ve heard everything.

373
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,160
I stand by what I said. If you agree to date me,

374
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:27,190
I’ll let you enter my house as a daughter-in-law of the Four Horsemen.

375
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:31,490
No way, I’ll never marry you.

376
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,490
Get down here right now!

377
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,000
Lompran!

378
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,520
Lompran!

379
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:45,920
When stripped of power, you’re just a spoiled brat.

380
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,490
Where are you going, Boss? Talk to me first!

381
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,110
You can’t enter.

382
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,440
I’m Rose, don’t you remember?

383
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,920
Boss, come out and talk.

384
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,520
Let go.

385
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,010
You can't enter.

386
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,390
Don't you remember? I'm Rose.

387
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,060
What now? Anyone got another plan?

388
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:16,010
Let’s leave it to fate.

389
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:37,290
What I’ve heard must be true.

390
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:42,480
You’ve finally pushed yourself to this point, Alice.

391
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,670
Last time, you invited me to play Monopoly,

392
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:50,500
but I was at a disadvantage from the start.

393
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,320
Today, I’d like a fair rematch.

394
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,040
No objections, right?

395
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,480
No one opposes.

396
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,040
You’ve earned it.

397
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,830
Where’s the last Horseman?

398
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,540
This is Lompran's home, why is he late?

399
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:42,700
May divine intervention

400
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:51,920
send us a hero to vanquish the villain.

401
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,120
Apologies for the wait, everyone.

402
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,420
What’s this, Lompran?

403
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,920
Oh, my father lost the ring.

404
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,910
And this gentleman found it.

405
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,920
Today, I'm just a host for this game.

406
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,700
You all set this up against me?

407
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:54,250
Someone once asked me how a thief would resolve this situation.

408
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,490
This is probably it.

409
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,570
What can I do for you, Jack?

410
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,340
Last time, when I beat you at Monopoly,

411
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,350
you said I could ask for three things, right?

412
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,680
Yes, and you’ve used them all up.

413
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,410
Don’t mess with Rose,

414
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,080
don’t take Tattoo’s mom’s kidney,

415
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,740
and treat you as an equal.

416
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,200
Not happy with one of your wishes?

417
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,000
If I want to trade

418
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,320
treating me as an equal for something else, can I?

419
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:56,880
It must be something significant for you to put your dignity on the line.

420
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,110
Yes, it’s far more important.

421
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,110
I misjudged you.

422
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:21,120
I thought you were just another poor guy trying to get rich quick.

423
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,240
But this is downright greedy.

424
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,900
Have you been hanging around Alice too much?

425
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,720
I’m not doing this for myself.

426
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,490
This is the only way to stop Boss,

427
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:41,050
before even you can’t stop him.

428
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:46,430
So you’re saying I can’t beat your Boss in this game?

429
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:50,360
No, but wouldn’t it be better

430
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:55,120
if we played a game we’re 100% sure to win?

431
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,280
What do you mean?

432
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,020
What guarantees do you have?

433
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:18,730
If I lose, take my life.

434
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:33,230
If we cancel treating you as an equal,

435
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:37,430
then your're dog.

436
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,720
What breed do you want?

437
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,440
Siberian.

438
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,980
Bark again.

439
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:21,080
Okay, okay. How about Chihuahua?

440
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:33,440
Cute! Spin around, spin!

441
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,400
Spin!

442
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,920
Next, a Pit bull.

443
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,400
Fiercer!

444
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,160
More fierce!

445
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,350
Bang!

446
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
Play dead, too!

447
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,940
Play dead.

448
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,660
Laugh, damn it!

449
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,800
Hey, don’t die yet. Get up, get up!

450
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
How about a golden retriever?

451
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,280
Shake hands.

452
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,330
Good boy.

453
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:35,610
I see why Rose likes you.

454
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,360
Even as a dog, you’re handsome.

455
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,030
Keep barking.

456
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,460
Want a Shiba too?

457
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,570
Bring it on.

458
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,740
Bark, Shiba.

459
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,970
This breed doesn’t bark much.

460
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:57,240
Oh, this breed doesn’t bark? Come here, lie down.

461
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,150
Oh no, Shiba Jack!

462
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,830
So obedient.

463
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:12,290
Are the game rules the same today?

464
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,930
Players must wager their real-life assets.

465
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:21,300
And to make it a fair rematch,

466
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,960
we’re playing Monopoly again today.

467
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,740
So, what’s everyone’s starting bet?

468
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,910
How about five million, Alice?

469
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,910
Make it fifty million.

470
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:36,300
Wow.

471
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,040
Thank you.

472
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,070
With such a big-hearted sponsor, aren’t you afraid of losing it all?

473
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:53,430
You're siding with a kid who's never played this game before. You really trust his skills, huh?

474
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:57,210
You don’t need to worry about me.

475
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:02,740
I can't match your skills or experience in this game anyway.

476
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,670
Alright, let’s begin.

477
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,690
Six.

478
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,080
Pathumwan District.

479
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,430
I’ll buy it.

480
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,250
Two.

481
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:37,910
I’ll pass.

482
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:45,000
Would you like some advice? You’re hesitating over such a low price?

483
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,880
I don’t like to reach beyond my limits.

484
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,600
Your turn, Pathapee.

485
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,040
Bang Rak District.

486
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,470
I’ll buy it.

487
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,540
One.

488
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,080
Khlong San District.

489
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,400
Investment.

490
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,800
Samphanthawong District.

491
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,720
I’ll buy it.

492
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,260
Three.

493
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,480
This is yours, Mr. Patthapee.

494
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,860
Thank you.

495
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,930
Wow.

496
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,480
Pay the toll, please.

497
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,060
Might as well keep buying.

498
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,690
Looks like you’ve intentionally lost the ring to the wrong thief.

499
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:34,320
Six.

500
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,890
One, two, three, four, five, six.

501
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:43,250
Wow, lucky you, Your Highness.

502
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,690
May I buy that spot from you?

503
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,190
It’s a good spot too.

504
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,020
I promise to take good care of it.

505
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,440
I’ll be watching.

506
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,070
One.

507
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,400
Phra Khanong.

508
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,830
I’ll buy it.

509
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,480
Bang Bon.

510
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,440
I’ll buy it.

511
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,410
Two.

512
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,860
Ho ho.

513
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,240
Six.

514
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,520
I’ll buy it.

515
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,830
I’ll buy it.

516
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,440
Two.

517
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,300
One, two.

518
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,300
Wattana District.

519
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,710
Oh.

520
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:41,680
I’m low on cash, but I’ll only charge you half the toll.

521
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,680
You think I can’t afford it?

522
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,520
Three.

523
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,660
I’ll buy it.

524
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,880
Three.

525
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,300
Oops.

526
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,580
What the heck?

527
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,070
I’ve never had such bad luck before.

528
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,280
Are you all conspiring against me?

529
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,060
Oops.

530
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:07,960
I’m not playing anymore.

531
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,560
Ah, ah, don’t forget.

532
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,970
If you do that, it’ll count as a foul and a loss.

533
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:19,000
You do know the severe penalties for not respecting the game rules, don’t you?

534
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,380
You only have one property left, Alice.

535
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:31,900
Will you hand over Suphanimit to me, or will you go bankrupt

536
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,250
and pay me back later?

537
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:41,030
Going bankrupt isn’t so bad, at least you’ll still have a home.

538
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:44,030
But you’ll owe over 100 million.

539
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,240
You’ll be in debt for life.

540
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,870
You lost because you’re greedy.

541
00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:01,110
If you’d used your brain,

542
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:06,130
this simple dice game wouldn’t have defeated you

543
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:09,350
because it’s just a basic Monopoly game.

544
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:23,090
Boss, it’s time for you to decide.

545
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,000
Fine, take the slum you want so badly.

546
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:39,840
The slum?

547
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,490
Don’t think I’ll give up so easily.

548
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,000
I won’t either.

549
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Give me my ring back!

550
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,330
I didn’t actually steal this ring.

551
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:10,060
I just took it from the thief.

552
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:14,220
Taking it back from me for free isn’t fair to me either.

553
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,620
Oh, playing hard to get, are we?

554
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,620
What do you want, then?

555
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:28,960
How about we discuss the details somewhere else?

556
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,890
After you, Rose.

557
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,880
Why should I go with you?

558
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,000
Be gentle!

559
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,190
Take it easy.

560
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,560
The more you clean, the messier it gets, so let me clean it for you.

561
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,310
Oh!

562
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:34,720
(100 ways to say "Thank you" without meeting in person)

563
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,320
My back hurts.

564
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:15,240
Without Joke around, there’s no one to help anymore.

565
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:23,310
And the ship that Toi Ting and I paddled for so long has capsized too.

566
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,770
I've only been gone a day!

567
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,230
Gah! You scared me!

568
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,620
Joke!
Grandma.

569
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,620
Joke!

570
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,680
What’s this about a ship? I don’t know anything about it.

571
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,750
Never mind, Have you two reconciled?

572
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:46,440
Are you coming back to live together?

573
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:51,140
Actually, I came back to pack my things.

574
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,370
And to say goodbye to you.

575
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,160
Oh.

576
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:00,300
I thought you two were just hot-headed.

577
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:08,420
Try living apart for a few days and then come back together, okay?

578
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:13,540
Better than leaving with unresolved feelings.

579
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:19,330
I can tell you two still love each other.

580
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,320
Just because I’m leaving doesn’t mean I don’t love him.

581
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,600
Even if we forgive each other this time,

582
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,480
there’ll still be problems if I’m the issue.

583
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:36,370
As long as Jack has me in his life,

584
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,960
problems will keep coming.

585
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,960
Endlessly.

586
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,350
I’ve made up my mind.

587
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,450
Then I wish you the best of luck.

588
00:53:55,550 --> 00:54:03,500
And don’t forget to forgive yourself, everyone makes mistakes.

589
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,170
You just made a few too many, that’s all.

590
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,230
Huh?

591
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,530
True enough, Grandma.

592
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:27,220
But all the good things you’ve done?

593
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,000
They’re still there.

594
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,170
Good is good, bad is bad.

595
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:41,490
You're like my son.

596
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:45,270
To me, you’re still family.

597
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,880
Thank you, Grandma.

598
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,690
I actually have something for you and Toi Ting.

599
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:13,060
This is for you, Grandma, for cooking for me,

600
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,210
giving me a place to stay, a bed, a bathroom.

601
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,830
Thank you so much.

602
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:32,180
Oh, I’ll never use all of this!

603
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:37,770
I heard the electricity bill tripled when I was here.

604
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:45,230
Please take it, and thank you for everything.

605
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:58,930
And this is for Toi Ting.

606
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:05,130
Wow.

607
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,860
She will love it.

608
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,360
I made it myself.

609
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,920
It’s beautiful.

610
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:26,000
Tell her she’s a brave kid.

611
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:39,160
And I believe Toi Ting will be a role model for Suphanimit.

612
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,610
Toi Ting, I’m sorry.

613
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:57,480
I can’t play with you as I promised.

614
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:06,400
But I’ll always be watching your growth.

615
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,380
And I’ll visit you often.

616
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:21,050
To me, you'll always be family.

617
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:09,970
As for Jack,

618
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,590
he probably doesn’t want anything from me anymore.

619
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:30,000
But if one day he asks about me,

620
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:50,780
tell him I’m thankful for the smiles we shared every time we met.

621
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:02,210
I’m sorry I couldn’t keep any promises.

622
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:05,100
Like quitting being a thief...

623
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:22,860
Or staying by his side until his dreams come true

624
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:38,050
And about what he said to not show my face again

625
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:44,660
I don’t know if I can do it, but I’ll try.

626
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,320
Joke.

627
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,090
Will I remember all that?

628
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,040
Fate’s funny, isn’t it?

629
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:43,870
You exchanged Jack’s freedom for never seeing him again.

630
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,540
I guess Jack’s back home.

631
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:08,220
You really don’t want to reconcile?

632
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,540
No, I don’t.

633
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:20,990
Joke.

634
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:27,000
Grandma, take care of your health.

635
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,700
Wow, look after yourself too, Grandma.

636
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,200
I just realized how exhausting it is to be a dog.

637
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,420
Seriously, after winning so many games together,

638
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:15,000
in the end, we had to give everything to Mr. Lompran.

639
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:20,160
At least we still have Suphanimit left.

640
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:23,990
If I’d known, I wouldn’t have returned the ring.

641
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:28,360
With the ring, we could’ve done so much more.

642
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,080
What’s with you?

643
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:37,610
You barely wore the ring, and now you’re turning into Gollum?

644
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:39,810
It’s good you gave it back.

645
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:45,440
Honestly, people like us aren’t suited for things like that.

646
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,430
Yeah, true.

647
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:55,210
But I do get why those in power indulge in corruption.

648
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:58,450
Once you’re in, it’s hard to get out.

649
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:01,840
Yeah.

650
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,000
So, what’s next for you?

651
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:13,890
After this, I’ll probably head back to sleep.

652
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:21,960
Tomorrow, I’ll tell the villagers I’ll be taking over Suphanimit from Boss.

653
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,580
I might also settle some debt issues.

654
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:30,000
As per the contract, Boss’s debtors still need to pay up.

655
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,400
Otherwise, it’d mess up the system.

656
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,600
True.

657
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:40,090
Thanks a lot. I’ll leave things in your hands.

658
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:45,410
Thank you for letting me atone for my mistakes.

659
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:53,880
But it seems like I’ll have a lot more work coming my way.

660
01:03:53,880 --> 01:04:00,290
What about you? What’s your plan?

661
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:09,240
I’ll probably deal with things at home first.

662
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,790
Alright, I’ll be off then.

663
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:15,210
Good luck.

664
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:16,340
Yeah, get some rest.

665
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:47,990
Grandma...

666
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,560
Was it you who betrayed me?

667
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,450
Huh?

668
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:18,150
Is that your friend running over there?

669
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,270
Save!

670
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,500
Are you okay?

671
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:25,280
Run ahead, I’ll handle this.

672
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,000
No.

673
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,720
What, are you some kind of hero?

674
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,720
A hero?

675
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:20,220
Beat them up!

676
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,940
Hey, let's go!

677
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,410
Save!

678
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,240
Save!

679
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:59,470
Save!

680
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,080
Who are you? Why are you here?

681
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:09,950
Grandma!

682
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:11,070
Joke!

683
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:12,510
Joke!

684
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:17,320
What did you do to Grandma? What do you want?

685
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,610
Joke, run!

686
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,220
Run!
No, Grandma!

687
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,840
I’m just here to do my job.

688
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,800
Don’t take it personally.

689
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:30,900
Didn’t you guys say you’d leave Jack alone?

690
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:34,940
I’m not here for Jack.

691
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:41,560
But your name’s Joke, right? Someone wants to see you.

692
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:45,640
I don’t want to meet them.

693
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,420
Don’t hurt Joke.

694
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,760
Did he teach you to fight?

695
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,950
Did it mention how he also lost to me the same way?

696
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:20,990
Joke!!

697
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:25,020
Ouch!

698
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,910
So we can’t just settle this peacefully?

699
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:36,310
Alright, I’ll handle it!!

700
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:38,800
White-Haired Queen’s Fury.

701
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:20,090
You hurt Toi Ting, and now you’re after Joke?

702
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:25,500
Don’t think you’re leaving this house in one piece today.

703
01:09:46,779 --> 01:09:48,779
Damn, she's just an old lady!

704
01:09:57,550 --> 01:10:02,970
Stop fighting, Joke. You can’t beat me.

705
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:13,920
Think about it, do you want to help Grandma or come with me willingly?

706
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,800
No way.

707
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:24,790
Grandma!

708
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,560
Grandma!

709
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,460
Hey!

710
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:47,190
That’s a good kid.

711
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:06,910
Don’t bother trying, it won’t come off.

712
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:10,330
I’ve tried everything.

713
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:14,200
Worse, that thing on your neck might be a bomb.

714
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:18,120
Be careful.

715
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:23,040
Save...

716
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,120
Where are we?

717
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:30,280
An abandoned factory Boss uses.

718
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,200
It’s for holding debtors.

719
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:38,380
Do you know where we are?

720
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:42,440
And how do we get out?

721
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,360
I kinda know, but...

722
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,360
it’s not as easy as you’d think.

723
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:52,160
How did you and Rose get caught?

724
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:55,630
Because you guys started it.

725
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,480
Boss!! You bastard!

726
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:10,940
If it were me, I wouldn’t do that.

727
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:16,640
If the detonator on the neck breaks and the bomb goes off,

728
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:18,880
you’ll die.

729
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,320
What do you want?

730
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:24,890
To play a game.

731
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:27,350
You guys love games, don’t you?

732
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,430
I’ll set it up.

733
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:37,450
Jack, Save, you both betrayed me.

734
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:42,070
Today, I’ll make it unforgettable.

735
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:47,540
So you’ll remember never to go against me again.

736
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,980
Still playing games, huh?

737
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:53,830
Huh?

738
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,080
Boss, aren’t you tired of doing everything alone?

739
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:11,050
You’ll never win, you know.

740
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:17,580
I’ve got friends, they’ll be here soon.

741
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:23,830
And you? You’ll end up alone and die

742
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:25,830
but in prison.

743
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:28,010
Hey, Save!

744
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:30,740
What the hell is this?

745
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:41,250
Did you forget who I am?

746
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:44,530
I’m not alone.

747
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:49,150
If you want to come, then all of you come.

748
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:51,150
I’ll be waiting.

749
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:15,000
Ah! Where am I?

750
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:20,480
Why did you capture me? Let me go right now!

751
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,840
What took you so long to realize?

752
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:29,670
Everyone’s done talking, beauty.

753
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,330
Did you forget who I am?

754
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:35,110
If I get out!!

755
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:37,930
Let go!

756
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,480
Go sit and shut up!

757
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,760
Sit!

758
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,460
Do you know who I am?
Sit down.

759
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,590
Hey! Grandma!

760
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,350
Grandma!

761
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,030
What happened?

762
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:13,250
Grandma!

763
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:14,350
Grandma!

764
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:15,470
What happened?

765
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:16,340
Jack.

766
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,360
Who did this to you?

767
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:21,970
Joke.

768
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:22,640
Grandma!

769
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,870
Jack, go save Joke.

770
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:26,660
Why?

771
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,930
Joke was taken away.

772
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:47,140
Boss, Jack is now inside.

773
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:51,030
Did you guys hear that? There's an important guest coming soon.

774
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:53,430
Jack
Stop.

775
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:56,090
Then it's time to have some fun.

776
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,880
Hey, Arun's here.

777
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,970
You guys get out of the way.

778
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:06,400
Don't touch my boyfriend!

779
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,340
If you love each other too much, you'll die together.
