00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
This series is purely a work of fiction
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,220
Arun, you look good in everything you wear.

3
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,140
Especially this necklace.

4
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,280
It looks so expensive when you wear it.

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,050
So beautiful, so mysterious

6
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,850
Oh, you're flattering me too much

7
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,070
This necklace is actually my mother’s

8
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,390
Really!

9
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,540
It’s an heirloom from my great-grandmother

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,170
And these things are just ordinary

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,720
Oh, Arun,

12
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,400
the “ordinary” things you’re talking about,

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,870
are they made from European marble floors?

14
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,700
And all those things you’re wearing,

15
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,410
aren’t they the stuff debtors pawned to the Boss?

16
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,220
And wearing it like this,

17
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,130
are you afraid he's going to get mad?

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,820
He won’t

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,740
He might not even remember

20
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,060
There are so many things

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,539
Arun,

22
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:43,229
the jewelry brands we contacted for sponsorship for the fashion show,

23
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,000
they all canceled

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,500
What?

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,420
They said your brand is…

26
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,640
It’s…

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,640
It’s too brand new..

28
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,050
Wow, how insulting!

29
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,710
The brand owner spent hundreds of thousands

30
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,700
on ads, on huge billboards

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,670
and not one person noticed?

32
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,440
Well...

33
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,000
I meant Arun's brand

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,200
has been around for a long time, right?

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,700
Yes!

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,380
The brand has grown for so long

37
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,040
They just don’t have an eye for it.

38
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,510
That's right!

39
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,010
Been around this long but still not famous, huh?

40
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,520
Okay,

41
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,820
I won’t say anything more

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What should we do now?

43
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,660
The theme is space metallic avant garde,

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
we need a lot of stuff!

45
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,000
How about this, Arun?

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,270
Bring all the jewelry you have at home

47
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,780
and use it for the event

48
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
Hmm...
Interesting

49
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,870
It's possible.

50
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,870
You mean these cheap things?

51
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,850
Yes, nowadays, big brands like Jean Paul Gaultier,

52
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,580
Thierry Mugler, Givenchy, or Versace

53
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,650
like to mix mismatched accessories,

54
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,170
put it all together.

55
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,430
More is more, bring it all

56
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:23,480
Put it all on, to confuse the unfashionable.

57
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,770
I agree, Arun.

58
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,180
Yes.

59
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,180
Noo Lek!!

60
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,079
Noo Lek!!

61
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,300
(Yes?)

62
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,230
Noo Lek!!

63
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,230
(Yes, I’m coming)

64
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,430
If you’re not in front of me in three seconds,

65
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,620
I won’t pay your salary

66
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,120
(Yes, I’m here)

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,620
One

68
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,360
(I’m here!)

69
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,000
Two

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,730
(I’m here!)

71
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,910
Here I am.

72
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,790
Come with me to the debtors’ treasure room

73
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,820
Oh my,

74
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,620
a treasure room?

75
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,420
I thought this was Indiana Jones' house

76
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,660
I've never heard of it in my life.

77
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,400
Yes

78
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,760
It’s true

79
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,370
Can I go in and take a look?

80
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,780
Whoa

81
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,450
Wow!

82
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,450
Whoa

83
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,980
(Necklaces, jugs.)

84
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,700
Can you really pawn these things?

85
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,930
Hmm

86
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,220
The stuff here ranges in price

87
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,430
There are things worth hundreds of millions,

88
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,230
down to grade-c knockoffs from the Golden Gate Plaza

89
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,230
But most people here don’t have much money

90
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,850
Whatever they get, they pawn it

91
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,480
That’s why there’s all this weird stuff

92
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,670
Oh..

93
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,640
So, everything in this room

94
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,300
comes from debtors?

95
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,980
Just some of it

96
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,560
To pawn something to my father,

97
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,170
they have to work for him

98
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:52,550
Those who don’t have anything or can’t pay off their debt,

99
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,550
they have to face something else

100
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Face something else?

101
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,570
Don’t tell me

102
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,560
You mean they get…

103
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Beaten up

104
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,620
I figured that from the start.

105
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,360
Me too.

106
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,850
Do they die from it?

107
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,740
No they don't.

108
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,880
But just enough for some blood and rubber to be spilled.

109
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,200
I understand the blood.

110
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,120
But spilling rubber? Are your debtors toads?

111
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,630
There!

112
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,390
I’m sweating.

113
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,240
Not spilling anything, just sweating.

114
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,030
But, Arun,

115
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,830
just now I saw something

116
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,940
This one would be perfect for us

117
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,960
Hey! Hands off! Use your eyes, not your hands!

118
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,480
You’ll damage it

119
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,450
But Arun, I want to touch it

120
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,450
Can’t I just touch it a little?

121
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,720
No, everything here has an anti-theft alarm

122
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,670
If you don’t want to talk to my father,

123
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,090
just look with your eyes.

124
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,909
Okay, I won’t touch it

125
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,990
This watch is amazing too

126
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,890
Oh my!

127
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,530
Wow!

128
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,780
Oh my, this ring is stunning

129
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,690
It’s super glam!

130
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,590
I think it fits the theme.

131
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,590
That's true.

132
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,820
But I think it..

133
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,400
No buts!

134
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,210
This ring, I see it, I like it, I got it.

135
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,790
Okay, Arun, you have great taste.

136
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,040
Good taste

137
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Arun, is there more you want to show me?

138
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,220
Come on, come on

139
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,010
There are even more beautiful things

140
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,380
Right?

141
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,080
Sis.

142
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,110
What’s up?

143
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,510
Do you need makeup artists for the event?

144
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,100
I can do makeup

145
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,550
I'll come and help.
(Oh my, what was that?)

146
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,110
If you need anything, let me know

147
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,400
For real,

148
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,409
I could use an assistant

149
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,210
Don’t tell anyone,

150
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,210
Arun is so stingy

151
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,960
I’ve asked for an assistant many times

152
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,380
Never got one.

153
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,230
Did you know that every day,

154
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,400
I have to pay for food and transportation out of my own pocket?

155
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,980
It's costing me!

156
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,210
Oh my

157
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,780
Let me see

158
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,560
Arun, that looks good, really good taste.

159
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,350
It’s fine

160
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,210
Not a problem.

161
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
Always using me.

162
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,120
So slow to open!!

163
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,130
Oh wow!!

164
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,669
Who’s going to carry all of this stuff?

165
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,360
Let me call him.

166
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,190
Arun

167
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,730
Hello, Arun

168
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,890
There’s so much stuff!

169
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,120
How about this?

170
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,170
Have someone from the house help carry it?

171
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,680
I can’t carry it all, there’s too much

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,950
(Noo Lek, you’re getting paid, so work for it!)

173
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,170
(That’s all, no more talking, my throat hurts)

174
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,510
Oh, soar throat!? So annoying!!

175
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,780
Makes me want to throw my phone.

176
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,780
So mad!!

177
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,450
Want me to help?

178
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,180
Oh, so handsome!

179
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,350
Ahh! So handsome!

180
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Yes, I’ve been feeling weak lately

181
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,540
Eating less too

182
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,540
That’s why I’m slimmer

183
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,870
Help me carry it, I can’t hold it anymore

184
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,930
Ow, ow

185
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,660
Cheers!

186
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,830
Cheers and bottoms up!

187
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,390
Bottoms up!

188
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,960
Here, I’ll tell you something

189
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,020
My face is right here.

190
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,260
I don’t want to gossip,

191
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,100
or should I gossip?

192
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,210
Okay, I’ll gossip

193
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,080
You know Arun?

194
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,520
See all those bags?

195
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,080
He says it’s the only one in the world

196
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,190
Make more, so there’ll be more bags

197
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,110
So confusing

198
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,720
And another thing,

199
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,000
he said that bag is worth more than my life

200
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,060
So confusing, everything coming out of that mouth!

201
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,560
That mango shaped face!

202
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,680
Not only that, he says be careful it might go missing.

203
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,070
If you're afraid it'll go missing, keep it yourself.

204
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,730
Don't let someone else keep it.

205
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,250
Oops, I don’t want to gossip.

206
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,470
If his dad wasn't rich,

207
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,620
he wouldn't be throwing money around like this.

208
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,230
Honestly, this bitch,

209
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,900
Being rich alone isn't enough.

210
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,340
You need to have taste too.

211
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,790
Totally.

212
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,790
Listening to you, Noo Lek,

213
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,960
What?

214
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,010
I'm getting riled up!

215
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,010
Phew!

216
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,170
One bag can't be worth as much as an employee

217
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,010
that's as good as you?

218
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,340
- What are you doing?
- Let me refill that for you.

219
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,340
Oops, refill?

220
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,400
Oops, don’t overfill, I have an early job tomorrow.

221
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,400
It's already full.

222
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Just one glass.

223
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,000
Please?

224
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,680
Cheers to my talented one.

225
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,030
Please?

226
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,920
Since I started working, no one’s called me talented.

227
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
You’re the first.

228
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,700
Alright, one last glass.

229
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,430
Okay.

230
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,960
Here, cheers.

231
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,440
But looking at you, you seem familiar.

232
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,330
Don't tell me

233
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,810
You're my soulmate.

234
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,920
Definitely soulmates.

235
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
It’s me!

236
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,310
Noo Lek?

237
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,680
What?

238
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Get some rest.

239
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
So, you all are really going to help me, right?

240
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,310
What do we have to do?

241
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,670
I heard you're an inventor, right?

242
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,120
Well, I don’t want to brag.

243
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,050
Then don’t brag,

244
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,390
just do it.

245
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,210
This bag is going to flip the script on Arun’s fashion show.

246
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,040
It’ll help us

247
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,470
get back the important stuff from the debtors.

248
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,280
What the hell are you doing?

249
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,990
You just press this button, and it’ll start working.

250
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,710
Whoa.

251
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
All done.

252
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,570
Hey, with this muscle suit on, you look pretty buff.

253
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,000
You're posing?

254
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,390
I’m done, I’m going to rest.

255
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,720
Where are you going?

256
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,050
To the bathroom.

257
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,340
Oops

258
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,840
That way.

259
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,060
Which way is the bathroom?

260
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,560
That way.

261
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,280
Woah.

262
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,810
I'm all bones.

263
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,530
Guys, I bought lots of food for you.

264
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,810
Want some?

265
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,700
Put it over there.

266
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,700
Put it here? Okay.

267
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,170
What’s this?

268
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,220
What bag is that?

269
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,060
Tattoo made it.

270
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,890
It even has lights.

271
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,620
Whoa, it’s pretty cool.

272
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,400
And this remote?

273
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,620
Hey, don’t press that.

274
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,280
Damn!

275
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,400
Geez!

276
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,460
Shit, it works.

277
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,460
Everything almost went down the drain.

278
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,000
My life almost went down the drain.

279
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,000
I’ve got nothing to do.

280
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,130
I want to help.

281
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,280
Then do whatever you can

282
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
to make sure he one doesn’t show up at the event tomorrow.

283
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,160
Huh?

284
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
Whoa!

285
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Why won't this knock him out?

286
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,450
Hey! I'm sorry!

287
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,780
I got the wrong guy!

288
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,560
I was just joking!

289
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,850
What the hell are you doing?

290
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,400
Tattoo, help!

291
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,880
Calm down.

292
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,930
Please calm down.

293
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,500
Yes, boss.

294
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,359
(You don’t have to come to the office tomorrow.)

295
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,079
Go help at Arun’s store.

296
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,740
We’re short on people.

297
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,440
Got it.

298
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,280
(Once you're done, I'll give you a bonus for helping out with the extra work.)

299
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,619
You can save up to pay off your debts.

300
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,220
Thank you, boss.

301
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,120
Whew,

302
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,400
my heart nearly stopped.

303
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,640
Why are you so startled?

304
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,030
I thought you were a thief!

305
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,480
That was close.

306
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,840
So, why are you home so late?

307
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,120
Just finished work?

308
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,260
Yeah,

309
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,430
there were a lot of cases to clear up.

310
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,000
If I mess up, it’ll be on me.

311
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,250
Speaking of money,

312
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,250
the documents you submitted to the bank,

313
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,470
the bank

314
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,400
didn’t approve.

315
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,990
Because both your capital and credit

316
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,430
couldn't compete with others.

317
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,100
Sorry about that.

318
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,450
Yeah, I kinda figured.

319
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,780
Honestly,

320
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:40,610
you should save up and get back your ring.

321
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,000
At least you wouldn’t have to keep working for the boss.

322
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,790
It’s a tough call.

323
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,800
You know the boss only gives

324
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
me the most desperate cases.

325
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,080
If I don’t help, they can’t survive.

326
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,760
Do you know it’s a trap?

327
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,720
You’re way too kind.

328
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,630
But it’s up to you.

329
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,080
I’ll be off.

330
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,100
Let’s go!

331
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,110
Are you going to a cosplay event?

332
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,000
Whoa, all decked out in gold.

333
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,780
So, where’s the stuff I asked for?

334
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,320
It’s all in here.

335
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,430
Whoa!

336
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,920
Looks perfect!

337
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,700
How is it?

338
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,320
The quality is excellent.

339
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,000
But let me remind you all again,

340
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,000
we’re only stealing back the stuff from the debtors.

341
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,840
You’re not allowed to steal anything else.

342
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,340
Anything else? What do you mean?

343
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:46,160
Like bags, clothes, necklaces, anything from the shop.

344
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,070
Stuff like that?

345
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,570
Where would I even wear it?

346
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,560
Space?

347
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,350
Alright.

348
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,460
Only debtor stuff, okay?

349
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,800
Anything else, don’t take it.

350
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,020
Got it.

351
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,520
You keep repeating yourself.

352
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,190
Okay, let's go.

353
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,850
Hello? The food has arrived.

354
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,020
How tall are you?

355
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,080
180 cm.

356
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,800
Let me see you spin around.

357
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,200
Turn around.

358
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,240
Hmm, good form.

359
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
What’s your name?

360
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,680
Tongteng.

361
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,120
Tongteng, huh?

362
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,680
I wonder which part of you is hung like “teng.”

363
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,010
Just in time, I was getting hungry.

364
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,000
Thanks.

365
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,060
You’re welcome, enjoy your meal.

366
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,060
Thanks.

367
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,550
The food’s here, everyone.

368
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,080
Come eat!

369
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,760
Oh, it looks delicious.

370
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,730
Help yourselves.

371
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,440
This place is so good.

372
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,720
Eat quickly,

373
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,110
then get ready, everyone.

374
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,330
Joyce, where’s Noo Lek? Why isn’t she here yet?

375
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,780
The event is about to start!

376
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,210
I’ve called her so many times, she’s not picking up.

377
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,650
We sent someone to her condo,

378
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,880
they said she hasn’t been back since last night.

379
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,320
Oh no!

380
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,930
Do you think something happened to her?

381
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,500
What could have happened?

382
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,280
She’s missing, along with the bag.

383
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,600
She’s a thief!

384
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,130
A thief!

385
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,020
Oh no!

386
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,680
Noo Lek!

387
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,000
My bag can’t go missing!

388
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,550
It can’t!

389
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,220
Alright, let me call her.

390
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,740
(Joyce.)

391
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,200
(Joyce.)

392
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Where am I?

393
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,900
Phone.

394
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,660
Oh crap.

395
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,330
Hello, Joyce.

396
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,120
Hello, Noo Lek.

397
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,620
(Where are you?)

398
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Where am I?

399
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,020
Excuse me, where is this?

400
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,680
Nong Na Kham, Khon Kaen.

401
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,800
Nong Na Kham, Khon…

402
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,280
I’m in Khon Kaen, Joyce.

403
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,170
Khon Kaen?

404
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,170
What are you doing in Khon Kaen?

405
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,730
Where’s my bag?

406
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,000
It’s with that thing.

407
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,610
(Come back to my event!!)

408
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,180
(Or I'm not going to pay you a single baht!)

409
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,720
(I've never met such a terrible stylist before)

410
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
If I hadn’t paid you so little,

411
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,440
I would have torn up your contract long ago.

412
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,920
Yeah, tear it up already, damn it.

413
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,480
(Working with you is like making merit.)

414
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,440
I don’t get paid, but I gain merit.

415
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
I get more merit than going to the temple!

416
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,110
I’ll tell you what, Arun.

417
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,110
No one is as skilled as your mom.

418
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,040
(Why don't you go fix that mango shaped face of yours? )

419
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,440
Why don't you go fix that mango shaped face of yours?

420
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,990
Ah!!

421
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,660
Noo Lek!? How can you hang up on me?

422
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,660
Calm down, Arun.

423
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,000
My phone

424
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,610
How about this?

425
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,000
We’ll use another bag from the collection for the finale.

426
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,840
Would that be okay?

427
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,900
No.

428
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,510
It has to be this bag.

429
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,970
It’s the top limited-edition piece, the highlight, the main item.

430
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,730
Call until she picks up and comes here.

431
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,040
Noo Lek!

432
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,170
What was I drinking so much for?

433
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,780
How am I getting home?

434
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,670
Can can I get home?

435
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,960
How do I get back to Bangkok?

436
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,290
Well, how did you get here?

437
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,040
That’s a good question.

438
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,590
Ugh, stop calling already, damn it.

439
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,920
Ugh.

440
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,810
Did she answer?

441
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,810
Still no answer.

442
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,190
Sorry,

443
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,560
Noo Lek sent me to take over.

444
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,000
Noo Lek sent you?

445
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,360
Yes, she had to work out of town.

446
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,640
Arun.

447
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,710
My baby is back!

448
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,990
Why was that idiot bitching about my mother just now?

449
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,990
Totally crazy.

450
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,360
Take this bag for standby.

451
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,420
Hurry.

452
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,700
Then go help with the models’ outfits.

453
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,000
Arun all the guests are here.

454
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,700
Wait!

455
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,860
Did I pick this person?

456
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,690
His face doesn’t look familiar.

457
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,000
Joyce,

458
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,870
Yes?

459
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Did I really choose this person?

460
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,000
Yes, you did.

461
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,480
Are you sure?

462
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,950
Positive.

463
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,750
Is everything ready?

464
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,330
Well...

465
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:42,880
Yes, everything is fine.

466
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,080
Good.

467
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,900
One more thing.

468
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
What?

469
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,170
Go ahead, put them on.

470
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,000
Oh, glasses, right.

471
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Hurry up.

472
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,520
Forgot the glasses.

473
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,770
Make sure everything is in order.

474
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,520
All set.

475
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,020
Is everything ready?

476
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,070
All set.

477
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,370
Okay.

478
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,710
The glasses looks good, doesn’t it?

479
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,870
Alright, everyone, listen up.

480
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,450
The accessories on each of you

481
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,390
are rare and one of a kind in the world.

482
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,640
So, take care of them as if they’re your life.

483
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,440
But if anyone’s worried about losing something,

484
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
don’t be.

485
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,480
We have bodyguards watching each of you.

486
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
One-by-one.

487
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,700
They’re standing behind each of you right now.

488
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,040
Got it?

489
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,400
Jack,

490
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,780
do you use any moisturizer?

491
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
Why is your face so dry?

492
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Even as a bodyguard, you should take care of yourself.

493
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,600
Here, try this.

494
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,240
What's is it?

495
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,140
It’s called Vit-C gel.

496
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,540
Try it out.

497
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,040
Try it now?

498
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,110
Yes, use it now.

499
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,810
See how the face glows?

500
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,770
He really does look better.

501
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,040
Right?

502
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,610
Hello.

503
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,860
Hi Lhung.
Hello.

504
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,200
This event is as grand as ever, Khun Arun.

505
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Thank you.
Thank you.

506
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,040
See?

507
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,640
Hello.
Congratulations.

508
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,290
Where are you rushing off to? We haven’t seen each other in ages.

509
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,290
He is a top spender, you know?

510
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,140
Oh.
He buys from every collection.

511
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,640
Of course.

512
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
Thank you.

513
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,340
The Thoy.

514
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,530
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

515
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,980
Hello.
Hello.

516
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,980
Thank you so much for writing the column.

517
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,280
I’m really happy,

518
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,780
and I’m a fan of Spirit, by the way.

519
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
Can I have your hand?

520
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,500
Everything’s ready.

521
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,320
Jack.

522
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,700
Yes?

523
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,210
How do you know my name?

524
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,060
I mean,

525
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,410
the name engraved on the ring.

526
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,520
It’s probably the owner’s name.

527
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,330
I don’t think so.

528
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,700
I think it’s the brand name of...

529
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,350
Of the ring, right?

530
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,810
Or maybe the owner engraved the name of someone they love

531
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,400
someone named Jack

532
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,650
to remember them by.

533
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,610
Even so,

534
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,960
the real owner is still the person named Jack.

535
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,710
Isn’t that right?

536
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Are you okay?

537
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,330
I’m fine.

538
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,790
You’re lucky, man.

539
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,570
You get to guard your dad’s stuff.

540
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,450
If it were me, I’d be out of here so fast.

541
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,490
This is your one chance.

542
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,800
Then I guess it’s good it’s me

543
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,650
and not you.

544
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,480
Everyone, please follow me.

545
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,620
Are we ready?

546
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,550
Let’s go.

547
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,620
Oh,

548
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,440
I’m sorry, I got startled by the sound effect.

549
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,340
Are you the boss’s bodyguard?

550
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,480
Yes.

551
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,580
What’s your name?

552
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,330
Hope.

553
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,760
Hope?

554
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,660
That’s like a character from a romance novel!

555
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,560
I’m Joyce, I’m Arun’s assistant.

556
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,760
Oh!

557
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,410
Assistant.

558
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,340
Bodyguard.

559
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,310
We go well together.

560
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,490
What’s that sound?

561
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,310
I didn’t hear anything.

562
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,620
Maybe it’s part of the sound effects.

563
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:14,800
Oh.

564
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,790
But this time, there’s a smell too.

565
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,140
Yes, it smells really bad.

566
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,790
The sound effects are 4D now.

567
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,680
If you need to go to the bathroom, just go.

568
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,530
Stop trying to cover the smell of my English Pear & Freesia perfume.

569
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,660
Excuse me!

570
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,660
Here, take this bag.

571
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,830
Guard it with your life.

572
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,320
I can't.

573
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,340
Hey,

574
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,290
watch over this for me, I can’t take it anymore.

575
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,290
I need to take a dump.

576
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,870
Jack, watch over the models for me.

577
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,870
I smell something weird.

578
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,750
Joyce,

579
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,199
What?

580
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,199
Could you share the bathroom?

581
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,409
Joyce!

582
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:44,409
What is it now?

583
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,090
Joyce.

584
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,520
Hope.

585
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,820
Are you okay?

586
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,620
I have to be okay.

587
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,540
It must’ve been the boxed lunch.

588
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,340
I made sure to order from our usual place, though.

589
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,000
Wait!

590
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You're here,

591
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,680
so who’s watching the models?

592
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,020
Oh, I...

593
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,470
You don’t need to say anything.

594
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:13,580
I knows you’re worried about me.

595
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,130
But we still have a job to do

596
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,370
that we have to do together.

597
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:24,370
That job is to make sure we don’t lose any of the boss’s accessories.

598
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,580
Oh!

599
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,420
Ah!!

600
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,280
Wow, so beautiful, Arun.

601
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,650
(It’s so expensive.)

602
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,000
(This kind of thing would take more than a decade to pay off.)

603
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
(So expensive.)

604
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
(So elegant.)

605
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
(Yes, the attitude is on point.)

606
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,960
(Perfect, perfect.)

607
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,660
(Strike a pose, darling, lift your chin.)

608
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,240
(Keep that head up.)

609
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,930
Wait a minute.

610
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
Can I please check the ring?

611
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,860
Is something wrong?

612
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,860
I just want to check the ring.

613
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,320
Can I take a look?

614
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,490
Oh!

615
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,280
What the hell?

616
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,830
Help! Help!

617
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,830
There’s an incident inside, the bag exploded.

618
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,130
Requesting backup to maintain order inside.

619
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,640
What happened?

620
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Oh no!

621
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,610
Why did the bag's electrical system short-circuit like that?

622
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,850
I don’t know either.

623
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,700
Just now, I saw sparks on all the models’ outfits.

624
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,400
on all the models’ outfits.

625
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,720
So, what should we do now?

626
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,320
What else? Go take off all the models' outfits immediately.

627
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,120
Or they’ll all get electrocuted.

628
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,720
Go!

629
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,000
Arun..

630
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,620
You three, go check.

631
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,270
I’ll handle the models.

632
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,750
Sorry.

633
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,550
We’ve got technical issues with both the outfits and accessories.

634
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,100
Please leave your accessories with me,

635
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,100
and go change immediately.

636
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Everyone, line up now.

637
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,320
Noo Lek’s assistant,

638
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,950
Where are you?

639
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,950
Noo Lek’s assistant,

640
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,250
you go ahead, I’ll pack everything up.

641
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,250
Go help them.

642
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,430
Noo Lek’s assistant.

643
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,040
Yes.

644
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,640
If you don’t show up now,

645
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,640
I won’t pay you a single baht.

646
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,060
Alright, I’ll go change.

647
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,780
Hope, I’m leaving this with you, I’ll be back.

648
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:14,920
Hey,

649
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,840
why did my bag turn out like that?

650
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,670
Uh...

651
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,420
Hmm...

652
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,150
Noo Lek passed it to me,

653
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,150
so I’m not sure either.

654
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:34,510
She must be messing with me.

655
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,510
She has no loyalty at all!

656
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,180
Now what should I do?

657
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,180
My dad is going to kill me!

658
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,000
Noo Lek!!

659
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,660
Arun.

660
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,800
I saw sparks on your outfit too.

661
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,340
What? My outfit?

662
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:55,840
Yes!

663
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,740
Quick!

664
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,960
Hang on a second, Arun.
It’s going to electricute you.

665
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,080
Everyone, stop!

666
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,410
Don’t change outfits yet.

667
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,680
Please take off your glasses, everyone.

668
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,350
You too.

669
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,350
Please take off your glasses.

670
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,730
Turn around for me.

671
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,050
Hey! Stop!

672
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,330
Hoy, get the car ready!

673
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,220
(Roger.)

674
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,020
(And where’s Tattoo?)

675
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,550
Hurry up!
Please be patient.  It's going to electricute me! Quick!

676
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,800
Can you do it?

677
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,000
Yes.

678
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,190
I think...

679
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,850
it should be safe now.

680
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,690
Are you sure?

681
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,840
Positive.

682
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,220
Okay.

683
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:44,640
Thanks, If I have another event,

684
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,250
I’ll hire you again.

685
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,550
Thank you.

686
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,480
Arun,

687
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,680
Arun,

688
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,240
the influencers and reporters are leaving.

689
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,290
We can’t let the event end with rumors

690
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:02,090
that a bodyguard died from being electrocuted at our show.

691
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,400
Arun.

692
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,740
I know.

693
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,320
The show must go on.

694
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:19,500
Get me a new coat.

695
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,500
A new coat, got it.

696
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,840
Excuse me.

697
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,670
Everyone,

698
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,270
what just happened was a..

699
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,270
surprise.

700
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,720
Surprise!

701
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,720
Give a round of applause

702
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,520
for the surrealistic performance at the Arun fashion event!

703
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,450
Let me tell you,

704
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:12,000
our team has been planning this surprise for a long time.

705
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,900
That's very true.

706
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,900
Didn’t you see how

707
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,900
seamless the team was?

708
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,150
The lights were real, and the shock was real too!

709
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:23,810
(So let’s all enjoy the show, shall we?)

710
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,910
(Let’s listen to some music, sip some cocktails,)

711
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,310
(and check out Arun’s new collection.)

712
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,710
(Enjoy!)

713
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,710
(Enjoy!)

714
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,930
You’re amazing, Arun.

715
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:53,710
No way!

716
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:56,110
Oh, I’m here.

717
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,210
(It took me forever to escape Arun.)

718
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:00,960
Where are you now?

719
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,720
I’m at one of the doors, trying to find the exit.

720
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,080
What happened to you?

721
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,640
(Did they catch you?)

722
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,240
(No, but I can’t find the way out.)

723
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,840
(Joke, where are you?)

724
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,940
I’m out already.

725
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,590
Where are you?

726
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,790
I don’t know!

727
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:18,790
Which way is it, damn it!

728
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,740
(Oh no!)

729
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,010
Tattoo! Behind you!

730
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,380
Hang on, I’m with Arun’s team.

731
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
That guy took the necklace!

732
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,950
What?

733
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:40,920
Catch him!

734
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,920
Damn it!

735
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:57,810
What the hell is going on?

736
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,240
Why are you searching me?

737
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,240
Don’t tell me this is part of the show!

738
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,240
There’s been an incident,

739
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,190
please cooperate.

740
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:13,090
(Suspect spotted running to the second floor.)

741
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,070
Roger, sending people up.

742
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,650
You two, come with me.

743
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,900
Arun,

744
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,650
I have something to inform you.

745
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,560
Brace yourself.

746
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:41,910
Not only is your necklace missing,

747
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,440
but the accessories taken from the models

748
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,890
have all been switched with fakes.

749
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,570
What now?

750
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,120
Why did I hire you people?

751
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,120
You can’t even catch one thief.

752
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,850
If we don’t find them,

753
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,200
and my father hears about this,

754
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,600
you, you, you, and you,

755
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,300
are all dead.

756
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,680
I’ll go catch them right now.

757
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,420
Go! Hurry up!

758
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:10,680
Rak, Yom, you two, come with me.

759
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,400
And you, check carefully.

760
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:14,600
Go.

761
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:16,860
(Joyce,)

762
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,600
Hey! Stop right there!

763
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,160
Hey!

764
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,110
Where are you going?

765
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:39,190
We’ve found him on the third floor.

766
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,040
We’ve found him.

767
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:05,540
(Go catch him.)

768
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:08,950
(Go!)

769
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:10,930
It’s you!

770
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,580
Jack!

771
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,550
Why does it have to be you again?

772
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:02,880
Drive the car!

773
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:06,890
Wait, where’s Joke?

774
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,580
Never mind, just drive!

775
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,080
No way,

776
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,360
we have to wait for Joke.

777
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,360
I told you to drive!

778
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,490
Why are you doing this?

779
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:21,770
Joke helped us out, you know?

780
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,440
What are you staring at?

781
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,440
I’ll give you one more month.

782
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,750
If you don’t pay up,

783
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,890
the next one to pay

784
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,890
won’t just be you.

785
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,050
How are you, darling?

786
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,050
Are you hurt anywhere?

787
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,010
Tell me, I’m sorry,

788
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:50,110
I’m sorry.

789
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,100
Hey, he’s here!

790
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,050
Damn it!

791
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,160
They are going down.

792
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,940
You can give me my stuff back now.

793
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,430
You can take it,

794
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,910
and run.

795
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,600
I know everything about you and the boss.

796
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:02,080
Everything I’ve done is to help set you free.

797
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:05,990
What the hell are you talking about?

798
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:10,310
No, take this ring back to Arun.

799
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,860
Along with everything you’ve stolen.

800
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,310
Even if you stole it,

801
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:15,910
you wouldn’t get a good price for it.

802
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:17,560
I’m not trying to sell it.

803
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,560
I’m going to return it to the debtors.

804
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,030
Oh, return it to the debtors?

805
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,330
I don’t believe you.

806
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:25,980
Stop lying.

807
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:29,030
I know you’re planning to steal Arun’s necklace.

808
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,030
You’re just greedy, wanting everything for yourself.

809
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:36,160
What are you talking about?

810
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,160
And what necklace?

811
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,690
Don’t act like you don’t know.

812
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:42,600
How could all the jewelry at the event be fake?

813
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,920
I didn’t take it.

814
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,160
So how did my ring end up with you?

815
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,910
I only took the ring and the debtors’ stuff.

816
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,380
You’re not fooling me.

817
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,080
Oh yeah?

818
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,720
You just wanted to keep it for yourself, admit it.

819
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:35,960
(Yom, to the left)

820
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:37,670
(Rak)

821
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,150
(If we don’t find it, we’re all screwed.)

822
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,940
Someone’s coming.

823
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,670
Go.

824
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,670
Get out.

825
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,450
I just checked this room.

826
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,400
It's clear,

827
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,050
you can check other floors.

828
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:08,900
Oh, trying to lead us away, huh?

829
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,800
Do you think I’m that stupid?

830
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,000
Are you the one who hired a thief to steal from the boss?

831
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,650
What the hell are you talking about?

832
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:20,350
Why would I do that?

833
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:22,100
If you don’t follow him now,

834
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,100
he’ll get away.

835
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:29,680
Or maybe there’s no thief at all, and you’re the one who stole it.

836
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,730
I knew you couldn’t resist.

837
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:35,530
In the end, you had to take your father’s ring back home.

838
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,490
Rak, Yom, search him.

839
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,500
Why are you hesitating?

840
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,950
I said search him!

841
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,120
And if you two don’t find the ring,

842
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,600
you can be my next partners in Taekwondo.

843
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,350
Got it?

844
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:00,350
Go ahead.

845
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,980
Did you find it?

846
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,580
No, we didn’t, boss.

847
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,780
I told you, waste of time.

848
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,470
Damn it.

849
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:38,030
There’s no one here.

850
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,750
I just told you that.

851
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,660
You never listen to me.

852
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,200
What are you standing around for? Go check the other rooms.

853
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,200
Yes, boss.

854
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,800
Once this is over,

855
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,280
you two can meet me in the practice room.

856
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,760
Aren’t you eating?

857
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,390
How can you eat?

858
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,160
We’re betraying the person who helped us.

859
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,120
Joke kept stressing that

860
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,870
if it’s not the debtors’ stuff,

861
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,790
don’t take it out.

862
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,050
If he finds out we took the necklace too,

863
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,050
he’s going to be furious.

864
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,800
I think if we give this to Suphanimit,

865
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,200
no one will dare to leave us behind.

866
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:29,160
Are we so desperate to clear our debts that we’re this selfish?

867
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:34,070
Everyone’s selfish.

868
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,720
Do you want to be free or not?

869
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,760
Of course, I do.

870
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:45,000
Then sell the necklace and help me out.

871
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:49,740
Right now, we have to help ourselves first.

872
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,360
I don’t want to be that kind of person.

873
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,140
Take the money.

874
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,790
I can’t betray Joke like that.

875
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:05,940
Hoy, we’ve come this far.

876
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,340
There’s no turning back now.

877
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,400
Boss,

878
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:18,980
check please.

879
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,810
Altogether it’s...

880
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:28,170
I’ll have the rainbow noodles with blue beef broth.

881
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:30,170
You’re still not full?

882
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,970
Come on.

883
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:40,510
Hurry.

884
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,200
Hey.

885
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,480
Don’t tell me...

886
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,420
Yup, this is the real underground pawnshop.

887
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,000
They only take illegal goods,

888
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,800
offer great prices,

889
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,200
and no one can track them.

890
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,450
Boss, take a look at this one first.

891
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:10,450
I think you’ll like it.

892
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:26,210
Cash only, no bargaining.

893
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,710
I’ll give you six.

894
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,600
Six thousand?

895
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,570
Six million.

896
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,690
If you don’t want it, leave.

897
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:38,020
Six million!

898
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,360
Hey.

899
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:04,580
What do we do?

900
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,110
I don’t know.

901
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,620
I knew it.

902
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:25,430
You were going to sell the necklace at that shop.

903
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,300
How do you know?

904
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,660
I’ve busted that shop before,

905
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,770
because they only buy from crooks like you.

906
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:44,400
But we didn’t mean to betray you.

907
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,420
At this point,

908
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,670
you don’t have to call me respect me anymore.

909
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,590
You didn’t mean to?

910
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,190
But you had a buyer all lined up.

911
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,410
Didn’t you say I was your idol?

912
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:06,200
Robbing from the wicked, helping the poor?

913
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,850
And this is how you betray me?

914
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:11,100
Fuck you.

915
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,100
Don’t blame Hoy.

916
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,280
I did everything myself.

917
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,280
Hoy tried to stop me.

918
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:25,970
You don’t have to forgive me.

919
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,880
Because what I did was fucked up.

920
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:45,400
But can you please accept this money?

921
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:51,750
It’s a share I set aside

922
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,750
to apologize to you.

923
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,550
I’m sorry, but I had no choice.

924
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,880
If I don’t have the money,

925
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:08,210
they’ll hurt my mom.

926
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:11,550
I can’t let that happen.

927
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,320
I’m sorry,

928
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,500
but I don’t have any better options.

929
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:37,010
Take the money.

930
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:42,810
I’ll forgive you this time.

931
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:47,820
But in return, you have to return all the stolen goods to the debtors.

932
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,400
Once it’s over,

933
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:55,080
get out of Suphanimit as fast as you can.

934
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:59,690
If the boss finds out, you’re both dead.

935
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,270
Really?

936
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:08,440
Yes!

937
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,440
Thank you so much!

938
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,890
Uh, what about Jack’s ring?

939
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:19,540
Did you get it?

940
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,540
You returned it, right?

941
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,880
Yeah, I gave it back.

942
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:28,980
But he didn’t take it.

943
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:40,770
How could you let them out of your sight?

944
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:45,700
Why didn’t you catch them?

945
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:57,810
(You call that working?)

946
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,520
Yes, grandma.

947
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,520
(When are you coming home?)

948
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:34,780
I’m not done with work yet, grandma.

949
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,900
(Sompong passed away, you know.)

950
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,680
His wife came to our house today.

951
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:47,810
She wanted to thank you

952
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:50,080
for helping her pay off the debt.

953
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:53,880
She said she’d try to save up

954
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,780
and pay off the rest as soon as possible.

955
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,780
(Jack.)

956
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,250
Aren’t you tired?

957
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,280
(It’s good to help others,

958
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,530
but make sure to take care of yourself too.)

959
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:13,530
(Do you understand?)

960
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,040
Yes, grandma.

961
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,560
I’ll wrap things up and come home soon.

962
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,530
Talk to you later.

963
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:43,440
(Boss: Arun said everything went smoothly, I transferred the money.)

964
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,610
(Boss: Your next case is Khajorn Jamchan.)

965
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:52,280
(Boss: Total debt with first month’s interest: 100,000 baht.)

966
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:23,990
(What are you going to do next?)

967
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,990
Move out with us?

968
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,770
With us?

969
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
No, he won’t go.

970
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,740
You’re lucky you’re not from here.

971
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:41,070
At least you have a home to go back to.

972
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:43,370
Not like us.

973
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,790
Go!

974
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:51,790
Leave!

975
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:22,560
You want to come and apologize to Jack, huh?

976
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,010
Jack is like that.

977
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:27,320
When he loves someone, he loves them with all his heart.

978
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,600
I told you already, didn’t I?

979
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,300
I told you not to come see me again.

980
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,500
Aren’t you used to my ways yet?

981
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,500
If you’re going to hug, just do it already.

982
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:36,770
Here, take it and run away.

983
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:39,240
The more you do this, the more you’re causing trouble for my family.

984
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,890
So why did you help me back then?

985
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,040
Arun, did you see your mother’s necklace?

986
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,440
You know it mustn’t get lost, right?
