This series is purely a work of fiction
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,610
I need my necklace back.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,320
Please, give me time to handle all of this myself.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,110
How about this?

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,440
Rose has liked Jack and felt a connection with him for a long time.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,170
If you want Jack, it’s easy.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,930
I heard he’s about to pay off all his debt to you soon, isn’t he?

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,240
I’ll give it back.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,800
It’s not that simple.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,440
So, it’s really over now, huh?

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,860
Hey!
Grandma!

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,400
Grandma!

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,340
Grandma.

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,310
Grandma.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,970
Grandma.
Grandma.

16
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,760
Grandma.
Grandma.

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,940
Grandma.
 Relatives of the patient, please wait outside.

18
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,940
Grandma.
You can't come in.

19
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,050
Shit, what’s going on?

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,780
I'm here.

21
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,960
Damn it!

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,960
I'm here.

23
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,020
Why hasn’t my grandma come out yet?

24
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,000
Nurse, how is my grandma?

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,670
Are you the relative of Je When Ngothong?

26
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,790
Yes, that’s me.

27
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,220
The doctor has performed an initial checkup,

28
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,280
but we still need to wait for the specialist to examine her.

29
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,890
What? I have to wait even longer?

30
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,070
She’s been in there for three hours already,

31
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,280
and no treatment yet?

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,380
Please stay calm.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,670
So, what should we do now?

34
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,440
For this case, we recommend admitting her,

35
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,760
so the nurses can monitor her until the specialist arrives.

36
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,850
Does the patient have insurance?

37
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,810
No, she doesn’t.

38
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,430
In that case, the hospital will provide a preliminary estimate of the expenses.

39
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,840
Please proceed to the finance office inside.

40
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,660
Here’s the total cost.

41
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,290
The room alone is 8,000 baht per night.

42
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Then there’s the doctor’s fee.

43
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,290
Altogether, it should come to around 30,000 baht per night.

44
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,240
But it's okay, I’ll handle it.

45
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
Can I borrow a pen, please?

46
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,870
I’ll be back later.

47
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,480
Nurse, please

48
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
take good care of my grandma.

49
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,270
Of course.

50
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,950
Thank you so much.

51
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,650
This case will be tough on everyone.

52
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,440
Thank you all very much.

53
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,840
Excellent work, truly befitting the top surgeon here.

54
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,000
Dad, can you check on my friend’s relative?

55
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,780
They’re in the ICU right now.

56
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,190
Please, I’m begging you, Dad.

57
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,670
Relative of the patient, please stay calm.

58
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,740
I’m not a relative.

59
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,230
I just came to talk to my dad.

60
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,770
Oh, is this your son?

61
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,260
I don’t know him.

62
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,430
(Hello, Jack.)

63
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,580
Hey,

64
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,400
I need to withdraw all my money,

65
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,560
over 300,000 baht, the investment I gave you.

66
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,230
(What happened?)

67
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,450
I have an urgent need for the money.

68
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,790
(Jack, right now, the funds are crashing hard.)

69
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,440
(If you withdraw now, you’ll lose half of your initial investment.)

70
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,920
(I don’t recommend you withdraw.)

71
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:56,500
Damn it! If I withdraw, it won’t be enough anyway.

72
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
(How much do you need? )

73
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,420
(You can borrow from me.)

74
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,180
I don’t want to be in debt to anyone anymore.

75
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,740
(I’m sorry, Jack.)

76
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,980
Why are you apologizing?

77
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,990
It’s not like you caused this.

78
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,120
(You trusted me with your money,)

79
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,900
(but now with this crisis, you can’t withdraw it.)

80
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,930
Hey, nobody wanted this to happen,

81
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,500
and you didn’t cause it either.

82
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,370
I genuinely trust you.

83
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,440
You’re way too kind.

84
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,690
(Thanks, that’s all for now.)

85
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,270
Visiting hours are over, please wait outside.

86
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,750
Just let him stay a bit longer, please.

87
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,300
I’m afraid I can’t.

88
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,700
Alright then.

89
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,020
I’ve heard everything from others already.

90
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
I think we should head outside

91
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,520
so we don’t bother the nurse.

92
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,480
Sure.

93
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,530
Some ancient herbal medicine might help stabilize Grandma’s condition.

94
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,420
Thank you so much.

95
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,600
Boss, would it be okay

96
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
if I asked to return to work?

97
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,990
I know it’s a bit rude

98
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,400
since I just resigned,

99
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,650
but I really need the money.

100
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,810
But didn’t you hate that job?

101
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,210
I have no choice.

102
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,520
Jack, you’re like a son to me.

103
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,790
If you don’t want to fight anymore,

104
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,760
come help me run the company.

105
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760
I’ll give you a raise too.

106
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Are you serious?

107
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,910
My insurance can cover relatives and family.

108
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,790
If you don’t mind, become my adopted son,

109
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,090
and you’ll be covered.

110
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,830
Oh.

111
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,560
I don’t even know how to thank you.

112
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,720
Just call me dad.

113
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,320
I’ve always wanted a son like you.

114
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,730
Jack, can I ask you something?

115
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,150
Of course.

116
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,520
If you had to marry a powerful family’s daughter to benefit our business,

117
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
would you do that for me?

118
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,400
Boss, I can do anything

119
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
help with the business, no matter how shady it is

120
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,070
I can do it

121
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,660
but just not that.

122
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:00,160
Then you still don’t understand what made Arun a worthless son.

123
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,840
I’m not rich enough to have two worthless children.

124
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,360
That’s fine, we’ll just go back to being boss and employee.

125
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,560
But right now, unfortunately, the company has no job openings.

126
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,970
I’ll do it.

127
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,880
No, Jack. If you don’t want to do it, I won’t force you.

128
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
I really love you like my own son.

129
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Boss,

130
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,650
please…

131
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,750
Let me marry the person you choose.

132
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:14,610
What was that? I’m getting old, so I didn’t hear clearly.

133
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Let me marry the person you’ve chosen.

134
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,090
I'm glad you decided like this.

135
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,410
Don’t forget to call me dad.

136
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,470
I gave Jack the medication to trigger the condition.

137
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,960
Thanks, you are truly terrifying.

138
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Looks like everything is going according to plan.

139
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,920
By the way, are the stocks dropping as expected?

140
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,980
No, Jack’s stocks are actually rising steadily.

141
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,250
I lied.

142
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,720
Excellent.

143
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,750
He’s called Joker, a former master thief.

144
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,730
He’s the mastermind behind Hoy and Tattoo’s plot to rob Master Arun.

145
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,160
He also gave Jack hope to pursue his dream.

146
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,590
In the future, he’ll definitely be a threat to you, Boss.

147
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,560
I’m giving you this info

148
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,170
in hopes you’ll be kinder to Hope.

149
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,940
You must like him a lot

150
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,970
to go this far for him.

151
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,230
Get out of here.

152
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Are you okay?

153
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,750
The boss offered me my old job back,

154
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,950
to become his adopted son,

155
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,360
and take over the business.

156
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,320
You should find another way out of this cycle.

157
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,780
If you get involved with Boss,

158
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
you’ll sink deeper,

159
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,650
and it’ll be hard to escape.

160
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,590
I’ve already agreed.

161
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,280
What?

162
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,330
Why did you do that?

163
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,760
Why?

164
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:22,810
Do you remember how hard it was to get out the first time?

165
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
I know you care about me,

166
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,120
but..

167
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,210
I’ve already made my decision.

168
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,100
And what about the promise we made?

169
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,600
You told me to stop stealing.

170
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,500
Now, look at you, a loan shark.

171
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,599
What am I supposed to do?

172
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,210
One of us needs

173
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,869
to start a new life,

174
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,859
and I want to see you happy with a decent job

175
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,640
and a good life.

176
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,000
That’s enough for me.

177
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,840
What if I become a crime lord, could you accept that?

178
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,880
Yeah…

179
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,310
I’ll just be your lowly employee.

180
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,500
(One week later)

181
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,330
(I like you, )

182
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:01,430
but our company doesn’t hire people with a criminal record.

183
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,570
I’ve applied to so many places this week.

184
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,400
Every single one rejected me for the same reason.

185
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,830
Please, I’m begging you.

186
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,960
I’ve turned over a new leaf.

187
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,730
I’ve done my time in prison.

188
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Does having a record mean

189
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,480
I’ll never get a chance to live a good life?

190
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,560
Rules are rules.

191
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,900
(Hiring: Movers, 350 baht per day)

192
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,330
So, this is what a decent job is like, huh?

193
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,890
(The first thing you need to learn in running this business)

194
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,070
(is to flatter the powerful.)

195
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,150
(Today, I’m introducing you to the most influential person in the country,)

196
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:43,520
(controlling agriculture, energy, real estate, and automobiles.)

197
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,750
(I’ve never brought anyone here,

198
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,160
not even my real son.)

199
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,160
(Rose must trust in what I choose.)

200
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,550
(Why do you keep introducing me to your friends’ sons, Father?)

201
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,970
(I don’t like it.)

202
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,400
(This is the modern era, no more arranged marriages!)

203
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,180
I don’t want to be engaged or married at all!

204
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,060
Oh…

205
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,560
Is this the friend’s son you mentioned?

206
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,480
Sorry for being rude, Ms. Rose.

207
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,480
This is Jack, my son.

208
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,150
Jack, this is Rose, the daughter of one of the four great families I’ve been talking about.

209
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,120
My son is new to this business.

210
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,850
If it’s alright with you,

211
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,930
I’d like him to learn the business from you, Ms. Rose.

212
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,940
Your son?

213
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,120
Oh, Jack’s my adopted son.

214
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,080
Actually, we've have met before.

215
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,220
As for learning, I’m happy to teach.

216
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,780
But I don't know if he’s okay with it.

217
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,260
Jack?

218
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:14,540
Sorry, I’m just a little nervous.

219
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,540
Please take care of me.

220
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,870
In that case,

221
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,200
could I get your contact info again?

222
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:30,000
My father deleted your number last time.

223
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,370
Here it is.

224
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,080
I’ve texted you already.

225
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:58,300
Bonjour, my soon-to-be fiancée.

226
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,660
Would you like a drink, Ms. Rose?

227
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,580
Who are you? Ms. Rose doesn’t drink alcohol.

228
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,510
Drink with me.

229
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,320
Give it to me!

230
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,560
He’s not someone who can't drink.

231
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,600
Lompran!

232
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,950
When will you grow up?

233
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,240
Today marks a special occasion where we, the four horsemen

234
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,160
and our partners, gather every month.

235
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,000
Since we’re all here, I have a fun game for us to play.

236
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,960
The game is called Monopoly.

237
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
We’re too old for kid games.

238
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Just play along for now.

239
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,820
The board is similar to Monopoly,

240
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,640
with 50 spaces,

241
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,450
each representing a part of Bangkok that we control.

242
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:56,060
For example, Sukhumvit belongs to Lord Patthapee,

243
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:02,790
Nana to Madam Trinuch, and Udomsuk to me.

244
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:09,120
Our game pieces represent each elite member playing.

245
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
If you land on a space,

246
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,760
you must pay rent to the owner of that area.

247
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,230
If you land on a treasure chest space,

248
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,380
you get to draw a card,

249
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,040
and you must follow its instructions.

250
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,420
Ugh, same old rules every time.

251
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,540
Or, what if we play for real money?

252
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,110
If you lose,

253
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:50,350
you lose control of the actual property.

254
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,980
I like that idea.

255
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,420
Great, I’ve been eyeing Silom.

256
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,600
Everyone good with the rules?

257
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,990
Are we just playing with people's lives?

258
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,630
Are we just playing with people's lives?

259
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:29,370
Why don't you join us?

260
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:35,150
You've been loyaly working for me for twenty years.

261
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:41,760
I'll give you Suphanimit.

262
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,750
Dad.

263
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,750
Hey.

264
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,000
There's only one space left.

265
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,400
If I play, I'll lose out.

266
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,930
Aren't you going to consider my feelings?

267
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,160
No.

268
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,480
If we're ready, shall we start playing?

269
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
I’ll go first.

270
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,040
Wow.
Number one, blue

271
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,610
Khlong San, 29 million baht.

272
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,030
Piece of cake.

273
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,280
Second player, Lord Patthapee.

274
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Thank you.

275
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,280
Number five

276
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,200
Bang Kho Laem, thirty-five million

277
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,260
I really want to throw in something extra

278
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,340
Oh wow

279
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,270
Four

280
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,500
Sathorn District
Oh wow

281
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,080
One hundred and eighty million

282
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,500
Wow

283
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
Come on Alice

284
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Minnburi, twenty million

285
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,110
I’ll go ahead and buy it

286
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,680
Number two, please

287
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,180
So lucky!

288
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,360
I never thought it would sell so well

289
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,450
Oh my! The customer is losing out!
Sir, congratulations

290
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,400
Here you go, sir

291
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,550
Wow, Lord Patapee gets money to spend freely now

292
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,310
So much money!

293
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,240
Oh, this one’s overflowing, no place left to put it

294
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,060
How much did you lose already?

295
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,610
Oh, don’t tease!

296
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,680
Just a few hundred million, no big deal

297
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,440
Boss, we need to roll a six, only a six will do

298
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,300
Yeah, I know that

299
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,520
Oh..

300
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,030
lucky

301
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:59,490
Wait, wait, let me have the honor of walking with Alice

302
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:00,920
Yes, sir

303
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,010
Treasure chest!

304
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
The game is getting more exciting now

305
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,990
This is Alice’s one chance to get her money back

306
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,860
And you never know, if he draws a good card, he might win this game

307
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,970
Who knows, he might even take our property

308
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,310
(Pause rent collection for 3 months in the local area)

309
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,580
Hey

310
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,950
Excuse me

311
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,640
Loud and clear

312
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,280
Pause rent collection for 3 months

313
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,950
Oh, oh

314
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,160
Alice, why is your luck so bad?

315
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,750
Lost millions

316
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,910
and still no income

317
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,280
You should make some merit

318
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,630
I know a lot of good temples

319
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,960
Want to go?

320
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,230
How long do I have to be at the mercy of those guys?

321
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,700
Jack, listen to me

322
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,650
We’re family

323
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:40,560
If I go broke, your grandma won’t have money for treatment either

324
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,080
So no matter what, you must marry Rose

325
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,580
It’s the only way out for both you and me

326
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,560
Understand?

327
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,470
I’m asking, do you understand?

328
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,720
Yes

329
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,820
I’m giving you until the end of this month to get Rose

330
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,110
Because at the next meeting,

331
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:23,170
Rose will help me renegotiate the rent back to normal

332
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,810
But is it really right

333
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,830
to deceive Rose like that?

334
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Report progress to me every day

335
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,440
Understand?

336
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,380
Hey!

337
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:26,510
Hey, sorry I’m a bit late

338
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,550
It’s fine

339
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,389
Sit down, eat

340
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,590
This is almost hot

341
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,950
Hey, is it not good?

342
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,350
No, it’s not that

343
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,180
I’m just so full, I could puke

344
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,860
Earlier I had a meal with the Boss

345
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,360
It’s alright, just have a beer with me, I bought some

346
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,930
No, wait

347
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,360
No beer

348
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,410
Honestly, I’m already a bit drunk

349
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,710
Can I just go sleep?

350
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,530
It’s fine, go rest

351
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,570
Take care of this for me, alright?

352
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,160
Yeah

353
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,590
(Oops, why are you jealous, I only love you)

354
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,810
Let’s go
(You silly guy)

355
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,130
Well?
(Iced tea, iced tea, I’ll get some ice)

356
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,290
Hello, young master

357
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,150
Hello

358
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,030
Long live the young master

359
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,750
Careful

360
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,470
Sorry, sir

361
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,220
Oh

362
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,200
You work here?

363
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,760
Yeah, I’m just lifting water barrels for fun

364
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,040
Let me help you carry it over there

365
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,870
No need

366
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,780
Just do your job

367
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,070
Alright, see you later

368
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,170
Yeah.

369
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,030
Sorry, just someone I know

370
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,060
Shall I escort you over this way?

371
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,730
Yes

372
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,750
Oh, I have to say I’m very excited today

373
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:47,100
Because I’ve been thinking all night,

374
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,100
Let’s go

375
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,740
Sure

376
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,080
Would you like some iced coffee?

377
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,640
Oh, yes please

378
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,480
Sis

379
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,000
Yeah

380
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,160
Hey, how are you, handsome?

381
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,010
A customer.

382
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,500
What’ll you have?

383
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,880
An iced Americano, grande size

384
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,000
What?

385
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,960
Iced Americano, please

386
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,430
Ice Saranyu.

387
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,870
Cha-cha-da-da, whoo!

388
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,000
Right?

389
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,800
Are you inviting me to dance?

390
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,510
Sis, yeah, medium black coffee

391
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,670
Medium black coffee

392
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,170
Right

393
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,590
What did she say earlier?

394
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,640
Something de.

395
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,380
Oh, de my friend right?

396
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,290
Oh, silly me!

397
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,320
Yeah, totally confused

398
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,600
Medium black coffee, right?

399
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,720
Yes, sis

400
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,360
What does grande mean?

401
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,420
It means size

402
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,540
Size?

403
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,980
Medium?

404
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,400
Does mine look grande?

405
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,540
Grande for sure, dear

406
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,430
Get the ice

407
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,750
Miss Rose, you can wait here

408
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,730
Okay

409
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,950
All done, no need to sit, come on

410
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,600
Huh?

411
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,100
Here’s your straw

412
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,770
Straw, straw

413
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,670
Here you go

414
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,480
Oh, do you take credit cards?

415
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,350
We accept but we don’t return them

416
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,710
No machine to swipe

417
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,620
No worries, we’ll pay in cash

418
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,170
Oh, okay

419
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,400
Here you go, sis

420
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:10,960
Change, change

421
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,510
How much?

422
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,730
Oh, no need for change
Huh?

423
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,500
no need for change

424
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,150
No need for change?

425
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:14,650
Yes

426
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,700
You’re the most beautiful in all 16 buildings

427
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,730
Oh, thank you

428
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,960
Never seen anyone so pretty

429
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,460
Thanks

430
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,240
Your outfit is lovely

431
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
Your gold looks more expensive than mine

432
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,990
Right this way

433
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,210
Come again

434
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,560
Sure
Come often

435
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,420
A hundred baht bill.

436
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,120
Should we close the shop?

437
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,030
Should we close?

438
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,900
Close it!
Close the shop!

439
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
Shop’s closed

440
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,170
Before you understand the poor,

441
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,380
understand the humans first

442
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,050
Young master?

443
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,250
They call that thug “young master”

444
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,930
I’m sitting right here, in plain sight!

445
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh, shush

446
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,480
I can’t hear

447
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,320
Talk like it's three kilometers away

448
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,780
But seriously, why are we eavesdropping?

449
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,400
Why not just listen at Tattoo's place?

450
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,640
You too?

451
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,440
This is a wiretap car,

452
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,000
not a satellite

453
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,440
Then why don’t we use a satellite?

454
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,500
Does it look like we have a lot of money?

455
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
We can barely afford food

456
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You two, be quiet

457
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,800
We need to figure out what Rose is up to

458
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,600
Why is she here at Suphanimit?

459
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,650
Maybe she’s here for revenge

460
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,120
So we can plan our escape

461
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,510
Suddenly angry?

462
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,180
There.

463
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,190
Suphisit, Jod!

464
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,550
Soon, we’ll know who’s master and who’s servant

465
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,630
I’ll tell dad everything

466
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,750
Gee, he's going insane.

467
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,090
You’re all so loud!

468
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,700
Hey.

469
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,360
Whoa!

470
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,190
Take it,

471
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,030
take it all

472
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,550
Did everyone get some?

473
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,200
P’ Rose, you're so beautiful and such a great teacher!

474
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,440
Come visit me often, okay?

475
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,880
Sure, but today everyone has to do the activity together first.

476
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,670
What do we get if we win?

477
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,210
The winner gets gold!

478
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:35,570
Oh, you mean the chocolate gold coins, right?

479
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,330
No.

480
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,390
I mean real gold.

481
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,660
But does everyone want the chocolate ones?

482
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,090
This one, this one!

483
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,590
Oh, okay then.

484
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,110
Alright, everyone, let's get started.

485
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,270
Go, go!

486
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:03,370
Today, I want everyone to draw a picture of their dreams, okay?

487
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,360
Well, what she means is

488
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,080
she wants you to draw what you want to be when you grow up.

489
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,150
What profession do you want to have?
Like a doctor, a soldier, whatever you dream of.

490
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,870
Jack, you draw too!

491
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,390
I'm going to draw too,

492
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,540
so we can learn about each other’s dreams and maybe help each other.

493
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:35,070
But I’m not good at drawing at all.

494
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,920
Don’t be shy, please do it for me.

495
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,630
Alright then.

496
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,680
Oh, what subject do you teach?

497
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,240
Oh, a football team!

498
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,000
What’s this?

499
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,100
It’s a pilot.

500
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,020
A pilot?

501
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,810
Oh! You like big dogs like English Mastiffs too?

502
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:15,420
I have one at home.

503
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,670
Um, actually, this is a buffalo, not a dog.

504
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,570
I want to have my own buffalo.

505
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:25,240
Haha, I had a feeling it would be a buffalo!

506
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,640
You drew it so well.

507
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,890
Jack, have you finished your drawing yet?

508
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:39,820
Yes, I’m done.

509
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,250
It’s quite simple.

510
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:55,290
I used to dream big, but I never reached it.

511
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:00,000
So, now I prefer something more modest, something that fits me better.

512
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,780
A simple dream is much more peaceful and fulfilling.

513
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,310
I envy you and the people here so much.

514
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,840
Simple?

515
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,020
Do you want to understand poor people, is that why you’re here?

516
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:20,900
Yeah.

517
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,880
Everyone’s dreams are simple

518
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,880
because they only know this way of life.

519
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,520
Their fathers were poor, their grandfathers were poor.

520
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,520
No one is going to finish highschool.

521
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:41,490
What are we supposed to hope for, like everyone else?

522
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,700
When no one around us has ever made it?

523
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:51,360
What you see is a simple life, right?

524
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,130
But it's actually hopelessness for everyone here.

525
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,490
Maybe there’s a national athlete among us.

526
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,490
Or a scientist,

527
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,190
or a doctor,

528
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:05,310
or even a singer, an artist.

529
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:08,050
But they don’t have the right to dream.

530
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,400
Because they have to take care of their real lives first.

531
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:28,530
Dreaming is for those whose realities are already comfortable.

532
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,970
Is that why you want to open a school, Jack?

533
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,950
That’s great, I would love to help out here like you.

534
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,540
(I’m finished, P’ Rose!)

535
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,800
Let me see.

536
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,050
Oh, a nurse!
Yes!

537
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,490
A nurse.

538
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,480
Wow, you're really good at drawing!

539
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,260
What do you think? She's talented, right?

540
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,680
Oh, this one is a nurse too.

541
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,000
And this is...?

542
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,580
A buffalo.

543
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,040
Oh, I see, it already has horns.

544
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,180
But I thought those were ears!

545
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,690
A buffalo, huh?

546
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:23,490
Yes.

547
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,080
(I saw it as a dog.)

548
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,150
(What’s this?)

549
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,060
(A football player.)

550
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,710
(A football player with a glow too?)

551
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,460
Jack, you can go home first if you want.

552
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,360
I’ll call another driver to take over.

553
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,770
You look tired.

554
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,990
Don’t forget, I’m your driver too, Rose.

555
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,200
Let’s go.

556
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,840
Wipe off the sweat, you must be hot.

557
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:35,770
Jack.

558
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,280
Can I ask you something? You have to be honest with me.

559
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,060
Sure.

560
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,140
Do you have a lover?

561
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:52,560
No, I don’t.

562
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:58,500
What about the water carrier we saw this morning?

563
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,000
You seemed to like him

564
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,790
He’s just a homeless guy, hanging around.

565
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:13,050
He helps with chores, cooking,

566
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:16,130
and bothering my grandma, asking to stay.

567
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,540
There’s nothing between us.

568
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,260
Where are you?

569
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:33,810
Put it here.

570
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,580
Could you shift this a little to the left?

571
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,630
Just a bit more.

572
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,830
I'll help over there.

573
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,490
Ow.

574
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,960
My head hurts.

575
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,520
What happened?

576
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,790
You were so drunk last night.

577
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,730
And you came to drink more at Tattoo's room.

578
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:09,150
Was it about Jack?

579
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,100
What the hell?

580
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,440
I was just thirsty.

581
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,690
You’re awake, want to keep going?

582
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,340
Please, I can’t take it anymore.

583
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,490
What?

584
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,240
Whoa, hey.

585
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,680
What’s going on here?

586
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,320
What happened, honey?

587
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,950
And what are the villagers up to, Auntie?

588
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:49,000
Well, Rose is here to give out grants so the locals can start their own businesses.

589
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Quick, let’s get up and help out with work!

590
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,940
Get up, get up, hurry.

591
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,500
No, I’m not going.

592
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:03,790
Are you okay? Just look at my child, are you alright?

593
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,120
In that case, I’ll go help out, Auntie.

594
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:07,930
Yeah, go.

595
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,870
Come on, Hoy, let’s go.

596
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,440
I can't, I’ve got work to do today.

597
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,050
Oh no, this is a disaster.

598
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,680
See you, Mama Jeab.
Yeah, yeah.

599
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,800
Since when has he become so responsible?

600
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,090
Looks like it’s just us two left now.

601
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:35,880
I’ll go find Grandma Whaen next door.

602
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,880
Okay, Auntie.
Yeah, yeah.

603
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:10,440
I am launching the “Debt-Free Legacy Project.”

604
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,830
A project aimed at improving the quality of life for the people in Suphanimit.

605
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:19,860
If I'm interested, I’ll fund the product development

606
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,860
to make it a national brand.

607
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,510
Whoa.
Wow.

608
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,880
And that’s not all.

609
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:30,060
I will also clear all the debt for that person.

610
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,700
Whoa.
Whoa.

611
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,840
(“Debt-Free Legacy Project: Everyone deserves the chance to dream.”)

612
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,630
Everyone deserves the chance to dream, okay?

613
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,160
Empty promises.

614
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,730
It’s not going to happen.

615
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:46,350
Hey!

616
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,520
If you’re not going to help, then don’t interfere.

617
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,780
Get out.
Go!

618
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,060
Get out.

619
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:59,440
Go on, get out.

620
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,580
Are you hurt?

621
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,340
No.

622
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,640
Go, go.
Go!

623
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,920
Get out of here!
Just leave, don’t get involved.

624
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,710
Everyone.

625
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:23,200
Everyone, please calm down.

626
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,890
Come out here.

627
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:34,960
Go.

628
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:47,390
Alright, it’s okay now.

629
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:24,850
I escorted Rose back safely.

630
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:32,240
I heard someone was stirring up trouble between you and Rose.

631
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,280
If you mean my friend, I’ve already dealt with him.

632
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,910
Damn it.

633
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:43,340
If you want your grandma to get treatment,

634
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,200
you’d better treat Rose well.

635
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,070
And remember, just warning him isn’t enough.

636
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,680
You need to cut that friend out of your life.

637
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,610
But what does Joke have to do with this?

638
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:01,610
Just follow my orders.

639
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:04,410
Get a new glass.

640
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:23,410
You can go now, I’ve got business to attend to.

641
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,980
Thanks for keeping an eye on Joker and reporting back to me.

642
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,140
Yes, sir.

643
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,880
You look a mess.

644
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,960
It's just the outside, have a seat.

645
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:53,840
I heard you helped this man in trouble rise again.

646
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,270
Let fate decide.

647
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:14,600
Damn it.

648
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,950
You promised to help me get the loan,

649
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,390
so why did you come out of this building?

650
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,730
Boss did the opposite of what you promised!

651
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,920
Answer me!

652
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,610
Huh?

653
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,320
It’s late, go home and sleep.

654
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,020
You scumbags!

655
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,380
You all lied to me!

656
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,820
I hope you rot in hell.

657
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,820
Damn you!

658
00:58:55,190 --> 00:59:00,000
You know what’ll happen if people find out Save is here, right?

659
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,620
Well?

660
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,360
Go.

661
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,000
Are you hurt?

662
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:17,760
Any injuries?

663
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,200
You’re always here to help me.

664
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,390
It’s been like this from the start, hasn’t it?

665
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:31,460
Me having to beat people up for you.

666
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,920
Damn.

667
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:46,390
Don’t make that face, you’ll age faster.

668
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:52,770
Let’s go somewhere fun.

669
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:55,410
Where do you want to go?

670
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,240
Far, far away.

671
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,720
You mean far from here, right?

672
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,410
Far from you.

673
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,920
Wow.

674
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,850
How was that joke? Good, right?

675
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:14,190
It’s better, but you’ve got to keep improving if you want to keep up.

676
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,940
I’ll answer according to the cards.

677
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,380
Will the four horsemen fall from power or not?

678
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:45,000
There will be a big change when the time comes.

679
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:49,710
One of the four horsemen will lose their power.

680
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:06,670
The situation will shift soon,

681
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:13,560
and you are the key to making that happen.

682
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,410
What should I do to overthrow them?

683
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:37,280
The four horsemen are game players.

684
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,680
That’s why they each made a ring,

685
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,680
like the imperial seal of ancient China.

686
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:51,380
Whoever possesses the ring

687
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:57,280
has the power to control this country.

688
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:02,800
If you get it, not just Suphanimit,

689
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:08,480
but the whole country will be under your control.

690
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:15,000
Like the official government seal?

691
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,500
You could say that.

692
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:24,150
If someone marries into the four horsemen’s circle,

693
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,150
getting the ring would be easier.

694
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:52,270
Oh, P' Nang.

695
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:54,910
Oops,

696
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:58,180
let me help.

697
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,570
Very funny.

698
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,220
Yes?

699
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,760
It’s a love card.

700
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:20,840
Oh, I see.

701
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:30,000
So, P' Nang, are you good at fortune-telling?

702
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,940
Who asks a fortune teller that?

703
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:43,820
Fortune-telling is like an investment with future risks.

704
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:48,960
Sometimes, it’s just about someone being unsure of something

705
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,990
and wanting confirmation from someone else.

706
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,180
But sometimes, it’s about weaving fate together.

707
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:01,430
Oh,

708
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:06,640
So you’re making it up?

709
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:10,320
Let’s move on.

710
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,120
You didn’t get it, did you?

711
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:37,730
Come eat with me first.

712
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:46,200
When you said I’m just clinging to your grandma,

713
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,450
did you really mean that?

714
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:15,000
Why are you causing trouble and disrespecting Rose?

715
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,340
What does Rose have to do with this?

716
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:29,760
This is between you and me, sitting here right now.

717
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:40,850
Stop interfering in my business with Rose.

718
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:46,810
The more you do this, the more she misunderstands.

719
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:53,910
You and I aren’t even anything to each other.

720
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:02,650
It’s like you want me out of your life.

721
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:10,360
So everything we’ve been through meant nothing?

722
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:20,060
Things aren’t the same anymore.

723
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:24,160
(Boss)

724
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,130
I’ll stay with grandma tonight.

725
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:41,590
You can stay with your people.

726
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:46,600
Hey, Joke, wait!

727
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,600
Joke!

728
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,720
Yes, Boss.

729
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,670
Yes.

730
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:10,560
I did everything you asked.

731
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,200
Joke probably doesn’t want to be around me anymore.

732
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:34,550
Joke,

733
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:40,189
are you okay?

734
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,000
I’m fine.

735
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:55,439
I’m old, not blind.

736
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:12,090
I can see you’re troubled.

737
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:19,430
Joke’s just being stupid, Grandma.

738
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:24,859
Messing up everything.

739
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:35,680
No one’s never messed up before.

740
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:39,779
Don’t blame yourself too much.

741
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,800
Please get some rest.

742
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:06,890
Now, you take care of yourself too.

743
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:38,550
(Stop interfering in my business with Rose)

744
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:45,000
(The more you do this, the more she misunderstands)

745
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:51,960
You and I aren’t even anything to each other.

746
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,340
I’m sorry, Joke.

747
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:01,750
How can you mess with people’s lives like this?

748
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,320
I have to do my duty.

749
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,050
What kind of duty is that?

750
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:07,840
Is your duty to ruin people’s lives?

751
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,320
Does it hurt a lot?

752
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,190
Not as much as what you’ve done to us.

753
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:14,440
Is Jack okay?

754
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,510
Rose, you’ve arrived right on time.Rose, you’ve arrived right on time.

755
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:18,680
To cancel the wedding,

756
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,280
you’ll have to play the game of the Four Horsemen

757
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,870
to negotiate a new deal.

758
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:24,470
Game start.
