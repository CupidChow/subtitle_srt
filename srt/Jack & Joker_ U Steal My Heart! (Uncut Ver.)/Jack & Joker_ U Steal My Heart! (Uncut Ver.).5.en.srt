This series is purely a work of fiction
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,250
You want to apologize to Jack?

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,940
It's just the way Jack is.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,280
When he loves someone, he loves them completely

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,280
Take it, and run away.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,280
I want to thank you for fixing the house

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,280
He’s so remorseful

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,680
Are you really not going to forgive him?

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,310
Just hoping he makes it out okay

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,440
And never comes back here

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,330
I don’t care where it is

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,330
Because you two

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,880
are going to get it back for me

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,510
I’m here to negotiate with Arun.

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,790
I don’t want any trouble.

16
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,660
You want your necklace back, right?

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,480
Then let these two go

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,820
and talk to me properly.

19
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:20,000
I’m the only one you need, right?

20
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,520
Go ahead and untie them.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,960
Untie them, your friend’s waiting.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,830
Untie them quickly, Joker.

23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,000
Hurry, Joker.

24
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,260
Search him.

25
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Found it, sir.

26
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
I knew it.

27
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,550
Give it back!

28
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,360
You want it?

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,510
Does it belong to you?

30
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,600
Tell me, why did Jack help you lie?

31
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,880
Or was he the one who hired you to do this?

32
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,610
Jack has nothing to do with this.

33
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,140
Wow, protecting him, huh?

34
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,600
You think I’m that stupid?

35
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,410
(Hope)

36
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,040
(Hope)

37
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,280
Did you really return the ring?

38
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,840
Ta-da.

39
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,860
How’s that? Impressed?

40
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,250
You finally confessed.

41
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,880
I’ve been grilling this idiot for ages,

42
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,130
Yom, hold it.

43
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,680
See, your friend spoke up.

44
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,500
But when I asked you, you didn’t.

45
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Made me ask forever.

46
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,540
Huh?

47
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,970
Hey!

48
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,000
Damn it.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,760
You guys should stop.

50
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,150
(I’ll confess to the Boss myself.)

51
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,970
Just let him go.

52
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,230
You don’t need to tell the Boss about this.

53
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,880
What you and your trashy friends need to do

54
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,750
is get that necklace back to Arun.

55
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,320
How am I supposed to know

56
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,710
where the necklace is?

57
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,120
Ask him.

58
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,680
The necklace was sold.

59
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,620
It’s probably at the auction now.

60
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,200
If you want it back, we need to work together.

61
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,060
Now you know

62
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,210
what to do, right?

63
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,600
Hey, Joke.

64
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,360
Joke!

65
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,310
Damn it.

66
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,300
Where are you going?

67
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,890
To buy medicine for the wound.

68
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,450
No need.

69
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,740
I brought some from home.

70
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,200
Here.

71
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,820
I found out the necklace was sent to a secret underground auction.

72
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,800
What we need to do is

73
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,960
find out who bought it.

74
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,470
But this event is very private,

75
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,970
only the country’s elites

76
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,320
and foreign billionaires are invited.

77
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,920
Arun will pose as a Hong Kong billionaire to get in.

78
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Why him, though?

79
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,070
Hoy and I could do it.

80
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,370
Right?

81
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,530
Sorry, but from the looks of you

82
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,510
nobody would believe that you're rich.

83
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,450
Damn, bullying us.

84
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,590
But I agree with them.

85
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,990
Why don’t you go in yourself?

86
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,060
You’re the best at this, aren’t you?

87
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,580
There are two of my enemies from prison in there.

88
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,040
No matter how well I disguise myself, they’ll recognize me.

89
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,490
So then,

90
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
it’s me,

91
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,270
the victim, going into a den of killers?

92
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,540
Really?

93
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,540
You want the necklace back, right?

94
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,670
This is the only way.

95
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,350
Better than getting killed by your dad.

96
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Argh.

97
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Fine.

98
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,050
I’ll go with Arun,

99
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,320
just in case something happens.

100
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,870
Alright, let’s proceed.

101
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,830
Next is the plan.

102
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
How’s it going?

103
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,170
The ring’s been taken.

104
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,070
Hope probably gave it to the Boss already.

105
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,280
You think he’ll blow our cover?

106
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,300
Arun said the Boss won’t attend the auction,

107
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
so we have to trust him.

108
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,460
It’s never going to end like you said.

109
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,950
Let me help.

110
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,620
Sorry.

111
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,440
For dragging you into something you’re not even involved in.

112
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,780
Lift your shirt.

113
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,390
Your wounds are deep.

114
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,390
Huh?

115
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Just lift it.

116
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,180
I think I’d rather do it myself.

117
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,020
Just lift it a little.

118
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,360
Why are you shy?

119
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
I’m helping, see? Lift.

120
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,470
Jack, be gentle.

121
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,240
Ouch.

122
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,730
If I’m any gentler, I won’t be cleaning it.

123
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,230
It’s far from your heart and you're still scared.

124
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,210
(Hello, what are you doing?)

125
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,170
Watching finance clips on YouTube.

126
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,250
(What’s up?)

127
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,070
Can I ask you something?

128
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,640
Aren’t you tired of hiding and sneaking and talking like this?

129
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,360
No, it’s thrilling.

130
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,480
(But I don’t like when you…)

131
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,600
Do dangerous stuff.

132
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,670
Are you worried?

133
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,670
Of course, I am.

134
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,900
I’m worried about Jack too.

135
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,960
Isn’t there another way?

136
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,510
Little one, don’t you remember?

137
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,120
Back when we were kids,

138
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,800
you were always in danger.

139
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,360
(And I was the knight who saved you just in time.)

140
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,770
So don’t worry, this is nothing.

141
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,000
(I know.)

142
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,260
Even if I tried to stop you, you wouldn’t listen anyway.

143
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,920
(But…)

144
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,310
I still can’t help but worry.

145
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,180
Then just wait at home, cook for me,

146
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,730
and wait for me to come back like a Japanese housewife.

147
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,900
Are you serious?

148
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,370
(Fine.)

149
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,400
Just don’t come back dead.

150
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,780
I won’t die.

151
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,350
Is everyone ready?

152
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,050
This auction spy mission

153
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,050
must go undetected.

154
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
Name?

155
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,990
This is a private event for invited guests only.

156
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,940
Zhou Xingxing, Chinese businessman.

157
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,300
Isn't it Zhou Xing Chi?

158
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,880
Mr. Zhou doesn’t speak Thai.

159
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,830
Zhou Xingxing from Hanyang Group.

160
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,750
Zhou Xingxing.

161
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Zhou Xingxing.

162
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,040
Where is Zhou Xingxing?

163
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,150
Zhou Xingxing.

164
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
Zhou Xingxing.

165
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,950
Why can't you find it?

166
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,530
The Chinese surname.

167
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,280
I thought you didn't speak Thai?

168
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,880
Huh.

169
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,180
Shit.

170
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,910
I told you it should’ve been me.

171
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,079
Not the time for that.

172
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,349
Don’t you remember?

173
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:19,520
Joke once said with a face like yours,

174
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,380
anyone could tell from Mars

175
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,380
that you’re poor.

176
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,440
Damn.

177
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,160
As if you’re not as poor as I am.

178
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Bully.

179
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:36,230
Jack, just play along.

180
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,740
Ugh,

181
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,760
it’s annoying that these people know nothing.

182
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,160
It’s frustrating.

183
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,790
The reason Mr. Zhou won’t speak Thai

184
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,230
is because it’s his trump card for the auction.

185
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,830
Why don’t you think that a foreign businessman

186
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,830
who speaks fluent Thai

187
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,640
would impress the guests?

188
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,580
Think about it.

189
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,530
He’s already wasting time speaking Thai to you.

190
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,040
That’s more than enough time wasted.

191
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,200
This is my super VIP guest.

192
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
He's going to Lalabuboo.

193
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,160
Give me the names, I'll find it.

194
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,940
Are you all blind?

195
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,470
Here is his name.

196
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,210
Here.

197
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,680
Here.

198
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,180
Let me tell you something.

199
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,840
You're very luck that

200
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,600
it wasn't Mr. Zhou's older brother

201
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,360
that the company sent Mr. Zhou Xingxing instead.

202
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,690
On other days, it would have been his brother.

203
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,690
Mr. Jing Xing Zhao.

204
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,520
Just his name makes me shiver.

205
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,360
Look!

206
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,130
My armhairs are standing up!

207
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,260
Well, you're lucky

208
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,260
so keep that luck

209
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,210
and keep it out of his hands.

210
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,550
Let me get in, or things will get more complicated.

211
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,550
Are you being too extra?

212
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,310
Calm down, Mr. Zhou.

213
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,880
Oh my god, Rat teeth Aran!

214
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,530
You…

215
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,070
Rose.

216
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,440
Well?

217
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,980
How’s it going?

218
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,620
It's my friend.

219
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,610
Sorry, we didn’t know.

220
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,440
Joke, I think I see someone I know.

221
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,780
Just make sure nobody notices us.

222
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,270
I hate this.

223
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,720
Come inside.

224
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,890
I didn’t expect that you'd attend this event.

225
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,630
Nang, this is Arun.

226
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,720
Arun, this is Nang, my investment advisor.

227
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,600
You’re Alice’s kid, right? You’ve grown a lot.

228
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,120
Nang, I thought this event

229
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,800
was for foreign businessmen investing with the government

230
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,770
and the top 5 wealthiest.

231
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,500
Maybe I misunderstood.

232
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
Not surprising, sis.

233
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:41,360
You usually misunderstands these things.

234
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,810
Oh, matching outfits.

235
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,830
Arun, why are we twinning?

236
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,090
Where did you buy this?

237
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,250
Oops, sorry Arun.

238
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,790
Barely touched it and it slipped off?

239
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,130
Yeah.

240
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,100
Waiter, get my friend a bottle of champagne.

241
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,830
The most expensive one.

242
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,340
Let’s drink, Rose.

243
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,500
Only a few hundred thousand per bottle.

244
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,080
Oops, waiter, never mind.

245
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,760
Arun, I'm allergic to cheap champagne.

246
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,080
Sorry about that.

247
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,600
But no worries, I have some at home.

248
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,890
We’ll drink together later.

249
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:41,070
Waiter, champagne, please.

250
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,720
This one?

251
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
Yes, that one.

252
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,400
Let's drink together.

253
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,800
He looks like Jack.

254
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Alright, ladies and gentlemen.

255
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,790
Now that everyone’s ready,

256
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,160
let’s begin with the first auction item.

257
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,650
It’s a thousand-year-old ivory tusk.

258
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,560
A round of applause for this amazing piece of history.

259
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,710
Beautiful.

260
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,520
How magnificent it is, both ancient and valuable.

261
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,320
A thousand years old?

262
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,520
Damn, I wasn’t even dead in my last life yet.

263
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,130
(Starting bid at 900,000 baht.)

264
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,370
950,000 baht.

265
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,720
950,000 baht.

266
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,050
Anyone offer more?

267
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,120
980,000

268
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,790
980,000

269
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,680
Three million.

270
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,050
Three million!

271
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,250
The bid for the ivory tusk is now 3 million baht.

272
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,520
(Anyone higher?)

273
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,760
3 million?

274
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,360
Damn, that’s a bit too much.

275
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,650
3 million, once.

276
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,650
3 million, twice.

277
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,370
3 million, sold!
Very impressive.

278
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,040
The thousand-year-old ivory tusk is sold to Rose.

279
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,540
Next, we have a painting.

280
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,360
This painting was done by a renowned Thai artist.

281
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,400
The artist’s name is Ajarn Chalerm.

282
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Anyone interested?

283
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,480
5 million.

284
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,300
Rose bids 5 million.

285
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,520
You must really love Ajarn Chalerm’s work

286
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,320
to bid that much.

287
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,830
I don’t know him, I just want to open the bid.

288
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Anyone want to go higher?

289
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,740
Anyone?

290
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,550
I’ll count now.

291
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,210
5 million, once.

292
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,880
5 million, twice.

293
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,330
5 million, sold.

294
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,550
You got it

295
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,870
The bid is closed.

296
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,580
This painting by Ajarn Chalerm

297
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,960
now belongs to Rose, round of applause please.

298
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,670
Now, ladies and gentlemen.

299
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:07,450
This next piece is of significant historical value,

300
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,690
both emotionally

301
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,630
and aesthetically.

302
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,400
A necklace that is has rich historical valure.

303
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,990
The history of Ms.Morakot's necklace, our eternal leading actress.

304
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:30,240
She wore this necklace when she passed away.

305
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,130
Arun owns the necklace.

306
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,490
So, Morakot is Arun’s mother?

307
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,760
Well, Boss didn’t register the marriage.

308
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,800
It’s not surprising that people don’t know they were in love.

309
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,000
Anyone interested, feel free to start the bidding.

310
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,570
Nine million.

311
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,400
Nine million.

312
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,040
Now this necklace is priced at nine million baht.

313
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,560
Nine million?

314
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,240
The necklace is now priced at nine million baht.

315
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,240
Does anyone have a higher bid?
Miss,

316
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,520
Actually, we don’t need to bid.

317
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,540
Don’t interfere.

318
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,800
Add one more million.

319
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,990
Now it’s ten million baht.

320
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,360
Does anyone have a higher bid?

321
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,380
Ten million two hundred thousand.

322
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,870
Why are they raising the bid by only a hundred or two hundred thousand at a time?

323
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,990
Isn’t it supposed to jump to thirteen million?

324
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,900
Thirteen million baht now.

325
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,500
The bid is now at thirteen million baht, honored guests.

326
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,530
Fourteen million.

327
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,530
Fourteen million baht.

328
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,130
Fifteen million.

329
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,130
Now it's fifteen million baht.
P’Nang,

330
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,000
Does anyone have a higher bid?

331
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Sixteen million.

332
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,040
He has the money?

333
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,620
I don’t know.

334
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,570
Does Arun have that much money?

335
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:55,730
Just look, the heir of this company is about to be in debt himself.

336
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,210
I won’t let it go.

337
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,480
Thirty million.

338
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,770
Now it’s thirty million baht.

339
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,120
This necklace is now valued at thirty million baht.

340
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,120
Does anyone have a higher bid?

341
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,010
Jack, tell him to stop.

342
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,010
Arun, stop.

343
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,960
This is already more than enough.

344
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,010
I don’t want my mother’s necklace

345
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,750
to end up with someone I hate.

346
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,530
That disgraceful bitch.

347
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,660
You already know that,

348
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,240
we’re going to steal it anyway.

349
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,390
Calm down.
Hope,

350
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,520
It’s about to be sold, you know that, right?

351
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,470
Let go.

352
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,040
Let go.
Thirty million, first call.

353
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Rose is about to win it.

354
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,760
Thirty million, second call.

355
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:47,400
And thirty million, third and final call.

356
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,800
The auction is closed at thirty million baht.

357
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,210
The necklace of Miss Morakot is now the property of Miss Rose.

358
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,570
Let’s give a round of applause for Miss Rose.

359
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,000
I thought they were going to keep bidding.

360
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,320
And now,

361
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,750
please welcome Miss Rose to come and take a picture with the necklace.

362
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Oh, shit..

363
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,000
Hey, what’s going on?

364
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,960
Uh, okay, everything is going according to plan.

365
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,580
Now Rose is our next target.

366
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,890
So, you can come out now.

367
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,400
You're saved, Mr. Zhou Xingchi.

368
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,340
Rose, you dumb fool, bid so high for it.

369
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,270
And in the end, didn’t get the item.

370
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,010
Really dumb.

371
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,620
I think he’s sick,

372
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,620
Or maybe he’s bipolar.

373
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,660
Rich people are all weird, aren’t they?

374
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,340
A martial artist, for real.

375
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,620
Wait, where did you learn these moves?

376
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,140
Show me.

377
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,150
Wow, you’re smooth.

378
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,170
Show me, let me see.

379
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:33,050
Wow, you’re so good, maybe dad should promote you

380
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:36,840
to be a graphic designer in the office.

381
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,290
No thanks, I prefer beating people up.

382
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
I can tell.

383
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,410
Damn..

384
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,830
That wasn’t bad at all.

385
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,830
As always.

386
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,000
Okay, pass it to Joke.

387
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,200
Done, the last thing is...

388
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Oh crap!

389
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,640
What happened?

390
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,980
The only thing left is for me to rob the goods truck.

391
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,000
Yeah,

392
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,400
but I forgot one important thing.

393
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,220
What?

394
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,460
I don’t know how to drive.

395
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,360
Ugh!

396
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
You were almost cool, brother.

397
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,980
Almost too cool.

398
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,380
I can’t believe it.

399
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,880
Brake!
Aaah!

400
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,390
Brake!

401
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,120
I can’t do this anymore!

402
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
I can’t handle you either.

403
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,800
You really don’t know how to drive.

404
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,630
You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?

405
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,940
What’s this English writing?

406
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:21,680
What English? It’s all Thai!

407
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,080
The ‘D’ stands for Drive.

408
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Drive...
Drive.

409
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,080
Drive.
Yes sir.

410
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,760
The ‘R’ is for reverse.

411
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,290
Reverse.

412
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,720
Reverse.

413
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,400
Yes, forward, reverse.

414
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,570
Forward, reverse.

415
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,000
Reverse, reverse,

416
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,800
reverse.

417
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,680
Yes, yes.

418
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,500
Let’s try it, go forward.

419
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,870
Let’s try going.

420
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,610
Hey!

421
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,960
Go!

422
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
You’re in the wrong gear!

423
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,320
And what does ‘P’ mean?

424
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,520
‘P’ is for pause.

425
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,150
Pause?

426
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,560
Pause the lesson, enough.

427
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,340
Tattoo, you’re pretty good, huh?

428
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,990
More advanced than the models I’ve seen before.

429
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,910
(Honestly though,)

430
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,670
(If you can’t drive tomorrow,)

431
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,670
(I can drive for you.)

432
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:30,000
You can’t drive, it’s too dangerous.

433
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,510
Besides, you still have to act.

434
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,210
If you get shot and die, what would we do?

435
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,830
Do you that when driving,

436
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,830
what's the most important thing?

437
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,430
It’s the heart.

438
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,560
Even though I haven’t known you for long,

439
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,040
I can tell you have a big heart.

440
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,790
(Thanks, man.)

441
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,840
That was so cheesy,

442
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,220
I almost said ‘gas.’

443
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,230
You get along with people so well.

444
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,910
Hey,

445
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,160
(Looking at me like this,)

446
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,560
(I used to have a girlfriend before, but we broke up.)

447
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,820
What about you? What’s your type?

448
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,910
(My type?)

449
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,130
Someone kind, I guess.

450
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,370
No matter how bad we mess up,

451
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,770
they still forgive us.

452
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,240
Why do I feel like your face is familiar?

453
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
It’s normal,

454
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,080
a lot of people always remember me as different people.

455
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,780
Many people say the left side of my face looks like Uncle Add,

456
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,000
While the right side looks like P’ Sek.

457
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,380
Uncle Add, P’ Sek.

458
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,380
Uncle Add, P’ Sek.

459
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,450
Uncle Add, P’ Sek.

460
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:13,130
Some even say I look like someone from the back of a truck.

461
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
Today it's Song's shift.

462
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,880
Why are you here?

463
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:26,739
Oh, I’m his son.

464
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:30,239
But now he had a minor accident,

465
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,790
his arm got a little scraped up,

466
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,239
And he’s having trouble walking.

467
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,900
So I’m taking over for him.

468
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,679
Shall we get going now?

469
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,679
I like being on time.

470
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,750
Let me get in the car.

471
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,600
Wait!

472
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,389
Gui,

473
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,760
Yes?

474
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,810
You go with them.

475
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,670
Come on, get in.

476
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,650
Why are you just standing there? Get in the car.

477
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,680
The bush by the fence grows over your shoulders,

478
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,480
The ylangylang vine creeps over the gate,

479
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,360
The sunflowers lift their heads, waiting,

480
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:04,290
What the hell are you talking about?
Probably just waiting for their father to come back.

481
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:16,000
Did you just pee or did you sneak a dump too?

482
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,760
Maybe I’m just overthinking,

483
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,680
because a car like this would normally have a stale smell.

484
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,170
So I’ll use this.

485
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:35,740
This is the cologne my father gave me.

486
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,000
It will get rid of any unwanted smells.

487
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,810
It’ll keep things fresh for the ride.

488
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,440
I put a sleeping potion into the perfume.

489
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,810
Anyone who smells this will go into a deep sleep.

490
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Let's go!

491
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,720
It can take down an elephant in ten seconds.

492
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,570
Just press this button.

493
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,560
Hey, Tattoo.

494
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,290
Tattoo.

495
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,080
You’re worried about me, aren’t you?

496
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,290
I’m just kidding.

497
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,340
What kind of perfume is this? It doesn’t smell nice at all.

498
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:48,480
Does it smell nice to you? If it does, take a deep breath and enjoy it.

499
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,180
I don’t smell anything nice at all.

500
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,020
Why am I feeling so sleepy?

501
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,810
Hey, you drive for me.

502
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,860
What the hell, man? You really did that to me?

503
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,860
You little shit.

504
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
You’ve got some nerve.

505
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,150
Tattoo!

506
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,340
Didn’t you say your drug works in ten seconds?

507
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,940
I’m about to die here.

508
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,330
(Joke, Joke, hello?)

509
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,330
(Is everything okay?)

510
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,480
Okay.

511
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,950
Tattoo, from now on, I’ll let you try your own drug first.

512
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,220
(I thought I’d have to step in.)

513
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,760
Earlier, were you worried about me?

514
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,440
(No, I’m more afraid my mission will fail.)

515
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
You…

516
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,600
Sweet dreams, Kui.

517
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,810
I'm so awesome!

518
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,350
Where did everyone go?

519
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,950
We meet again, darling.

520
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:25,500
I won’t let you get away like when you were in jail.

521
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,900
Do you remember us?

522
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,180
What can I get for you?

523
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,330
Make it strong, brother!

524
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,430
Bring it on!

525
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,570
Hey!

526
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
Hey, stop right there!

527
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,280
For daring to steal my pawned goods.

528
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,280
They’re so tight-fisted.

529
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,280
I’m really stuffed.

530
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,170
They really work well together.

531
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:56,580
When we were in jail, the nickname was “Tongue and Tooth.”

532
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,630
I thought it was a P' Bird song!

533
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,560
If you want to win against them,

534
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,180
you need to team up with me, I’ll lure them,

535
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,510
and you’ll throw the punches.

536
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,600
Let’s go.

537
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,580
Hey!

538
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,310
Jack!

539
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:05,890
Jack!

540
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,880
Damn it!

541
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,760
Joke, someone told them our address.

542
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,720
You should run away first.

543
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,470
Stop talking.

544
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:19,470
I’m not going anywhere.

545
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:21,210
You can stop worrying about others now.

546
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,560
Worry about yourself for a change.

547
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,730
You’re about to die here.

548
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
What are you laughing at?

549
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,240
Your words sound just like my grandma’s.

550
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,660
Damn it.

551
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:48,680
Can you get up?

552
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,680
I can manage.

553
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:44,300
I’m really sorry.

554
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,520
Um, can I report something?

555
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,110
There’s a fight at the bar near On Nut.

556
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:07,220
There should be about ten people involved.

557
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,000
Okay, please hurry.

558
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,790
Thank you.

559
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,160
Tattoo, stop!

560
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,520
This time, we’re finally going to be free.

561
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,650
Why are you doing this?

562
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,640
Joke has saved us so many times.

563
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,060
You and I, Hoy, you and I.

564
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,400
We’ve fought for so long.

565
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,190
We deserve our freedom now.

566
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,700
But Joke is my friend too.

567
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,690
But you’ve only known him for a few days.

568
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:53,980
I don’t care, a friend is a friend.

569
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,980
But you don’t even really know him.

570
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:00,250
Is he just some rich kid?

571
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:03,320
How could he be friends with poor people like us?

572
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,120
He must have his reasons for not going home.

573
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,730
You know, I feel sorry for Joke.

574
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:13,170
Listen to me.

575
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,380
Listen to me carefully.

576
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,570
My father taught me something.

577
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:20,880
Before leaving me and my mother to pay his debts.

578
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,230
We can’t escape poverty,

579
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,960
if we don’t do something bad to others sometimes.

580
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,050
I’d rather be a struggling poor person

581
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:38,250
than a rich person who betrays friends like this.

582
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,890
If you’re like this,

583
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,170
I don’t think we can be friends anymore.

584
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,570
Um…

585
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,680
If we can’t, then we don’t have to be.

586
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,260
What?

587
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:16,760
Come here.

588
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,260
What?

589
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,360
Quickly.

590
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,510
Come here, now!

591
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:21,050
What?

592
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,150
Come here.
What’s going on?

593
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,730
This time we can finally start a new life.

594
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:33,320
So we won’t have to live in such poverty anymore.

595
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,220
Where did you get Miss Morakot's necklace?

596
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:39,290
It doesn’t matter.

597
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,680
Give it back.

598
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,680
Why should I give it back, Mom?

599
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,180
This necklace can sell for millions!

600
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,830
Ms. Morakot has already passed away.

601
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:51,180
Don’t you feel sorry for her family? Something for them to remember her by?

602
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,960
But isn’t it people like them

603
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,760
who have always looked down on our poverty?

604
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,620
They don’t deserve our sympathy.

605
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,970
Then don’t give them more reasons to look down on us.

606
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,520
Give it back!

607
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,430
You have a light touch, huh?

608
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,520
Well, I used to be a thief.

609
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,550
So what should we do about the bag?

610
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:41,480
If Arun finds out, we’re done for.

611
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,080
I have a pretty good idea of who took it.

612
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,640
If it were me, I wouldn’t run away.

613
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,620
Um…

614
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:32,390
I happened to find the bag on the street.

615
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:39,220
I thought I’d return it to you.

616
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:49,300
And also give it back to Jack.

617
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:00,650
I’m really sorry, man.

618
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:01,850
But I really had to do it.

619
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,850
You’re so lucky!

620
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,700
I came to look for the bag around here too.

621
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,650
You just happened to find it first.

622
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,420
Thanks a lot, man.

623
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,960
I really appreciate it.

624
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:38,580
I really thank you.

625
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,000
I just…

626
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It’s okay.

627
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,490
Thank you so much.

628
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,410
You’re so kind.

629
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,350
Even with Tattoo being a jerk,

630
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,400
you still help him.

631
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,860
Why? Or do you want me to be a bad person?

632
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,650
That’s good enough.

633
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,810
Oh, my precious!

634
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,880
Let’s consider everything that happened as settled.

635
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:47,560
And about my father, he will never know about this.

636
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,680
Including the fact that you guys stole from me in the first place.

637
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,680
I’ll help cover it up.

638
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:03,030
Oh, and as for the other missing items,

639
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,120
I’ll pretend I don’t know about them.

640
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,420
Okay?

641
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,280
Deal.

642
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:14,050
Deal.

643
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,680
This time, it counts as a legitimate robbery.

644
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,390
Yeah, I know.

645
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,650
Shall we start over?

646
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,270
Let’s forget everything that’s happened.

647
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,230
I forgive you.

648
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:30,000
Suddenly, I’m hungry.

649
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:34,520
My grandma made some chive dumplings.

650
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:40,000
She probably made too much, we should be able to finish it together.

651
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,700
Are you inviting me to your house?

652
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,000
Are you asking me or are you going?

653
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,250
Oh, let’s go!

654
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,250
Let’s go!

655
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:02,820
Tell me!

656
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:08,710
We’ve been robbed of the necklace, Miss Rose.

657
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:11,760
Do you think I can be tricked just because I'm a rich girl?

658
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:16,490
But we really were robbed.

659
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:19,300
Thirty million might not be a lot for me,

660
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,840
but I know the value of money.

661
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,870
From what I’ve investigated, those who came back

662
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:31,040
were nearly beaten to death.

663
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:38,730
So we really were robbed.

664
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,820
And now, where is my necklace?

665
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,770
This person is the one who stole it.

666
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:57,120
This is the person we met at the auction, right?

667
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,140
From what you asked me to investigate,

668
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:06,980
it seems after you went abroad to study,

669
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:11,240
this guy started working for the boss to pay off debts.

670
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:17,360
If you want to help him, paying off his debts would probably be the best way.

671
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:22,080
Thank you, P' Nang.

672
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:35,050
You’re done here, now get out.

673
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,300
Get out!

674
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,480
Yes.

675
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,440
I have to get my necklace back.

676
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,930
If you make a deal to exhange lovers.

677
00:58:57,930 --> 00:58:59,930
Rose might agree to it.

678
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:01,670
This is my friend, have you said hi?

679
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,420
So, we're friends now?

680
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,770
No one ever gets to sleep on my bed.

681
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:07,130
Who do you think you are?

682
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:11,480
I hope that I can pay off all my debts this year.

683
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,480
So I can go do things I want.

684
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,450
The thing that you want to do,

685
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:18,800
is it still the same?

686
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,270
You still remember?
