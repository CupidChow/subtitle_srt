[YWPB]

4
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,740
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,570
Give me some time.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,360
I really have no money.

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,940
If you're one day late,

8
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,860
you'll be beaten up for a minute.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,220
It's been three days.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,420
You can calculate the time, right?

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,540
I will.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,160
It's 1.5 minutes.

13
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,340
Are you provoking me?

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,060
I was just kidding.

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,080
I was just kidding.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,620
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,340
Handsome.

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,630
My grandma really needs money.

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,550
So your money

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,190
is with Grandma, right?

21
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:08,890
Hello?

22
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,370
Take a look.

23
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,260
where Jokjaek's grandma is.

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,870
Later,

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,600
we can go to his grandma's place to collect debts.

26
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,450
No, please.

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,840
Don't touch my grandma!

28
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,490
Please, don't touch my grandma. I'm sorry.

29
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,900
That's enough.

30
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,840
Stop it. It hurts.

31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,539
Hey.

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,570
I'll remember your number.

33
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,340
What's your name?

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,710
What are you doing?

35
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,370
What did you do to my boyfriend?

36
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,890
Why don't you speak?

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,030
Let me ask you, what did you do to my boyfriend?

38
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,789
Baby, does it hurt?

39
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,630
Hey.

40
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,820
Are you hurt?

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,300
I'm fine.

42
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,100
Really?

43
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,240
Yes, he's not that strong.

44
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,040
-I'm really okay.
-Yes.

45
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,110
Come here.

46
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,160
He said enough, but you still won't stop?

47
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,010
You kept hitting him.

48
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,750
Are your ears not working?

49
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,660
Baby.

50
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,150
It doesn't hurt at all.

51
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,260
Can't you ask him for money nicely?

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,680
Don't do it violently, okay?

53
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,680
This is not good, understand?

54
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,090
Baby, fight back!

55
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,590
Fight back!

56
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,900
Really?

57
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,630
I'll beat you up.

58
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,830
You jerk. Do not use violence to collect debt anymore, okay?

59
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,400
Or my grandma will hurt.

60
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,210
How is it, baby?

61
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:18,680
I'm done.

62
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,010
What did you just say?

63
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,360
Two minutes left, right?

64
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,140
Two minutes left.

65
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,110
Let me do it.

66
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,900
Start counting.

67
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,200
It's not over yet.

68
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,000
Wait, baby.

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,329
Baby. Didn't we agree not to use violence to solve the problem?

70
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Right?

71
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,200
How dare you touch my baby?

72
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,930
Go to hell!

73
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,130
My baby is amazing!

74
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,880
Does it really not hurt?

75
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,690
Not at all.

76
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,130
You're protecting me.

77
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,089
To be honest, does it hurt?

78
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,470
How was my acting?

79
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,230
You're amazing.

80
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,260
If you want me to get better quickly, you can give me a kiss.

81
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,400
He's shy, but it's okay. He fainted.

82
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,750
Wow, it doesn't hurt anymore.

83
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,230
It hurts.

84
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,250
-I punched him.
-What should we do?

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,320
How did it go?

86
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,820
You must have heard that

87
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,760
we can't choose the family to be born into.

88
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,090
But we can have the rest of our lives ourselves.

89
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,970
Do you think I'm right?

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,080
No.

91
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,080
But I think this is right.

92
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,680
Because I have Joke and Jack as my role model.

93
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,690
Although Jack was born unlucky,

94
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,240
he's poor and unlucky, and bad things happen.

95
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,770
Baby.

96
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,270
Is Toi Ting scolding us or praising us?

97
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,310
Don't call me that in public.

98
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,150
I'm shy.

99
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,080
Okay, Piggy.

100
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,680
But Jack never gave up.

101
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,570
In the end, Jack got his fate.

102
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,400
You're so eloquent.

103
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,210
Did someone write this for her?

104
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,110
This is Toi Ting.

105
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,370
Not Hoy.

106
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,000
Ah.

107
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,080
Joke is also someone

108
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,740
who proved that saying.

109
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,080
He's from a rich family,

110
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,070
smart and rich,

111
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,640
but it doesn't mean he has to go the same way as his family.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,610
It's weird.

113
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,300
It's not over yet.

114
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,140
Because in the end, we can choose our own path,

115
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,750
which is meaningful to others.

116
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,510
Oh.

117
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,910
Because of these brothers,

118
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,750
I believe that

119
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,640
our...

120
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,120
Our fate is up to us.

121
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,120
Thank you.

122
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,250
Good job. Next.

123
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,540
That's why people don't trust you.

124
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,970
This isn't a singing show.

125
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,490
[Gangster]

126
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,460
That's why Supanimit's a mess now.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,230
It's all because

128
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,260
the people behind the boss organized a new gang.

129
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,220
After we cancelled this cruel system,

130
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,480
they joined forces with these gangsters.

131
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,620
Or the debtors turn into these liars.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,930
Can't we do anything to them?

133
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,560
Those small gangs

134
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,510
just don't go too far.

135
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,390
Or we can only call the police.

136
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,930
Why don't we just rush into their den

137
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,680
and kick them out like last night.

138
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,920
It's hard to deal with the debt collectors.

139
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,570
I can't make much money even if I get up early and work late every day.

140
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,260
I'm thinking

141
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,330
those under Boss who do bad things as Boss said

142
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,370
are better than I am now.

143
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,080
I can't do anything.

144
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,570
I don't think the people in Supanimit

145
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,159
can't get rid of poverty.

146
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,050
Aran and I can't make much money.

147
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,410
We don't have any customers.

148
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,330
Do you think

149
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,330
if we told everyone

150
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,300
to bring their children to our school

151
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,860
and it will improve their quality of life,

152
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,820
am I deceiving them?

153
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,590
If they know the truth later,

154
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,200
will they think it's good?

155
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,720
But hope is a good start, right?

156
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,020
It's different.

157
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,190
They didn't even have the right to choose.

158
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,760
Now they have it.

159
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,480
It might take some time.

160
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,900
I'm lucky to have someone to help me.

161
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,190
So we need to help each other

162
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,390
and give them more choices.

163
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,930
Actually, I want to help.

164
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,500
But we can't take care of ourselves.

165
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,610
I think the richest person now

166
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,390
the Hoy.

167
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,510
Then

168
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,340
where is Hoy?

169
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,330
Right.

170
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,290
Where is he?

171
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,860
It's me again. I'm here.

172
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,180
Hey, Hoy.

173
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,150
Why did you say you're a wolf so quickly?

174
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,020
You should let Sister Nang say it.

175
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,710
Ah.

176
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,460
Everyone voted.

177
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,910
But we haven't calculated the votes.

178
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,340
And the result hasn't been announced yet.

179
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,250
You should respect your character.

180
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,360
I'm sorry, everyone.

181
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,480
Tell me, what's your role?

182
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,830
What else? It's obvious that Hoy's a wolf.

183
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,030
Can you play or not?

184
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,580
Miss, I don't want to be a farmer anymore.

185
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,380
I want to be a wolf like Brother Hoy, okay?

186
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,150
Kaosui chose it herself.

187
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,990
This is the fairest one.

188
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,660
It's not fair at all.

189
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,340
Why can't we choose what we want to do?

190
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,970
Then look for the joy of the farmers.

191
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,550
Or you can be grateful.

192
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,870
Then I quit.

193
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,080
Let's go back and play our own catching game.

194
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,150
But this is much more fun than yours.

195
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,610
In your game, the pursuers can only run away.

196
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,120
You can vote for this, and you can choose the werewolves.

197
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,040
It's all your fault.

198
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,110
Aren't the kids playing with you?

199
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,680
Jack.

200
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,380
Hug my boyfriend gently, Miss Rose.

201
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,480
Joke!

202
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,220
Are you jealous?

203
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,820
It's Hoy's fault.

204
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,360
Hello, Sister Nang. Hello, everyone.

205
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,140
Hello. Hope Save.

206
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,440
I understand.

207
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,440
But I don’t know how to help you.

208
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,400
Besides, I didn't have the strength to change Supanimit.

209
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,930
Next time,

210
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,330
at the meeting of four,

211
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,100
I'll coordinate with Lompran.

212
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,080
You said you won't interfere with each other.

213
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,420
That means your game is still in progress.

214
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
It's not cancelled.

215
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,980
Yes, it takes time.

216
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,550
I can't cancel it just because I want to.

217
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,570
I'm sorry.

218
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
If someone

219
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,990
who needs to apologize,

220
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,750
It should be me.

221
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,310
By the way,

222
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,730
why didn't the boss

223
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,470
control those four

224
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,110
to be able to manage Supanimit well?

225
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,070
He always did that.

226
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,150
It's just that my dad and my uncles don't care.

227
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,000
Eat up.

228
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,640
Wow, Grandma's dishes have changed.

229
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,860
It's not like the old days. Only leeks then.

230
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,450
I don't sell leeks anymore.

231
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,580
I have a young man to take care of me.

232
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,860
Not one, but two young men.

233
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,540
Do you have one?

234
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,680
Do you?

235
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,150
Joke sells leeks too.

236
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,710
Aren't you afraid of forgetting the recipe?

237
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,110
I won't forget. I remember things well.

238
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,250
Really?

239
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,340
Then why do you always fail?

240
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,810
Wow.

241
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,350
This is so sad.

242
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:46,460
Then test me and ask me some English words.

243
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,510
Feeling well.

244
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,830
Happy.

245
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,510
Having a good look.

246
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,580
Beauty.

247
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,850
Wrong.

248
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,990
What?

249
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,530
Wrong.

250
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,690
Why?

251
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,230
Because I'm having a good look.

252
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,980
Gosh.

253
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,350
I'm convinced.

254
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,470
OK.

255
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,540
Dip the fish dew in sauce.

256
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,920
It's too hard, Grandma.

257
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,690
I told you to bring it here, not to ask you English words.

258
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,220
Ah.

259
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,910
Here.

260
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,890
What about your soulmate?

261
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,300
Isn't that me?

262
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,710
Goodness.

263
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,740
Destiny.

264
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,910
One more.

265
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,070
What?

266
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,920
Anniversary.

267
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,950
It's the anniversary.

268
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,580
I haven't learned it yet.

269
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,980
An anniversary?

270
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,430
I don't know. I only know today's is our anniversary.

271
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,430
You remember?

272
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,800
Here.

273
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,530
The anniversary.

274
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,650
It must be Anniversary.

275
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,890
Thank you.

276
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,790
Hahaha.

277
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,230
Isn't this Chinese chives?

278
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,220
Yes.

279
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,720
But I haven't eaten it for a long time.

280
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,160
Remember to cook for me.

281
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,850
Sure, I'll cook for you later.

282
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,780
The atmosphere is here.

283
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,400
The last line.

284
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,750
No way.

285
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,790
Really?

286
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,780
Oh, Jack.

287
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,410
We've been engaged for a year.

288
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,930
My dream has come true.

289
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,730
You too.

290
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,920
It's time

291
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,060
to upgrade our status.

292
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,840
Marry me.

293
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,300
♫Only you♫

294
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,470
♫Make my heart flutter, and I don't even know why♫

295
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,470
Then...

296
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,930
should I answer Marry

297
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,470
or yes?

298
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:44,450
♫I just follow my heart, and you're the only one inside it, right?♫

299
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,870
Wow.

300
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,200
You two finally got together.

301
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,560
Grandma fell asleep safely.

302
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,730
You can't die yet, Grandma.

303
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,610
Hahaha.

304
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,130
When are you going to get married?

305
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,450
♫Na Na Na♫

306
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,350
Right.

307
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,780
I haven't even checked the date yet.

308
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:16,900
Did you ask your parents to visit you?

309
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,260
♫Oh, oh, oh♫

310
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,870
Grandma.

311
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:21,990
Yes, it's me.

312
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,010
♫Na Na Na♫

313
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,650
What should we do?

314
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,230
Where's the wedding ceremony? Have you decided?

315
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,930
Don't worry.

316
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,250
It's your first wedding.

317
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,020
I'll take care of it.

318
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,780
I promise there will be no problem with Suthee.

319
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,690
♫There's no doubt♫

320
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,930
Right?

321
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,880
Yes.

322

♫Wow♫

323
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,530
Let's eat first.

324
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,430
Let's eat.

325
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,350
We should celebrate.

326
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,990
♫There's no reason. Because the answer in my heart is you♫

327
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,770
Eat up.

328
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,890
I'm sorry, Doctor.

329
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,670
I stopped them, but they didn't listen.

330
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,450
You may leave.

331
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,600
Okay.

332
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,260
Hello, Doctor Suthee.

333
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,160
Hello.

334
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,920
I asked Jack to propose to you today.

335
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,760
Propose?

336
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,130
Yes.

337
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,260
Then why don't you go home?

338
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,700
You can't make noise in the hospital.

339
00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:01,050
Alright. I'll take lion dance to propose marriage.

340
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,840
It's okay. Let's talk here.

341
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,560
Who's the bride and who's the groom?

342
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,890
They don't ask that nowadays.

343
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,490
This is their business.

344
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,640
Hahaha.

345
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,970
I have no problem with it.

346
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,640
Thank you.

347
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,700
He's been to your house longer than in his own house.

348
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,920
Please take care of my son.

349
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,760
Okay.

350
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,020
Thank you.

351
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,510
Dad.

352
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,710
As for you...

353
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,800
Joke.

354
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,230
You're staying at his house.

355
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:07,420
I don't remember anywhere else you've been for so long.

356
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,940
Anyway, hope you can be happy together forever.

357
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,010
Tell me if you have any problem.

358
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,600
We're family now.

359
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,520
If you become a father one day,

360
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,730
I hope you can be a good dad too.

361
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,440
Dad, stop it.

362
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,980
Or I'll get mad.

363
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,380
Is there a problem?

364
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,180
Why do you look so down?

365
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,820
No.

366
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,910
There's no auspicious day for you two.

367
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,540
What do you mean?

368
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,840
If you want me to be more specific,

369
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,050
you two are soulmates,

370
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,060
but you two are also enemies.

371
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,710
I don't think so.

372
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,960
We've been dating for a year.

373
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,160
We haven't even quarreled.

374
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,010
But you can't be together.

375
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,880
Something will eventually separate you two.

376
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,400
Your camera will be isolated for a year.

377
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,670
If you get married, you may be separated

378
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,350
and never see each other again.

379
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,810
There must be something wrong.

380
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,990
Or

381
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,820
my birthday is wrong?

382
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,130
I should ask my mom first.

383
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,700
When was I born?

384
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,670
I think part of what Nang said

385
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,610
is right.

386
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,530
After we first met,

387
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,240
we had problems with those debt collectors.

388
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,670
The second time we met,

389
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,360
you went to jail.

390
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,610
I'll be taken to work and lost money.

391
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,950
How can you believe that so easily?

392
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,520
Let's watch it again.

393
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,670
This is the third time.

394
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,910
Nothing will go wrong.

395
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,700
Your fate

396
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,390
makes it impossible for you two.

397
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,220
If this year

398
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,700
we don't have an auspicious day this year,

399
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,500
But you said we were enemies.

400
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,880
I think it's a bit ridiculous.

401
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Jack.

402
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,040
Didn't you say it yourself? I'm your lucky charm.

403
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,490
I might be unlucky for the first time,

404
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,790
but it wasn't me.

405
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,940
I made your dream come true.

406
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,510
Yes.

407
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,100
Nang. Can you help us again?

408
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,990
I want one day

409
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,400
when you get married and have the least contradictions.

410
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,980
What is this?

411
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,930
Gosh.

412
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,080
I really want to be a fortune teller.

413
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,600
Maybe my boyfriend will trust me more.

414
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,470
Don't be sad, okay?

415
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,720
Of course.

416
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,400
This is our future.

417
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,450
As you know,

418
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,780
Sister Nang is a good fortune teller.

419
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,940
I didn't know you were scared before.

420
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,010
but now you're afraid of a luxury brand.

421
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,860
What a headache.

422
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,200
But I don't know why I think so.

423
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,000
Our marriage

424
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,350
will be a perfect and happy ending.

425
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,000
What do you mean if we break up?

426
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,010
Are you unhappy?

427
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:56,020
Or will I have a serious fight with you?

428
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,610
No.

429
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,580
Or do you have someone else?

430
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,520
Me?

431
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,790
I don't understand.

432
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,290
Goodness.

433
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,510
Hey.

434
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,720
Why do you think so much?

435
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:25,410
Listen to me.

436
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,470
No matter what fate it is,

437
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,430
even if I can't marry you,

438
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,590
I will.

439
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:41,330
Even if Grandma and my father tole me to break up with you,

440
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,130
I won't break up with you.

441
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,960
We've been through so much

442
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,660
because we went through so much.

443
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,650
Yes.

444
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,110
Yes, just yes?

445
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,960
Why?

446
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,090
You said you wanted to grow old together.

447
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,370
You're the only one.

448
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,410
Don't you want to marry me?

449
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,060
Of course I do.

450
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,950
But I...

451
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,010
The thought of breaking up with you

452
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,370
I'll die.

453
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,640
I'm really going to die. I can't live.

454
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,190
Really?

455
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,220
Who said we should break up?

456
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,150
Remember,

457
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,850
no matter what can separate us,

458
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,660
in the end,

459
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,500
I will try my best

460
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,070
to find you.

461
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,040
So cute.

462
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,350
What was it again?

463
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,700
What?

464
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,790
I told you.

465
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,570
Everyone.

466
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,780
Take it.

467
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,120
Is this a donation?

468
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,710
I don't want money.

469
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,150
I've accumulated enough.

470
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,870
Open it first.

471
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,510
What about mine?

472
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,140
This is Rose. This is yours.

473
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,960
[Jack & Joke] [Wedding Invitation]

474
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,860
Wow.

475
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,720
Really?

476
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,750
Yes.

477
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,270
It's finally time. Congratulations.

478
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,890
Oh my god.

479
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,240
Congratulations.

480
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,880
As for the groom's clothes,

481
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,560
the groom's clothes.

482
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,020
Are you really going to help them?

483
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,490
Can you be normal? Don't be weird.

484
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,960
Hey.

485
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,950
because I have a Quirk to attract people's attention.

486
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,710
But I'm already attractive enough attention.

487
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,020
That's why I'm not curious.

488
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,480
I know you're not.

489
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,090
Whose wedding is this?

490
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,880
Honey, read your name.

491
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,700
You

492
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,070
Rose has been preparing for Jack's wedding for a long time.

493
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,760
I'll do it this time.

494
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,030
I'll help too.

495
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,910
Do you need a driver?

496
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,000
You want to drive, right? I'll arrange a grand event for you.

497
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,600
Why don't you send us to the bridal chamber?

498
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,810
Just at the door?

499
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,570
Just go in.

500
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,970
My job is not easy.

501
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,670
Well,

502
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,780
I want you to come on stage

503
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,490
and Rose.

504
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,120
You can say anything.

505
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,420
Whatever.

506
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,760
Come on.

507
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,780
Don't exaggerate. Let me help you.

508
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,660
This is for you.

509
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,100
Wow.

510
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,170
Brother.

511
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,990
I want to invite you to our wedding too.

512
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,070
Are you getting married?

513
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,700
Congratulations.

514
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,730
But I'm not sure if I can go on the wedding day.

515
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,600
I'll give you red packets.

516
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,170
Wow.

517
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,120
Thank you.

518
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,670
I can't believe it. My two employees don't work together,

519
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,910
but we get married together.

520
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,430
Goodness.

521
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,560
It's nice.

522
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,530
Thank you for your kindness.

523
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,490
What about the couple?

524
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,240
When will they be together?

525
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,240
Which couple?

526
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,430
You guys.

527
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,240
Me and him?

528
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,920
Are you kidding me?

529
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,920
He wants to catch me?

530
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,650
It's true, brother. He is

531
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,980
like a newborn cow and horse.

532
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,040
I

533
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,700
Only a top male model can touch me.

534
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,420
He can't touch me.

535
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,910
I was just kidding.

536
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,360
Don't take it too seriously.

537
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,040
We didn't.

538
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,050
Come on, cheers!

539
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,410
Yeah!

540
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

541
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,680
the only thing I can quickly decide

542
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,140
in my life of 23 years long

543
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,860
is driving. No matter it's turning left or right,

544
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,350
I can immediately make a decision.

545
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,720
What are you doing?

546
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,800
So many people are here.

547
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,670
We're all friends.

548
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,420
Oh.

549
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,170
Smells good.

550
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,860
Let's talk in our room.

551
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,630
Come on.

552
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,270
One more thing.

553
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,250
is something I can immediately judge.

554
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:16,180
Take Joke and Jack to the bridal chamber.

555
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,910
I'll do my best.

556
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,060
Jack.

557
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,980
Your friend gets so drunk every time he comes here.

558
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,660
No.

559
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,330
I should get used to it.

560
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,130
The situation was same

561
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,840
when I first met you.

562
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,830
You have a good memory.

563
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,180
Those people are not my friends.

564
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,370
But these

565
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,970
are my friends.

566
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,490
Do you remember what you said to me?

567
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,700
Back then,

568
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,460
when I said you had a cute smile?

569
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,940
No.

570
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,220
Then...

571
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:14,280
I was too old to drink?

572
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,720
Are you crazy?

573
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,980
You tole me

574
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,780
one day,

575
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,370
your dad will admit and accept me.

576
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,270
You're right.

579
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,980
You pervert!

580
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,660
You molested me!

581

I'm going to sleep.

583

584
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,930
You...

585
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,610
What did you do to me?

586
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,210
Help!

587
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,020
Help!

588
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,420
-Go! Go!
-Listen to me.

589
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,180
Yesterday,

590
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,130
you vomited all over your body when you were drunk.

591
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,310
I'll take it off for you, or it'll dirty my bed.

592
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,940
And you took off your pants yourself.

593
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,690
It has nothing to do with me.

594
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,330
Then why did you take off your clothes?

595
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,870
I always take off my clothes to sleep.

596
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,980
Because I'm allergic to sweat.

597
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,250
Otherwise, my whole body will turn red.

598
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,780
And since you came to sleep with me,

599
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,290
I've been sleeping in clothes.

600
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,610
I got pimples all over my body. Did you see that?

601
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,500
I put up with it for you.

602
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:23,820
Well...

603
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,410
This is my room.

604
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,750
You're awake.

605
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,800
go back to your room.

606
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,890
Don't come back to sleep.

607
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,870
Sleep with your dad.

608
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,170
Okay.

609
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,250
Be careful.

610
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:59,230
Didn't you say it was too slow?

611
00:33:59,250 --> 00:33:59,860
Gosh.

612
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,270
Don't think too much.

613
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,510

614
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,100
Gosh.

615
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,989
If it's too hard,

616
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,409
you don't have to learn.

617
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,860
I think

618
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,409
you don't have to do everything perfectly.

619
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:28,780
Look at me. Even if I'm only good at one thing,

620
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,719
I won't lose my job.

621
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,570
I just want to learn. What if?

622
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,360
What if you lose your job?

623
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:40,889
The economy is not good lately.

624
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,219
What if you die?

625
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:47,480
I've been fortune-telling for people around me lately.

626
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,639
I realized

627
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,270
if you were gone one day,

628
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,560
I'll be doomed.

I want to learn everything first.

I can do it for you without you.

Really?

632
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,020
Will I die?

633
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,200
Teach me again.

634
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,850
Step on this first, right?

635
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,940
Am I going to die?

636
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,730
Ah.

637
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,520
Again.

638
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,950
I sent you an invitation. Who else do you want to invite?

639
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,540
Coach, but...

640
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,680
He's staying far away, so he won't be able to come.

641
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,190
Now,

00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,720

Do you want to invite him?

644

He is actually

00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,680
an elder who always gives me a chance.

646
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,180
But I don't think he wants to see us.

Yes, we are together.

It means he knows the shape of this building.

who else would do such a thing?

00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,020
Nothing.

Help me. I'm dying.

Can you take Nang

00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,520
to the banquet this afternoon for me?

764
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,040

Let me see.

What's going on?

771
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,870
So this is it. Nang is going too?

772
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,540
Because my grandma is also going this afternoon.

But isn't this a party at the Leek Restaurant?

774

That's even better. Let grandma go with Nang.

But he said it's just a regular seminar.

778
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,910
So what kind of party is this?

779
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:34,360
Don't you think it's too coincidental?

780
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,800
They didn't invite us,

781
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,640
but they invited Grandma, Save,

782
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:41,610

803

It's like a game center

00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,730
where we can book or negotiate

805

01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:00,120
Oh my.

1129
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,310
You guys have good stuff too.

1130
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,140
Share some with me.

1131
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,480
Are you crazy?

1132
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,870
I don't know what you really want.

1133
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:11,650
But if you hate me that much, then fight me one-on-one.

1134
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:12,910
It's none of other's business.

1135
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:27,670
Aran.

1136
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:40,940
Tatto...

1137
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,520
Bastard!

1138
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:57,340
Wait!

1139
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:01,290
If you want to fight,

1140
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,840
I think you should put down your weapons first.

1141
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:06,090
Then we can fight.

1142
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,910
How would I know

1143
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:10,730
if you're up to something?

1144
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:16,350
Sure.

1145
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,700
You have to let my friend go first.

1146
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,990
If you think you can do it,

1147
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,670
then try.

1148
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,020
Stop!

1149
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,690
Should we go help Hoy first?

1150
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:18,860
Let's deal with these two first.

1151
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:39,100
Save.

1152
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,470
Ah!

1153
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:06,170
Let go!

1154
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:18,180
Come on.

1155
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:29,110
Joke.

1156
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:30,250
Do you think I spent a year

1157
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,010
to be your daycare brother?

1158
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,980
Carbon!

1159
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,460
Jack.

1160
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:10,600
You two beat me together

1161
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:12,800
and still couldn't win.

1162
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:15,620
Do you still want to fight me one-on-one?

1163
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,550
Do you think you can beat me?

1164
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:18,720
No.

1165
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,180
Stand up!

1166
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,970
Stand up for your friendship!

1167
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:40,830
So cheap.

1168
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,980
Are you so in love?

1169
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,060
Huh?

1170
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:57,740
Follow me.

1171
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:09,480
Joke.

1172
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:12,020
Joke

1173
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,640
Joke.

1174
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:50,300
Jack.

1175
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:52,920
Do you really want to know

1176
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:54,810
what you want?

1177
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:59,550
Carbon, Carbon, please...

1178
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,450
Please don't, Carbon.

1179
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:05,950
Kids of SUPANIMIT.

1180
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:08,900
Then you need to choose

1181
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,810
who you want to help.

1182
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:13,290
Hoy

1183
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:15,350
or Joke.

1184
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:19,530
If you can't make a choice,

1185
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:23,110
I'll make this decision for you... I'll kill them both!

1186
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:26,220
Carbon, please don't do this.

1187
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:30,410
I...

1188
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:34,430
I've never put my head on someone else's belt.

1189
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:39,340
I love you.

1190
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:41,890
My dear.

1191
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:45,510
Joke, don't do this.

1192
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:53,920
Ah!

1193
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,510
You bastard!

1194
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,540
Let go!

1195
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:05,210
Let go of me!

1196
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,880
Let go!

1197
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,590
Joke!

1198
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,730
Joke, Joke!

1199
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,840
Joke!

1200
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:14,990
Joke!

1201
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:19,020
No!

1202
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:27,880
No, Joke!

1203
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:46,500
Joke!

1204
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:12,970
Joke!

1205
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:20,720
[Indefinite closing]

1206
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:22,510
Two days have passed

1207
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:27,060
since the tragedy at DIF MARKE casino.

1208
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:29,570
The search for Mr. Joke's body

1209
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,820
continues with little hope.

1210
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:34,230
Mr. Carbon's body

1211
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:37,920
and the suspect's body have been sent for examination.

1212
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:42,650
It's a tragedy etched in the hearts of the people.

1213
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:46,670
Whether he's alive or not, we still

1214
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:48,820
pray wholeheartedly for Mr. Joke to be found soon.

1215
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:57,640
Grandma.

1216
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:00,850
Good morning.

1217
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:04,780
Oh my, you're so aloof.

1218
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,200
I thought you were the special detective.

1219
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:09,990
Grandma, you know what?

1220
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:11,020
Every morning when I wake up,

1221
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,430
I sit quietly like this for almost an hour.

1222
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:17,790
Do you know why? After I wake up,

1223
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,790
I think about what day it is.

1224
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:29,470
I bought some food for you.

1225
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:32,550
Don't forget to eat.

1226
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,880
I'll put away these leftovers.

1227
01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:46,030
Grandma, let’s watch TV.

1228
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,640
Now, the divers

1229
01:22:51,670 --> 01:22:54,420
have officially begun searching for Mr. Joke’s body.

1230
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,670
From the end of the river

1231
01:22:56,690 --> 01:22:59,310
to where he fell,

1232
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:02,200
but still no sign of his body.

1233
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,950
Just keep it on.

1234
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:11,230
Maybe someone will find him.

1235
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:14,250
He'll be back soon.

1236
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:17,570
Grandma, you don't need to listen to these news.

1237
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:20,110
He'll be back soon.

1238
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:22,980
Hey.

1239
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,730
But you also know,

1240
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,530
it's been a few days.

1241
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:30,450
Now everyone has found Carbon.

1242
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

1243
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:37,570
Just shut up if you don't know what to say.

1244
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:42,740
Jacke.

1245
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,610
Turn it on.

1246
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,800
Nang.

1247
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,830
Why didn't you tell me back then

1248
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:38,350
that it was Joke who was supposed to die that day?

1249
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:44,040
Didn't you say you could change that destiny?

1250
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:46,300
Then why did you let him die?

1251
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:50,260
And then?

1252
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:53,450
If Joke didn't die,

1253
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,310
would no one have died?

1254
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:59,610
Could you all have come back safe?

1255
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:02,880
The one who dies

1256
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:05,400
would still be one of you.

1257
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:09,100
Do you want to die instead of Joke?

1258
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:15,950
You're a coward!

1259
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,010
That day, Jack and Joke asked me

1260
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:24,900
to help with their wedding diary.

1261
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,930
Do you know what I learned?

1262
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,480
Actually, there are only two types of people who come for fortune-telling.

1263
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,580
The first type...

1264
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:39,400
is afraid of certain things happening

1265
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:42,040
and does everything to avoid them.

1266
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:46,900
And the second type bravely and smartly
deals with whatever comes their way.

1267
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:51,760
Some people are so scared of dying
they forget to actually live.

1268
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:21,140
Most people are cowards like you and me.

1269
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:23,830
But Joke is not.

1270
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:27,120
Joke lived his life to the fullest.

1271
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:30,060
When he's gone,

1272
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:33,540
he won't have regrets like we do.

1273
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:55,690
I'm sorry.

1274
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:01,700
If I hadn't lost the hard drive,

1275
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:03,870
Joke wouldn't have...

1276
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:09,410
Don't blame yourself.

1277
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:11,920
We're both at fault.

1278
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:18,160
I'm such a crappy boss.

1279
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:22,800
No, you've done great.

1280
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:49,820
Jack.

1281
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,910
I'm sorry.

1282
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:54,250
Why do you feel sorry?

1283
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:56,260
Well...

1284
01:27:56,290 --> 01:27:58,540
Wait, what? What's wrong with Joke?

1285
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,700
He died the day before your wedding.

1286
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,640
What are you talking about, Auntie?

1287
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,410
Joke isn't dead.

1288
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:09,820
He's still alive, he just hasn't shown up yet.

1289
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:15,820
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

1290
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:18,990
Why do people think you're dead?

1291
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,320
Why doesn't anyone trust me?

1292
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:24,290
Joke!

1293
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:26,510
Come back.

1294
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:30,280
Everyone's waiting to come to our wedding.

1295
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,520
If you do this,

1296
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:35,220
they will think you abandoned me.

1297
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:48,690
Hello?

1298
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:49,890
Who is it?

1299
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,570
Is it Mr. Jack?

1300
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:54,860
The flower canopy Mr. Joke ordered is ready.

1301
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:56,380
Should we deliver it now?

1302
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:59,630
Yes, you can.

1303
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,290
See, Auntie?

1304
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:06,530
I told you he's not dead. He's alive!

1305
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:08,390
How is that possible?

1306
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:11,560
I've told you he’s not dead.

1307
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:15,290
I'm sick of repeating it, he's alive!

1308
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:18,260
He's really alive!

1309
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:19,370
Everyone says he's dead.

1310
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:20,570
I'm telling the truth!

1311
01:29:20,590 --> 01:29:21,850
