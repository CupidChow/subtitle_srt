This series is purely a work of fiction
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,500
Save, I need your help.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,920
Are you ready to fix your mistakes?

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,070
If I lose, you can take my life.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,300
I've never been this unlucky, are you working together?

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,720
Jack and Save, you two betrayed me.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,280
Grandma.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,170
Today I'm going to make it unforgettable.
Hey,

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,270
You rascal!

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,310
Jack, you go help Joke quickly!

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,000
Why?

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Joke was taken away!

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,940
When did Joke get kidnappeded by Boss's men?

14
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,539
Shit, I have no idea.

15
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:17,710
But I think we should hurry and go.

16
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,780
I don't know how Joke is holding up.

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,970
Fuck.

18
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,820
So where should we go?

19
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,360
Uh...

20
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,039
I have no clue where we should go.

21
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,259
I know where.

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
I'll take you guys there.

23
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,460
Let's go.

24
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,640
Let's go!

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Yeah! Let's go!

26
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,400
I don’t know which doors Boss has his men guarding,

27
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,000
so I think it’s better if we sneak in separately.

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,540
If we all go together, we might get caught.

29
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,320
Or should I go talk to Boss directly?

30
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Maybe we can avoid using force.

31
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,950
Yeah, I think that’s a good idea.

32
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,260
At least you used to be his adopted son.

33
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,730
Oops.

34
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,450
Nevermind, I was never the favorite child anyway.

35
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,000
Sorry, I forgot.

36
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
Alright, you two go together.

37
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,610
As for the rest of us, I think we should deal with Boss’s men first,

38
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,850
to weaken his forces.

39
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,190
In that case, I’ll sneak in from the back of the building.

40
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,230
There’s a shortcut there.

41
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:19,459
It’s risky, but it might help us figure out where Boss is keeping Save and Joke.

42
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,310
And if Boss doesn’t play by our rules,

43
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,320
I’ll go in alone and take him down myself.

44
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,200
Going in alone? Seriously?

45
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,380
Yeah, wait sec.

46
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,310
What’s that?

47
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,280
I brought this.

48
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,610
A deodorant spray?

49
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,130
Hey, stop!

50
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:42,780
Huh?

51
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,159
Who would care about deodorant at a time like this, idiot?

52
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,820
Oh, right.

53
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,530
So what is it?

54
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:56,030
This is a new and improved tranquilizer I upgraded from the old one we used.

55
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,680
I put it in a portable bottle to make it easier to carry.

56
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,400
It’s for emergencies. Trust me, three seconds, and they’re out.

57
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,770
Couldn’t you find a bottle that’s more minimalistic? This one’s so flashy.

58
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,560
The maximalist look is part of its signature.

59
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,260
Alright, just keep it on you.

60
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,180
Okay, so we’re all set.

61
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,490
I’m heading out.

62
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,380
Good luck.

63
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,400
Alright, Arun.

64
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,920
I’ve got an idea.

65
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Understood, boss.

66
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,210
Got it.

67
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Man, it’s so hot today. Hope it doesn’t rain.

68
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,450
Hey, wanna go for a joyride?

69
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,860
Let’s go, hurry!

70
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,280
Hey! How did they get in?

71
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,520
Suck and pull on it.

72
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,560
Hey! Go and catch them!
Suck and pull on it.

73
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,670
Go, go!

74
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,850
Suck and pull on it, come on.

75
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,260
Hurry!

76
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,240
You can't go in.

77
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,100
I need to talk to my dad.

78
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,390
Boss ordered that no one is allowed inside.

79
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,190
But Jack and I are Boss’s sons!

80
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,500
Still not allowed.

81
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,290
No matter what, I’m going in.

82
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,760
Jack, ignore them.

83
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,080
You’re not allowed, please leave.

84
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,420
You dare block me?

85
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,580
Fine, my father will hear about this and you'll be in deep trouble.

86
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Please wait a moment.

87
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,480
Boss, Aran and Jack are now inside.

88
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,840
What should I do?

89
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,659
(Let them return but if they are stubborn, catch them all.)

90
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,740
(No need to care if they are my sons.)

91
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,060
No matter what, it's still a no.

92
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,540
Please leave.

93
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,420
Okay.

94
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,350
Okay, I'll go back, but please give this to my father.

95
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,060
The bag looks familiar.

96
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,510
Familiar how?

97
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,240
Like this.

98
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,760
Hey, what’s wrong with you?

99
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,370
What are you doing?

100
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,980
If you want it, come and get it.

101
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,039
Hey! What’s wrong?

102
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,480
After them!

103
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,210
Stop right there!

104
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,900
Alright, I’ll help you two,

105
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,900
but don’t get up again, okay?

106
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,190
Joke!

107
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,060
Boss, Jack is now inside.

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,480
Did you guys hear that?

109
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,930
An important guest is coming soon.

110
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,070
Then it's time for some fun.

111
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,970
I also want to know who else will come to help you guys.

112
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Then I'll start with...

113
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,760
You, Save.

114
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,410
Hey, what's that noise?

115
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,290
Look.

116
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,290
The person who was going to help you hung up.

117
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,550
Oh, Save, you're waiting for nothing.

118
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,580
A guy like Hope wouldn't dare fight someone like me.

119
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,580
Well? Depressed?

120
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:03,510
See, don't you dare betray me!

121
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,160
Hey! It's the sound of someone screaming, follow it!

122
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,910
Who should be next?

123
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Let's go with Rose.

124
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,310
(Rawat)

125
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,240
Hello?

126
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,580
(Boss, is my daughter with you?)

127
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,840
Father!

128
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,180
(Why did you take Rose?)

129
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,260
(Let go of my daughter, she has nothing to do with it.)

130
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,400
(If you are not happy about something, come and talk to me directly.)

131
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,230
Wow, you're apologizing already?

132
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,640
Promise me that you will do everything I ask.

133
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,320
(Promise, I promise you, I can do anything you want.)

134
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,900
Father.

135
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,320
You said it yourself.

136
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,430
Then repeat after me.

137
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:51,440
I will do everything my master asks for because I am your servant.

138
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,250
Don't say it, Father.

139
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,710
If you say it, I will immediately release your daughter.

140
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,200
Don't, Father, or Boss will...

141
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,690
(I will do everything my master asks for because I am your servant.)

142
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,100
Father

143
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,280
You are the Four Horsemen, but you are so easily fooled by me.

144
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,460
Even if you lick my shoes,

145
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,940
I will not let go of your daughter, you idiot.

146
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,940
She will die today.

147
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,600
Boss,

148
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,330
You are a psychopath!

149
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,870
You just found out?

150
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Who's next?

151
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,110
Suck and pull.

152
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,640
How could you ever keep up with me?

153
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,610
Wow, I'm on another level.

154
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,280
How are the others?

155
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,840
Hey!

156
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Oh!

157
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,610
Do you think you can escape us?

158
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,100
You're playing so hard, bro.

159
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,770
Calm down, bro.

160
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,480
That son of a bitch has a gun.

161
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,720
What gun? It's just a spray.

162
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,260
Hey!

163
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,820
They're all asleep.

164
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,810
Wow, Tattoo is really on another level!

165
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,810
Who'd give up so easily!?

166
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,400
Hey!

167
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,810
Oh man.

168
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,280
Calm down, bro.

169
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,920
Whoa, there's so many of you.

170
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,000
I think we should talk it out.

171
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh, it hurts you if you punch, bro, calm down

172
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,640
Calm down first, bro.
Hoy, move.

173
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
What the hell is this?

174
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,220
Tattoo! You're really something else.
Hey, don't!!

175
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,190
Wow...

176
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,060
you were almost cool.

177
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,060
Joke!

178
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,830
Jack!

179
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,040
Jack!
Stop!

180
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,990
you were almost cool.

181
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,460
Boss.

182
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,830
Boss, please let everyone go, you can take me instead.

183
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,240
Why would I do that?

184
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,360
At least holding these three,

185
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,370
gives me satisfaction.

186
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,110
Why are you doing this? I don’t understand.

187
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,070
Oh, nothing much. I just want to play a game.

188
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,070
Want to play with me?

189
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,780
Actually, I wanted Hope to play this game with me.

190
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:24,920
If someone loses, I’ll blow them up along with Rose.

191
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,560
But Hope’s a coward, unlike you.

192
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,150
You’re more loyal than anyone else.

193
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:40,300
So, I’ll play this game with you.

194
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,110
Here’s the deal.

195
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,370
If you win, I’ll release all the hostages.

196
00:16:53,300 --> 00:17:01,610
But if you refuse to play, I’ll blow up Joke right now. How about that?

197
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,180
Jack, don’t!

198
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,230
No.

199
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,440
I’ll play.

200
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,069
What’s the game?

201
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,150
Let me go!

202
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,320
Did he seriously put a bomb collar on them?

203
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,600
Let him go.

204
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,090
It'll be ok.

205
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,530
I'm sorry.

206
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,140
Today’s game is Hangman.

207
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,550
You get it, right?

208
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,210
I’ll have them each pick a word.

209
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,640
Your job is to guess the letters correctly.

210
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,200
But if you get it wrong more than seven times, the collar they’re wearing will explode.

211
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,820
You’ll probably choose Joke, right? Now, who should I pick?

212
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,930
You.

213
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,300
Rose, I was planning to kill you first

214
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,570
but you’re feisty and I like that, so I'll pick you.

215
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,280
As for Save, got any last words?

216
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:26,150
Save, if you don’t have anything to say, then prepare to say goodbye.

217
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,120
Hey! What are you doing?

218
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,520
Nobody picked him. What’s the point of keeping him alive?

219
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,620
But you promised me that if I played and won,

220
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,260
you’d release the hostages.

221
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,680
I did.

222
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,820
But I never said I’d release all of them.

223
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,410
If there’s nothing left to say, prepare to say goodbye.

224
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,410
Stop it!

225
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,510
Don’t!

226
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,210
What are you doing?!

227
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,560
Think you’re tough, huh?

228
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,500
Hey! Don't!
No!

229
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,670
Yes!

230
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,700
Hey, Save! How is this possible?

231
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,700
I'll go find help!

232
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,880
Don't run away!

233
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,600
Watch out for the bomb!

234
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,480
Hey, why are you scared of a bomb?

235
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,190
The bomb isn’t going to explode anymore. Go catch that guy quickly!

236
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,090
You guys upstairs, go check the control room and see what’s going on.

237
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,450
If anyone gets unlocked again, you two can prepare to die.

238
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,450
Go!

239
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,550
Damn it, I’m sorry, Joke, Rose.

240
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,370
I’ve wasted enough time already.

241
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:30,000
Hey, everyone downstairs, think of one word each,

242
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,300
And don’t forget to include a hint.

243
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,620
Hey, if you guess Joke’s word, it’ll be too easy.

244
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:32,890
Here’s the deal, I’ll switch. You guess Rose’s word,

245
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,940
And I’ll guess Joke’s. Fair, right?

246
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,700
Fair, my ass!!

247
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,540
Huh? What are you even saying?

248
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,870
And do I even have a choice?

249
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,500
No.

250
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,410
Go stand with Rose now.

251
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,370
And as your godfather,

252
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,370
I’ll let you start the game.

253
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
Diarrhea?

254
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,700
Stomach ache?

255
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
Diarrhea.

256
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:51,880
I don't think that's right, A should be at the back.

257
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,960
Shit.

258
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,840
Throw?

259
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,030
Let’s see what Joke wants to tell you.

260
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,330
Hey, look in here and search thoroughly.

261
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,380
Where did he go? I saw him run in here.

262
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,350
Hey, are you in here?

263
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,630
What are you guys doing?

264
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,740
Where is it? Are you following it?

265
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,830
Search everywhere!

266
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,710
Hey, come here!

267
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
His clothes are here.

268
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,600
Hey, follow me.

269
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,960
What’s up?

270
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,300
Don’t worry, the situation here is under control.

271
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,830
There’s no way the villagers can get out.

272
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,680
What’s up?

273
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,420
Ah!

274
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,000
Pretty helpful.

275
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,770
Eek!

276
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,250
It’s Arun, Boss’s kid!

277
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,920
Don’t hurt us! We have nothing left.

278
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,510
No, no! I’m here to help everyone!

279
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:06,000
Don’t lie to us. You’re here to kill us for sure.

280
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,390
Why would I kill you, you idiot?

281
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,970
Everyone needs to leave right now!

282
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,500
My dad’s men are coming. Hurry!

283
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,600
No way. If we run, we’ll just get caught again.

284
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,890
True.
Yeah.

285
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,160
We’ll stay here. We don’t want to get hurt anymore.

286
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,030
Right.

287
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,250
If we go out, we’ll be attacked.

288
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,380
Why are you all so cowardly?

289
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,330
If you don’t want to fight for yourselves,

290
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,760
At least fight for the children at home!

291
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,560
Toi Ting,

292
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,220
How’s my daughter?

293
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,390
She fought bravely against the bad guys.

294
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,380
If you saw it with your own eyes,

295
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,580
You’d be so proud of her.

296
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,690
And did she win?

297
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,900
She’s just one kid, how could she win?

298
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,080
But at least Toi Ting fought until the very last moment.

299
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,430
Hey, Arun’s here!

300
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,310
Hey, they’ve arrived!

301
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,260
You all get out of the way.

302
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,920
Our kids are fighting these villains.

303
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,920
Why aren’t we standing up to them?

304
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,790
Attack!

305
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:29,560
Attack!

306
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,190
You can’t escape.

307
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,139
Where could you go?

308
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,310
Fine, come at me.

309
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,909
Ruk, look at his stance!

310
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,000
Bring it on!

311
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,199
Pathetic.

312
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,739
Hey, Yom!

313
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,340
Hope, step aside. We don’t want to gang up on you.

314
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:05,470
Ruk, Yom, think carefully.

315
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,470
You still have time to switch sides.

316
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,900
You see how Boss is becoming a power-hungry tyrant.

317
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,900
We have to stop him together.

318
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,680
No one can stop Boss.

319
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,430
Fine, I gave you both a choice.

320
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,430
I won’t hold back now.

321
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,240
Are you ok?

322
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,570
I’m sorry.

323
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,980
It’s okay.

324
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,070
Let's go outside and find people to help.

325
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,680
No one outside will help.

326
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
We’re the ones who have to help Jack.

327
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,630
You're a burden to me.

328
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,760
You sprayed without looking at me!

329
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,370
Why are you pulling your hand back?

330
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,680
Huh?

331
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,250
Where do you think you’re going?

332
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,430
You want to get inside?

333
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,910
Over my dead body.

334
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,400
Tattoo!

335
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,080
What?

336
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,090
Get up!

337
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,650
You want some?

338
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,290
You want to go in, right?

339
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,030
If you don’t get up,

340
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,920
You’ll die right here!

341
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,450
Hey!

342
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,590
Let them go!

343
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,990
Or I’ll shoot you!

344
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,250
You two, go inside first.

345
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
Get in there.

346
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,670
A five-letter word.

347
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:35,310
Could it be “Love, Live, or Death”?

348
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,770
Or is it “Lovely”?

349
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,560
What?

350
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,710
You’re done for!

351
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,930
Do you have a problem?

352
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,280
Is that why you do this?

353
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,260
Everyone hates you.

354
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:53,240
You just want to show off your power that you can ruin other people’s lives.

355
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,350
You claim to hate the elites.

356
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:05,920
But in reality, you desperately want to be one of us.

357
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,270
And you never will.

358
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,820
So go on, keep clinging to your fake power all by yourself.

359
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,410
Fake?

360
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,600
Save that line for your father in the next life.

361
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,810
How is it wrong?

362
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,800
Damn it, what word did you type?!

363
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,920
What are you doing?

364
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,920
Shoot me if you’re going to shoot.

365
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,030
Shut up! I’m a good shooter!

366
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:49,620
If you had the guts, you’d have shot me already.

367
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,920
Don’t test me!

368
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
I’ll really shoot you!

369
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:04,110
Shoot, then! I dare you!

370
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,090
Tattoo!

371
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,950
Tattoo!

372
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:22,760
Damn it!

373
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,640
Are you okay?

374
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,730
Tattoo, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to kill you!

375
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:36,760
Tattoo!

376
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,030
Damn it, did I kill my friend?

377
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,770
I think one of your friends just got shot by Carbon.

378
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,000
What word is it?

379
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,120
So frustrating!! I can’t think of it, your turn!

380
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:56,860
What is it?

381
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,680
Boss, dickhead.

382
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,120
Yes!

383
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,180
Huh?

384
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:15,000
Joke, you cheated! You wrote it wrong on purpose to make me lose!

385
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,240
Hey, hey! How did I cheat, Boss?

386
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,960
You told me to write an English word,

387
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,370
So I typed “sorry” to Jack.

388
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:27,150
Sorry! How did I cheat?

389
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:31,820
What kind of school did you go to that taught “sorry” with a Z, you idiot?

390
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:35,780
What kind of thief are you? Dumb ass!

391
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,330
Oh, really?

392
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,330
It’s spelled with an S?

393
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,310
Sorry.

394
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,310
That’s not cheating.

395
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:00,900
It’s your stupid program that can’t detect misspelled words, not our problem.

396
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,600
Shut up already!

397
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,960
You’re so sneaky. Die, all of you, right here.

398
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,610
Hey, no!
What’s going on?

399
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:08,410
Hey!

400
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:09,810
No, don’t!
What’s happening?

401
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:11,120
Dad!

402
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,420
You can’t go in.

403
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,250
I’m Boss’s son!

404
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,030
Move!

405
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,700
You can’t go in.
Move aside!

406
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,590
Dad!

407
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,480
Hey! Arun!

408
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,380
Arun!

409
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,030
Dad! Don't!

410
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,130
Hey!

411
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:32,480
Jack.

412
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,960
Joke, are you okay?

413
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,950
Rose?

414
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,370
Ok.

415
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:44,370
Arun!

416
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,480
Arun! Let go!

417
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:49,850
Arun! Let go!

418
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:50,440
Dad!

419
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,880
How did you survive?

420
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,180
Arun!

421
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,150
Arun!

422
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,510
Don't!

423
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,420
Let go!

424
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Hey!

425
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,520
Get down there and get it quickly! Go!

426
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:13,980
Oh shit!

427
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,870
Damn it!

428
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,820
Arun, let go!

429
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,560
Dad!

430
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,890
Damn it, how did you survive?

431
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,060
Damn it!

432
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,250
Hey!

433
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Hurry up and fix this. I’ll handle it myself.

434
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,240
I’ll kill you all!

435
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
I’ll take your arms with me!

436
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:36,880
Take this!

437
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:07,000
Carbon, give it to me!

438
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,830
I’m serious, damn it!

439
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,840
Hurry up!

440
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,320
Jack!

441
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:28,910
You want it?

442
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:35,200
Beat me first, and I’ll give it to you.

443
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,310
Jack!

444
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,610
Where did you kick it?

445
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,620
Don't you dare touch my boyfriend!

446
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,140
Joke, are you okay?

447
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,210
Jack!

448
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:47,780
Let him go!

449
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,630
Are you ok?

450
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,700
Jack, Joke, you guys are amazing.

451
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,000
You okay?

452
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,970
Serves you right.

453
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:19,360
Do you have any last words before you die, Jack?

454
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:37,880
Jack.

455
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,640
Jack, what the hell are you doing?

456
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,620
You'll get blown up!

457
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,250
Get out!

458
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:49,750
No, I'm not going. I'm staying with you.

459
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:02,330
Then let me apologize one last time, okay?

460
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:06,990
But this time, you have to forgive me.

461
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:09,640
No.

462
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,540
None of it matters anymore.

463
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:23,640
Just being here with you right now, nothing else matters.

464
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:31,220
If you love each other so much, then die together.

465
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,820
I’m afraid I won’t get to kiss you again.

466
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,000
Boss is cheating! Automatic disqualification!

467
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:18,290
What’s that noise?

468
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:22,060
Where is it coming from?

469
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,740
Nang, how do you know I’m here?

470
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:34,730
Alice, do you really believe that ring will give you power over us?

471
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:42,160
Let me tell you, that ring is worthless.

472
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,360
We made it all up for fun, thinking it was a joke.

473
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:52,170
Never thought you’d actually believe it so completely.

474
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,090
Hope no one has any issues with that.

475
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:26,320
Who’d have thought you’d be bold enough to kidnap Rose for your schemes?

476
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,320
That’s gutsy of you.

477
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:34,100
If I weren’t truly powerful,

478
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,230
Rose’s father wouldn’t have let her stay with me.

479
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:47,400
Because I’m confident my daughter will be safe.

480
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,750
Well done, everything’s going as planned.

481
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,750
Thank you, sir.

482
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,700
Hey! Hey!

483
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,270
No need.

484
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,120
You two, keep an eye on them.

485
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,540
Yes, sir.

486
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,540
Damn it!

487
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,220
You fool.

488
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,280
Do you now understand the punishment for cheating?

489
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:33,560
The penalty for cheaters in the Four Horsemen’s game is..

490
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:41,640
One, erasure from the civil registry and all identifying records.

491
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,530
No!

492
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:51,760
Two, complete asset seizure, reducing you to start from zero.

493
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:59,520
Nang, are you sure you’re siding with them?

494
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,080
Aren’t you angry that their parents

495
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,960
ruined our parents, they commited suicide

496
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,970
and left us orphans?

497
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:16,130
And is your method really the right way?

498
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:19,650
Face the consequences of your actions.

499
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Bastards!

500
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,690
Hope!

501
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:55,780
No, it’s not true, you’re tricking me!

502
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,440
Dad, why are you doing this?

503
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:09,100
Looking at them, looking at me, as a pawn in this game?

504
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,470
Do you even have a heart?

505
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,460
You power-hungry maniacs!

506
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:00,560
Three days later...

507
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:06,420
How’s everyone doing?

508
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:10,240
Hey, man.

509
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,850
Still in pain, damn it.

510
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:19,510
Grandma, you brought fried chive cakes?

511
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,040
Looks delicious.

512
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,830
You’ve got a sharp nose, Tattoo.

513
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,000
How are you guys? The hospital beds are uncomfortable huh?

514
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,060
I’ve stayed here before. I know it well.

515
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:39,360
Oh, Grandma, with this condition, even if I didn’t want to, I’d have to stay.

516
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:43,440
Grandma,

517
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:50,030
I’m sorry for everything that happened.

518
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,980
It’s okay, it’s okay.

519
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,080
I’ve forgotten everything about you.

520
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:01,760
But this one here, I’ll forgive only halfway,

521
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,590
because you kept trashing my house.

522
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:08,500
Do you know how much effort it takes for me to clean up?

523
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,400
My back hurts, you know!

524
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,750
Oh, Grandma, it was just a small thing. You hold a grudge, don’t you?

525
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,090
Just a small thing?

526
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:29,100
Oh no, Hope, the high mistress gave the order.

527
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,000
You want some?

528
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,560
Hey, hey, I can’t, I can’t.

529
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,480
Look at my condition.

530
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,290
Hey, Toi Ting, are you feeling better?

531
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:50,000
Yes, Grandma, in just two days, I’ll be able to go back to Taekwondo class.

532
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,750
Huh?

533
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:53,930
Really, doctor?

534
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:58,160
Not really, she just complains every day about wanting to go back.

535
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:04,230
Perfect timing, doctor.

536
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:09,830
I’d like to invite you to the learning center opening that Joke and I are hosting.

537
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:12,030
Are you free to join?

538
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:19,020
I want you to come.

539
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:24,110
It’s my son’s event. Of course, I have to go.

540
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,260
Right?

541
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:46,000
And why are you poking my butt?

542
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,630
That’s great!

543
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:51,080
I'll kick your legs.

544
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,500
And how’s everyone else?

545
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,390
Hoy is helping out at the center.

546
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:02,720
Arun is probably handling things with Boss.

547
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,070
Okay.

548
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:09,110
Has anyone been able to hold Boss accountable?

549
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:12,060
And that heavy hitter named Carbon?

550
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:18,770
Carbon has been handed over to the police.

551
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:20,770
But as for Boss,

552
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:25,140
it seems like the Four Horsemen have hidden all the evidence.

553
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,240
The police can’t do anything.

554
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,810
But Boss will face his karma.

555
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,240
Let’s just leave it for now.

556
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,220
Let’s eat, Grandma made this for us.

557
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,560
Come on, everyone, while it’s hot.

558
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,850
Here, Tattoo, take a box.

559
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:45,000
Here’s another one.
Grandma’s handing them out.

560
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,470
You, turn around. You got shot, didn’t you?

561
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:23,080
I love this necklace just as much as you.

562
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,560
But we have to sell it.

563
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:31,840
You can use all the money to pay back the interest you cheated people out of.

564
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,770
If you want to do the right thing,

565
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,540
you have to start there.

566
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:46,570
Don’t forget to take your meds.

567
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,750
Necklace.

568
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:57,000
Morakot

569
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:07,420
Morakot

570
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:35,020
Morakot, do you know how much I’ve missed you?

571
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:39,870
Take me to be with you.

572
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:48,450
All this time, you've been proud of me.

573
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,360
So you went on and stole their dreams?

574
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:17,290
I hope my death can make up for it.

575
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,040
Take me with you.

576
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:26,649
Death can’t atone for anything.

577
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:32,930
Living does, it gives you the chance to make amends.

578
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:40,649
Morakot

579
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,109
Morakot

580
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:51,020
Morakot

581
01:09:03,529 --> 01:09:08,080
Dad.

582
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,080
What’s wrong, Dad?

583
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:14,270
Help!

584
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:15,319
Dad!

585
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:16,319
Dad, stay strong!

586
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,750
Dad.

587
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:20,970
Help!

588
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:24,330
Dad.

589
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:26,330
Help!

590
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,870
Help!

591
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:38,050
It's here! Move!

592
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,720
Oh!

593
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,920
Take what’s yours.
Thank you.

594
01:09:44,439 --> 01:09:45,000
Thank you very much.

595
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Tell me how it tastes, okay?

596
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,680
You can compliment, but no criticizing!

597
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,560
I wouldn’t dare.

598
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,450
Me neither.

599
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,040
So, how’s your dad?

600
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:06,360
He’s safe. Good thing we got him to the hospital in time.

601
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:18,000
I heard the Four Horsemen have chosen a new boss.

602
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,400
What? Seriously?

603
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,000
Damn, do we need to run?

604
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,430
If the new boss is in cahoots with your dad,

605
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:29,380
will they send people after us?

606
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:38,380
But if we run, what happens to the villagers?

607
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:42,270
And if the new boss is as bad as the old one,

608
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:44,270
it’ll be even worse.

609
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:49,470
Just talking about it gives me chills, like a spirit is watching me.

610
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:57,480
Sorry, forgot about your dad.

611
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,480
Stop talking, stop talking.

612
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,480
Another thing is

613
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:09,190
what if they change the debt contracts for the worse,

614
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:11,320
the villagers will suffer even more.

615
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:17,790
I’m not running.

616
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:26,210
I can’t run anyway, my dad’s bed ridden.

617
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:34,390
I’m not running either. If you’re staying, I’m staying.

618
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,690
Why should I run when I’ve got no friends to run with?

619
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:44,650
Forget it, cheers.

620
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:48,540
Welcome drink, bottoms up!

621
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:51,170
Finish it!

622
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:57,260
You guys have become so much kinder.

623
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:02,510
That last scene was so impactful.

624
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:04,510
Super heroic!

625
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:07,990
Wow, your language has improved a lot lately.

626
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,470
Mixing Thai and English perfectly.

627
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:11,050
Of course.

628
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:12,300
Wow! Of course?!

629
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:17,120
You guys don’t need to worry about the new boss.

630
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,780
They might even be someone you’ve seen before.

631
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:23,230
You?

632
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:24,710
Not me.

633
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:27,150
Or maybe…

634
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:28,430
Or maybe…

635
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,350
Or maybe...

636
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,610
Are you ready, boss?

637
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,960
Can I rehearse the script again?

638
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,960
No need.

639
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:53,280
By the way, my boyfriend is dressed especially sharp today.

640
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:59,220
Let’s finish your speech quickly so we can get to other things.

641
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,630
Hello, hello?

642
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:06,430
Alright, everyone, step in closer.

643
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:07,360
Move in closer!

644
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,000
Come on in, you over there. Yes, you!

645
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,930
It’s the perfect time now.

646
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:18,510
Let’s give a big round of applause for the ceremony’s president and the new boss of Suphanimit!

647
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:31,040
Hello, hello, testing. One, two.

648
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,620
Hi, everyone.

649
01:13:47,910 --> 01:14:01,570
Greetings to everyone at Suphanimit. I’m Pokpong Jungjaruek, the new boss of Suphanimit.

650
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:09,880
Today, I feel deeply hated.. No!

651
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:16,730
Deeply honored for our learning center.

652
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:23,460
I want the people of Suphamini..

653
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:26,430
Nimit!

654
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:31,000
To have less space...

655
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,560
More space!

656
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:35,830
Will he get it right today?

657
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:40,200
...A space filled with hope.

658
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:51,440
It’s going to be a disaster.

659
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,070
Thank you.

660
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,730
Called it, spot on like a fortune teller.

661
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:28,830
Oh, is it over already?

662
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:36,060
Well, it was a short speech, but still got the point across.

663
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:38,240
Let’s move to the next agenda, then.

664
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,870
I’d like to invite the director of our learning center,

665
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,410
Jack Jakrapol Ngowtong, or as everyone knows him,

666
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:48,000
as Jack, the former Grim Reaper, to say a few words.

667
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:03,690
I’d like to thank our new boss.

668
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:06,640
Let me share a little something.

669
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,230
This learning center wouldn’t exist

670
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:15,680
without our main supporters, Rose

671
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:24,630
the teachers, and the villagers who’ve carried on the debt-free legacy project.

672
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:25,910
Me, too!

673
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:30,100
Of course, and Joke as well!

674
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:35,190
Thanks to them, we had the funds to turn this project into reality.

675
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:38,520
Let’s give them a round of applause!

676
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,900
Isn’t it tiring to keep that face on all day?

677
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:49,890
Of course it is.

678
01:16:55,240 --> 01:17:01,050
I grew up in this community too and faced a lot of disappointment.

679
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:06,620
Because I used to believe I was too small to make any change.

680
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:14,550
But one day, someone came into my life

681
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:21,270
and made me believe that even someone as small as me could make a difference.

682
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:25,410
Even if I fell a thousand times,

683
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:29,200
they trusted me,

684
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:36,370
and that gave me the strength to overcome despair.

685
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:39,770
That’s why I want to pass this strength on

686
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:44,090
to the next generation of superheroes.

687
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:47,900
I want them to believe they’re strong

688
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:53,880
and valuable enough to never let anyone take advantage of them.

689
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:58,930
With that, I’d like to present certificates and superhero capes

690
01:17:58,930 --> 01:18:04,130
to represent the beginning of dreams

691
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:07,430
and hope for our community.

692
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:22,760
So, may I invite Miss Toi Ting Sangtawan, the representative of the new heroes,

693
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,590
to come forward and receive her certificate and cape.

694
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:34,420
(Certificate of Achievement: This certificate is awarded to
Miss Toi Ting Sangtawan for the beginning of dreams and hope for the Suphanimit community.)

695
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:17,950
Are you leaving already?

696
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:22,120
Yes, I have some work to do at the shrine.

697
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,080
We haven’t talked in a while.

698
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:25,770
Yes.

699
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:33,200
Are you still troubled by that day?

700
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:39,810
Why did you let the elders, my father

701
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:41,810
even Boss do that?

702
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:49,780
My voice wasn’t strong enough to stop them,

703
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:54,210
neither the Four Horsemen nor Boss.

704
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:56,620
But that wasn’t the case with me, was it?

705
01:19:56,620 --> 01:20:02,710
I always listened to you and believed in your judgment, you know that very well.

706
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:07,150
Or did you manipulate me all along with your advice

707
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:09,800
to make things turn out this way?

708
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,800
Was all of this your game?

709
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:18,210
Rose.

710
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:25,600
If I told you it was a game,

711
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,140
would you be angry with me, Rose?

712
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:38,240
It was the strategy of a group of people, and I could only voice objections.

713
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:43,130
The villagers were just pawns moved along the board.

714
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:48,520
I only tried to restore balance.

715
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:58,040
If manipulating me was what it took to bring hope back to Suphanimit,

716
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,960
then I won't be angry.

717
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:08,080
But after this, I’d like you to help me reform some traditions of the Four Horsemen.

718
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,390
Can you help me?

719
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:14,050
I promise your voice will matter to us.

720
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:23,410
Are you going to refuse? I’ve got the ring.

721
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:37,310
I’m always willing to help you, Rose.

722
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:45,070
That ring suits you perfectly.

723
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:50,670
Excuse me.

724
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:51,580
Sure.

725
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,520
Wow, a satisfying scoop.

726
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,780
Take it.

727
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,990
Here you go.

728
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:27,480
Hey there!

729
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,620
We made it, even if we’re late.

730
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:38,040
Top, Mom, Dad.

731
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,040
Let me hold that.

732
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:48,730
You’re amazing, I’m so proud of you.

733
01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:55,860
So proud.

734
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:58,430
Thank you, Mom.

735
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:00,430
Thanks, Dad.

736
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:13,740
Your little brother brought flowers for you.

737
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,720
Thank you so much.

738
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:55,260
What’s up? Tired already?

739
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:58,280
Of course, I scooped ice cream for hundreds of people.

740
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:02,520
So much sweat.

741
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:26,690
Jack.

742
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:30,290
I have something to tell you.

743
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:36,040
Oh no, are you going to confess your love again?

744
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:38,510
No, no! Too cheesy.

745
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:40,150
Are you crazy!?

746
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:41,930
You're somewhat of a narcissist.

747
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:47,560
No, I just want to thank you.

748
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:57,600
I’ve made a list of a hundred ways to repay you for what you’ve done for me.

749
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:06,720
First, I’ll make you clean chive cakes.

750
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,130
Wow, a healthy recipe, huh?

751
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:15,000
Second, I’ll wash the dishes after every meal.

752
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,420
And third...

753
01:25:19,730 --> 01:25:24,520
No need, if you want to thank me,

754
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:30,000
just stay with me, that’s enough.

755
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,210
There's no need.

756
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:39,660
Here.

757
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:51,050
I stole it from Boss’s office.

758
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:57,390
Hey, even if it’s fake,

759
01:25:57,390 --> 01:26:03,080
to me, everything that happened was real.

760
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:13,080
Then you keep mine, and I’ll keep the Joker.

761
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:13,890
Here.

762
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:41,090
Thank you so much.

763
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:43,270
It means a lot to me.

764
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:58,330
Wait, did you really steal it? You?

765
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:05,610
Not true.

766
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:06,930
Oh?

767
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:11,270
I asked Arun for it, how’s that?

768
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:13,470
My lie was pretty convincing, right?

769
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,300
You jerk.

770
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:23,240
Joke.

771
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,660
Oops, my bad.

772
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:27,830
It all spilled!

773
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:29,610
You deserve that!

774
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:55,220
Take mine, I’m full.

775
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,600
I don’t want it anymore.

776
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,960
I’d rather it from here.

777
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,600
What?

778
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:11,480
Hey, Jack!

779
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:24,010
There's some here too.
