This series is purely a work of fiction

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,080
Your grandma is in a stable condition now.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,830
Thank you so much, doctor.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,600
Thank you... dad.
(Grandma’s recovering!)

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,300
If you have a problem, just say it.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's play a game.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,700
A truth game.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,280
The reason I spend so much time with Rose

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,010
is because Boss made me deceive Rose

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry for what happened.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,790
You know I’d help you with anything.

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,280
I appreciate everything you did for me.

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,610
I think we should take the vase back too.

14
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,610
It’s got such a nice shape.

15
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,460
The bookshelf too.

16
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,730
And the sofa, table, bed—let’s take it all back.

17
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,520
Does the fridge come with the place too?

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,680
I think we should take everything.

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,330
But are we really going to take it all back?

20
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,940
Can you even carry all this stuff?

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,740
I’ll call Hoy to help you move.

22
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,000
You want to take everything,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,509
but you’re not even helping me.

24
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,200
You’re complaining over something this small?

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,000
Just standing there drinking, enjoying yourself.

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,440
Give me some.

27
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,640
Refreshing and tasty.

28
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,200
Do you want some?

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,270
Go ahead.

30
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,480
Wait, you want it but you’re not taking it?

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,600
Take it already.

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,130
Come on, you want some or not?

33
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,970
Go ahead.

34
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,980
Man, you’re something else.

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,780
So, what now?

36
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,200
You’re really going to take all this?

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,750
But didn’t you say you didn’t like Rose’s stuff?

38
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,800
Now you’re suddenly all fancy, wanting everything.

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,829
Well, I used to be a rich kid, didn’t I?

40
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,640
You forgot?

41
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,360
Yeah, so what’s next?

42
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,720
I guess I have to go back and work with Rose,

43
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,350
like I agreed with Boss.

44
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,510
How long is this going to last?

45
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,770
Probably until Boss changes his mind.

46
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,890
Right now, I’m not staying with him as an employee.

47
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,000
I’m staying as his adopted son.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It’s not going to be easy to leave.

49
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,810
Adopted son?

50
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,600
That’s right.

51
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,550
What do you mean?

52
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,390
You stop right there.

53
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,650
Didn’t you promise me

54
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,650
you wouldn’t do anything stupid to help me again?

55
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,880
You’re not forgetting, right?

56
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,000
What’s this promise you two made?

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Nothing, Grandma!
Nothing at all, Grandma!

58
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
Careful, Grandma.
Take it easy.

59
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,000
Surprise!
Surprise!

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Welcome home, Grandma.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,720
Thank you, everyone.

62
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,690
Wait a second, what are you all up to?

63
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,290
My grandma just recovered from an illness.

64
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,720
She might have a heart attack and end up back in the hospital.

65
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,210
Oh, please, I'm not going to get scared over something like this.

66
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,400
Come on.

67
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,720
Wow, surprise!

68
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,400
Happy birthday Jack.

69
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,000
I didn’t get you a present this year.

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,690
Hope you don’t mind.

71
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,170
Come here, Grandma.

72
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,220
No worries at all.

73
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,510
Just having you healthy

74
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,990
is the best gift for me.

75
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,080
Come, let me give you a hug.

76
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
Whoa, you almost hit my face.

77
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,810
Hoy!
What’s up with you?

78
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,120
It’s Jack’s birthday?

79
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,560
I'm surprised for real.

80
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Yeah, but you don't need to make that face.

81
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,170
It’s not that big of a deal.

82
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,100
Not a big deal?

83
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,350
You’re the big brother of the gang, you know?

84
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,400
We gotta make it special, since it’s your birthday.

85
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,420
Here, I’ll make birthday fireworks for you.

86
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,110
How about a cool jacket from me?

87
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,810
Don’t borrow money from me to buy him a jacket.

88
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,400
I’ll knit one myself, but I probably won’t finish in time.

89
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,300
So let me make you a knitted hat for now.

90
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,000
I don’t know how to make anything.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,400
And I’m broke.

92
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,280
I’ll just come for the food.

93
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,840
For you, I’ve got an idea.

94
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,210
How about you clean up everything after the party?

95
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,210
That’s what you’re good at, and it’s easy too.

96
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,950
Okay, okay.

97
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,190
Whoa, why do I feel so exhausted already?

98
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,900
I’ll make some food and some chive cakes for later.

99
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
You all better be quick about it.

100
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,730
Okay?

101
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,700
Where are you going today?

102
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,640
Oh, I’ve got an important appointment.

103
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,460
(What's the important appointment?)
(Don’t ask.)

104
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Yes, Rose.

105
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,120
That’s right.

106
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,870
I’ll meet you there.

107
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,000
It’s a really important meeting.

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,560
Rose is quite something, huh?

109
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,630
Even on his birthday, she makes him go see her.

110
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,120
I’ll wait for you to blow out the candles together.

111
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,710
Yeah.

112
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,159
Wait for me.

113
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,220
After Lompran lost to Jack,

114
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,810
he never bothered me again.

115
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,360
Everything went smoothly, right?

116
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,440
Ever since I became close with Jack,

117
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,560
things have improved a lot.

118
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,340
Oh my god, Nang! I totally forgot!

119
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,300
What should I do? Help me!
What’s going on?

120
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,300
Today’s Jack’s birthday!

121
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,080
So what now?

122
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,330
Right?

123
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,340
What should we do?

124
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,280
I want to throw a birthday party for Jack.

125
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,520
Or maybe take him on a private jet to dinner in France?

126
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,080
Or take him up the mountain to teach underprivileged kids?

127
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,720
Maybe let Jack choose himself?

128
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,160
Maybe let Jack choose himself?

129
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,210
But then it wouldn’t be a surprise!

130
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,000
Help me figure out ,

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,110
what I should do

132
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,070
so Jack and I can have a happy ending.

133
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,760
Close your eyes and make a wish, Rose.

134
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,050
Close my eyes and wish, okay.

135
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,120
Done yet?

136
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Just a moment.

137
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,210
Okay?

138
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,400
Don’t rush me.

139
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Okay, I’m done now.

140
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,920
You got the Hierophant card.

141
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,320
Huh, really?

142
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,680
You know what that means, right?

143
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
No idea.

144
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,510
What does it mean?

145
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,770
It means agreement,

146
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,770
unity,

147
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,920
or marriage.

148
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,630
Are you serious?

149
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,610
Marriage?

150
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,460
Am I really going to marry Jack?

151
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,000
Well, if it’s about that…

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,600
I suggest this.

153
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,200
How about you throw a dinner party at home?

154
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,960
Invite Jack and family members.

155
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,170
Since it’s a surprise, why not invite the Four Horsemen too?

156
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,500
Then maybe propose to him.

157
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,480
Okay!

158
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,000
Thanks so much!

159
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,360
I’ll send someone to help.

160
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,760
Sure.

161
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,720
Please excuse me.

162
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,750
Okay.

163
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,010
I’m going to get married.

164
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,540
Sorry I’m late.

165
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,270
I totally forgot the appointment.

166
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,030
What’s Joke like?

167
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,340
Joke?

168
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,610
You know Joke?

169
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,030
Yeah, he’s a thief who doesn’t like stealing much.

170
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,160
Not a bad guy at all.

171
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:25,160
He’s fun to talk to, loves his freedom, unpredictable.

172
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,100
He can be a little reckless and foolish,

173
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,340
but he’s very determined.

174
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:38,130
That’s the kind of person who can take care of everything here.

175
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,190
Is Joke going to be a housekeeper?

176
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
You’re as funny as ever.

177
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,840
Here, I’m giving you three cards for your friends.

178
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,000
This one’s for Joke.

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,440
This one’s for Tattoo.

180
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,320
And this one’s for Arun.

181
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,800
You remember, right?

182
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,470
Yeah, I remember.

183
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,640
And what about me?

184
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,640
Don’t I get one?

185
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,030
Here’s yours.

186
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,500
The Star.

187
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,770
So I’m going to compete in The Star?

188
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,240
If you don’t want to, you don’t have to.

189
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
If it’s going to make you that upset,

190
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,090
the birthday boy wouldn’t want that.

191
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,050
I’ve already finished Jack’s gift.

192
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,430
But what I’m working on now is just making money.

193
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,350
So I can pay off my mom’s debt.

194
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,110
I’m just taking trash and turning it into more trash.

195
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,130
Hopefully, it’ll be worth something more.

196
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,130
But in the end, it’s still trash.

197
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
Hey, calm down.

198
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,680
Your creation, it’s actually pretty cool.

199
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,030
If it’s good, it’ll sell, right?

200
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,220
That’s not the point.

201
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,830
Even if something is amazing,

202
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,430
if they don’t want it, they won’t buy it.

203
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,480
Your creation might be a little weird,

204
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,480
but I think it’s awesome.

205
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:13,410
If you spruce it up a bit,

206
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,220
I bet it’ll sell.

207
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:23,860
Compared to all the items I’ve designed,

208
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,810
yours is the most creative by far.

209
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,670
If I had your mind,

210
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:46,920
I wouldn’t get bullied for being a copycat.

211
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,780
I miss my dad.

212
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,110
What’s up with you?

213
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,700
One minute, four emotions.

214
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,880
I’m really starting to not understand you.

215
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,650
Hey,

216
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,200
hey, stop it…

217
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,530
Don’t cry!

218
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,750
Stop crying already.

219
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,530
Can you hear me?

220
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,300
Hold it in, hold it in.

221
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,220
Hey, Tattoo, why are you picking on Arun?

222
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Just talk it out, man.

223
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,510
What? What did I do?

224
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,600
I didn’t do anything.

225
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,960
All I did was touch him, and he started crying.

226
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,250
Arun, what’s going on?

227
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,370
If something’s wrong, you can tell us.

228
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,930
I think this is getting out of hand.

229
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,700
Alright, alright, move.

230
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,660
Move over.

231
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,960
What?

232
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,290
Don’t comfort him, just let him be.

233
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,810
He’ll calm down by himself.

234
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Stop crying.

235
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Count to one.

236
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,470
Count to two.

237
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,440
There.

238
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,320
That’s it.

239
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,020
And you, what’s up?

240
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,190
Oh, did you see Joke?

241
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,610
Just in the morning.

242
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,740
Passed by him but didn’t talk.

243
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,720
I’ve got something for you guys.

244
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,240
What is it?

245
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,820
Nang said for we have to wait for everyone to show up.

246
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,980
then I can give it out.

247
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,650
Let me go find Joke first.

248
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,220
Hey, hey, come here.

249
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,000
What is it?

250
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,740
I don't get it.

251
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,900
It’s just cards, right?

252
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,950
Free fortune-telling delivered to your house like this?

253
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,000
You’re becoming more like Aunt Jeab every day.

254
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,609
Yeah, I’m your mom now, have you bowed to me yet?

255
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,030
Bow? Bow to you?

256
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,470
I don’t see anything strange here.

257
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,520
Thank you.

258
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,440
Um, Miss Rose?

259
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,580
May I ask you something?

260
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,680
What is it?

261
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,000
Today is a special day for me.

262
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,320
I’m happy to be with you, Rose.

263
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:22,340
And please don’t be shocked by what I’m about to ask.

264
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,580
Oh my, am I really going to marry Jack?

265
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,310
So soon?

266
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,990
Okay then.

267
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,010
If you aren't ready, I can wait.

268
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,010
Oh, it’s fine.

269
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,940
But what are you going to ask?

270
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,330
I’d like to...

271
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,600
I’d like to go home first.

272
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,450
Oh, go home?

273
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,800
You’re not staying to have dinner?

274
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,280
I’ve already made plans with friends and my grandma

275
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
to have dinner together.

276
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,400
Okay.

277
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,860
Go spend time with the important people.

278
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
I understand.

279
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,590
But tomorrow morning, I’ll come see you right away.

280
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,730
Oh, it’s alright.

281
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,730
No problem at all.

282
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,590
Hello, Butler?

283
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,380
Cancel everything for today.

284
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,680
Everything, the private chef, organizing team,

285
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,240
security, all of it.

286
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,000
Miss Rose?

287
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:09,550
Me and my dad will call to apologize to Four Horsemen.

288
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,120
Since the host isn’t coming, who would we arrange this for?

289
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,270
Miss Rose, no need to cancel.

290
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,790
I’ll stay and have dinner with you.

291
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,600
Really?

292
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,920
Really.

293
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,760
Okay.

294
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,400
One moment.

295
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,590
No need to cancel anymore, I misunderstood.

296
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,630
Thank you.

297
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:13,060
(Jack: I might not make it back in time for the cake.)
(Jack: Tell Grandma for me.)

298
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,120
(Joke: No problem, I might be late too.)

299
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,400
(Five hours earlier)

300
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,210
I’m full now.

301
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,640
Just one last bite, one last bite.

302
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,770
I'm full, you all eat slowly.

303
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,770
Let me take you upstairs to rest.

304
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,570
Okay.

305
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,410
Rest well, Grandma.

306
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,020
Alright.

307
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,390
Rest well, Grandma.

308
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,410
Alright.

309
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,360
When you’re done eating, wash the dishes.

310
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,850
Huh?

311
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,320
Oh, I just remembered that Toi Ting has homework.

312
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,800
It’s physics, I’ll help out.

313
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Let’s go.

314
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,150
Huh?

315
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,480
I don't know how to do the dished.

316
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,220
Please wash them.

317
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,800
Huh?

318
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
What? Hey?

319
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,320
Me, again?

320
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Take it slow, Grandma.

321
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,630
Take a nap first, Grandma,

322
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,990
then cook later.

323
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,280
Oh, I thought you’d help me cook.

324
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh, Grandma, I have other things to do.

325
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,090
It’s alright, I was just joking.

326
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,970
I haven’t cooked in a long time.

327
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,370
I’ll show you my skills, cooking ten things at once.

328
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:54,590
Ten things at once, Grandma? I’ll explode from eating so much!

329
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,280
Are you mocking me?

330
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,820
Oh, Grandma, are you upset?

331
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,480
Grandma?

332
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,250
She fell asleep too fast.

333
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,990
It’s okay,

334
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,910
I wanted you to pour me a drink.

335
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,980
I heard you’re a waiter at a bar.

336
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,960
I didn’t expect Boss to be a fan of mine too.

337
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,910
It’s an honor.

338
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,000
I made sure Jack wouldn’t mess with you.

339
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,280
But in the end, you found a way to mess with him.

340
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,260
You and Jack’s friendship is really unbreakable.

341
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:15,840
If you know this, can you let Jack go?

342
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,510
As for Grandma’s hospital bills,

343
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,870
I’ll handle the rest.

344
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:34,730
Do you know how much I paid to get this picture?

345
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:41,640
Sorry, I didn’t come to discuss anything else.

346
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:46,330
A bird spreading its wings and flying freely in the sky.

347
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,760
Do you understand the meaning of that?

348
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,750
Because I’ve never understood that feeling myself.

349
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,050
The marriage between Rose and Jack is the only way.

350
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:07,180
Jack’s adoptive father will get everything.

351
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,450
I won’t let anyone get in the way of my plan.

352
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,750
Is this really the only way?

353
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,360
Isn’t there any other way I can help Jack?

354
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,920
What if there’s another way?

355
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,600
There’s something important to this marriage.

356
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,140
Would you steal it for me,

357
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,420
knowing it’s a risk to your life?

358
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,790
If it would buy Jack his freedom,

359
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,370
just tell me.

360
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,570
We might have to cut the power.

361
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,750
What are you doing here?

362
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:26,280
I’m an electrician, I came to fix the building’s power.

363
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,280
I was just looking at the plans to make it easier to fix.

364
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,780
But no one lives here.

365
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,010
I come up here to smoke all the time.

366
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,100
Come on, after all I’ve said, you still don’t believe me?

367
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,910
Please, don’t make me use force.

368
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,560
Ow, that really hurts!

369
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,400
I punched you this hard, and you’re not hurt at all?

370
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,720
You want to get hurt?

371
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,450
If you want to get hurt, it has to be like this.

372
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,960
I’m putting in so much effort, at least be hurt a little.

373
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,870
Let go.

374
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,520
Let go!

375
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,170
Hey, what’s that?

376
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,840
What did you spray?

377
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,430
A new, stronger formula.

378
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,720
Just one more to do the trick.

379
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Hey, are you okay?

380
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,330
My hand almost broke.

381
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,820
But how did you guys get here?

382
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,910
It wasn’t hard to figure out, whenever Jack is somewhere,

383
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,910
you’re probably nearby.

384
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,730
And this place gives the best view of Jack,

385
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,520
so we came.

386
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,330
Miss Nang asked us to give you this, it’s for you.

387
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,380
What does "The Fool" mean?

388
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,880
A dumb person.

389
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,610
Huh?

390
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,560
Oh man, just because I don’t speak English, you call me dumb?

391
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,100
Yeah, you’re a bully.

392
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,480
It means dumb, you dumbass!

393
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,400
Oh.

394
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,450
Didn’t even know that much.

395
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,430
Miss Nang said it must be given together, never separated.

396
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
I don’t think there’s anything strange about it.

397
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
As for my fortune,

398
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,450
I’ll be "The Star."

399
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,240
Oh man, stop being superstitious.

400
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,010
Focus on what we’re doing.

401
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,660
So, what do you need us to help with?

402
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,920
Just tell us, and we’ll help.

403
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,510
Nothing, you guys should go back.

404
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,350
This mission is too dangerous.

405
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,700
If we mess up, we could all die.

406
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,820
Die?
Die?

407
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,600
What could go wrong?

408
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,190
We’re the Three Little Pigs team, right?

409
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,080
Four.

410
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,590
I won’t get to be "The Star," huh?

411
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,720
Four it is then.

412
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,140
The Four Little Pigs team, nothing’s impossible for us.

413
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,560
We’re so strong together.

414
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,480
Yeah.

415
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,340
Joke, if we hadn’t come to help, you’d have been dead long ago.

416
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,190
True.

417
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,190
Thanks a lot, guys.

418
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,560
So, no matter what, we’ll do this together.

419
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,240
This will be our last mission.

420
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,630
Then I need a name for the mission.

421
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,240
Mission Possible: Bring babes back!

422
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,920
Oh, Joke, you have terrible taste in names.

423
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,440
If you have kids in the future,

424
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,240
please let someone else name them.

425
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,470
Great taste, my ass, idiot.

426
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,070
Don’t complain.

427
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,550
Yeah, what are we doing again?

428
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,890
We’re going to rob Rose’s house.

429
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,010
For real?

430
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,410
Hey, I’m scared to die!

431
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,530
Watch closely.

432
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,520
Hey, where are you going?

433
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,240
Oh, I’m delivering ingredients.

434
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,280
You’re late today.

435
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,350
Traffic was bad.

436
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,120
Alright, go inside, you know the way?

437
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,440
I remember.

438
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,610
Well, hurry up then!

439
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,250
Hey, can you help me out? It’s stuck.

440
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Late and causing trouble.

441
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,660
You guys ready? I’m inside.

442
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,960
Ready.

443
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,730
But I’m not ready.

444
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,520
Are you guys serious?

445
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,100
I think this is too dangerous, we should bail.

446
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:12,150
Hoy, your job is the easiest, just sit still.

447
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,820
Man, stop being a coward.

448
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,750
I’m heading into the kitchen now.

449
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,910
Man, I’m just sitting here,

450
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,110
but Joke’s sitting here doing nothing too.

451
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,770
Yeah, is he even there?

452
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,690
I’m in here.

453
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,390
Sorry for saying your job was easy.

454
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,540
You’re late, acting like a guest at the party.

455
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,610
Well, it’s just...

456
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,360
Good thing it didn’t lose its cool.

457
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,180
Hey, grab this box.

458
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,550
These river prawns are pretty decent this time, nice size.

459
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,550
Take this box too, hurry.

460
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,840
This is the last box.

461
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,750
Let me check what’s in this box.

462
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,000
What’s this?

463
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,080
Blackchin Tilapia fish.

464
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,530
I know!

465
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:35,990
I mean, why are you delivering this?

466
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,890
I ordered salmon.

467
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,240
Do rich people eat blackchin tilapia fish?

468
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,360
I didn’t know, I’m just the delivery guy.

469
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,480
Take it back and bring me salmon.

470
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
I'm giving you fifteen minutes.

471
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,760
Never missed before, and now you mess up big time.

472
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,320
You’re getting a complaint from me.

473
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,400
Get going.

474
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,160
Hurry and clean that, we’re late.

475
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,950
Check the meat.

476
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,540
Oh man, the heat’s too high.

477
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,380
Oh, blackchin tilapia fish, huh?

478
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,639
Well done, Two.

479
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,449
Now for the real mission.

480
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:31,850
Our target is in the main mansion,

481
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,639
inside Rose’s dad’s office.

482
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,409
If you’re standing where you are,

483
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:41,820
go straight, then turn left at the lion statue.

484
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,969
It's a dead end.

485
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,739
Is it left or right?

486
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,260
It's not there? It should be.

487
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,989
Geez, could you focus?

488
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,960
I told you to bail.

489
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,140
This is my karma, having stupid friends like you guys.

490
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,210
Tattoo,

491
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:10,720
(you stay still and walk out smoothly.)

492
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,830
Okay, okay, I'll walk you back.

493
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,350
I found a lion statue, what do I do?

494
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,240
Did you find it? Good job, man.

495
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,310
Go straight to the room over there.

496
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,520
Did you get there? Why is it so easy?

497
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,520
Because I'm awesome.

498
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,730
Oh shit.

499
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,630
Shit!

500
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,210
It’s probably the room with the eagle statue on the upper floor.

501
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,210
Damn.

502
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,400
We're so done for.

503
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,300
We're dead, what should we do?

504
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,380
Tattoo, you go out first and I’ll handle the rest.

505
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,420
I just got lost, man.

506
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,930
Well then, I won’t trouble you any further.

507
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:22,700
I’ll be going now.

508
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,570
Wait.

509
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,740
I’ve seen you walking back and forth for a while now.

510
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,670
If you’re really a food delivery guy, why can’t you remember the way?

511
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,720
Damn.

512
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,190
Let me see your ID.

513
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,180
ID?

514
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,600
Here’s my keys, sir.

515
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
(And here’s my phone.)

516
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:05,800
It should be around here somewhere.

517
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,300
Seems like I don't have it.

518
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,910
Come on, I’ll take you out.

519
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,040
Thank you so much.

520
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
Hey, what’s going on?

521
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,810
Sorry, man.

522
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,380
It’s my fault, I almost ruined the plan.

523
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,000
It’s fine, we’re back on track now.

524
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,120
Which way next?

525
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,440
Sorry about that.

526
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,620
Almost messed up everything.

527
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,880
Just hold it in, get back to work.

528
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,800
Follow this path, at the end there’s an elevator.

529
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,290
Go up and you should find a statue with an eagle.

530
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:09,350
It’s the floor above, sorry again.

531
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,420
Alright.

532
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,760
(Are you sure about this, Arun?)

533
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,130
(Feels like I’m going in circles.)

534
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,410
Hey, I think I found it.

535
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,770
Yeah, that’s the room.

536
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,880
Are you sure? There aren’t any guards.

537
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,680
Exactly, is this even the right room or floor?

538
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,960
I don’t think it’s wrong.

539
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,650
Took you long enough, everyone’s been waiting, follow me.

540
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,020
Follow me.

541
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,120
Yes.

542
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,420
Hurry up.

543
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,090
Right away.

544
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,170
Please, enjoy your meal.

545
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Madam Trinuch was right.

546
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,940
Please, eat up.

547
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,340
I’ve prepared much more for you.

548
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,920
It's only once in a while that we get to have dinner at Raewat's place.

549
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,350
It’s very tasty.

550
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,680
Thank you so much.

551
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,690
Oh no.

552
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,000
Damn.

553
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,900
So the person who saved you was actually Jack?

554
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,390
What a twist of fate.

555
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,290
I’m really sorry that Rose couldn’t call back.

556
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,600
We were just as shocked by what happened.

557
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,730
Hope you don’t mind.

558
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,460
Yes sir.

559
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,040
You're back taking care of Rose again.

560
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,480
There's nothing to worry about our daughter.

561
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:30,440
Just as I was telling you earlier,

562
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,160
Jack missed out on the national team

563
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,880
because opportunities for the poor in this country are scarce,

564
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,500
and if the chance ever comes, I want to support this cause for real.

565
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,080
Good.

566
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,320
Jack already has a pilot project on this, actually.

567
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,640
Tell them about it.

568
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,030
Oh, yes, I actually have…

569
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,370
It’s fine, it’s fine.

570
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,440
When you’re in my position,

571
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,340
do whatever you want.

572
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,920
But today’s a birthday, let’s not get into serious stuff now.

573
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:11,510
Oh, it’s a special day, let’s toast.

574
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,690
Bring out the champagne.

575
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,670
Hey, what are you waiting for?

576
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,180
One moment, please.

577
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,460
Alright.

578
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:40,200
Arun, how does this open?

579
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,440
I don’t know either.

580
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,000
Usually, someone opens it for me.

581
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,870
Wow, you’re something else.

582
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:52,060
Shh, quiet, Joke’s concentrating.

583
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,340
(Alright.)

584
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,240
(When’s the champagne coming? I’m parched.)
(We’re waiting for the champagne.)

585
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,240
(So thirsty.)

586
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,360
Got it yet?

587
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,400
Ah!

588
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,950
What are you doing? Do you even know how?

589
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,070
Have you ever done this before?

590
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:26,880
Ah!

591
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,980
Damn.

592
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:33,290
I told you this was a bad idea.

593
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,840
I apologize.

594
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,340
How did this even happen?

595
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,360
I’m so sorry.

596
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,960
Wipe it up now.

597
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,840
My shoes are soaked, wipe it.

598
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,770
Clean it thoroughly.

599
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,670
No, sit down.

600
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,470
Quickly.

601
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,420
I apologize.

602
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,670
Usually, we train our staff well,

603
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:14,340
but accidents happen

604
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,610
no need to be upset.

605
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:16,520
Alright.

606
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,340
Excuse me, I’ll go change clothes

607
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,560
please continue enjoying the meal.

608
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:27,650
Oh, yes, I love it when champagne splashes on me

609
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:31,200
it’s refreshing, like a celebration or something.

610
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
Lovely, very nice.

611
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,330
Bring the cake in.

612
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:40,880
Happy birthday to you.

613
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,240
Happy birthday to you.

614
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,350
(Happy birthday.)

615
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,840
(Happy birthday.)

616
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:58,290
(Happy birthday to you.)

617
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,670
Hurry, Joke, it’s the last room down there.

618
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:06,870
I’m here, but there are so many buttons.

619
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,520
Hoy, you ready?

620
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,470
Wait, wait, I’m not ready.

621
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:13,000
Which one is for the second floor?

622
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,530
What words do you see?

623
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,860
Tell me.

624
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:20,610
Well, there’s Eagle.

625
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:24,520
There’s Dragon…

626
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,970
I can’t read it, I don’t know.

627
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,330
Hurry up, Hoy.

628
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,380
Damn, the guards are coming.

629
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,560
We’re running out of time.

630
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,630
Hoy, just pick one.

631
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,820
Damn, I’m choosing?

632
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,800
You’re letting me choose?

633
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,200
Make a wish.

634
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,010
Sure.

635
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,610
Damn.

636
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,300
Why did the lights all go out?

637
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,300
Doesn’t it seem strange?

638
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,450
It’s not strange, it’s just part of the birthday party.

639
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,710
They always go all out like this.

640
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,710
No need to worry.

641
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:30,600
Phones still work.

642
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,380
Power’s out.

643
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:43,180
Damn, that’s cool.

644
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,170
Oh, did someone make a mistake?

645
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,710
Rose?

646
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:10,830
Are you pulling a prank?
Not me.

647
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,280
Go check it out, see what happened.

648
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,130
Yes, sir.

649
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,440
We apologize.

650
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,520
Please wait a moment, we’re investigating.

651
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:23,390
No worries, we can keep drinking champagne.

652
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:25,000
Happy birthday.

653
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,640
Yes.

654
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:28,990
Actually, it adds to the atmosphere.

655
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,680
I’m inside.

656
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,410
I’m at the car, you guys.

657
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,890
I think I found another room.

658
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:12,640
I’ll check it out.

659
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,720
Guys, I found it.

660
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,400
Where, where? I want to see too.

661
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,400
I want to try it on.

662
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
(So, this is the ring my dad wanted.)

663
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,640
If I wear this, will everything I wish for come true?

664
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,640
Or should I keep the ring myself?

665
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,820
Then I’ll never be poor again.

666
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,040
I think I’ll give the ring to my dad.

667
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,940
He’ll be so happy.

668
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,440
I’d like to try it on too.

669
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,960
No, the ring is only for Jack.

670
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,800
Oh.

671
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,660
Happy birthday, man.

672
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,840
I hope you truly gain freedom from now on.

673
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:33,130
I think there’s a code to unlock it.

674
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,400
Damn, someone’s coming.

675
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,100
This is the ring my father just mentioned.

676
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,070
One day, when I get married,

677
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:10,270
this ring will belong to my husband

678
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:14,200
to use for developing communities, changing laws,

679
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,610
achieving equality,

680
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:19,420
everything he would want,

681
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:25,100
everything he wishes will come true with this ring.

682
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:33,470
I want you to have this ring.

683
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,070
Will you be my boyfriend?

684
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,920
Rose!! You!

685
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,330
Let him accept so it can all be over

686
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,330
and we can finally be comfortable.

687
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:03,770
No, Jack, if you go through with this, you’ll never be happy.

688
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,300
I’m honored you want it to be me.

689
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,070
And thank you very much

690
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:18,780
for inviting me for dinner.

691
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,740
Your mother and father

692
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:25,150
and relatives were so kind to me.

693
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,850
I never thought

694
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,970
my life could improve this much.

695
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,870
And it would only get better

696
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,840
if I could marry you, Rose.

697
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:53,160
But the truth is, I haven’t loved you at all.

698
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:03,800
I can’t keep lying to you any longer.

699
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,480
I've learned that

700
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:11,840
lying doesn’t bring happiness to a relationship.

701
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:18,680
I want to apologize to you.

702
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:25,080
And thank you for everything you’ve given me.

703
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:33,210
Did I pressure you too much? Was it too soon?

704
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:35,070
Do I need to change something?

705
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,960
I already have someone I like.

706
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:43,800
Okay.

707
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:51,920
Then can we still be friends?

708
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,090
Forever.

709
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:04,730
If you ever want to see me,

710
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:10,000
if you're ready to see me, just tell me.

711
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I’ll come to you, Rose.

712
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:19,960
I’ll see you off.

713
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,120
Please, go ahead.

714
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:23,870
Oops.

715
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:26,760
Rose, are you okay?

716
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:30,780
If I’m not okay, I’ll have to be okay.

717
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,160
It’s heartbreak.

718
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,090
At first, I wanted to mock her a little.

719
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,240
Damn, it’s a shame. Why didn’t she ask me instead?

720
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,740
What? It's kinda cute.

721
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:52,560
So, who does Jack like anyway?

722
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:57,740
Don’t worry about that, focus on this first.

723
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,320
Arun, do you know the code?

724
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,070
If I did, Rose wouldn’t have had a chance.

725
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,980
There are strange symbols everywhere.

726
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,560
I have no clue.

727
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:35,570
There’s a person, a circle, dots, and a star.

728
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,570
Do you think it’s part of the code?

729
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:43,820
Guys, I got it!

730
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,810
(I’m leaving these three cards with your friend.)

731
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,380
Joke, I think it’s the star symbol.

732
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,550
Okay.

733
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,050
Hey, it worked!

734
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,050
Hey!

735
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,480
Yes!

736
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,530
See? I told you!

737
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,080
I'm not dumb!

738
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,560
Shit! You’re not so stupid after all, Hoy.

739
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,230
You’re amazing.

740
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:39,440
The event’s over, but the fish dish hasn’t arrived. What happened?

741
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:44,240
Sir, there was a slight mishap with the supplier.

742
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,240
And why hasn’t the power been restored?

743
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:49,270
The whole event is ruined now.

744
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:50,520
Please calm down, Mr. Raewat.

745
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,060
Sir.

746
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,300
It looks like someone disguised as a waiter is inside the house.

747
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,300
Excuse me, excuse me.

748
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,160
The ring!

749
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,790
The ring is missing!

750
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,720
Close the house and don’t let anyone in or out.

751
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:09,820
Search everyone.

752
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:12,630
Every room, every person must be thoroughly checked.

753
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:16,880
Anyone acting suspiciously and uncooperative should be taken down on the spot.

754
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,600
Whoever dares to defy the Four Horsemen will face the consequences.

755
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:28,300
Damn.

756
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,870
I didn’t swipe anything this time.

757
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,480
I didn’t go off script at all.

758
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,480
I know, I took a bit too long in there,

759
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,480
(which delayed everything and blew the plan.)

760
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,560
They’re calling everyone for a headcount.

761
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,840
You’d better get changed quickly.

762
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,520
Too late to change.

763
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,470
There aren’t many guests here.

764
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,920
They’ll know I’m an outsider soon.

765
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,090
How are you going to escape?

766
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:53,680
Hoy, listen to me.

767
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,220
(If I don’t make it out in time,)

768
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,110
(I’ll leave the ring, )

769
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:00,820
and you can come get it later.

770
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,240
I’m counting on you.

771
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,170
Damn,

772
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,720
another tough mission for me.

773
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,690
Hey, they’re on the second floor!

774
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,750
Joke, damn it!

775
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,480
You two, check the room!

776
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,560
And you, follow me.

777
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,480
I’ll come to help you.

778
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,140
Tattoo, wait.

779
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:40,800
What?

780
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,830
Hold on.

781
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:44,050
Someone has to finish this mission.

782
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:46,480
If someone else gets caught, we’ll all fail.

783
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,510
Just wait.

784
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,290
Hello, Joke, get out of there!

785
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:55,000
I believe in you guys!

786
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,540
Hey, stop.

787
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,900
Stop!

788
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:24,470
Why did he tell us to stop?

789
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:25,230
No idea, boss.

790
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,820
Where did they go?

791
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:33,280
Hey, open the door!

792
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,050
Open it.

793
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:36,510
Open up!

794
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,810
Open the door!

795
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,370
I told you to open it!

796
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:41,910
Open the door!

797
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:42,830
Open up!

798
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,330
I said open the door!

799
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,330
Open the door!

800
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,970
Open the door!

801
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:49,990
I said open the door!

802
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,200
Open up!

803
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,360
I was waiting for you..

804
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:04,910
Is this all part of your plan?

805
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:08,400
Whoever’s inside, open the door!

806
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,520
Not convenient!

807
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,240
(Didn’t you hear me say open?)

808
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,680
Get inside and hide.

809
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,280
Go, quickly!

810
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:23,980
(Open the door!)

811
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,540
(I said open it!)

812
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,480
I told you it’s not convenient.

813
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:33,930
You didn't listen to me!!

814
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:37,310
Sorry, but the master’s ring is missing,

815
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,720
so I need to search everywhere.

816
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:41,360
Then go ahead and search.

817
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,490
There’s a suspicious person on the opposite building’s rooftop.

818
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,490
They could be the thief from the event.

819
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:54,530
Copy, sending a team over now.

820
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:55,340
Excuse me.

821
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,340
Hurry up.

822
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:07,920
Come out.

823
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,540
Why are you doing this?

824
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,330
(Hoy)

825
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,490
Come help carry the stuff, it’s all clear here.

826
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,640
Stop right there!

827
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:58,370
Hands up!

828
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,860
Oh.

829
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,080
We’ve been tricked.

830
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,420
Hey!

831
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,440
It still hasn't gone far.

832
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,980
Go after it

833
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,420
Joke, are you okay?

834
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,080
Still good, man.

835
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:58,120
Yay! Yay!
Yay!  Yay!

836
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,540
We’re unstoppable.

837
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:44,670
Boss,

838
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:49,660
I want to apologize…

839
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:53,870
For not being able to marry Rose.

840
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,110
I may seem ungrateful,

841
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:00,000
but can I withdraw?

842
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,910
As for my grandma’s medical debt,

843
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:07,630
if you want me back in debt collection,

844
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,240
I’m willing.

845
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:14,770
(It’s okay, you’ve done enough.)

846
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:18,260
(Go live the life you want now.)

847
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,400
Thank you very much.

848
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,310
You’re home late.

849
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:04,370
Did you work hard today?

850
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:07,570
Almost killed me.

851
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,190
Grandma says she can only cook one thing now.

852
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,250
I thought you’d bring some snacks.

853
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,080
Are you hungry? If you are, let’s order something.

854
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,010
You don't have to.

855
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:22,650
No, this is enough.

856
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:26,180
I’ll be right back.

857
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,720
Where are you going?

858
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,280
Bathroom.

859
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:41,240
Happy birthday to you.

860
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,790
Happy birthday to you.

861
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:49,650
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

862
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:53,840
Happy birthday to you.

863
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:57,440
Make a wish.

864
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:07,150
Actually, the wish I made

865
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,970
last time

866
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,990
already came true.

867
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:14,950
The boss let me resign.

868
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,170
Really, I actually resigned this time.

869
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:22,680
No way.

870
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,720
How?

871
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,570
Yeah, I was so surprised.

872
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:29,410
When it finally happens, it’s so easy.

873
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:35,830
But whatever. Now I don’t even know what to wish for.

874
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:37,370
Come on, make one for me.

875
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,800
I already made a wish.

876
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:50,400
And I think mine’s going to come true too.

877
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,130
So, shall we blow out the candles?

878
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:57,200
Together?

879
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,060
Yeah.

880
01:05:58,950 --> 01:05:59,450
Come on.

881
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:02,400
One.

882
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,400
Two.

883
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,880
You know what?

884
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:26,170
Rose asked me to be her boyfriend today.

885
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:42,480
And what did you say?

886
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,160
I turned her down.

887
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,680
I told her I already liked someone.

888
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:06,030
Let’s play truth or dare, like old times.

889
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:10,670
Okay.

890
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:19,290
Truth.

891
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:25,470
Who’s the person you like?

892
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:38,400
You.

893
01:07:58,130 --> 01:07:59,450
You’re such a cheat.

894
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,980
Dare.

895
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,600
Wanna be my boyfriend?

896
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:23,560
Yeah.

897
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:22,910
You’ve done enough.

898
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:26,250
Now go live the life you want.

899
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,399
(Thank you)

900
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,750
Yes.

901
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:51,800
You promised to set Jack free.

902
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:55,600
I hope you don’t go back on that.

903
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:00,840
Because if I could steal for you,

904
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:06,010
I could steal it back just as easily.

905
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:12,120
I may not have been the nicest businessman,

906
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:16,000
but I’ve always kept my promises.

907
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,470
Don’t worry.

908
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,840
I like you.

909
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,120
We should have met sooner.

910
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,400
Are you interested in working for me?

911
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:26,110
Yeah, it’s me.

912
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:27,420
(What’s up?)

913
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,960
You just got out of prison, right?

914
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:32,630
You’re unemployed.

915
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:39,300
I have a job for you. Good pay, easy work. Interested?

916
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,320
(What kind of work?)

917
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,550
Help clean up for me.

01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:45,810
(I was just looking for something fun to do lately.)

919
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,680
Hey, I want some milk.

920
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,000
Do I have a boyfriend or a kid?

921
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,960
What are you smiling for?

922
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,860
Well, my boyfriend is so cute, how can I not?

923
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:08,660
P' Joke! It's bad! Boss is having his minions hunt down the debtor in the shrine!

924
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,660
Tonight I'm going to hunt down all the evil debtors!

925
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,810
Get me all the people from Suphanimit who owe me money!

926
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,740
I'm going to go help the people at the shrine.

927
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:21,200
Hey, what's wrong? Why are you acting weird?

928
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,270
Yeah, something is wrong.

929
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:25,590
How many times can you forgive a person for their mistakes?
