This series is purely a work of fiction
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,410
So, what do you need us to help with?

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,650
What are we doing?

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,430
We're going to rob Rose's house.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,010
We’re the Three Little Pigs team, right?

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,030
Found it.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,610
I’m leaving these three cards with your friend.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,060
I think it’s the star symbol.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,270
Hey, it worked!

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,310
Happy Birthday to you.

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,970
Be my boyfriend?

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,400
Yeah.

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,040
So feisty.

14
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,250
You think I'm going let you lead?

15
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,590
Ow!!

16
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,170
Think we should quiet down a bit? My grandma might hear us.

17
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,479
Mhm.

18
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,910
Wait.

19
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:21,520
This time, let me do it.

20
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,760
Joke.

21
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,940
Have you ever thought about getting married?

22
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,380
Not really.

23
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,320
Probably because my family’s not that close.

24
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,640
So I never thought about having a family.

25
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,420
I wouldn’t know how to make it work.

26
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,900
You're overthinking it.

27
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,680
I think I’m just scared I’d be a bad dad.

28
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,250
Scared my kid would hate me.

29
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,460
Trust me, you won’t be like that.

30
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,270
I’ll be right back, bathroom break.

31
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,090
Alright.

32
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,000
Wait, what’s this?

33
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,270
Hoy left his cards here.

34
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:35,230
How did Hoy’s cards end up in your pocket?

35
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,600
He left them there, I guess. No idea.

36
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,860
Weren't you going to the bathroom?

37
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,760
Then I'll go instead.

38
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,650
Wait, I called dibs.

39
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,100
You promised you'd free Jack.

40
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,880
I hope you’re not going back on that.

41
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,440
Tasty?

42
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,200
So good.

43
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,460
Really?

44
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,840
This place sells out fast.

45
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,200
Oh, what did you order?

46
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,960
Pandan custard.

47
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,790
Hey, I’m craving milk.

48
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,670
Am I dating you or babysitting you?

49
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,130
Two fresh milk, please.

50
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,890
Make it cold.

51
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,730
Ooh, looks delicious.

52
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,170
Sis!

53
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,280
Where are you going?

54
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,260
Just getting some documents.

55
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,450
What documents?

56
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,950
Take a look.

57
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,190
Sure.

58
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,150
Should I sign this?

59
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,410
Yeah.
Um.

60
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,690
Can I not sign?

61
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,000
Nope.

62
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,919
No stalling.

63
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,440
Here?

64
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,429
Yep,

65
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,600
hurry up.

66
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,970
Sure.

67
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,760
Faster.

68
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,860
I’m going as fast as I can!

69
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,900
Here you go.

70
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,600
Let's go.

71
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,260
Where are we going?

72
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,270
Sis!

73
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:04,450
Would you mind staying out of others' business and focusing on ours for once?

74
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Old habits die hard, huh?

75
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,830
I forgot,

76
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,980
that I'm not a debt collector anymore.

77
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,030
How did you get so messy eating?

78
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,350
Not just today, but every day from now on,

79
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,350
I’m only interested in you.

80
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,310
Wow, you’re cheesy.

81
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,520
Look.

82
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,630
I made all these last night to hand out today.

83
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,630
You made them all? Last night?
Yep.

84
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,000
Well then, let me help you pass them out.

85
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,510
For everyone, guys!

86
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,860
Come on over, kids.

87
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,630
Just a sec.

88
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,800
Here you go, little one.

89
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,560
This side, hang on a sec.

90
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,760
Come on.
Okay.

91
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,560
There's Taekwondo classes, too.

92
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,020
Do you actually know Taekwondo?

93
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,550
Of course I do!

94
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,270
Show us something!

95
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,000
Come on, show the kids!

96
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,020
Alright.

97
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,910
Here we go.

98
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
Wow!

99
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,680
So cool!

100
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,000
Mom, I want to be like him!

101
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,970
I want to learn too!

102
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,710
Let’s start with a front kick.

103
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,080
Guard up,

104
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,320
left foot slightly forward, then snap it!

105
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,760
Fast, like bam!

106
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,230
Ready?

107
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,310
Let’s go.

108
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,580
Too high!

109
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,230
Yay!

110
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,320
Pretty good!

111
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,550
Anyone else want to try kicking?

112
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,920
Let’s do it, come on.

113
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,220
Left, right, then snap!

114
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,340
Something like that, but use your body to help.

115
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:34,690
I think we’re going to have a lot of people show up for our open house.

116
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,290
Definitely, with all thos flyers.

117
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,720
If that’s the case…

118
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,300
Hmm?

119
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,210
I'll take the last flyer

120
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,090
so I can keep it as a keepsake.

121
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,950
Go for it.

122
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,080
Why are you smiling?

123
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,850
With such a cute boyfriend, how can I not smile?

124
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,060
It’s not coming out, come closer.

125
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,930
It’s still not coming out.

126
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,780
I'm chessy?

127
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,780
And you're not?

128
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,160
What’s this?

129
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Hoy left his cards here.

130
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,410
Tonight, I'm taking down every single evil debtor.

131
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,580
Round up everyone in Suphanimit

132
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,140
who owes money, no matter who they are.

133
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,830
Whether they are merchants or beggars that won't pay their debts.

134
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,450
Get them all.

135
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,670
Yes, Boss.

136
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,630
No one’s standing in my way now.

137
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,480
You looked so stressed out.

138
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,330
You're not being sly, is there something wrong?

139
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,410
Boss made me draft a new contract.

140
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,950
From now on, debtors who can’t pay him back

141
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,480
will be forced to work for him.

142
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,630
Like slaves.

143
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,980
How much debt do you have left?

144
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,750
Two hundred thousand.

145
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,950
And if one day we disobey Boss,

146
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:16,290
he might use this contract against us.

147
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,510
I can't keep doing this anymore.

148
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,190
Do you want to take my money

149
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,260
to pay off your debt to him?

150
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,410
Then, just move away quickly.

151
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,070
But you want me to leave you here alone?

152
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:56,310
Besides, Boss has more power now,

153
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,710
even if we tried to escape,

154
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,240
we wouldn't get far.

155
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,380
It’s okay,

156
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,780
you have me.

157
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Everything will be alright.

158
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,720
What are you doing?

159
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,750
The holes don’t match at all.

160
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,890
You don't get art, huh?

161
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,680
Criticize all you want, why don’t you do it yourself?

162
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,200
Here, take over.

163
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,530
The brush is in your hands.

164
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,000
P’Jack.

165
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,579
What happened, Toi Ting?

166
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,500
(Gone to work upcountry. Sorry, be back soon.)

167
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,170
Dad doesn’t love me anymore, does he?

168
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,040
I don’t think he’ll come back.

169
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,800
I know.

170
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,570
I overheard him saying I’m a burden.

171
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,000
It's okay, Toi Ting, it's okay.

172
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,000
Maybe he just needs some time to rest.

173
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,770
In the meantime,

174
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,200
would you like to stay with us?

175
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:57,130
P’Jack and I will take care of you until your dad comes back, alright?

176
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,680
Don’t worry.

177
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,820
We won’t leave you.

178
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,840
No crying, okay?

179
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,750
How about I help look for your dad?

180
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,190
I’d rather be with someone who actually wants me around.

181
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,690
Then, how about staying with us?

182
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,550
Only if you’d like, of course.

183
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,980
You can stay with us.

184
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,920
Come on.

185
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,990
Don't cry.

186
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,020
Smile, you're a tough cookie.

187
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,020
Come help me draw this, maybe?

188
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,830
P’Jack isn’t very good at this.

189
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,340
Show off your skills.

190
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,910
Hey.

191
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Do you want to draw something?

192
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,160
It might even turn out better than P’Joke’s work.
Huh?

193
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,540
Try it here.

194
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,570
Wow!

195
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,030
You're smiling, are you having fun?

196
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,320
It looks great!

197
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,830
In that case, make ten of them!

198
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,830
Ten? I'll get you some more.

199
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,980
Left, left…

200
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,120
Which left?

201
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,720
My left, left.

202
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,410
My left.

203
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,670
So, my left is right.

204
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,040
Just like her mom used to be.

205
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,570
Lower the left side a bit.

206
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,480
Is it straight?

207
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,210
Lower the right side a bit.

208
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,670
Lower the right side a bit.

209
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,800
Alright?

210
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,960
Looks good.

211
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,910
Alright, I’m letting go.

212
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,560
Who came up with that?

213
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,560
That family trio of course.

214
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,650
(Determined, courageous, and fighting against debt.)

215
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,380
What’s that?

216
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,560
(Trainee teacher)

217
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,140
Trainee teacher

218
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,650
How is it?

219
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,820
Not bad.

220
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,990
What about mine?

221
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,880
Hoy.

222
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,620
Tou read it!

223
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,680
T "E" with "A" - Teacher.

224
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,210
So, it means knowledgeable, right?

225
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,690
You don’t have to say it so harshly!

226
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,040
I'm sad!

227
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,650
Fine, take it.

228
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,650
What a burden I’ve got.

229
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,140
Damn.

230
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,580
Hello, testing, testing…

231
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,610
Welcome to the Open House Learning Center.

232
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,070
The event starts now!

233
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,360
Not bad at all.

234
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,280
I think it sounds a bit ordinary, though.

235
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,160
I think it should be something like this.

236
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,320
Excuse me?

237
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,050
Congratulations to Jack.

238
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,030
Even though we're no longer together,

239
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:11,900
I’m genuinely happy for your success.

240
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,640
Fake.

241
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,870
Yes, but we’re still friends, aren’t we?

242
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,430
It hurts, but it’s okay. Today is your day.

243
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,430
Congratulations.

244
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,140
Friends! Let’s go to class, it’s time.

245
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,820
Kids, go sit in your assigned seats from the handout.

246
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,820
Yes, let’s go.

247
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,850
Come on, you’re with me.

248
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,780
Wait, where are we going?

249
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,660
To teach, of course.

250
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,480
To teach?

251
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,910
Yes.

252
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,050
Alright, kids, let's solve this problem together.

253
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,620
Find the GCD of forty and seventy-two.

254
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,760
I’ll give you a moment to try it.

255
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,630
Hey, can you cover for me? I need to use the restroom.

256
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,000
I don’t know what to do!

257
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,810
You can figure it out, this is simple.
I can’t do this at all.

258
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,620
Teacher, I finished!

259
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,280
Teacher, can you go over it? I couldn’t figure it out.

260
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,280
What’s the answer? I want to know.

261
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,980
Alright,

262
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,900
let’s wait for Teacher Jack to get back.

263
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,470
He’s taking forever in the bathroom, though.

264
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,500
Just answer!

265
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,770
Answer!

266
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:26,540
GCD is…

267
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,000
What is it, students?

268
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,450
Oh, so you don’t know either, Teacher?

269
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:48,250
Answer it!

270
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:54,490
The GCD of forty and seventy-two is eight.

271
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,260
Dad.

272
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,920
We can find the GCD easily

273
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,800
by breaking down numbers into prime factors.

274
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,810
Like for forty, it’s two to the power of three and five.

275
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,600
Oh.

276
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,310
How did you get here?

277
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,290
Go ask him yourself.

278
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:42,330
Hello, Doctor. I’m Jack.

279
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,890
I know you.

280
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,510
Nephew of Jern Wen, the debt collector.

281
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,290
Get to the point, I have a morning meeting.

282
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,330
I'd..

283
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,670
I’d like to invite you to our school’s open house,

284
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:07,280
my friend Joke and I run the school.

285
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,510
He even has a school now?

286
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,320
Why didn’t he invite me himself?

287
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,470
Sir,

288
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,190
Joke respects you a lot.

289
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,740
All this time he hasn’t come home,

290
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,760
it’s not because he didn’t want to,

291
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
he misses home so much.

292
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:41,140
But he fears you won’t welcome him.

293
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,790
You have no idea how much he misses home.

294
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,200
Father?

295
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,040
Joke is very talented, sir.

296
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:59,670
He’s become a pillar for our community at Suphanimit.

297
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,540
All I ask

298
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:09,210
is for the person Joke respects the most

299
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,060
to witness his success.

300
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:20,290
Would you be able to forgive him for his past?

301
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,270
Could you put it behind you?

302
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,420
It’s too late.

303
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:43,990
It’s never too late, unless we’re dead.

304
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:49,270
Thank you for considering it, sir.

305
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,460
Alright, kids, we’re off to craft class with Teacher Tattoo.

306
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,380
Yay!
Come on, line up!

307
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Come on, follow me.

308
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,680
Thanks, Dad, though I can’t solve just this one.

309
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,120
Come eat with us on Sunday.

310
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,460
In that case, Dad, you’ll have to invite me and maybe I’ll come.

311
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,570
Alright, I’m inviting you.

312
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,850
You’re amazing.

313
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:08,540
Even though I haven’t been the father I should be,

314
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:15,130
you’ve come this far, I think I should be the one apologizing.

315
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:26,480
That’s enough, we both did the best we could.

316
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,470
There’s no need for apologies anymore.

317
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,120
So, when are you coming home?

318
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:49,800
P’Joke, let’s go get some snacks, someone even bought us ice cream.

319
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
Really?

320
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,890
Uncle, come with us for some treats?

321
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,460
Uncle?

322
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,280
Am I old enough to be called uncle?

323
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,050
Actually, Toi Ting is like a daughter to me and my boyfriend.

324
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,340
We plan to adopt her since her father isn’t around.

325
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:17,700
So, Toi Ting is like your granddaughter.

326
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,960
Boyfriend...

327
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:27,910
Good thing I came today, I learned alot of new things so thanks for sharing.

328
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,140
Bring your boyfriend to visit me sometime.

329
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,020
Oh, Toi Ting.

330
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,590
Let’s go outside.

331
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,850
Let’s let them talk.

332
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,550
Come on.

333
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,320
My boyfriend is standing right here in front of you, Dad.

334
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
This is my family.

335
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,000
To the life we started together.

336
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,470
To turmoil that saw us as a prey.

337
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,720
To the moments of retribution,

338
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,620
and to the blood ties that refuse to break.

339
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,680
Let me ask you something.

340
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,000
Why did you help Rose,

341
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,050
the child of the person who killed our parents? Was that part of your plan?

342
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,010
Are you actually thinking of betraying your own blood

343
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,010
and going back to bow down to them?

344
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,770
I'm warning you one last time,

345
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,770
only because of our sibling bond.

346
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,790
You're attacking the wrong enemy.

347
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,840
I'm giving you one last chance to think it over.

348
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,370
If you're not standing with me,

349
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,920
then you're standing against me.

350
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:58,560
And here’s our water bottle rocket, but the final step to launch it is

351
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,380
we have to pressurize it by pumping air like this.

352
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,640
Whoa!

353
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,210
Wait, wait, it might break!

354
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,830
Let me pump slowly like this.

355
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,400
Keep pumping.

356
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,429
(Joke: Thanks for coming, everyone.)

357
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,969
(That’s enough! Enough!)

358
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:28,100
(You want to use the restroom first?)

359
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,400
Now we’re just left with the release part.

360
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,239
We’ll pull this string here.

361
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,090
It's all tight now.

362
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:51,650
For the first launch, I’ll let Arun release it.

363
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,010
Me?

364
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,440
Do it for the kids to see.

365
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,429
No way.

366
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,139
It’s educational!

367
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:57,850
No way.

368
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,600
Yes!

369
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,280
Yes?
Yes.

370
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,650
Yes.

371
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,380
Show the kids, come on.

372
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,670
Quickly, come on!

373
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,580
Quickly!

374
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,950
Let’s count together, okay?

375
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,590
Go!

376
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:19,540
Five, four, three, two, one!

377
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,800
Whoa!

378
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,820
So funny!

379
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,900
What?

380
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,330
Wait, who's messaging?

381
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,260
Jack, my project office got thrashed.

382
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,260
What should we do?

383
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,400
Those cheaters, come out!

384
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,330
Cheaters, come out!
Come out quickly, are you going to not pay?

385
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,040
Come out!
Come on!

386
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,010
How can you just seize the place like that? Come on out!

387
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,960
Yes, exactly!

388
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,680
Come out now!

389
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,460
What should we do?

390
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,810
Come on, are you going to cheat us out of the money?

391
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,650
Come out now!

392
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,620
It’s alright, Rose.

393
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah, everyone’s here, we’ll work it out together.

394
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,760
Okay.

395
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,230
I think I can hold up.

396
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:23,790
Yeah.

397
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,430
Yep.

398
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,990
You guys.

399
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,510
Scissors.

400
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,280
Use the scissors to cut it.

401
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,960
I need to get reinforcements to help P' Nang right now.

402
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
Boss and the others are with her at the shrine.

403
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:51,990
I’ll be right back.

404
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:53,690
Huh?

405
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,340
Come on, let's do it together.

406
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,400
So, what are you going to do now?

407
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,930
Everything that's happening is probably because I got out of prison and came here.

408
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,800
Are you overthinking this?

409
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,050
Guys, I'm going to help the people at the shrine..

410
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,000
Boss is probably going to go full force.

411
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,490
But if anyone doesn’t want to come,

412
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,490
you don't have to.

413
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:29,800
Are you coming? I’m going.

414
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,520
Let go.

415
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,750
We're all going.

416
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,840
You too.

417
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:49,330
Alright, let's split into two teams.

418
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,330
Jack and Rose, go help the people at the project office.

419
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,070
The rest of you come with me to the shrine.

420
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,290
Okay.

421
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,170
Let's go.

422
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Alright, that’s the plan.

423
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
I'm going with you.

424
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:16,120
I think it's a bit dangerous, stay here.

425
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,770
Dad's gone, and now you’re going too?

426
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,130
Let me handle it this time.

427
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,040
Promise you'll come back.

428
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:36,150
Promise that even as a ghost, I'll still return.

429
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,080
You’re so ridiculous, P' Joke!

430
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,910
Toi Ting, if anything happens,

431
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,850
go to Uncle Suthi, don't go to anyone else.

432
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,930
P' Joke, you’re the worst!

433
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,830
I’m not speaking to you anymore.

434
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,240
Let’s go.

435
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,550
Hey, wait.

436
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,480
Is something up?

437
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,600
You’re acting strange.

438
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,520
There is.

439
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,030
What is it?

440
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,910
If someone made a mistake,

441
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,290
how many times would you forgive them?

442
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,590
What are you doing?

443
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,400
I trust you.

444
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,120
Whenever you want to tell me,

445
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,600
we’ll talk then.

446
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,890
Jack.

447
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,120
I love you.

448
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,400
Yeah, I love you too.

449
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,270
Come on.

450
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,290
Let’s go, everyone.

451
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,370
Okay.

452
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:24,000
Hey Joke, does Jack know that we returned the ring to Boss?

453
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,350
That it’s giving him powers like Thanos?

454
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,590
Not yet.

455
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,230
What should we do?

456
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,180
I feel terrible about it.

457
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,230
But the next time I see Jack, I think I’ll tell him.

458
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,010
Why tell him?

459
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,880
Some secrets are okay to keep.

460
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,090
Otherwise, we might just end up fighting again.

461
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:50,940
Seriously, or P' Jack will definitely kill us.

462
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,980
I actually agree with them.

463
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,360
It was so hard for you to end up with each other in the first place.

464
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,680
I used to think like that, too.

465
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,370
But trying to survive by lying

466
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,920
has messed up my life enough.

467
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:20,200
If I’m going to start over, I’d rather do it honestly.

468
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,910
You cheats!

469
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,400
Give us our money back!
Return the money!

470
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,140
Calm down!

471
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,900
I didn’t take it!

472
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,210
Didn’t take it, I swear!

473
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,930
Alright, it’ll be returned, I promise.

474
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,200
Hey, you cheats, give us our money back now!

475
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,540
Don’t do this, you cheats!

476
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,670
Wait, wait!

477
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,350
Everyone!

478
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,420
How could you steal money like this?

479
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,040
Listen, please.

480
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,000
Calm down!

481
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,860
Save, what happened?

482
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:07,440
The money I withdrew to pay the people in the project

483
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,290
it looks like someone stole it.

484
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,720
Alright, everyone, there's no need to worry right now.

485
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,500
I will transfer the money to everyone by midnight tonight.

486
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
So you can be at ease for now.

487
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,020
Are we really going to get it?

488
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,100
Is it for real?
Is she just saying that?

489
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:28,020
She should give us the money, rich people love to deceive and it’s happened too many times already.

490
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,700
Yeah, that's true.
Right.

491
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,770
Everyone, please.

492
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:36,130
I will definitely transfer it, but for now, feel free to go have tea at the coffee shop.

493
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:39,760
It's free, I'm treating to make up for the late transfer.

494
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,430
What should we do?

495
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,490
It’s better than getting nothing, right?
Let's try trusting her this time.

496
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,310
Order whatever you want. Go on, go.

497
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,920
If I don’t get it, I’ll be back.

498
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,880
I’ll give her one more chance.

499
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,840
My house was just robbed.

500
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,400
Do you think it’s related?

501
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,860
Or could it be one of my father's enemies?

502
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,440
Or maybe one of Boss's men?

503
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,560
Because Boss would lose the most if Rose’s project succeeds.

504
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,730
Besides, Boss has been acting untouchable lately, with no fear of anyone.

505
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,640
I think it must be Boss's people who stole Rose's father's ring.

506
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,180
But I checked everyone’s background

507
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,470
and found no one with a history of working for Boss.

508
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,910
So how could they steal from me?

509
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,360
Hey, I heard from the locals that lately,

510
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,140
the thief Joker has been active again.

511
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,440
Maybe…

512
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,140
Could everything that’s happened be related to that thief?

513
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,220
But isn’t that Joke?

514
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:55,780
And if Joke really did it, what should we do?

515
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,710
We might have to kill him.

516
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,570
But I don’t think it’s him.

517
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:11,730
He’s really changed, he’s turned his life around.

518
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:24,840
Hey!

519
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,460
Sis!

520
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,290
Who is it?

521
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,990
Sis!
What's happening?

522
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,320
Look, Sis Oh fell down to her death.

523
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,870
How did she fall?

524
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,480
She fell from the top floor and landed in a pool of blood. Is she dead?

525
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,150
Call an ambulance!

526
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,220
Quickly, call an ambulance!

527
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,660
How did she get into so much debt with Boss?

528
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,670
She made so much money from the Four Horsemen game earlier.

529
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,670
Even if she borrowed money to expand the shop,

530
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,830
she shouldn’t be in this much debt.

531
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,690
It's...

532
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:12,820
It’s because of me again.

533
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:20,000
Boss told us to trick her into investing all her savings in a failing stock.

534
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,320
So she’d have no money to pay Boss back.

535
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:27,720
Sis Oh had to die because of me.

536
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:31,590
Don’t think about it, don’t even mention it.

537
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:39,380
It’s all written out with detailed financials.

538
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:44,390
Wait, there's even a depreciation rate on the collateral per year.

539
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:47,430
Boss couldn’t have done all this alone.

540
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,110
Many parts of this contract

541
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:12,250
match what you advised me on exactly.

542
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,640
Damn.

543
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,410
Have you been helping him with everything all along?

544
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:25,410
Save, answer me!!

545
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,780
And my grandma… do you know anything?

546
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:33,450
Do you know about my grandma?

547
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,700
Hey!

548
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,870
Answer me!

549
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,400
What’s your problem with him?

550
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,360
If you’re that mad, take it out on me.

551
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,930
So you knew everything with him, too?

552
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,710
Did you know what he did?

553
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,650
You bastard.

554
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,650
Damn it.

555
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:57,020
Jack, stop.

556
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:57,720
Jack.

557
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,880
Jack, stop.

558
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,450
Jack, please.

559
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:02,950
Damn it.

560
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,880
Damn it!

561
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,040
And do you know how much debt Save has with Boss?

562
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,260
He doesn't have a choice, just like us.

563
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,810
If you don’t want him to die,

564
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,820
don’t let me see this bastard’s face again.

565
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,330
And stay away from my grandma!!

566
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,690
Everyone, please, I’d like to ask all of us,

567
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:57,370
let’s fight Boss together because he has oppressed us enough already.

568
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:01,620
He’s taken everything, stolen everyone’s dreams.

569
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,280
I know everyone is afraid,

570
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,360
but I want us all to stand up and fight together.

571
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,640
If we don’t, no one else will help us.

572
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,250
So please,

573
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:16,850
stand up and fight.

574
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,700
I don’t think this is working.

575
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,780
No one’s on board.

576
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,050
What should we do?

577
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,050
I’ve rallied them so much, I don’t know what else to say.

578
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,330
Sister Nang, do something.

579
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:49,870
Boss’s people are coming.

580
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:56,240
Sorry, Hoy, I’m done.

581
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,550
Get in, go in.

582
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,860
(The best thing is for you to run.)
What are you looking at? Get to work.

583
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:04,300
(If you don’t want to live under Boss’s rule anymore.)
Hey, you've gone too far.

584
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,680
Boss has way more power now,

585
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,580
even the law, the media, or the police can’t touch him.

586
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:18,000
Even Rose or the Four Horsemen

587
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,530
can’t do anything about him anymore.

588
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,560
Father, please, Father, could you use your influence…

589
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,370
Let’s talk on the plane. Hurry up and pack, and let’s get out of here.

590
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:29,200
Where are we going?

591
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,000
Let’s go now, or we won’t make it.

592
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,860
Wait, Father!

593
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,820
We’ve all lost.

594
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,540
I won’t give up.

595
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,460
I will not leave anyone behind.

596
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,590
Jack opened the school to help the community.

597
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,590
I was going to make more friends.

598
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:00,000
Everything was going well.

599
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,770
I won’t give up.

600
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:08,350
And Sister Nang, you shouldn’t give up either.

601
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,020
That would mean becoming an enemy of Boss,

602
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,560
the most powerful person right now.

603
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:24,790
But it also means we’d only have one enemy.

604
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:28,370
If you don’t stand with the villagers,

605
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:30,370
you’ll have hundreds of enemies.

606
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:38,870
One enemy versus hundreds, even I can do the math.

607
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:19,300
We’ll divert his attention.

608
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,580
You guys go through the secret door behind the gym.

609
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:31,690
Hey, monkey face!

610
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,570
If you’re tough, bring it on.

611
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:38,570
Let’s see who’s really tough.

612
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,800
Kid,

613
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,150
you’re hilarious.

614
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,790
I was just getting bored anyway.

615
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:52,310
So you’re Jack’s lousy apprentice, huh?

616
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,200
Jack is a million times better than you, you old fish-faced jerk.

617
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,150
Take that!

618
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,920
You wanna get hurt, kid?

619
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,550
Bring it on, then.

620
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,820
Hoy’s been talking to Sister Nang forever.

621
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,890
Is he getting anywhere?

622
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,590
I don’t know.

623
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:49,790
Joke!

624
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,820
Hey, Hoy, how did it go?

625
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:22,000
Today, I’ll fight to death alongside all the villagers.

626
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:31,800
Yes.

627
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:34,610
We’ll fight together.

628
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:57,600
Fight together.

629
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,880
Teacher Joke!

630
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,320
What happened?

631
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:30,580
After everyone left, Boss’s men locked us in the learning center.

632
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:35,240
They threatened us not to return.

633
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:42,670
It was Boss’s plan to lure us out

634
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:44,670
and then intimidate the kids.

635
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:48,490
They said if any parents flee their debts,

636
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:52,480
the kids will be taken to pay them instead.

637
00:54:54,540 --> 00:55:00,870
Boss wanted to teach them not to have any hope, even the kids.

638
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,270
Toi Ting.

639
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,200
Where's Toi Ting?

640
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,300
Help!

641
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,170
Help! Is anyone here?

642
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,720
Help!

643
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:29,770
Is anyone here?

644
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:31,420
Help!

645
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,860
Help!

646
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,790
Help!

647
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,460
First, call me handsome daddy,

648
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,670
and maybe I’ll let you go.

649
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:55,310
I'd rather call you a big toe.

650
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,880
Still being cheeky when you can’t escape, huh?

651
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,610
Who said I’m running? I’m baited you out here.

652
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:36,830
You think I’m stupid?

653
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,770
Who’s stupid here?

654
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,590
By now, your friends have already run home like scared dogs,

655
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,730
telling their parents how scary this place is.

656
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:50,000
Who would dare send their kids here again, huh?

657
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:53,210
Ever heard the saying?

658
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:57,900
One shot kills two birds.

659
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,600
Bang.

660
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:05,710
How many years in jail do you get for stomping on a kid?

661
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:11,630
Oh, I forgot, Boss has the ring.

662
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,020
Let me go!

663
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,440
Let go of me!

664
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,070
Help! Is anyone around here?

665
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,190
Let go!

666
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,750
Bye-bye.

667
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:27,710
Let go!

668
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,760
Help!

669
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,930
Help!

670
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:46,540
Toi Ting!

671
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:47,880
You’ll be alright.

672
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:52,900
Toi Ting!

673
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,030
Family members, please wait outside. No entry is allowed.

674
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,360
Damn it.

675
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:22,720
Don’t worry, she’s like a niece to me.

676
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,780
Dad.

677
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:10,630
Jack.

678
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,580
What the hell happened?

679
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,840
Hey, what the hell happened?

680
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,840
What the hell happened!!

681
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,290
It’s all because Save betrayed us.

682
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:44,320
Damn you, Save.

683
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,960
Save betrayed us.

684
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:49,450
Toi Ting.

685
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,060
Save’s been working for Boss all along.

686
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,060
Damn it!

687
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,670
It’s not Save.

688
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:08,650
It’s me.

689
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:24,460
I gave the ring to Boss.

690
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,840
I betrayed you.

691
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,220
Why does it have to be you again?

692
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,550
The condition is critical, doctor.

693
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:58,850
Several broken ribs and possible brain damage.

694
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,240
I don't want to see your face again.

695
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,640
Was it all a lie?

696
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:08,000
He said not to show my face again.

697
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:14,360
I don't know if I can do it, but I'll try.

698
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,360
The last of the Four Horsemen hasn't arrived yet?

699
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:21,860
Someone once asked me how to solve the situation like a thief.

700
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:23,860
I think this is how to solve it.
