This series is purely a work of fiction
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:09,680
How's your tutoring going?

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,200
The teacher is just following the curriculum,

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,760
Can you just make me proud for once?

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,059
so please, just let me make the national team once.

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,240
Then I can finally pay off all my debts and live comfortably.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,600
I want to create a fully integrated learning center

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,930
We’ve been informed that
there’s been an embezzlement at the bank.

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,360
On the second floor, in my bedroom,

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,860
there’s all the evidence that ties me to that name.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,160
I want Jack.

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,520
He’s the right person for the position I want to fill.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,280
Next time we meet, I will do everything
 to apologize to you, Jack.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,080
I hope I never see you again, Joker.

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,050
Five years later

(100 ways to make it up to them)

17
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,360
(Restricted Area)

18
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,079
Hey, sorry.

19
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,079
Could I drop you off ahead?

20
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,110
I don’t want to go all the way into Suphanimit.

21
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,370
There are a lot of thieves there.

22
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,920
But what about you?

23
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Why are you going into such a dangerous place?

24
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,610
I’m going back to repay an old debt.

25
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,110
Damn it. How am I ever going to find you?

26
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,600
Will I ever get to apologize to you in this lifetime?

27
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
(Feel free to refill, dear.)

28
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,500
(Can I get a refill?)

29
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,800
(Absolutely, dear.)

30
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,850
(That’s awesome!)

31
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,650
(I keep refilling?)

32
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,600
Excuse me, uncle.

33
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,120
Do you know anyone around here named Jack?

34
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,470
Uncle?

35
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,880
Who's an "uncle"? What are you talking about?

36
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,730
Huh!?!

37
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,730
Wow, just because I have long hair?

38
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,280
Hey.

39
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,780
I'm here.

40
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,580
Look!

41
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,580
Hey, sis.

42
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,800
Can I ask you something?

43
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Order first.

44
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, I’ll have a glass of water.

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,550
Is this guy being an ass?

46
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,640
You come to a coffee shop and ask for water?

47
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,340
Uh...

48
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,470
What do you want?

49
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,920
How about some water?

50
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,670
Just plain water, please.

51
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,670
Fine.

52
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Thank you!

53
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,000
Hey!

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Ten baht.

55
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,660
For the water. Water’s not free.

56
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,910
Food, drinks, whatever we sell here!

57
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,500
Here you go, bro.

58
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,000
Take it.

59
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,390
Wow, ten baht for water.

60
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Is it tasty?

61
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,860
The water here is like nowhere else.

62
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,860
You’ll only get water like this at my shop.

63
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,000
Is this tap water?

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,800
Huh, what did you say?

65
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,080
Nothing. Can I ask now?

66
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,130
Go ahead.

67
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,350
Do you know anyone named Jack?

68
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,530
He’s about… this tall.

69
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,890
Kind of shy, sweet,

70
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,410
and looks really gullible.

71
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,210
Know him?

72
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,710
Nope.

73
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,710
Gullible?

74
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,410
Who’s that?

75
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,200
Nope.

76
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,520
You really don’t know him?

77
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,420
Nope.

78
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,420
But we’ve tricked plenty of people, bro.

79
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,960
This guy too, he got tricked.

80
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,460
Okay, how about this.

81
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,660
Huh?

82
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,460
He’s a Taekwondo instructor,

83
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,860
and he’s about to open a school.

84
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,860
Know him now?

85
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,660
Jack, the Taekwondo guy, opening a school?

86
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,160
Gullible?

87
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,220
Oh, there's no Jack like that around here.

88
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,220
The only Jack here is

89
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,280
Jack the Reaper!

90
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,810
(Yeah, well, pass this on for me.)

91
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,000
(Sure, P' Jack.)

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,850
(Let's go, guys.)

93
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,150
Hey! Hey!

94
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,600
He's here!

95
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Close the shop! Close the shop!

96
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Move!

97
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Oh no, bro! Which way now?

98
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,320
Quick!

99
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Hurry up! Let’s go, bro!

100
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,610
(Shop closed every day)

101
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,200
What are you playing at?

102
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,670
Come here!

103
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,670
Hurry up, bro!

104
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,740
The shop's closed, we'll try again tomorrow.

105
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,080
Let's hit that shop over there first.

106
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
Go!

107
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Go!

108
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,120
(100 ways to make it up to them)

109
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,300
Huh? What?

110
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,950
Hey!

111
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,280
Where is he going?

112
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Hey!

113
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,040
P' Jack, this is framed real nice.

114
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Is it valuable?

115
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,310
It’s trash.

116
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,960
There's nothing of value in your room at all.

117
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,990
How is that possible?

118
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,780
Are you hiding something from me?

119
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,000
Where did you hide it?

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What the hell did you do with the money?

121
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
You’re in debt,

122
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,040
and you think you can pull a fast one?

123
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,680
Please don’t hurt me.

124
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
You think I’m playing, huh?

125
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,480
Don’t!

126
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Nothing, huh?

127
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Let’s go.

128
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,670
Is anyone in this room?

129
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,670
No one, sir.

130
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,260
What happened to you in the last five years?

131
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,980
Go home, all of you. I want to be alone today.

132
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,280
Yes, sir.

133
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,270
Oh, and take care of this for me.

134
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,460
Yes, sir.

135
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Let's go, guys.

136
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,900
Who the hell are you, following me around all day?

137
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,590
Tell me!

138
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,380
Calm down.

139
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,730
It’s me.

140
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,040
I just wanted to apologize for tricking you.

141
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
For five years,

142
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,810
I’ve been thinking of a hundred ways to make it up to you

143
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,300
whether it’s cleaning your house,

144
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,910
mopping your floors, or helping you open that school you wanted.

145
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,420
I’d even clean up after you, anything.

146
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Just forgive me, please.

147
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,640
(100 ways to make it up to them)

148
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
You think I’m some kid

149
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,230
that you can fool as easily as before?

150
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Jack,

151
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I really want to apologize.

152
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,400
Every second I spent in prison,

153
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
I felt guilty.

154
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
I never thought my actions

155
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,440
would affect someone like this.

156
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,860
It’s too late now.

157
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,860
Stay out of my life

158
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,840
if you don’t want to die.

159
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:10,980
No.

160
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,840
Not until you forgive me.

161
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,440
You want me to forgive you so bad, huh?

162
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Then try dying.

163
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,580
If it’ll make you stop being angry,

164
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,460
go ahead and kill me.

165
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,460
Do it.

166
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,830
You’re daring me?

167
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,830
You’re daring me, right?

168
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,680
Say it again.

169
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
Do it.

170
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,740
Don’t ever show your face to me again.

171
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
Or I’ll kill you for real.

172
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,090
Who’s there?

173
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,080
Hello.

174
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,370
I’ve just moved into the room next door

175
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,370
and wanted to introduce myself.

176
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,270
I brought you this gift basket.

177
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,690
Earlier today, I heard a lot of banging coming from your room.

178
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,550
Then I saw a man walk out.

179
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,550
Is everything alright?

180
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,040
Oh...

181
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,630
that’s none of your business.

182
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Wait!

183
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,240
I just wanted to know

184
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,970
Is that guy single?

185
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,010
If he's single,

186
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,010
I just want to know his address and where he works.

187
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
I just want to hit on him.

188
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,320
Oh...

189
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Why didn’t you tell me sooner, man?

190
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,770
I totally support young love!

191
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,500
Oh!

192
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,250
Come on in, bro.

193
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:55,750
Sure.

194
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,750
Here, have some cold water.

195
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,540
If you want to know anything about him,

196
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,150
I’ll tell you everything.

197
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,890
Did he give me the right location?

198
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,830
You said he was rich, right?

199
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,830
If he’s rich, why would he borrow money from the boss?

200
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,080
Oh, idiot!

201
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,340
Rich people do this kind of thing,

202
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,340
they borrow money to invest and make more.

203
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,660
Look at his watch, man.

204
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,560
That thing’s worth tens of thousands.

205
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,480
That Ferragamo shoes too.

206
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
They could buy your motorbike!

207
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,660
Shit.

208
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,660
And don’t forget that gold chain he’s wearing.

209
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,680
This guy’s loaded.

210
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,950
Yeah, you’re right.

211
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,780
Let’s wait until he gets the money,

212
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,780
then we’ll rob him.

213
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,320
Huh?

214
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,480
But then he’ll have to pay Boss back for us, won’t he?

215
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,770
Yeah.

216
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,770
But the difference is

217
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,930
we’ll take his money, pay Boss,

218
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,930
and let him become the debtor instead of us.

219
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,940
Oh, poor guy.

220
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Shit!

221
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,440
Man, pity yourself first.

222
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,090
We’re finally getting out of this filthy debtor life.

223
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,750
I’m tired of it.

224
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,750
Go! Get back to plan it out.

225
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,750
Yeah.

226
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,830
Mr. Johnson.

227
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,830
Yes

228
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,930
After I got the investment from Bitcoin,

229
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
I became an early investor.

230
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Then my dog gave birth.

231
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,310
Her puppies are adorable.

232
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,070
They looked into my eyes

233
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
and smiled at me.

234
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,090
So I took all my earnings

235
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,300
and put them into Shiba coin.

236
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,090
I invested tens of millions in futures.

237
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,470
But in the end,

238
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,180
it just kept going down,

239
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,250
and now it’s about to liquidate.

240
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,890
So I’m here to borrow money

241
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,580
to cover my future.

242
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,190
I believe that

243
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,350
the dogecoin will come back.

244
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
Doge...

245
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,850
is going to make us rich.

246
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,760
Sir,

247
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,440
I need to borrow three million.

248
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,750
I promise to pay it back in one month,

249
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,000
with interest and big returns.

250
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,430
Mr. Johnson, don’t worry.

251
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,100
Here, no matter who you are

252
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
there's no problem

253
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,300
we're happy to help everyone,

254
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,290
whether they’re junkies, monks,

255
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,290
or even ex-cons.

256
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,680
Thank you so much, sir.

257
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,240
Here, Boss.

258
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
Here you go.

259
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:12,870
Jack,

260
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,070
this is Mr. Johnson, our new client.

261
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,130
I’m assigning this case to you.

262
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
No way!

263
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,220
What are you doing?

264
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,120
Boss, this guy is a scammer.

265
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,650
You’re scamming me?

266
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,960
No, I’m not.

267
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,450
I’m just here to borrow money.

268
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,690
If you won’t lend it to me,

269
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,500
I’ll have to go somewhere else.

270
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,000
You two know each other?

271
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,400
No.

272
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,900
Then how do you know he’s a scammer?

273
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,000
Well?

274
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,640
It’s fake, boss.

275
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,260
I know.

276
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,120
I know.

277
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,960
I'm sorry.

278
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,680
Hope, you don't need to.

279
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,910
I'll take care of him, boss.

280
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,010
I'll take care of him, boss.

281
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,790
You idiots.

282
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,490
Get up.

283
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,500
Let me go, please.

284
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,530
Come on.
I’m really here to get a loan.

285
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,250
I already told you

286
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,450
to stay out of my way.

287
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,920
What are you doing here?

288
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,880
And what are you doing in a place like this?

289
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,870
I told you to stop,

290
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,060
or I’ll kill you next time.

291
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:41,020
I wasn’t sitting idle these past five years.

292
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,410
Let's see how you've improved.

293
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,340
Five years ago, you'd be able to hit me.

294
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,780
But now, you can't even graze me.

295
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Or maybe you're slower today

296
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,390
is because you’ve put on weight?

297
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,540
Is that all you’ve got?

298
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,680
Why don’t you practice speaking less?

299
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,140
You want to keep going?

300
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,420
They’re acting like they’re flirting or something.

301
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,230
Hey, shush!

302
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,850
What are you all standing around for?

303
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,960
Beat him up!

304
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,480
I don’t care about this guy.

305
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,200
Hey, if you guys are going to beat me up,

306
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,390
leave my face alone, okay?

307
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,720
What?

308
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,790
(Sompong ran off with the money.)

309
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,340
Okay, I’ll be right there.

310
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,880
You two keep an eye on this bastard.

311
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,080
I’ll be back soon.

312
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,530
Give him hell.

313
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,270
Yes, boss.

314
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,920
You ready?

315
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,620
Doesn’t matter, we’ve got to be ready.

316
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,660
Where do we start?

317
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,660
Not the face, please.

318
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,480
What’s up, Jack?

319
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,390
Don’t make this worse, Sompong.

320
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Right there, that’s good.

321
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,740
How’s that?
A bit more to the right.

322
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,570
The right?

323
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,160
Yeah.

324
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,450
Hey, you’re pretty good at this massage thing.

325
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,320
Yeah, right?

326
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,970
Instead of wearing yourself out by beating me up,

327
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,310
just let me give you a massage.

328
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,810
It’s a lot more relaxing, isn’t it?

329
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,410
Yeah, a little higher though.

330
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,000
Higher?
Mm-hmm.

331
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,100
Okay.

332
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,560
Whoa, you’ve got a stiff neck here.

333
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,210
Want me to go harder?

334
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,210
Yeah, harder.

335
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,210
A bit more pressure, huh?

336
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,900
Hey!

337
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,900
Don’t come any closer!

338
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,730
I’ve got nothing left!

339
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,430
I’m not scared of anything anymore.

340
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,670
Don’t do anything stupid.

341
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,120
You’ve already taken everything from me.

342
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,920
You’re just one of their lackeys.

343
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,990
Just let me go.

344
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,920
Have a heart.

345
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,550
Even if you’ve got no money,

346
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,000
you shouldn’t run away.

347
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,320
Take this with you, then.

348
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,340
Hey!

349
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,880
Damn it!

350
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,680
Hey.

351
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,720
Are you going to die?

352
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,680
I told you,

353
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,380
there’s nothing left.

354
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,440
I'm already dying from cancer.

355
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,560
Just let me live my final days in peace.

356
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,070
Rules are rules.

357
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,720
You're the one who signed the contract with the boss.

358
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Hey, hey,

359
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,930
isn’t that going too far?

360
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,560
Have you turned into a demon?

361
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,760
Mind your own business.

362
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Why do you care?

363
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,490
Run!

364
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,430
Get out of here!

365
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,560
Jack,

366
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,720
I’m telling you this for your own good.

367
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,700
What the hell happened to you?

368
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:31,510
You’re not meant to be some cruel, heartless, lowlife like this.

369
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,490
Alright,

370
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,630
then talk to my fists instead.

371
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,370
I’ll bring back the gentle version of you from five years ago.

372
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,230
You think I’m doing this because I want to?

373
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,910
If I hadn’t believed in that stupid hope

374
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,420
someone gave me...

375
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,060
You’re the one who’s fucked up.

376
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,320
Do you want to be a hero?

377
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,130
Disgusting.

378
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,670
You want to bring me back?

379
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,600
You want to apologize to me?

380
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,080
If you really feel guilty, then get out of my life,

381
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,210
because ever since I met you,

382
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,010
nothing in my life has gotten better.

383
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,920
Ugh, so dramatic.

384
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,560
Feel sorry for him?

385
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,610
Feel sorry for yourself first.

386
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,060
But today, we’re going to rob him

387
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,770
because he’s at his weakest today.

388
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,260
Are you ready?

389
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,920
Let’s go.

390
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,850
Follow me.

391
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,810
Stop wasting time.

392
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,440
So, you’re going to give up on day one?

393
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,390
Alright,

394
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,030
I’m heading out.

395
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,870
Have a drink with me before you go.

396
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,710
Out of all my men,

397
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,530
you know you’re my favorite.

398
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:27,489
Thank you.

399
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,440
Then why are you doing this to me?

400
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,830
How long are you going to deceive me?

401
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,449
What are you talking about, boss?

402
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,360
You’ve been paying off the debts of your own debtors

403
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,360
who couldn’t pay, haven’t you?

404
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,070
Answer me.

405
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,650
Yes.

406
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,500
We’re running a business, not a charity.

407
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,360
The most important thing isn’t the money,

408
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,360
it’s respect.

409
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,770
If you keep doing this, my business will go to hell.

410
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,310
From now on, for Hoi and Tattoo’s debts.

411
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,310
I’m putting Hope in charge.

412
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,380
And if next month you’re still doing this,

413
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,120
I’ll start taking out each debtor you’ve been protecting.

414
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,270
Got it?

415
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,820
Yes.

416
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,110
You can go now.

417
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,030
Oh, Mom! You made your special omelet for me again.

418
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,280
The smell’s so good from here.

419
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,990
You tired?

420
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,750
Hey, Tattoo, my bestie.

421
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,030
The smell’s so strong from here, huh?

422
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,460
Come on.

423
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,430
I’ve already set a plate with rice for you.

424
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,120
You want some?

425
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,680
Mom, go into the bedroom.

426
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:21,380
Come and eat.

427
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
You think you’re fast, huh?

428
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,550
Jack is weak.

429
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,840
It’s good that it's me now.

430
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,190
I’m going to teach you a lesson you’ll never forget.

431
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,140
Hope, Hope, that’s enough! Please, stop!

432
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,320
I'm begging you.

433
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,560
Fuck off.

434
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
If you interfere, I’ll make sure he never walks again.

435
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,040
Please, I’m begging you.

436
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,880
Go inside.

437
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,910
Go inside.

438
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,960
It’s alright, Mom.

439
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,570
Go on.

440
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,550
Good boy.

441
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,160
You staring at me?

442
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,650
When’s it coming?

443
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,960
How would I know?

444
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,160
It’s hot.

445
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:51,610
And you...

446
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,460
Hey!!!

447
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,600
What the hell are you wearing?

448
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,750
A mask.

449
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,000
This idiot.

450
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,240
Hey, he’s here.

451
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,130
Hide.

452
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,010
Hey!

453
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,940
Hey, hands up and spin around!

454
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,860
Damn it,

455
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,000
I’m not in the mood to play around.

456
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,880
Hey, he understood that.

457
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,430
Hey, a cockroach!

458
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,740
Shit, it’s gone now.

459
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,950
You’re afraid of cockroaches?

460
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,550
You’ve got to be kidding me.

461
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,390
I bet he’s around here somewhere.

462
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,450
Hey..

463
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,780
Hoi,

464
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,410
what the hell are you doing?

465
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:15,950
Wait,

466
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:21,690
weren’t you wearing shorts when you came?

467
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,570
You’re messing with the wrong guy, kid.

468
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,060
Take it easy,

469
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,060
I’m from the room next door.

470
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,960
Let’s talk, man.

471
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,860
Don’t do anything to me, I just got punched too.

472
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,360
Don’t let me see your face again.

473
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,150
Let's get out of here.

474
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,200
Wait.

475
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,350
That tattoo… the legendary Joker thief!

476
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Are you...

477
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,420
Oh man, you…

478
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,770
Woah.

479
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,520
Sit down, you idiot.

480
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:33,430
I’m a huge fan of yours!

481
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,240
You can go now.

482
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,580
Let's go.

483
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,600
You’re upset about Jack, aren’t you?

484
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,680
How’d you know?

485
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,880
If you help me rob that bastard who’s been oppressing us,

486
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:58,580
I’ll tell you Jack’s secret

487
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,520
and make sure you reconcile with him.

488
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,880
Consider it my payment.

489
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,030
Alright, let’s hear it.

490
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,680
The Jack you’re seeing now

491
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,880
isn’t the real him.

492
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,170
It’s all an act.

493
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,750
The boss probably sent someone to keep an eye on me.

494
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,750
Help me make it convincing, you idiot.

495
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,810
Hey P' Jack, P' Jack!

496
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:38,820
I’m sorry, we won’t do it again,

497
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,470
please let me go.

498
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:44,410
Because lately, the boss has been watching Jack closely.

499
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,440
Jack is actually a kind person.

500
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,280
All his debtors know that.

501
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,920
And Jack has been paying off all our debts himself.

502
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,810
So he hasn’t changed after all.

503
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,740
It’s just the circumstances forcing him.

504
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,510
And what’s the secret?

505
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:24,960
I found out Jack owes the boss.

506
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,200
Both money and a life debt.

507
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,210
Since Boss took Jack in,

508
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,360
he seized something important.

509
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:41,290
It’s Jack's parents’ wedding ring.

510
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,790
Jack’s father gave it to him before he passed away.

511
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,590
Boss did this to prevent Jack from betraying him

512
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:49,690
and running away from his debt.

513
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,120
That's the reason why

514
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,120
Jack has to follow Boss’s every order.

515
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:02,980
You’re a thief.

516
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:06,920
Can you steal Jack away from those scumbags?

517
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,900
You don’t know anything, so don’t speak.

518
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,740
This job,

519
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,150
I might be able to get Jack out of this miserable life,

520
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,980
out of being Boss’s debtor.

521
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,030
Don’t show your face to me again.

522
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:43,200
Or I’ll kill you.

523
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:51,750
I’ll help you guys.

524
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,990
And we’ll steal Jack’s ring back too.

525
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:01,830
This will be my final job as the Phantom Thief.

526
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:02,760
Joker.

527
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,070
Then I’m coming with you.

528
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,000
Amateurs like you

529
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,520
will just be a burden to me.

530
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,480
But I know how to rob Boss.

531
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,530
But you have to promise that Hoi and I can tag along.

532
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,920
I have unfinished business with them.

533
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,150
If you don’t believe me, just look at my face.

534
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,520
It’s lucky I was at home today,

535
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,440
or else my mom would have been...

536
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,930
Hoi and I,

537
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:43,170
we want to live freely for once.

538
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,330
Fine.

539
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Yes.

540
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:06,550
What’s the plan?

541
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:08,580
Don’t disappoint me.

542
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,310
The plan is,

543
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,010
instead of robbing the highly cautious boss,

544
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,430
we’ll just rob some fool,

545
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:27,640
who likes to wear his dad’s valuables for fun.

546
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,370
Save.

547
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,310
Save.

548
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,140
He's gone.

549
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:16,130
You’re not cut out to be such a vile, disgusting, lowly person.

550
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,300
I’ll bring back the kind version of you from five years ago.

551
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,430
Grandma.

552
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:31,330
Hmm?

553
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,360
Why the serious face? What’s wrong?

554
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,200
Grandma, in the past five years..

555
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,420
Do you think I've changed?

556
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,210
You can’t be a kid forever.

557
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,400
Helping others is good,

558
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:52,050
but don’t forget to help yourself too.

559
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,580
Or maybe let others help you for once.

560
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,840
Don’t worry about me, Grandma.

561
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,730
Just me alone,

562
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,180
I can handle it.

563
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,270
Go rest,

564
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,310
Grandma, I’ll clean up.

565
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:09,730
Just leave it here.

566
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:11,920
Not a minute has gone by, this kid.

567
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,560
Go get some rest.

568
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,190
Leave it here.

569
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:01,540
Wow, your skin looks amazing!

570
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,540
Well, I slept like a baby, so I’m glowing.

571
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,440
So healthy!

572
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,590
Do you believe that this piece,

573
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,590
Yes.

574
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,120
makes me look like I’m wearing luxury brands?

575
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:14,080
Wow,

576
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,430
but it’s only because it’s on your face!

577
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,430
Oh, stop it.

578
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,430
I’ll hire you more often then!

579
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,060
Deal!

580
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,800
Arun, hurry up, the live stream has started!

581
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,420
Okay, okay.

582
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,720
Are you ready?

583
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,720
Almost done! Let me just contour a bit.

584
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,780
Hurry, hurry!

585
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:43,130
Are we live?

586
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:46,370
Hello everyone!

587
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:47,710
Hello, I’m Arun!

588
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,520
And I’m Pharaoh!

589
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,420
With only two viewers,

590
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,210
should we switch to a video call instead?

591
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,820
Twenty thousand, twenty thousand.

592
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:54,710
Oh, twenty thousand.

593
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:55,610
Pharaoh!

594
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,760
It looked like no one was here!

595
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,850
Today,

596
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:00,320
we’re here with the brand owner,

597
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,060
Arun!

598
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,710
It’s Arun himself!

599
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:04,310
Today, Arun is here to show us

600
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,480
the hottest items, bags!

601
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,080
What do you have to show us today?

602
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,530
I've has brought a lot!

603
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:10,320
Where?

604
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
Let’s start with the first one!

605
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,050
Yes, exactly, bring it on!

606
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,150
This one is so I proudly present to you!

607
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:18,150
Yes, slay.

608
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:19,560
It’s an Hermès bag,

609
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,310
and let me tell you, it’s super rare!

610
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:24,270
So rare, there are only three of them in the world.

611
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:27,070
So rare that the maid spent four days looking for this!

612
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,690
She couldn't find it in the closest at all.

613
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,690
It’s made of woven leather.

614
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,190
Yes.

615
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,340
Yes, it looks like it's woven from toothpicks.

616
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:35,940
Let’s move on to the next one.

617
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,740
The next one, please.

618
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,580
Let’s see, let’s see!
I brought so many bags today.

619
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,980
This one is amazing.
The second bag.

620
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,360
It looks so luxurious!

621
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,860
This is also Hermès.

622
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,010
Yes, still Hermès, viewers!

623
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,260
But this one is made of leather.

624
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,570
Let me tell you, if it’s big, it’s crocodile,

625
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:56,400
but if it’s small, it’s instantly a monitar lizard skin!

626
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:56,900
Do you like monitar lizards?

627
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,300
Oh, Pharaoh!

628
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,040
What?

629
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,000
Be serious!

630
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Okay, this one, if you get it, is totally worth it!

631
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,020
Also worth a million!

632
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,720
Yes.

633
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,020
What’s the comment?

634
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,040
What?

635
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,630
What did they type?

636
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,630
When is the new collection launching?

637
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:13,230
Oh!

638
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:15,810
Don’t say “oh,” just tell them!

639
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,010
It’s like they know,

640
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,100
like they came to this live just to hear the announcement!

641
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,240
Make the announcement!

642
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,120
The new collection is launching tomorrow! Oh!

643
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:28,750
And it’s a secret just for this live stream.

644
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,160
There’s going to be an event too.

645
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,760
Really?

646
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,210
Of course, it’s going to be grand!

647
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,900
And who’s going to the event?

648
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,300
Is it going to be random people?

649
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,400
No way!

650
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,440
I have to say that this event is invite-only!
Fabulous!

651
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,010
Everyone there will be top-tier.

652
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:45,960
Of course!

653
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,960
Only the elite of Thailand!
All celebrities and let me tell you,

654
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:52,600
this event might have some surprises!

655
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,830
Ooh, I’m excited!

656
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,970
Let’s move on to the third bag.
The third bag!

657
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,410
Do we really need bags like this?

658
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:03,390
(One essential item is a bag, right?)

659
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,110
Honestly, Pharaoh, if you want to look fabulous, stylish, and confident,

660
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:07,370
you need to have it!

661
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,000
That sounds like fun, Arun.

662
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,960
The jewelry brand we contacted for sponsorships,

663
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,960
they all canceled.

664
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,000
Here’s an idea, Arun,

665
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,520
why don’t you bring all the jewelry you own at home

666
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,070
and use it for this event?

667
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,070
P’Joy, are you really going to choose this person?

668
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,020
The jewelry each person will wear,

669
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,270
it’s rare.

670
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:42,270
Treat it as if it’s your life.

671
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:49,010
We have bodyguards watching you all one by one.

672
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,870
May I borrow your ring, please?
