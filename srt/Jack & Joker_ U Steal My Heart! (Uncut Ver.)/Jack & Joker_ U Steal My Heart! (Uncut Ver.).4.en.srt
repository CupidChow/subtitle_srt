This series is purely a work of fiction
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,290
But let me remind you all again,

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,000
You’re not allowed to steal anything else.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,490
Boss, take a look at this one first.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,340
Are we so desperate to clear our debts that we’re this selfish?

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,340
You’re lucky, you get to guard your dad’s stuff.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,280
If it were me, I’d be out of here so fast.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,490
Why does it have to be you again?

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,370
You just wanted to keep it for yourself, admit it.

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,730
Ouch, take it easy Toi Ting

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,870
You’re so small but your hands are so heavy

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,280
I’m the one who didn’t let him leave the house

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,840
Creditors these days are brutal

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,090
They don’t even spare kids

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,940
I’m afraid he’ll get beaten up if he goes out

16
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,160
He hasn’t left the house in so long, won’t the teacher come looking for him?

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,410
Why would they? He dropped out

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,020
What?

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,820
Well, we don’t have money

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,180
The cost of uniforms, books

21
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,280
I let him drop out so he could find a job

22
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,650
At ten years old?

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,120
Uncle Khajorn, are you crazy?

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,070
Should I call the police to arrest you?

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,920
Go ahead, report me

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,770
Go report me and have me arrested

27
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,960
Maybe prison’s more comfortable than being here right now

28
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,690
At least someone would take Toi Ting in

29
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,740
Take care of her and end this once and for all

30
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:36,020
Ouch

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,840
I’m just kidding

32
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,410
I’ve got money to pay those bastards now

33
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,170
No one’s coming after us anymore

34
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,160
Uncle, did you borrow from Boss?

35
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,870
Even though his interest isn’t as high as others

36
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,420
But if you don’t pay,

37
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,710
he won’t let you go

38
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,250
Jack, don’t tell me you’re handling my case

39
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,600
That’s how you knew I borrowed more from Boss

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,930
Hooray,

41
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,370
I’m saved

42
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,270
Jack, homie, if you help me

43
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,540
If you pay Boss for me first

44
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,640
I swear I’ll find the money to repay you as fast as I can

45
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,610
You can take Toi Ting

46
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,550
Have her do housework for you in the meantime

47
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,290
Well?

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,380
P’ Jack, don’t pay my dad’s debt

49
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,870
He just spends all his money on booze

50
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,200
Mind your own business, you brat

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
You’re ruining his good deed

52
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,790
Jack won’t abandon me

53
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,110
Right?

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,940
Uncle, I’m not that rich

55
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,240
I can’t help everyone all the time

56
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,050
You’re joking, right?

57
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,800
You’re teasing me, aren’t you?

58
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,730
Toi Ting, go ask Auntie Jo at the O-Liang shop

59
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,390
See if she knows who Robin Hood is

60
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,880
I’m going to look for him

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,880
Maybe he’ll help me

62
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,120
Go, hurry

63
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,550
Ouch, Dad, if Auntie Jo knew who it was

64
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,040
Would she still be calling him Robin Hood?

65
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,550
Robin Hood?

66
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,600
People say someone’s been

67
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,170
hanging the debtors’ pawned items at their front doors

68
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,490
But nobody knows who it is

69
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,320
The debtors are overjoyed,

70
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,940
so they call him Robin Hood

71
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,380
Robin Hood? More like the Joker

72
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Damn, it’s boiling hot

73
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,380
Me and Hoy hung things at every house

74
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,380
Uh,
what about yours?

75
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,400
Hey, that’s P’ Jack’s ring

76
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,440
You’re going to return it to them?

77
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,990
Well, they didn’t even want it back when I tried to return it myself

78
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,870
If he doesn't want it, just sell it

79
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,000
No way

80
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,190
I’ll give it to his grandma instead

81
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,970
You think Jack would let you meet his grandma?

82
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,760
Sure, just go to the morning market

83
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,260
Grandma goes out to sell chive dumplings

84
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,180
Give it to her directly, she’ll definitely accept it

85
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,250
Yeah

86
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,250
You’re right.
Right?

87
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,650
Grandma, fourty baht chive dumplings please

88
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,580
Sure, sure

89
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,580
Here you go

90
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,580
Thank you
Thanks

91
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,070
What would you like, dear?

92
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,130
Two please

93
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,120
Sure

94
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,920
I’ve just fried them fresh, nice and hot

95
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,890
Here you go

96
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,680
Thanks

97
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,920
Is that enough?

98
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,570
Grandma,

99
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,840
I have a thousand baht bill

100
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,630
I want to buy water at that shop, but they don’t have change

101
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,380
Could you break it for me?

102
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,380
A thousand baht bill?

103
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,750
Hmmm.

104
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,750
Let me check

105
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,350
Oh, I’ve got it

106
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,610
Wait, don’t exchange it

107
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,390
That’s a counterfeit bill

108
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,000
Hey, saying that is an accusation

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,100
I’m not accusing you

110
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
It’s low-quality counterfeit,

111
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,370
doesn’t even have a watermark

112
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
It’s definitely fake

113
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,630
Are you saying we’re scammers?

114
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Hey, thief!

115
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,049
Go away

116
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,049
Oh hey

117
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,700
Just because my hair’s white

118
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,520
Don’t think I’m old

119
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,310
I’m the White Haired Witch of Chao Phraya River

120
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,310
Remember that

121
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,080
Yes, take your time sitting down

122
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
Thanks, thanks

123
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,800
Ouch

124
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,320
I haven’t practiced this pose in a while, my joints are all stiff

125
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,400
Maybe you should see a doctor, Grandma

126
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,680
No, I’ll just go home and take some medicine, I’ll be fine

127
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,210
Don’t worry

128
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,320
Oh, Grandma, sit down

129
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,260
I’ll help lift this

130
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,640
How about I push your cart and take you home?

131
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
No need

132
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,770
I don’t want to trouble you

133
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,600
It’s no trouble

134
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Your house is just at the end of the alley

135
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,910
Alright

136
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:59,040
But how do you know where I live?

137
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,220
You must be a friend of Jack’s

138
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,590
Right?

139
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,200
Yes

140
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,850
You’re not from around here, are you?

141
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,020
So how do you know Jack?

142
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,800
Uh,

143
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,000
we met at a secret bar

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,570
A bar?

145
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,920
Worked part-time together, right?

146
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,480
Yes

147
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,600
No wonder I’ve never seen you

148
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,840
Once we’re done, we can head out

149
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
Just leave the chair here
I’ll clean it up

150
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,670
All done
Shall we?

151
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,500
Let’s go together
Come on

152
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,000
You want to apologize to Jack?

153
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,020
It’s complicated

154
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,600
But I don’t think Jack would want me telling anyone

155
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Did you break his heart?

156
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,170
No, that’s not it

157
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,760
About five years ago

158
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
I worked with Jack

159
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,440
I lied to him that I knew a generous benefactor

160
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,110
Who would give scholarships to poor kids

161
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,550
I told him I got the scholarship

162
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,930
He was happy for days

163
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:39,300
But in the end, there was no scholarship

164
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,810
So you didn’t break his heart, just lied to him

165
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,350
Pretty much

166
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,720
I feel really guilty

167
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,560
So I came to find him

168
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,000
I wanted to see how he’s doing

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,550
And I’ve been trying to apologize

170
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,660
But he hasn’t accepted it

171
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,330
He doesn’t even want to talk to me

172
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,510
Jack’s like that

173
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,960
When he loves someone, he loves them completely

174
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,210
But when he hates someone

175
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,370
He can hold a grudge forever

176
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,480
At least you feel remorse for your mistake

177
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,870
Just clear things up,

178
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,340
so there’s no hard feelings

179
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,000
Arun

180
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,770
I checked everything

181
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,250
All the security cameras were broken before the incident

182
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,950
Then why…

183
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,950
But I have good news

184
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,320
Come take a look

185
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,920
Isn’t that Noo Lek’s assistant?

186
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,140
Yes

187
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,230
I questioned Noo Lek

188
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,860
She said she

189
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,610
didn’t send anyone that day

190
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,180
And her purse went missing

191
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,570
after someone spiked her drink

192
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,130
But what’s interesting is here

193
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,800
This is the symbol of the legendary thief

194
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
The Joker

195
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,550
What is this?

196
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
How did it get here?

197
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,670
We don’t know yet

198
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,700
But here

199
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,830
This car was rented from Huai Khwang

200
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,830
The renter used a fake name

201
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,960
But stupidly listed Suphanimit as their address

202
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,700
And this reckless driving style

203
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,700
There’s only one person in Suphanimit who drives like that

204
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,250
Hoy

205
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,820
Are you saying that he is the Joker?

206
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,000
It's just that if that idiot

207
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,820
was really the legendary thief

208
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
Why would he be in debt to us?

209
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,090
Actually, there’s one more thing

210
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,210
To rig up something crazy enough

211
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,460
To make a purse deliver an electric shock

212
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,840
I can only think of one person, Hoy’s friend, Tattoo

213
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Like you said

214
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:54,030
Those two idiots are too dumb to come up with a plan like this

215
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:58,260
I think someone else is helping them

216
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,780
Could be one of our own

217
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,810
Aran

218
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,180
Are you putting things away?

219
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,120
Yes, Dad

220
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,680
Did you see your mother’s necklace?

221
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,060
There’s a jeweler coming to the house to clean the jewelry

222
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,810
I had the maid check your room for your mother’s necklace

223
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,810
She said she couldn’t find it

224
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,610
I’m asking, where is it?

225
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,000
I took it to a friend to have it cleaned

226
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,120
He got a new jeweler, so I wanted to try them out

227
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,980
Alright

228
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,720
But can you trust this new jeweler?

229
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Absolutely

230
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,760
You know it mustn’t get lost

231
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,400
Otherwise, I’ll erase your name, and his, along with the necklace

232
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,260
Understood?

233
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,720
Yes

234
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,270
All of you

235
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,580
Bring back whoever took my necklace

236
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,580
Or you’ll all die

237
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,820
Understood?

238
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,819
Yes

239
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,260
Rak, Yom, let’s go

240
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,010
Come in, come in

241
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,300
Just leave it here

242
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,130
Yes

243
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,000
Okay, okay

244
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Go sit down and relax

245
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,080
I’ll get you some food

246
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,680
Sure

247
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
Sit tight

248
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
Here it is

249
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,700
Chubchai
Looks delicious

250
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
chive dumplings

251
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,420
Help yourself

252
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,870
Thank you

253
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Eat up, eat up

254
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,210
Is it good?

255
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,210
Yes

256
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,100
Jack's mom and dad

257
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,710
when they were alive

258
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,950
they used to run a restaurant here in Suphanimit

259
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,510
When the business was doing well

260
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,570
Jack's dad wanted to expand

261
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,540
So he borrowed money

262
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,440
But life is unpredictable

263
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,590
Once he borrowed, customers disappeared

264
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,600
In the end, it became a debt

265
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,910
With no way to repay

266
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,700
I had to go back to selling chive dumplings

267
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,190
Where did Jack’s parents go?

268
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,840
Most people thought

269
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,820
they couldn’t handle the debt and ran away

270
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,960
left their kid to pay

271
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,160
they jumped off a building to claim the insurance

272
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,080
But they didn't read the contract carefully

273
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:05,100
It said that if they committed suicide, the insurance wouldn't pay.

274
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,450
I couldn’t pay it off

275
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,520
Luckily, Boss saw potential in Jack

276
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:27,700
Thought that when he grew up,

277
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,910
They even used his parent's ring that was given to Jack

278
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,100
as collateral

279
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,990
until the debt is paid

280
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,110
That ring had Jack’s name engraved on it

281
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,410
Do you think people like that would abandon their kid?

282
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:08,460
Oh, was the story so sad it made you lose your appetite?

283
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,450
It's so good

284
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,390
If it's good then eat up.

285
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,460
Yes.

286
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,680
Make yourself at home.

287
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,480
No need to wash the dishes, I’ll will wash them later.

288
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,880
And if you’re not going anywhere today,

289
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
in the afternoon, just relax inside the house for now.

290
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,620
It’s hot outside.

291
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,180
I'll go take a nap.

292
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,290
The painkillers make me drowsy.

293
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,650
Feel free to make yourself at home.

294
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,090
Alright, Ama.

295
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,560
Ow.

296
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,520
Ow!

297
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,460
Ow!

298
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,380
Toi Ting

299
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,570
P' Jack, I heard grandma screaming.

300
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,200
Ama is with someone.

301
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,920
Huh?

302
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,120
Ow.

303
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,000
Ow.

304
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,390
Hey!

305
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,210
What are you doing to my grandma?!

306
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,160
Jack, why are you hitting Joke?

307
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,670
Well...

308
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,700
He was giving me a massage.

309
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,320
I was in so much pain.

310
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,650
Come on, Toi Ting, give me a massage instead.

311
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,900
Didn't I tell you?

312
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,520
Not to come near me again!

313
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,830
Haven’t you learned how I am by now?!

314
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,280
If you’re going to hug, just do it already.

315
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,900
I won’t mind.

316
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,900
You miss your friend, don’t you, P' Jack?

317
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,050
This morning Joke helped me catch a thief

318
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,050
trying to steal money at the market.

319
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,560
So, I invited him over for lunch.

320
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,040
Well, once you’ve eaten, you should leave.

321
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,400
Wait, why are you chasing my guest away?

322
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,520
This is my guest, not yours.

323
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,220
Besides,

324
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,230
when I woke up

325
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,320
he cleaned the whole house!

326
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,160
If you’re not going anywhere today,

327
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,630
stay and relax until the evening.

328
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,430
I will cook dinner later.

329
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,350
Alright.

330
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,350
No.

331
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,910
Joke just did something wrong.

332
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,590
Huh?

333
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,190
Really, Joke?

334
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,940
What did you do?

335
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,610
Grandma, I need to tell you something.

336
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,930
Can’t explain right now.

337
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,910
It’s something between

338
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,610
me and him.

339
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,370
Oh.

340
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,740
That thing.

341
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,860
What thing?

342
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,890
That thing, of course.

343
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,600
What are you talking about?

344
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,660
That thing.

345
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,000
What do you mean, grandma?

346
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Don’t you remember?

347
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,280
Oh, that thing.

348
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,700
I won’t interfere, you two go sort it out yourselves.

349
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,220
Toi Ting, continue with my massage.

350
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,670
Go return the ring to Aran.

351
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,970
And don’t let her see it.

352
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,040
You know how much she wants that ring back.

353
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,470
It’s a symbol of your parents, you know?

354
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,470
And I know deep down

355
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,950
you want the ring back, too.

356
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,990
Don’t act like you know everything.

357
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,100
The more you do this, the more you’re causing trouble for my family.

358
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,480
If Boss finds out...

359
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
So why did you help me back then?

360
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,710
You could’ve just handed me over to Boss’s men.

361
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Take it, and run away.

362
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,680
Run where?

363
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,690
Where would I go?

364
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,200
My home is here.

365
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,580
My grandmother is here.

366
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,580
How could I just leave?

367
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,800
I’m not the type to cause trouble

368
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,480
and solve it by running away.

369
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,090
Even if I did run,

370
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,950
Boss would think I stole from his debtors,

371
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,700
including that necklace.

372
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,760
Imagine how messy that would get.

373
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
Tell me honestly,

374
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,050
why do you think

375
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,880
stealing is the answer to everything?

376
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,440
Because it’s the only thing I’m good at.

377
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:10,260
At least let your grandmother decide for herself.

378
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,080
It’s her son's ring, after all.

379
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,240
Think it over.

380
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,810
And if by tomorrow night

381
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,790
you still decide the same,

382
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,530
I’ll return the ring to Aran.

383
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,530
But if you don’t agree to my deal,

384
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,840
I’ll give the ring to grandma right now.

385
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,480
Damn it.

386
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,010
Alright, fine.

387
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,740
If I agree, you’ll leave me alone for good.

388
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,740
Deal?

389
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,310
Yeah.

390
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,600
I promise.

391
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,540
Where are you going?

392
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,000
I’m just going to eat with grandma and then head back to my room, why?

393
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,940
Boss’s men are looking for Hoy and Tattoo right now.

394
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,000
If you go back to your room, you’re done for.

395
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,900
Looks like I need a new place to stay tonight.

396
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,930
Where can I go that your guys won’t search?

397
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,750
Where?

398
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,260
What should I throw out?

399
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,860
If I toss my winter coat, I’ll need a new one later.

400
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,640
If I toss my watch, what will wake me up in the morning?

401
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,570
Better stick with this method.

402
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:28,360
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

403
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,700
Catch a tiger by the toe.

404
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,700
If he hollers, let him go,

405
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,190
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

406
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,450
Ow!

407
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,140
That's for making me walk around and look for you for a long time.

408
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,300
Get him into the car.

409
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,760
We’ve got another stop to make.

410
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,780
Do I really have to be here, Mom?

411
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,880
I’m not good with deities.

412
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,180
I get the chills just being here.

413
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,880
Whether you like it or not, you have to stay.

414
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,230
The deities will protect us.

415
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,600
You want to be a hero, don’t you?

416
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,850
A hero with no place to go.

417
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,600
Quick.

418
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,880
Now, let’s go.

419
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,530
Oh, hey, sis.

420
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,530
Did you bring your son to stay with us?

421
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,430
Just put your things here for now.

422
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,240
Here, we live like bees helping the hive,

423
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,980
and everyone must pitch in.

424
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,730
Make sure to do good deeds.

425
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,200
And don’t sneak outsiders in to stay for free.

426
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,370
Unless you’ve got permission from Miss Nang.

427
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,940
What kind of deity

428
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,370
gives things with conditions attached?

429
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,730
Maybe the deity isn’t as strict as you think.

430
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,980
First, we need to store all valuables

431
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,360
in a locker.

432
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,140
This will help you cut off desires

433
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,000
and avoid bringing any bad habits into the sacred space.

434
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,710
When you’re ready to leave,

435
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,730
you can come back for your things.

436
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,290
Go ahead.

437
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,790
Oh,
hand it over.

438
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,680
Here you go.

439
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,640
Thank you.

440
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
Oh, right.

441
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:17,980
Here.

442
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,840
What about your phone?

443
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,000
Oh, I pawned it.

444
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,360
Used it to pay the last rent for my flat.

445
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,490
I don’t have one.

446
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,600
In that case...

447
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,390
you have to know hunger before you know satisfaction.

448
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,390
Show your devotion

449
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,260
by serving the community first.

450
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:07,940
They make it sound so noble, but in the end, we’re just washing dishes.

451
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,929
We’re lucky enough to stay and eat here for free.

452
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,679
Stop complaining.

453
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,360
Besides, staying here with Miss Nang

454
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,400
is the safest option.

455
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,739
Boss’s men wouldn’t dare step foot here.

456
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,560
Hey, sis.

457
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,560
We need someone to help sell sacred items.

458
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,560
Oh, okay.

459
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,560
I’ll do it.

460
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,630
Do you want Boss’s men to see you?

461
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:37,770
I’ll go.

462
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,770
Alright, let’s go.

463
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,389
Clean up properly, okay?

464
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,270
Let's go.

465
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,600
Hoy, I was just thinking about you.

466
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,760
What’s up?

467
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,680
Hello?

468
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,250
Hoy, can you hear me?

469
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,560
Hello?

470
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,550
(Tattoo, help me!)

471
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,470
Hello, what’s wrong?

472
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,600
(Tattoo!)

473
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,610
Hoy!

474
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,440
(Help me!)

475
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Hoy!

476
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,350
What are you fixing?

477
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,690
I’m fixing the bookshelf and the chair.

478
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:41,180
They’re old and need some repairs.

479
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,840
Maybe it’ll bring something good into Jack’s life.

480
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,600
Do you like Jack?

481
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
No, I don’t.

482
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,780
You don’t like him, but you’re fixing his house?

483
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,880
I just want to help Jack.

484
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,670
If you like him, just say so. There’s no need to hide it.

485
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
Hey, who are you?

486
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,400
P' Save!

487
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:15,680
P' Joke, run!

488
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,060
Wait, Toi Ting.

489
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,420
Save, you startled me.

490
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,420
Are you looking for Jack?

491
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,970
He’s not here.

492
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,490
Oh, really? And who’s this?

493
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,130
He’s the electrician, my lights were out,

494
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,120
so I called him to fix them.

495
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,330
I thought he was a thief.

496
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,610
I’ll get back to work.

497
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,350
That was close.

498
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,440
Hello, P' Jack, Save came to the house.

499
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,440
He saw P' Joke.

500
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,470
What should I do?

501
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,720
(You got so worked up, I thought it was someone else.)

502
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,470
(If it’s just Save, don’t worry.)

503
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,900
(But if it were Hope or someone else)

504
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,900
( then call me, okay?)

505
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,680
Really?

506
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,060
But Save is...

507
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,650
Seriously, Toi Ting, it’s fine.

508
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,000
(I’ve got to get back to work, Talk later.)

509
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,070
Oh.

510
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,310
Did P' Jack say why

511
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:38,160
he didn’t want anyone to see Joke?

512
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,320
No, but he said if it were Hope’s men,

513
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,670
they shouldn’t see Joke at all.

514
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,540
I think Jack doesn’t want people to see me.

515
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,590
I stole Hope’s girlfriend.

516
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,780
That’s why Boss’s men don’t like me.

517
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,600
You have a lot of enemies.

518
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,600
Yeah.

519
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,540
Teenage love, huh?

520
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,490
Yeah.

521
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:26,130
You’re lying, I know who Hope’s girlfriend is.

522
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,010
Oh?

523
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:44,200
I don't know who is Hope's girlfriend.

524
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,880
Hope has a girlfriend?

525
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,880
Why don’t I know about it?

526
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Money fixes everything, huh?

527
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,780
Hello, Hoy.

528
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,790
Hello.

529
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,710
What are you saying? You’re mumbling.

530
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,480
You sent me the location but didn’t explain where you are.

531
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,680
How am I supposed to find you in this massive place?

532
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,670
I can’t understand you, speak up.

533
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,250
Hello?

534
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,730
Twenty-fifth floor.

535
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,250
Hoy!

536
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,680
What the hell is going on with you?

537
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,340
Damn it, I can’t get out.

538
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,240
What’s wrong with you?
Right behind you.

539
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,200
Idiot.

540
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I couldn’t find the necklace.

541
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:28,400
Maybe they hid it at the shrine.

542
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,870
If that’s the case, don’t worry.

543
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:34,680
I’ve got our men investigating quietly.

544
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,850
Hey, it’s not here!

545
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,800
Where did Tattoo's mom go?!

546
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,460
Something seems funny.

547
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,320
I had his mother go out for an errand

548
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,240
She didn’t bring anything with her

549
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,870
I can confirm that

550
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,870
Miss Nang, help us

551
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,070
Miss Nang

552
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,930
Shut up if you don’t want trouble

553
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,900
I think we should go

554
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,710
I don’t think they’ve hidden anything here

555
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:52,120
But before we leave, a good gangster should leave a mark

556
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:56,880
Ah
Ouch

557
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,190
Miss Nang and the boss have already made peace

558
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,560
You guys attacking us like this

559
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,560
You’ll surely face Miss Nang’s revenge

560
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,870
Oh, bring it on

561
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,200
I’ll teach Pee Nang myself

562
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,820
Show her what a real man’s punch feels like

563
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,820
Hey
Ah

564
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Oops, Miss Nang

565
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,010
Miss Nang is here to help

566
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,210
It’s definitely Miss Nang

567
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,900
What was that sound?

568
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,900
Didn’t you say you caught everyone?

569
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,620
Ouch
Ouch

570
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,090
Miss Nang

571
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,090
Miss Nang is here to help

572
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:01,630
I wasn’t going to get involved with the boss’s business anymore

573
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,940
But you attacked my people

574
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,940
I can’t let that slide

575
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,880
Oh shit..

576
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,520
Take this to the person who sent you here

577
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:02,050
Who hurt my people?

578
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,820
Whoever did must pay for their actions

579
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,780
Nine-zero

580
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,780
That’s a nice number

581
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:40,810
The lightest punishment.

582
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,430
Congratulations.

583
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,750
What have you all been up to?

584
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:07,630
Well...

585
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:09,560
Miss Nang

586
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,930
You see, Miss Nang made Yom perform Chinese opera

587
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,920
like Sun Wukong for the Gods

588
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,290
Didn’t I tell you guys

589
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,720
To investigate quietly?

590
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,720
And…

591
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:32,720
Here, Miss Nang sent this

592
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,700
She said it’s the fortune stick that decides the fate of the one in charge

593
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,440
Me?

594
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,870
Yes

595
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,110
Didn’t I tell you guys

596
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:57,080
To investigate quietly?

597
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:01,370
You picked the wrong people to mess with

598
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,370
You’ll bring misfortune to us all

599
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,500
Ouch

600
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,700
Where did you hide the necklace?

601
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,580
Huh?

602
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,920
It’s with your leader, right?

603
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,920
That Joker thief

604
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:29,610
Silence..

605
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,560
Fine

606
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,960
Start with them

607
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,730
Let them choose if they want to lose a foot or…

608
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,940
An ear

609
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,700
Yes, sir

610
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,710
Rak, Yom, laugh

611
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:16,930
Hello, Toi Ting

612
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,930
(Jack, come back quickly, someone suspicious is outside)

613
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:24,090
(Standing in front of the house, Grandma’s talking to them)

614
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:27,200
Okay, I’ll be right there

615
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,640
What’s wrong?

616
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,620
Well done, thank you

617
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,700
Oh, Jack, you’re just in time

618
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,950
Coach Wah came to visit

619
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:51,040
I'm going to cook dinner

620
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,420
Join us for a meal

621
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,050
Oh, thank you, but

622
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,120
I’ll pass

623
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,120
I was just stopping by

624
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,290
Alright, make yourself at home

625
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:02,840
Come on, Toi Ting, help me with dinner

626
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:15,600
How have you been, Jack?

627
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,600
Not so great

628
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,720
And you, Coach?

629
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,020
Not great either

630
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:28,460
You’ve heard the news, right? The association got shut down

631
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,310
No, I hadn’t heard

632
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:36,790
Can’t blame anyone

633
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,790
Part of it’s my fault

634
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:41,040
for choosing Carbon

635
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,970
To compete at the national level

636
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:47,390
I thought I could change someone that hot-headed

637
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,200
But I was wrong

638
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,000
Who am I to turn fire into water?

639
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,830
What happened with Carbon, Coach?

640
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,000
Drugs

641
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,440
He assaulted someone and left them disabled

642
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,830
He’s in prison now

643
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,060
Even his own father gave up on him

644
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,500
Cut ties and let him rot in jail

645
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:24,670
When the association got investigated, no one wanted to send their kids to train

646
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:30,000
Everyone’s probably paying for their actions now

647
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,120
I’m sorry to hear that, Coach

648
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,780
But that’s not why I came

649
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:52,900
I’m heading back south to find work

650
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,080
Before I go, I thought of you, Jack

651
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,000
I just wanted to come and sincerely apologize

652
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,410
For making the worst decision

653
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,210
If only I hadn’t been a coward

654
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,710
If I had stood up to those above me

655
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:12,710
It wouldn’t have ended like this

656
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,290
I’m really sorry

657
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:22,920
If you could forgive me, it would mean a lot

658
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,480
I used to think

659
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:45,470
That if you ever apologized to me

660
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,470
what I'd do

661
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:51,970
I’d be overjoyed

662
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,020
Seeing the person who wronged me in pain

663
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,000
And I’d be proud of myself

664
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,000
Because I’ve always done the right thing

665
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,540
And it would finally be time

666
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,650
For fate to recognize me

667
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,700
But now, honestly

668
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,370
I feel

669
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:26,960
Empty

670
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:35,090
Maybe because

671
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,410
it’s been so long

672
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,160
Your apology doesn’t

673
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,840
mean anything to me anymore

674
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,920
I can’t forgive you completely

675
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:11,700
But I believe that with time

676
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,600
Everything will get better

677
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,310
It’s okay

678
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,040
I understand

679
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:32,100
Well, I wish you luck on your path, Jack

680
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I’ll be going now

681
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,500
Tattoo, help me

682
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,420
Enough

683
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,440
Tattoo, help me

684
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,810
That’s enough

685
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:20,240
What are you all doing?

686
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,020
What are you doing?

687
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,410
This is the first step

688
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:26,100
Ouch

689
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,730
Get up

690
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,730
Take this

691
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,240
My first step

692
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,680
Has to be like this
Ouch!

693
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:43,520
Wow, you’ve got guts, just like the boss’s kid

694
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:46,470
Father’s son

695
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:50,530
Hoy, did you pee your pants?

696
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:52,530
I’m scared

697
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,190
I’ll ask you one last time

698
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:00,000
Where’s my necklace?

699
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
If you don’t answer

700
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,940
I'm going to cut your little brother off

701
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,500
and feed it to the ducks!

702
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,500
They’ll eat it whole

703
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:15,000
This small, one duck wouldn’t even be full

704
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,560
I’ll count to three

705
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,450
One

706
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,840
Two
No!

707
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,180
Three
No!

708
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,670
I pawned it all

709
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:26,550
Which pawn shop?

710
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:35,800
I don’t care where it is

711
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,600
Because you two are going to get it back for me

712
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,790
Got it?

713
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,790
What do you expect us to do?

714
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:44,800
Rob the pawn shop?

715
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:50,710
Of course, you managed to rob me

716
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:53,280
What’s one more robbery?

717
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:00,000
Well, why don’t you let him help one more time?

718
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,110
Alright, we got it

719
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:14,170
The Three Little Pigs Gang

720
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Who came up with that name?

721
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,400
So lame

722
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:23,010
Oh my God!

723
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,320
It’s the Joker thief’s contract

724
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,080
Joker

725
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,330
We’ll see who’s tougher

726
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,510
Rak, Yom, laugh

727
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:50,190
Joker

728
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,040
(Dream Journal)

729
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,680
(Learning Center Project)
(Giving kids a library, a strong community, Children have a place to learn, no need for loans)

730
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,290
(Our learning center)

731
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,000

(Standard blueprint for child learning centers)

733
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:16,150
I helped Joke fix a chair and a table for you

734
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:19,040
Then I saw the book, it looked interesting, can I read it?

735
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:21,290
Go ahead

736
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:31,870
Little…

737
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:35,310
Wond...

738
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:37,680
What does this word say?

739
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,740
Wonderful

740
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:42,750
Wonderful

741
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,750
The Wonderful Little One

742
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,480
I wish I could go to school like this too

743
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,160
I'd read the whole pile of books!

744
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:58,720
All of this was done by Joke.

745
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,690
He said he wanted to make amends for making you sad.

746
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:14,490
When the lights bright, it makes me miss your parents.

747
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,770
Dad,

748
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:27,820
Have some water first.

749
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:28,830
Here, have some water.

750
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:29,640
Thanks, mom.

751
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,550
How does it look?

752
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,880
I think Jack will like it for sure.

753
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,600
Yeah, I think so too.

754
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:45,000
(Your dad, whenever he fixes something, it breaks. Whatever he touches, he ruins.)

755
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,050
(I thought at first it would end up a mess.)

756
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:50,290
Just a bit more, a little bit.
(But after a while, this bookshelf corner...)

757
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,860
Stop, stop.
(But after a while, this bookshelf corner...)

758
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,860
One, two, three.
(But after a while, this bookshelf corner...)

759
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,170
Wow.
(It turned out quite nice, didn't it?)

760
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,480
Do you like it?
Yay, yay.

761
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,310
Do you like it?

762
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:01,380
Do you like it, Jack?

763
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,010
Are you happy, son?

764
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,270
Isn’t it beautiful?

765
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:07,130
Is it the way you like it, my clever boy?

766
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,260
Who made it for you?

767
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,260
Dad made it for you.

768
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:13,130
Come on, let's take a picture.

769
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,560
Smile beautifully, okay?

770
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:20,410
One, two, three.

771
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,450
People do foolish things

772
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:29,730
because they just want to make the ones they love happy.

773
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:13,260
Joke.

774
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:16,200
Hey, Joke.

775
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,770
Hey, Jack.

776
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,440
Hey, Jack!

777
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,360
What?

778
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,020
Hey, Jack!
Hey, hey!

779
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,350
Call for ice cream truck, will you?

780
01:03:57,350 --> 01:03:59,660
Are they selling or what?

781
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:02,220
Why are they in such a rush?

782
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:22,900
I really can’t hold onto this anymore.

783
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,080
I want to thank you for fixing the house

784
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:36,160
and for everything.

785
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,760
When will you stop using my room number

786
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,760
to order things like this?

787
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:47,000
Hey.

788
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:53,060
Your room and my room are basically the same thing.

789
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,370
Someone might see.

790
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:58,960
Didn’t you promise…

791
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:04,590
Not to let anyone find out?

792
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:07,160
The people around here...

793
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,880
What if they know we’re dating?

794
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:12,520
It’s exciting.

795
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:23,170
Wow, how long are we going

796
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:26,100
to have to keep hiding this?

797
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:31,740
Until I’ve paid off the boss.

798
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:39,010
By the way, is this your fortune slip?

799
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:42,310
I found it in front of your room.

800
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:45,000
Hmm.

801
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,820
Someone else gave it to me.

802
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,590
"The lost soul trapped in darkness will find that the right person

803
01:07:55,590 --> 01:08:01,860
is closer than they think when the time comes."

804
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,160
Who are you looking for?

805
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,820
The right person.

806
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,279
Turns out they're closer than I thought.

807
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:24,950
You mean that slip?

808
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,430
This one?

809
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:40,510
(Urgent! Seeking...)

810
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:45,000
(Urgent! Seeking...)
Looking for the model who worked for Aran the other day.

811
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:54,640
I think I saw someone who looks like him.

812
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,640
In the afternoon.

813
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,700
Where?

814
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:04,010
At Jack’s house.

815
01:09:08,029 --> 01:09:09,350
Oh.

816
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,229
Jack.

817
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,380
Keep this for me.

818
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:28,220
I knew it, they really are dating.

819
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:31,260
P’ Jack!

820
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,399
Sis!

821
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:33,040
Yes!

822
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,180
Yeah, but with all this,

823
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:36,760
I think you should get a set of fortune sticks.

824
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,520
Really?

825
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,240
Why?

826
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,040
Because it was blessed for three days and nights at the temple.

827
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,760
People use it, and after just three days,

828
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,450
their sales tripled!

829
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:45,000
Wow.

830
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,689
You don’t have to believe me.

831
01:09:46,689 --> 01:09:47,439
Brother,

832
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:49,590
For things like this, you have to try it to see.

833
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:52,010
Three thousand only.

834
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:52,960
But should I get it?

835
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,900
Just get one set.

836
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,320
Very quick decision-making!

837
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,460
Pay three thousand, quickly!

838
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,720
Hurry up!
Thanks.

839
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,630
Three thousand, you said?

840
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,320
It will bring you triple the income, right?

841
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,460
Triple.
Triple.

842
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,080
In three days, triple the amount.

843
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:06,800
Here you go.

844
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,480
Thank you, hope you have good luck and happiness.

845
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,990
Amen, amen.

846
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:12,310
Let me see.

847
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:14,310
Do you want to see anything else?

848
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:22,540
Ah, yeah, but don’t tell anyone.

849
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:24,540
That you saw me in Suphanimit...

850
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:25,840
Oh, okay, got it.

851
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,840
Wishing you success, lots of sales.

852
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,390
Thank you

853
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:33,910
I'll set this up and let the customers come.

854
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:34,680
Oh my, I forgot.

855
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,750
Let’s go.

856
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,070
Set it down first.

857
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:38,140
(But if next time it’s wrong...)

858
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,550
(You know that the older guys are strict.)

859
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:41,380
(Yes.)

860
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,480
Look at this.

861
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,150
The money will come now, you’ll see.

862
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,910
Oh, so many flies, no customers at all.

863
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:47,920
Oh, so many flies, no customers at all.
What’s up ?

864
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,490
The flies or customers ?

865
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:51,120
Get me a coffee, please.

866
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,010
Okay.

867
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,080
What’s he having?

868
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,080
Coffee, right, make it right away.

869
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,800
Here, let me scoop the ice.

870
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,040
See

871
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,510
Jack.
Hey, hey.

872
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:10,670
Call for ice cream truck, will you?

873
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:12,370
(Jack)

874
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:13,450
Are they selling or what?

875
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,710
Jack.

876
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,140
Got it?

877
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:18,560
Uh huh

878
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,410
Alright, here’s your ten baht change

879
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:27,400
You’re so distracted, I can tell you’re thinking about someone

880
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,660
Right?

881
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,440
Is that right?

882
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,840
You’ve got a girlfriend, don’t you?

883
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,950
Oh, you’ve got a girlfriend!

884
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:33,880
Teens these days

885
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,160
Oops, no

886
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,040
No,

887
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,300
it’s just that today there’s been troublemakers all day

888
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,750
So I had to go back home to sort things out

889
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,720
It’s been a hectic day

890
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,920
Hectic

891
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,600
Stressful, oh

892
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:51,280
And is the person causing Hectic the same person?

893
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,520
You know they say

894
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:58,210
If one day you think of someone more than three times,

895
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:02,720
It means you care about them

896
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,450
Oh my!!

897
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,900
That’s how teens are

898
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,700
You're getting a girlfriend soon!

899
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,260
Oh dear!

900
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,260
Here’s your ten baht change

901
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:16,070
Let him plat.

902
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,760
Ten baht change

903
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,980
Why don’t you try pulling a fortune stick

904
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,520
Just ten baht

905
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,030
A fortune stick for ten baht

906
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:24,470
Hmm

907
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:27,040
Next time, it’ll be twenty, you know

908
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,360
In five minutes, it’ll be twenty baht

909
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,140
That’s a fifty percent discount for the first person

910
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,970
First one, quick, give it a try

911
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,860
Number nine
The number nine

912
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,700
Will it mean progress, or what, huh?

913
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:43,820
Progress like this means you’ll definitely get a girlfriend

914
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:45,260
Oh my

915
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,260
Is it right, which one

916
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:49,260
Oh, here it is

917
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,620
Number nine

918
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:52,640
Hey, don’t read it or his luck will change

919
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,760
I didn’t read it, I didn’t read it

920
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,560
Didn’t read it at all

921
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,560
Didn’t read it at all

922
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,880
(Fortune stick number nine)
(When the fool changes black to white, the fate of the forgiver will change)

923
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,530
(Toi Ting)

924
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,310
Hello, Toi Ting

925
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:12,430
(Hope is coming to raid the house right now)

926
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:15,540
(You need to come back immediately)

927
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:16,670
This time it’s Hope, huh

928
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:18,860
Okay, I’ll head back right away

929
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:20,430
Wait for me

930
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:21,250
Where are you rushing off to?

931
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:22,570
Jack

932
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:23,970
Never mind, never mind

933
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:24,980
Probably going to meet his girlfriend

934
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,550
Hey, this is my house

935
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:35,290
No one’s allowed in unless I say so

936
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:39,450
Whoa, it’s like you knew we were coming

937
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:42,380
What are you so scared of

938
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:44,630
Who are you hiding

939
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:46,630
What nonsense are you spouting

940
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,000
The only one in my house is my grandma sleeping inside

941
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,430
Do you even have manners?

942
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:54,400
Manners?

943
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,110
How do you spell that, Rak, Yom?

944
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,270
I can’t spell that

945
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:09,870
G-e-t get, h-i-m him!

946
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,000
What?

947
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,110
Why are you standing there like idiots

948
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:21,110
I told you to grab him

949
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:23,430
You, grab him

950
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:26,960
You guys are useless, I’ll do it myself

951
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,280
You’re digging your own grave, Jack

952
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,280
Damn it

953
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,000
Here, boss

954
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,910
Jack

955
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Who’s fighting in front of my house

956
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:06,660
I’ll stuff poison in their mouths with some chive dumplings

957
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:13,920
Here’s the deal, Grandma

958
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,520
I got a tip-off that there’s a thief hiding here

959
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,200
If you don’t want any trouble with the boss

960
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,200
I suggest you let us search the place

961
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,200
Search if you want, go ahead

962
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,940
Talk too much, your breath stinks

963
01:15:58,510 --> 01:15:59,210
Well

964
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,460
Didn’t find anything, boss

965
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:10,410
Thank you, Grandma, for cooperating

966
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:12,410
Unlike some people

967
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:14,980
I’ll remember this, you

968
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,980
I don't care, idiot!

969
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,630
If you want to settle it now, I’m ready

970
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:22,630
Not today

971
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:24,370
I’m in a hurry

972
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,650
Ugh

973
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,420
You too?

974
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:37,540
Let’s go

975
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:13,080
(Fortune stick number nine)
(When the fool changes black to white, the fate of the forgiver will change)

976
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:27,430
Ah Joke wrote a letter revealing everything

977
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:33,470
That he’s the thief who stole from the boss

978
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:38,840
And the time he lied to you at the bank years ago

979
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:48,490
He came here to return the ring, didn’t he

980
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:58,270
I’m sorry, Grandma

981
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,460
I couldn’t keep it

982
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:07,490
Because no matter what, it wasn’t right

983
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,700
You did the right thing

984
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:29,200
But I have to confess, Grandma

985
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,260
The first time Joke gave me the ring

986
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:35,000
I was so happy

987
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
So happy I wanted to keep it

988
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,410
And run away far from here

989
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:50,570
But then I thought about it, the way he got it was through theft, Grandma

990
01:18:53,760 --> 01:19:00,960
It made me feel like that ring wasn’t mine anymore

991
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,690
How old is Joke anyway?

992
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:12,390
He’s just trying to help in whatever way he can

993
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,620
He’s so remorseful

994
01:19:18,810 --> 01:19:20,810
Are you really not going to forgive him?

995
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:57,110
This is yours

996
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:13,800
I did it all myself

997
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,960
Try it

998
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,650
If it’s good

999
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:21,320
I might change careers and start selling chive dumplings

1000
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,000
I got the recipe from Grandma

1001
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:31,840
Thank you so much for letting me stay here

1002
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,530
Even though it wasn’t for long

1003
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:39,740
But you chose not to keep the ring, right?

1004
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,400
I guess I can’t convince you otherwise

1005
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:52,830
Jack, even though my apology may be too late

1006
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:56,880
I want you to know

1007
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:02,280
Your goodness has changed someone like me

1008
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,730
From now on, I don’t know if we’ll ever meet again

1009
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:14,150
Take care of yourself

1010
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,460
What did Joke write

1011
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,920
It’s nothing, Grandma

1012
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,940
He just said he’s turning over a new leaf

1013
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,440
And he said

1014
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,350
He’s going to sell chive dumplings using your recipe

1015
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:55,770
There it is, you’re smiling

1016
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:58,760
You might have forgiven Joke

1017
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,760
But you just don’t realize it yet

1018
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:08,560
And you rushing over here just in time

1019
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,430
Was it because you were worried about me, or about Joke?

1020
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:16,760
Oh Grandma, of course I was worried about you

1021
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,050
Just hoping he makes it out okay

1022
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:35,050
And never comes back here

1023
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:10,710
Hello

1024
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:13,840
I’m here

1025
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:40,570
I came to negotiate with Aran

1026
01:23:40,570 --> 01:23:42,180
I investigated and found out

1027
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,740
The necklace was sent to an underground auction

1028
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:46,760
Aran will pose as a Hong Kong millionaire to get in

1029
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,180
So basically, I

1030
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:50,180
Have to be surrounded by assassins, right?

1031
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:54,240
What we need to do is get in and find out who got the necklace

1032
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:58,230
I’m sorry for dragging you into something you’re not even involved in

1033
01:23:58,230 --> 01:23:59,450
Come here, I’ll help

1034
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:00,910
Lift up your shirt

1035
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:03,770
Oh my god, Rat teeth Aran!
