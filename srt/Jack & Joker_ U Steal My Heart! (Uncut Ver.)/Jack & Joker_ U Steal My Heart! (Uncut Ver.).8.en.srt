This series is purely a work of fiction
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,180
If you want your grandma to get treatment,

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,000
you’d better treat Rose well.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,700
And more importantly, you need to cut that friend out of your life.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,920
Do you have a girlfriend?

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,250
No, I don't.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,610
What about the water carrier we saw this morning?

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,740
You seem to like him

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,800
He’s just a homeless guy, hanging around.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,000
He helps with chores, cooking,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,240
and bothering my grandma, asking to stay.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,480
It’s like you want me out of your life.

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,280
Stop interfering in my business with Rose

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Ah! A ghost!

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,120
Please don't haunt me.

16
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,210
What ghost?

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,640
It's me.

18
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,910
Oh.

19
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,910
It's you?

20
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,009
You're such a scaredy cat.

21
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,670
You startled me!

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,360
What are you having?

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,990
Herbal Chinese natural supplements.

24
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,150
I'm taking them to complement the doctor's medicine.

25
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,880
So I can recover quickly.

26
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,640
I want to get out of the hospital once and for all.

27
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,310
I haven't been sleeping well.

28
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,750
I feel awfully dizzy

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,120
So while we wait for the surgery,

30
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,780
why don’t we go home and rest?

31
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,200
No, she can’t leave yet.

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,620
There are medicines to be given and blood pressure
checks in the morning and evening.

33
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,280
And she has a heart condition.

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,240
If anything happens, you won’t make it back to the hospital in time.

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,590
Right now, the doctor’s schedule is packed,

36
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,100
so she has to stay in the hospital.

37
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,930
Did you hear about the news from the OR?

38
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,840
Dr. Suthee, he has another kid.

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,190
They came to the hospital,

40
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,480
causing a big argument and word is, they’re cutting all ties.

41
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,130
He even brought some old lady to stay on this floor.

42
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,360
Her name is something like Jen Wen, a Chinese-sounding name.

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,320
That’s me.

44
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,180
Oops.

45
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,380
Anyway, thank you very much.

46
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,760
I'll just do it.

47
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,410
Hello, this is the inpatient ward.

48
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,320
(Yes, hello, sorry)

49
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,660
Jen Wen, in room 703.

50
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,670
How’s the patient?

51
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,400
(Room 703)

52
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,660
(They’re probably asleep, let me check.)

53
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,660
Oh, that’s alright.

54
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,570
And how’s their relative doing? Are they okay?

55
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,150
(Excuse me?)

56
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,550
It’s okay, no need to call them.

57
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,920
As long as they’re fine.

58
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,010
I tried calling them but couldn’t reach them,

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
so I just wanted to check in.

60
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
(They went into the room already.)

61
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,320
Thank you.

62
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,360
(You’re welcome, goodbye.)
Goodbye.

63
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,400
Looks like Grandma's grandson is worried about his boyfriend.

64
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,600
Oh.

65
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,740
How sweet.

66
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,180
(Debt inheritance Project)

67
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:17,420
Rest assured, Rose, my team and I will only

68
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,370
choose the best, most marketable work.

69
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,050
(Thank you, Nang, for handling everything.)

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,500
(Jack, take the next right.)

71
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,280
(Got it.)

72
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,080
Is Jack going with you?

73
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
Of course, Nang.

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,420
I would never go see Lompran alone.

75
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,430
(Is that okay, Rose?)

76
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,550
I’ve heard Lompran is quite strange.

77
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,590
I’m afraid he’ll pull something on you.

78
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,100
I'm not scared, I can fight back.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The contestant is ready.

80
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,270
It’s time for the selection, Rose.

81
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,010
(I hope everything goes well for you.)

82
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:53,680
Okay.

83
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,720
Is our team ready?

84
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,800
Ready!

85
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,050
Let’s begin.

86
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,850
It’s time to find...

87
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,360
Search the heavens to free people from debt.

88
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,660
Excuse me, Lompran said

89
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,010
there would be only one guest, right?

90
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,680
Jack’s here with me, so if Jack can’t enter, then I won’t either.

91
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,850
Ah, Rose?

92
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Right on time.

93
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,540
Bring her in, bring her in.

94
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,370
Please come over here.

95
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,760
Uh, what’s this?

96
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,300
Afternoon tea.

97
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,350
I meant...

98
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:19,490
Oh, it’s today’s theme.

99
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,490
The game is “Put Yourself in Someone Else’s Shoes.”

100
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,830
You’ll have to act as if you’re from a different social class

101
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,360
to see how tough life can be

102
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,610
for someone in that position.

103
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,429
If someone can’t handle it, such as

104
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,059
stumbling in high heels or dropping earrings, whatever, they lose immediately.

105
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,660
It means you don’t understand the other person’s hardship.

106
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,060
Confusing? It’s a tradition of mine with my maids.

107
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,850
If I can’t handle this outfit,

108
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,140
I lose too.

109
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,080
What happens if you lose?

110
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,760
I’ll be fired.

111
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,710
But if I lose,

112
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,880
I can’t exactly fire myself from my own house,  can I?

113
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,360
That doesn’t seem fair.

114
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,970
It’s fair!

115
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,370
The maids knew the rules of this house
before they started working here.

116
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,370
Right?

117
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,930
Right?!

118
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,160
Yes.

119
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,120
Hey, driver, your job’s done.

120
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,160
Wait outside.

121
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,160
No.

122
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,520
Jack came with me, so he stays with me.

123
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,130
Because that’s my tradition.

124
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,000
Fine, let's get to it.

125
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,870
The reason I called you here today,

126
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,760
is to discuss our wedding.

127
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,150
I’m glad you brought it up.

128
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,850
I want to cancel our wedding plans.

129
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,610
Why?

130
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,730
Because I don’t love you.

131
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,130
What?

132
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
You lose.

133
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,720
But Master Lompran, I don’t want to leave.

134
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Rules are rules.

135
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,760
Take her out.

136
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,820
Master Lompran, please don’t kick me out!

137
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,220
Master Lompran, please!

138
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,240
Sorry, I’m sorry.

139
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,030
Isn’t this a bit too easy?

140
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,580
If this reaches the Four Horsemen,

141
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,200
your father will have a tough time.

142
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,740
And you, driver, what right do you have to touch Rose?

143
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,850
He’s my friend, show some respect.

144
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,120
A servant is a servant, no matter the name change.

145
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,020
It's still a servant!!

146
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Even if you cancel the wedding,

147
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,610
you know that’s not something easily done.

148
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,980
The first option.

149
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,600
You’ll have to play the Four Horsemen’s game

150
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
to make a new deal.

151
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,150
The second is,

152
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:02,430
your father will have to leave the Four Horsemen.

153
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,470
If we can’t settle this peacefully,

154
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,140
then let’s play the game.

155
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,280
The same game your father and mine played.

156
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,600
The Ladder to Heaven.

157
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,200
You’ve done your homework.

158
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,940
If I win, first,

159
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,640
you must marry me.

160
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:36,840
Second, change the tradition, servants can no longer be friends.

161
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:45,520
Third, he’ll be my guard dog for one day,

162
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,880
and he’ll play this game in your place.

163
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,730
His name is Jack.

164
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,810
And Jack will not play your ridiculous game.

165
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
Well, then, I have no choice.

166
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,980
You’re left with option two.

167
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,920
Shall I call the uncles right now?

168
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,610
I’ll play in Rose’s place.

169
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,610
Jack!

170
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,800
If Jack wins,

171
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,450
First, you must leave me alone.

172
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,630
Second, you must stop insulting Jack and treat him as an equal.

173
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,000
And third...

174
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,060
Jack can ask for anything he wants.

175
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,230
Bet it’s money, right?

176
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,190
Deal.

177
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,150
But let me tell you this.

178
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,210
I’ve never lost this game to anyone.

179
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,250
The doctor is really handsome.

180
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,220
Who are you here to see?

181
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,000
I’m here to report to the professor about a patient.

182
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,610
All reports have been sent to the ward, haven’t they?

183
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,080
Oh, really?

184
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,160
Why does your coat say you're a woman?

185
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,680
(Dr. Tiwaporn Sintanapardi)

186
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,710
Oh no!

187
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,090
Whose coat are you wearing?

188
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,660
Take that off right now!

189
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,200
Are you even a real doctor?

190
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,490
Answer!

191
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,200
Or I’ll call security.

192
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,000
Hey, Ton, there you are!

193
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,320
The professor’s been looking for you.

194
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,280
Hello, Sa!

195
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,760
This is Dr. Ton, from orthopedics.

196
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,560
He’s Dr. Kaew’s boyfriend.

197
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,010
He keeps wearing her coat by mistake.

198
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,480
Oh, so it’s Dr. Kaew’s boyfriend. You should’ve said so, I was so scared!

199
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,120
I’ll be going now before the professor waits too long.

200
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,930
Okay

201
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,550
You’ve been gone a long time.

202
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,270
Someone said Dad had a fit the other day,

203
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,030
and I wondered if you were back.

204
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,580
Turns out it really is you.

205
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,260
So, what are you doing here?

206
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,540
Don’t tell me you’re here to see Dad.

207
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,160
I’m here to take care of a friend’s grandma.

208
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,090
She’s been waiting for surgery for a while now

209
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,650
and she hasn't gotten it yet so I wanted to talk to Dad.

210
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,710
This friend must be really important to you

211
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,070
for you to come see Dad.

212
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,030
You should come home sometimes.

213
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,030
Dad and Mom miss you.

214
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,920
Funny, I’m not you.

215
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,550
Living Dad’s dream, I see.

216
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,950
Wow, Dr. Theeraphat Khongsuk.

217
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,950
Of course.

218
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,550
Here we are at Dad’s office.

219
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,640
Take it slow, I’ll help talk to him.

220
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,250
Dad’s not here, must still be in surgery.

221
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Is this really Dad’s room?

222
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,450
Yes, why?

223
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,010
Look, he even stocked up on your favorite minced pork noodles.

224
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,980
Dad really misses you.

225
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,360
Otherwise, he wouldn’t stock up on noodles for you, right?

226
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,580
But since you haven’t come home,

227
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,280
he just eats them himself.

228
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,230
Are you joking?

229
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,340
No, Dad’s on shift tonight,

230
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,930
and I’ve got reports to finish so I can’t come with you.

231
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,920
Do you even know what time Dad has dinner?

232
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,270
Why are you asking?

233
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,820
The rules are we take turns rolling the dice.

234
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,000
If our mascots land on a space, they must follow the instructions.

235
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,660
Keep moving until someone reaches the goal.

236
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,860
The player with the most accumulated money wins.

237
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,860
Easy?

238
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,450
Let’s pick our mascots.

239
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,810
If I get an odd number, you choose first.

240
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,360
If it’s even, I will.

241
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,790
I’ll pick red,

242
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,730
as fiery as my love for you, Rose.

243
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,400
I’ll choose green.

244
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,880
Okay, let’s sit down.

245
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Game start!

246
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
I’ll go first.

247
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,590
(Luckily found a wallet, gained 6,000 baht, and a bonus roll.)
That’s how it’s done!

248
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,560
(Won the lottery, gained 2,000 baht.)
Woo! This game is mine!

249
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,410
Jack, it’s your turn.

250
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:36,320
(Business didn’t go well, gained 300 baht.)

251
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,450
You need to work on your singing.

252
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:54,060
(This is a motar that won't break, no matter how hard you pound it.)

253
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,260
If the judges see yours.

254
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,700
It's going to blow away their minds.

255
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,490
I meant the product.

256
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Weirdo.

257
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,260
Where did Auntie Jeab go?

258
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,260
It's almost our turn.

259
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,400
She's not picking up.

260
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,840
She probably left her phone at the shrine.

261
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,620
I'll call again.

262
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,320
She's not picking up.

263
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,620
Yeah, that’s enough.

264
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,470
Calm down and focus for a bit, okay?

265
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,000
I’ll help you present.

266
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,490
Number thirty-seven, please.

267
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,490
Let’s go, quickly.

268
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,350
Hello, everyone.
Hello!

269
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Please present.

270
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,040
And this is the innovation that helps Thai farmers

271
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,220
increase their yield to infinity, like a bird.

272
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,680
But it’s not peck.

273
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,440
And how about crows?

274
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,520
Don’t even think about it!

275
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,120
Because this is the necklace that turns a blind eye
and a deaf ear.

276
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,520
Shoo!

277
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,200
Perfect, perfect!

278
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,990
Excuse me for a moment, please.

279
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,020
Perfect, here’s the crown!

280
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,800
Oops!

281
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,650
And if you want to be an outstanding farmer,

282
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,680
wear “turn a blind eye and a deaf ear” necklace!

283
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
And you’ll love it.

284
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:36,930
But wait, worms, bugs, ants don’t have ears!

285
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,040
So it only works on birds and crows, right?

286
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
Hmm.

287
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,820
Oh, when the crow flies,

288
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,360
the worms and stuff get scared,

289
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,810
and they fly off with wings too, right?

290
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,760
Right?

291
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,710
Right, right, exactly!

292
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,960
Is that so?

293
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
Interesting.

294
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,550
But I think you should just take this home and use it yourself.

295
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:13,010
And you should take all of this back to play at home, too.

296
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,010
You’re wasting everyone’s time.

297
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,130
Next number, please.

298
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,760
(Choices)

299
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,680
Choices.

300
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,800
Randomly choose a situation that gives us a big sum of money.

301
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,720
You can either choose or throw it away,

302
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,680
but if you choose, you have to roll the dice again.

303
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,810
If it’s an even number, you get the money.

304
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:57,190
But if it’s an odd number, the opposite happens.

305
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,610
The opposite.

306
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,900
The bigger the money, the worse the opposite outcome.

307
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Number four, please.

308
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:24,500
(Choice: Invest in stocks. Either get a 3 million baht dividend or be 3 million in debt.)

309
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,840
Are you choosing, Jack?

310
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,550
(Choice: Invest in stocks. Either get a 3 million baht
dividend or be 3 million in debt.)
(Play: Throw away.)

311
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,720
I’ll pass.

312
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Yes!

313
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,930
(Choice)

314
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,990
I choose number two.

315
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,870
(Choice: Sell your kidney and get 100,000 baht or die during surgery.)

316
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,330
You know, poor people,

317
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:38,040
when they get money that’s more than they’ve earned in their whole life,

318
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,360
they don’t care what they have to lose.

319
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,580
I choose!

320
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,120
Yes!

321
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,040
Change your mind, Rose.

322
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,540
These people are not right for us.

323
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,540
Don’t befriend them.

324
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
(Choice)

325
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,700
Number one, please.

326
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,930
(Choice: Open your house to a stranger.)

327
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:55,060
(Get a new friend who gives you 100,000 baht,
or a thief who robs you blind.)

328
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,000
If you go back to your room now, you won’t make it.

329
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,710
So I need to find a new place to crash, huh?

330
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,230
Thanks for fixing the house, by the way.

331
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,030
Thanks for everything.

332
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,030
Like hell I’m sleeping on the floor!

333
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,240
Letting you sleep in the room is a blessing already.

334
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,580
I could send you to sleep on the street!

335
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,240
Students, pay your respects.

336
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,000
Promise me.

337
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,530
I’ve promised you a hundred times that I’ll stop being a thief.

338
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,990
Promise you won’t disappear

339
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,160
until I’ve achieved my dream.

340
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,990
I choose!

341
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,270
Jack is back.

342
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,760
It’s the last round, but you won’t catch up with me.

343
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,220
Just a little over ten thousand left.

344
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,780
Hmm.

345
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,450
(Final round)
(Square 45: Customer gives a 500 baht tip. Square 46: Receive a 300,000 baht inheritance.)

346
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,650
(Square 47: Donate all your money. Square 48: Win 2,000 baht from the lottery.)

347
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,080
(Square 49: Get a 70,000 baht bonus. Square 50: Collect gold and sell it for 25,000 baht.)

348
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,560
Come on, baby! I choose number two.

349
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:40,000
Number two.

350
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,560
(Number three: Donate all your money.)
Damn it!

351
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Your turn, Jack.

352
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,950
Yes.

353
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,950
(Customer gives a 500 baht tip.)

354
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,200
No!

355
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,670
Don’t forget what we agreed on.

356
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:52,800
You need to stop messing with me, treat Jack equally,

357
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,040
and give him one thing he wants.

358
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,230
And if I don’t?

359
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,470
I’ll tell Uncle Four Horsemen.

360
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,110
You’re a game master, right?

361
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:22,250
You should know that cheaters are exiled.

362
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:27,200
A game is a game, and rules are rules.

363
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,280
Fine.

364
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:52,030
Auntie Jeab, Jae Oh, what do you mean by that?

365
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:57,240
I knew it! You played the original Heaven’s Ladder game?

366
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,370
If you’re going to play Four Horsemen’s Game,

367
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,910
you need real lives at stake.

368
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,190
(Congratulations! Remaining balance: 161,000 baht.)

369
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,870
This means not only are they taking all your money,

370
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,120
but also…

371
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,280
(Sorry! Remaining balance: 0 baht, and your kidney will be sold.)
It can’t be helped, the game included selling a kidney. That’s too much!

372
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,550
That’s too much!

373
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:22,490
A game is a game, and rules are rules, right?

374
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,320
Look!

375
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:36,340
Ahh! I won!

376
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,530
I’m saved!

377
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,840
Your last wish, say it.

378
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,260
Write down whatever amount you want.

379
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,620
Hey!

380
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,630
I don’t want money.

381
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,630
For my last wish,

382
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,960
I want you to cancel all penalties for Auntie Jeab,

383
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,560
especially the one about taking her kidney, isn’t that a bit much?

384
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,900
You want to be a hero, huh?

385
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,040
Let me do you a favor.

386
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,050
These people knew the rules before they entered the game.

387
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:39,330
But fine, I’ll cancel the kidney penalty.

388
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:43,550
She’ll still be punished anyway.

389
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:48,820
We’ll just take the money instead.

390
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,820
The kidney’s worth about 100,000 baht.

391
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:55,540
I hope you’re satisfied, Mr.Jack.

392
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,050
(Not true!)

393
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,640
Auntie!

394
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,160
Auntie!

395
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,860
At least she only lost the money and not her kidney.

396
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,850
With a whole body, you can always start over.

397
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:40,480
Is it that easy for someone whose life is in debt?

398
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,160
Are you stressed?

399
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,530
How about we celebrate today?

400
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,070
Wherever you want to go, I’ll treat you for one whole day.

401
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:03,210
My grandma’s sick, so I haven’t really gone out much lately.

402
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,680
Besides, I’m not really into going out.

403
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,000
What’s wrong with your grandma?

404
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,750
Where’s she being treated? How much does it cost?

405
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,140
I can get you the best doctor in the country.

406
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,680
No need, Rose.

407
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,320
I’ve already taken her to the hospital.

408
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,680
It's eased my worries a bit.

409
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,640
Now I’m just worried about the wait for surgery.

410
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,110
I’d feel better if it could happen sooner.

411
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:47,940
Then today, let me make you happy, Jack,

412
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,280
so you’ll have good energy to take care of your grandma.

413
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,650
Let me take you out to celebrate.

414
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,650
Please?

415
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,570
Okay, sure.

416
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,650
Jack!

417
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
Is Jack here?

418
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,900
Joke, Joke!
What is it, Aunt Jeab?

419
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,740
Jack, where’s Jack?

420
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,900
He’s not here.

421
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,150
Call him for me, I need help.

422
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,350
Can you hold on to this for me?

423
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:23,110
What’s going on, Auntie?
Just get Jack, please.

424
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,130
Calm down, Auntie.

425
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,380
What do you guys want now? Tattoo already paid off all his debts.

426
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,380
We’re not debt collectors.

427
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,450
We’re from the Four Horsemen.

428
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,070
Four Horsemen?

429
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:44,960
Mali Mahattanapatamakorn joined the Four Horsemen’s Game.

430
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,480
She must compensate by giving up her kidney.

431
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,000
But the exchange has changed

432
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,710
from her kidney to 100,000 baht.

433
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,060
Joke!

434
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,430
Please call Jack for me.

435
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,230
Please help and have Jack talk to them.

436
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,430
Help me, please, Joke.

437
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,240
Why does it have to be Jack, Auntie?

438
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,720
Because Jack played the game and I lost.

439
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,420
I need him to negotiate for me.

440
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,340
What?

441
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,340
What’s going on?

442
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,680
Rose, wait in the car.

443
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,790
I’ll be right back.

444
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:25,210
Jack!

445
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,280
There you are, Jack.

446
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,160
Jack, come here.

447
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,860
Help me, Jack! Don’t let them take my money!

448
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,580
I have nothing left!

449
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,470
Please, Jack!

450
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:42,030
Auntie, if you don’t give them the money,

451
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,630
they’ll take your kidney instead.

452
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:47,900
Just talk to them for me, please, Jack!

453
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,320
I’ve done everything I can, Auntie.

454
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,960
Do something, Jack!

455
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,010
Hey!

456
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,480
You agreed to this with the Four Horsemen!

457
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
Do you want to die?

458
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,240
Hey, Mom.

459
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,100
What the hell is going on?

460
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
I just wanted to help make money.

461
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,320
Then I played the game, and I lost.

462
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,590
Now they want to take all our money.

463
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Please calm down, sir.

464
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,200
It’s a done deal.

465
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,210
Come with me.

466
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:42,270
What the hell are you doing?

467
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,030
How can you toy with people’s lives like this?

468
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,590
I…

469
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,710
I have to do my job.

470
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
What fucking job?

471
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,480
Is your job fucking people's lives up?

472
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,660
Anwer me!

473
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,400
Fine.

474
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,560
Punch me.

475
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:11,810
Do you think I feel good about what I did?

476
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,580
Don't think that I don't have the guts to do it!

477
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,290
What the hell is that burning smell?

478
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,470
Fuck!

479
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,720
Does it hurt?

480
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,050
Not as much as what you did to us.

481
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,540
Jack.

482
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,050
Are you ok? You were gone for so long.

483
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,510
I was so worried.

484
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,990
Return to where you belong.

485
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,560
It’s okay, let’s go.

486
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,940
Grandma, try tasting it.

487
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
Why is there so little dough?

488
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,040
It’s a low-carb recipe, for health.

489
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,000
It's delicious.

490
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,880
Are you going to open up and a shop and compete with me?

491
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,920
You could sell this!

492
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,590
Really?

493
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,140
Mmm.

494
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,800
Delicious, delicious.

495
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,180
So who are you giving this to?

496
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,250
I’m giving it to Dr. Suthi.

497
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,250
He's coming to perform Grandma’s surgery.

498
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,730
Why don’t you call him Dad?

499
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,430
Isn’t Dr. Suthi your father?

500
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,280
I heard the nurses gossiping about it.

501
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,530
Come.

502
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,560
You argue with your father often, don’t you?

503
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:58,090
Parents, even when they’re angry...

504
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,990
...they’ll never hate us.

505
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,760
I hope you can make peace with your dad.

506
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,880
Thank you.

507
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,020
Will you eat with me?

508
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,750
No, I’m full.

509
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:33,290
Delicious, delicious.

510
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,200
Come in.

511
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,840
What?

512
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,190
Top said you’ve been eating only instant noodles lately.

513
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,050
So I made clean-style chive dumplings for you.

514
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:35,320
It’s healthier.

515
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,630
What do you want?

516
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:51,050
A patient named Jern Wen Ngow Thong doesn’t have much money.

517
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:56,010
She probably won’t be able to stay here long.

518
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,050
So I wanted to ask you to speed up the surgery for her.

519
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:10,000
Don’t you think other patients need the same thing too?

520
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:12,890
And why should I help that woman?

521
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,800
What’s your connection to her?

522
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,530
She’s the one who made me want to be a better person.

523
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,130
She made me want to return to an honest profession.

524
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,680
By selling this?

525
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,920
How much do you think you’ll make from it?

526
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:47,720
You don’t even have much money, so why take on more burdens?

527
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,440
And why don’t you put her in the general ward?

528
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,490
Her grandson arranged everything.

529
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:04,540
He probably wants her to be comfortable.

530
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,850
So he's poor but too proud?

531
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,320
And if I don’t help, you’ll probably rob someone to pay for it, right?

532
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:20,000
A thief is always a thief.

533
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:30,040
Has time never changed your mind, Dad?

534
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,700
You never blame yourself, do you?

535
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:41,000
I’m like this because of you.

536
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,400
I’m not your father.

537
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,300
Get out.

538
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,370
Nang said Tattoo’s project was hard to expand on,

539
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:18,370
so it wasn’t selected.

540
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,990
How about this, I'll ask my father.

541
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:27,660
Maybe there’s a position open for Tattoo and his mom at home.

542
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,210
So they can work at my house.

543
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,520
What do you think, Jack?

544
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,930
Yes, that sounds good.

545
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:37,170
Thank you.

546
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,630
The song seems a bit sleepy, I’ll be right back.

547
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,120
Oh, hey.

548
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,760
Wow, are you serving today?

549
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,760
Yeah, some of the staff didn’t show up,

550
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,720
so I have to do it myself, that’s just how it is.

551
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,240
So..

552
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,700
Joke?

553
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,000
He said he's looking after your grandma.

554
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,550
Yeah, why...

555
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,400
Oh, we’re friends, so we help each other, right?

556
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,370
I get it, I won’t disturb you.

557
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:36,370
Enjoy yourselves.

558
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,360
Let’s toast, Jack.

559
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,460
Sure.

560
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,280
Can you finish it all in one go?

561
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:52,950
They say when people are stressed and start dancing,

562
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:56,940
endorphins get released, making them relax.

563
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:02,370
But I can’t dance at all.

564
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:04,920
Rose can’t dance either.

565
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,620
So let’s not know how to dance together, okay?

566
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,540
Shall we?

567
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,560
Let’s dance.

568
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:12,840
Wait..

569
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,310
Let’s dance!

570
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:20,310
Dance.

571
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,220
Dance like this.

572
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,540
Spin!

573
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:32,370
But no one’s spinning around.

574
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,400
Spin, Jack!

575
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,440
There are so many people today.

576
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,720
(Dance, Jack!)

577
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,680
Okay.

578
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,420
(A thief is always a thief.)

579
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,670
(Joke)
Everyone else is dancing.

580
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,970
Come on, Jack, it’s your turn.

581
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:36,550
Alright.

582
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,390
(Hoy: Jack and Rose, huh?)

583
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:01,470
(Tattoo: So sweet, probably forgotten his friends and grandma by now.)

584
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:05,150
Come on, Jack, it’s your turn.

585
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,900
I saw Dad sitting quietly in his room.

586
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,630
He’s like this every time you argue.

587
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,900
Do you think he’s sad?

588
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,440
He’s never even seen me as his son.

589
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,320
People are strange, right?

590
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,580
The more they love each other, the less they speak honestly.

591
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:22,830
Both sides just want to hurt each other again and again

592
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:27,280
because they’re afraid they’ll get hurt if the other doesn’t love them the same anymore.

593
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,540
Stop comforting me, Top.

594
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:35,760
He scolded me and kicked me out.

595
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,930
He’s never called me his son, not once.

596
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,460
Is this what love is?

597
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:47,270
I’m not comforting you, I’m just telling the truth.

598
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:52,000
I’ve been with Dad all along, and I know how he shows his love.

599
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,870
He doesn’t show it to you, but I see it.

600
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,580
but I see it.

601
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,740
(A patient named Jern Wen Ngow Thong doesn’t have much money.)

602
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:25,780
She’s the one who made me want to be a better person.

603
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:29,000
She made me want to return to an honest profession.

604
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:47,770
Come in.

605
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:55,010
Excuse me, I’m here to deliver the patient’s case documents.

606
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,510
Can you get me the files for the patient named Jern Wen Ngow Thong?

607
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,510
Sure.

608
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,600
How are you feeling today?

609
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:25,080
I’m feeling a bit better, doctor.

610
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,010
Are you still feeling dizzy?

611
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:35,840
Just a little bit.

612
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,040
How did you like the chive dumplings, doctor?

613
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,810
Joke made them himself.

614
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:54,990
Oh, I see.

615
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:03,860
Your son is such a sweet, good kid.

616
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:09,670
Even though he may not be great in everyone’s eyes,

617
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:13,490
he never stops trying.

618
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:17,770
If he were my real grandchild,

619
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:21,680
I’d be so proud of him.

620
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,570
You should praise him sometimes, doctor.

621
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:37,560
Things are complicated between me and my son.

622
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:41,610
It’s been like this for a long time.

623
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:49,290
It wouldn’t be easy to change things like that.

624
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,650
I’m just an old person, close to dying

625
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,770
and not as smart as you.

626
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,160
But I’m sure of one thing,

627
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:13,130
separation in death is better than being estranged while still alive.

628
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:22,890
Not speaking to each other while still living is more painful.

629
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,010
Yes.

630
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,250
And what’s this?

631
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,980
Oh,

632
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:48,000
Chinese herbs.

633
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,930
Relatives sent them over.

634
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,140
I’ll be off then.

635
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,240
What’s going on here?

636
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:33,400
Oh, this is a gift from Rose.

637
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,110
From Rose?

638
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,080
Yes.

639
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Jack.

640
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,740
Grandma.

641
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:51,810
The nurse just told me that the surgery is scheduled for tonight.

642
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:54,900
Tonight?
Yes.

643
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,920
Really?
Really.

644
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,880
We can finally go home.

645
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,100
That’s great, Grandma.

646
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,960
Yes, get ready.

647
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:12,230
They said Dr. Suthi

648
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:14,910
canceled his trip to Japan for this.

649
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:20,060
Someone requested a special appointment for him.

650
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:20,560
Oh.

651
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,680
They skipped the queue for me.

652
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,930
Anyway, I wants to send thanks to them.

653
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,340
Sure, I will go thank them for you.

654
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,340
Alright, grandma, now just rest.

655
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,580
Because it’s this evening, so get ready.

656
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:39,040
Jack, take care of yourself too, okay?

657
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,440
Don’t worry, grandma.

658
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,660
Thank you.

659
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,460
Is everything sorted?

660
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:52,110
Okay.

661
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,170
Thank you so much.

662
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:57,790
Alright, I’ll take care of it.

663
01:00:58,650 --> 01:00:59,750
Okay, goodbye.

664
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,880
Rose, thank you so much for everything.

665
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,880
You’ve always helped me

666
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,720
and my grandma.

667
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,030
It’s no problem at all.

668
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,370
I’m happy

669
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:18,500
as long as Jack’s grandma is happy.

670
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,480
Thank you.

671
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,270
By the way, do you know Dr. Suthi?

672
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,280
Who’s Dr. Suthi?

673
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,680
Oh, Rose…

674
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,890
Oh, Jack!

675
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:31,780
Miss Rose, you’re visiting grandma too?

676
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:36,170
How’s it going? Does grandma like the special room?

677
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:37,890
Yes.

678
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,940
We’re like family, you know.

679
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,420
If there’s any issue, just let me know.

680
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,240
I’ll go check on grandma now.

681
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,110
Okay.

682
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Hello, grandma.

683
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,560
Oh, Boss!

684
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,580
No need, grandma.

685
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:18,570
You just rest.

686
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:23,870
Boss, you visit me often.

687
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:25,510
I feel bad.

688
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:27,160
No need to feel bad, grandma.

689
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,940
Jack’s grandma is like an elder I respect.

690
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,990
I just want you to get well soon.

691
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,330
Thank you so much.

692
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:43,250
Oh, this morning the chief doctor came to check on me.

693
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:51,640
He said Chinese medicine like this isn’t good for people with heart disease.

694
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:58,040
Oh no! I should go have a word with the doctor who gave it to you.

695
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,260
It’s okay, it’s okay.

696
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,600
If they didn’t know, it’s not their fault.

697
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,780
It’s alright.

698
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:11,790
But I don’t think it’s necessary anymore.

699
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:13,370
Right.

700
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:26,290
I think it’s not necessary either.

701
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,160
Grandma, just rest.

702
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,060
You’ll feel better soon.

703
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:52,800
Okay.

704
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,470
Eat the snacks I bought.

705
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,720
There’s a lot, I bought a bunch.

706
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,090
This shop is hard to order from, and the queue is really long.

707
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:04,510
Thank you so much.

708
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:07,240
It’ll make grandma feel refreshed.

709
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,720
What do you think they’re mad at each other about?

710
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,480
Is it because I sent that clip of Rose?

711
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:41,300
Not sure.

712
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:44,430
But they fought before about my mom.

713
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:46,590
Your mom?

714
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:47,900
Damn.

715
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:54,340
I hate this atmosphere.

716
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:07,160
Hey, guys, after grandma’s surgery,

717
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,160
should I order pork barbecue to celebrate?

718
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,780
Hoy!

719
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,840
This is a hospital.

720
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,750
They’re not going to let you have barbecue here.

721
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:17,650
Think a little.

722
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,100
Oh, right.

723
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,340
Who’s the relative of Ms. Zhenwen?

724
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:27,140
Me.
Me.

725
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,740
Your grandma is in a stable condition now.

726
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:41,530
But she needs to stay in the hospital for another day or two for observation.

727
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:43,530
If everything’s good, she can go home.

728
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,000
Thank you so much, doctor.

729
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,240
Thank you.

730
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:54,590
Yes!

731
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:55,600
Thank you…

732
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,880
Dad…
Grandma’s recovering!

733
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,820
Pork barbecue!

734
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,740
Well, it’s a good thing.

735
01:06:58,530 --> 01:06:59,690
Don’t sleep yet.

736
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:02,310
Use that thing.

737
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,410
I bought it for you.

738
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,180
You usually use it, right?

739
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,790
What’s wrong? Are you uncomfortable?

740
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,840
You’re talking to me?

741
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,490
Aren’t you afraid Rose will say something?

742
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:11,490
Is Rose in this room?

743
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,240
Honestly, when I told you to stop bothering,

744
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,760
I just meant with Rose.

745
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,760
I didn’t mean for you to disappear from my life.

746
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:33,800
But what you’ve been doing makes it seem like you’re trying to vanish from my life.

747
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,000
You can’t sleep, can’t sit,

748
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,170
but you use it because it’s Rose’s.

749
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,460
Why don’t you come sleep on the bed?

750
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:58,680
I’ll sleep on the couch.

751
01:09:00,529 --> 01:09:03,319
You want to sleep on the couch? Why?

752
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,960
Because it’s Rose’s?

753
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:10,000
Are you messing with me?

754
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:13,130
I told you to stop talking about her.

755
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:14,910
And you keep mentioning her.

756
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,120
So I can't say anything?

757
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:25,609
Huh? I can’t even say the word Rose?

758
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:28,130
Why? Are you going to get mad?

759
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:43,410
What are you doing?

760
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:44,990
I’m annoyed with you.

761
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:47,359
I’ll watch over grandma, you go home.

762
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,540
Oh, so now that things are calm, you want to watch over her.

763
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:56,400
But before, you left grandma waiting alone every day.

764
01:09:57,970 --> 01:09:59,970
Don’t you feel guilty?

765
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,520
You don’t know anything, so don’t talk.

766
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,560
Then tell me what’s going on!

767
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:10,480
Hanging around Rose.

768
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,920
Playing that silly game? Why?

769
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,900
Are you getting money for grandma?

770
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:21,380
At least what I’m doing is helping grandma survive.

771
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,020
And after you get the money, what’s next?

772
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:25,450
Tell me honestly?

773
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:29,360
You’re just going to pay off those people, right?

774
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:33,690
How long are you going to rely on those people?

775
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:40,740
Tell me.

776
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:50,470
Isn’t there any other way?

777
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:56,000
Answer me! Tell me what is the real problem!

778
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:37,330
Jack.

779
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,850
Our family is just us.

780
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,260
If you have a problem, just say it.

781
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,040
There’s nothing, grandma.

782
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,350
You just woke up from surgery.

783
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:53,930
It’s late, go to bed.

784
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:59,070
I’m not sleepy anymore, let’s play a game.

785
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:02,760
Playing a game now, grandma?

786
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,100
Yes.

787
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:07,260
A truth game.

788
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,300
Whoever lies loses.

789
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,340
I’ll start.

790
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,460
I miss Jack.

791
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:25,920
I’m so happy that Jack is here with me today.

792
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,680
Who’s next?

793
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:37,120
Me.

794
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:43,400
I’m happy grandma recovered safely.

795
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,640
And I don’t like that Jack doesn’t speak frankly,

796
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,630
as if I’m not his friend.

797
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:59,400
Your turn, Jack.

798
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:16,490
The reason I spend so much time with Rose

799
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:21,270
is because Boss made me deceive Rose

800
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:25,440
to get money to help grandma.

801
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,220
Now I feels guilty,

802
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:33,840
especially after finding out that Boss was the one who helped grandma

803
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,320
get surgery quickly.

804
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:44,160
I'm afraid this debt won’t end easily.

805
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,100
Come here.

806
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,220
There.

807
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:52,040
Oh, Grandma.

808
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:55,120
You should’ve discussed this first.

809
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,760
You should’ve told me before.

810
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,000
This is my body.

811
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,800
I should decide.

812
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:12,370
And the one who spoke to Dr. Suthi wasn’t Boss, it was Joke.

813
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:20,880
Jack, not speaking directly

814
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,560
doesn’t make the people around you happy.

815
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:34,210
I’m sorry that I became the reason for you doing this.

816
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,360
It’s not your fault, grandma.

817
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,890
I’m sorry.

818
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,450
From now on, no matter what it is.

819
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:47,070
I promise to tell grandma everything, okay?

820
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,740
And about Rose and Boss,

821
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,590
I’ll handle it myself.

822
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,900
And if the couch is uncomfortable,

823
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:07,640
why don’t you just sleep on the bed?

824
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,640
Squeeze in a bit.

825
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:16,740
If you don’t sleep together, it means you’re mad at each other.

826
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:18,750
No.
No.

827
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:22,880
If you’re not mad, then sleep together.

828
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,480
Don’t dawdle,

829
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,160
I’m getting sleepy.

830
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,340
I’m going to bed.

831
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:36,430
I'll take you to bed.

832
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:03,830
Aren’t you cold, sleeping without a blanket?

833
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:04,340
No.

834
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:07,410
I don’t want to share a blanket with you.

835
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,520
I'm for everything that happened.

836
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:18,030
It’s my fault.

837
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:22,250
I thought I could handle everything on my own.

838
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:24,250
Without talking to you first.

839
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:26,990
But in reality,

840
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,480
the more I tried to handle it,

841
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,480
the more I messed things up.

842
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,500
Now you think of me.

843
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:45,340
You know I’d help you with anything.

844
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,760
I’m your friend.

845
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:50,300
No.

846
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:52,830
Huh?

847
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,800
You’re family.

848
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,640
I didn’t want you to feel hurt.

849
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:04,580
I appreciate everything you did for me.

850
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:13,450
I didn’t do it for you, I did it for grandma.

851
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,180
What’s with you?

852
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:36,450
You’re the one not using the blanket,

853
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:38,070
so I’m hugging you instead.

854
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:42,560
They say hugging

855
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,100
is warmer than ten blankets.

856
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,400
Who is they?

857
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,260
Who?

858
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:54,360
That person is...

859
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:56,610
Me.

860
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:10,260
It’s warm, though.

861
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:04,800
So what are you going to do now?

862
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,800
I probably have to go back to working for Rose,

863
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,170
like how I agreed with Boss.

864
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:11,960
I won't let anyone stand in the way of my plan.

865
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,090
Is there no other way I can help Jack?

866
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:16,840
Will you be able to steal it for me?

867
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,680
Even though it might kill you?

868
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,960
If it's in exchange for Jack's freedom, then please tell me.

869
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,510
Then what else do you want us to help you with? Just say so.

870
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:26,480
What are we doing?

871
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,270
We're going to rob Rose's house.

872
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:32,530
We're the Three Little Pigs team.
