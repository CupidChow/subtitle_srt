MOON LOVERS:
SCARLET HEART RYEO

2
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,836
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS.

3
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:17,436
Don't push me away.
Don't tell me to leave.

4
00:00:18,676 --> 00:00:22,396
Don't say your unhappy because of me.
Don't call me a monster.

5
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:27,036
You especially can't do that.

6
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:30,876
You...

7
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:34,036
are mine.

8
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,156
I'm not yours.

9
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:40,876
You're mine.
I said you belong to me!

10
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:42,916
Without my permission...

11
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:45,476
you can't leave me

12
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,316
nor can you die.

13
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:52,796
You are completely mine.

14
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:15,276
Su?

15
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:28,796
No way.

16
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:32,356
You've seen it wrong.

17
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:34,756
She can't leave the palace.

18
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:38,356
No way.

19
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:40,436
EPISODE 10

20
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:41,676
It's her, I'm sure.

21
00:02:41,756 --> 00:02:43,556
You can check the door keeper.

22
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:45,956
No court lady can leave the palace!

23
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,796
Do you think So would care?
He must just dragged her out.

24
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:53,556
Only Su will get punished.

25
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:57,276
Let's go find her.
Give me a horse and men...

26
00:02:57,356 --> 00:02:59,236
- Go back to the palace.
- What?

27
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:03,876
It's not good for you either
that they find you sneaking out.

28
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:08,116
Just go back.
I will find her.

29
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:13,476
I appreciate your thoughtfulness,
but I can't just go like this.

30
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:16,636
If they find out about Su...

31
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:20,036
you really don't know
what will happen to her.

32
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:22,636
Let's find her together.

33
00:03:26,676 --> 00:03:27,756
OK.

34
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:32,356
I treated you like a child.

35
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:34,916
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:39,116 --> 00:03:40,116
I trust you.

37
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:52,356
You listen to me carefully.
Even though we're married...

38
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:55,076
I can't admit that you're my wife.

39
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:59,636
So we'll leave the way
we've been before.

40
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:02,636
Don't ever try to nag me, OK?

41
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:14,076
Please answer my question!

42
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,436
It makes me infuriated.

43
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:26,196
I'm already married to you.

44
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:30,436
I'll follow you because our marriage is
based on friendship, it will prosper.

45
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:35,316
What...

46
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,156
language is that?

47
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:44,356
How would I like you when you seldom
talk and only do in hard languages?

48
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,356
I like to use a big part of the bed.

49
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:15,676
You told me to hold it
until first snow comes.

50
00:06:17,196 --> 00:06:18,316
Haesu.

51
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:22,436
You're such a terrible liar.

52
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:56,356
You and I are not safe anymore.

53
00:06:58,076 --> 00:07:03,636
Then should we just run away?
If you want, I can do that.

54
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:18,636
Whenever I have to leave Songak,
I wanted to show you here before.

55
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:01,316
I was always pushed away.

56
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:06,716
I still don't know why I had to leave.

57
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:13,356
I didn't make anyone unhappy.
I didn't harm any animal.

58
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:16,116
I didn't use swords easily on people.

59
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:22,716
But I still have to leave?

60
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:31,076
I hope you can live with no pressure.

61
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:38,636
I hope you can live without
having to see blood or unfairness...

62
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,676
outside of the palace.

63
00:08:43,276 --> 00:08:46,076
If you go with me.

64
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:52,116
I'm a court lady.
I have to live in the palace.

65
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:55,276
Then I won't leave either.

66
00:08:58,316 --> 00:08:59,676
And I...

67
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,996
have someone special in my heart.

68
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:10,996
Is it Baeka?

69
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:14,156
No, it's not him.

70
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:17,996
Then it's fine.
As long as it's not Baeka.

71
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:23,836
If it's others, I can kill him.

72
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,556
What?

73
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:35,556
I said you were mine
when you were beaten by Yeonhwa.

74
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:39,716
Since then, you're mine.

75
00:09:42,196 --> 00:09:48,116
You looked at me as myself.
You didn't need any explanation.

76
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:56,796
You said you're scared of me.
I don't trust that.

77
00:09:58,076 --> 00:10:00,116
Because you're my only friend.

78
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:07,516
So I'm not sorry for anything.
Even kissing...

79
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:10,116
or dragging you out here, and...

80
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:17,236
threatening you not to
love any other guy.

81
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:34,036
Here.

82
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:39,716
I wanted to give you something
like this.

83
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,676
I just wanted to help you.

84
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:45,676
I didn't ask for your love.

85
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:49,676
Try to run away from me, then.

86
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:05,436
You can throw it away
if you don't want it.

87
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:36,436
Su!

88
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:44,796
Su!

89
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:49,356
How did you find us here?
The palace already knows about me?

90
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:53,036
Thankfully it's just me and Uk,
but they'll find out soon.

91
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:54,996
Let's go.

92
00:11:57,796 --> 00:11:58,716
Come on.

93
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:04,676
What are you doing?

94
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:07,356
I'll take her back,
since I took her out.

95
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:13,116
People will gossip if they see you
together. That's an even bigger problem.

96
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:16,396
Su.

97
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:19,236
The Emperor has given her
to me already.

98
00:12:19,796 --> 00:12:21,836
It's right that I take care of her.

99
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:24,796
He gave her to me.

100
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:30,916
I'll go with the Fourth Prince.

101
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:36,436
Don't worry, please go back.

102
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:41,036
He'll take care of me.
I think we can do that.

103
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,796
You'll go with the Fourth?

104
00:12:49,956 --> 00:12:50,956
Yes.

105
00:12:57,716 --> 00:13:02,836
You'll keep your word.
Don't ever let her get hurt.

106
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:04,958
I wouldn't want that either.

107
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:22,758
You can't just let them go.
What if he's not going to the palace?

108
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:24,518
Then I won't just sit and watch.

109
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:27,358
What?

110
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:32,878
This is the only time
I'm letting them go together.

111
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,158
Court Lady Oh. I...

112
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:57,798
I just took her out.
Don't blame her.

113
00:13:58,598 --> 00:14:00,598
You went out of the palace?

114
00:14:00,678 --> 00:14:05,398
The Emperor ordered her to
take care of me. We had to go out.

115
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:11,158
Still, taking a court lady out will
be seen as a challenge to the Emperor.

116
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,478
So are you going to punish her?

117
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:18,878
- Do you have to?
- Please go back, Prince.

118
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,398
She'll have to make more excuses
if you're spotted here.

119
00:14:22,998 --> 00:14:24,158
I trust you.

120
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:50,158
I'm sure your thoughtless kindness
has shaken the Fourth Prince's heart.

121
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:57,518
This is why you don't fit in here.
You can't be kind to anyone here.

122
00:14:58,438 --> 00:15:02,438
You need to be careful
each and every step.

123
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,278
That's the only way you survive.

124
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:08,318
I...

125
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:11,078
What should I do now?

126
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:15,878
You have to wait until
his feelings go away.

127
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:31,758
Bull's-eye!

128
00:15:37,998 --> 00:15:39,398
Bull's-eye!

129
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:57,638
Bull's-eye!

130
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,398
What a surprise.
Seeing you miss the target.

131
00:16:14,478 --> 00:16:16,478
These days make me practice more.

132
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:22,158
I think of someone when I see the target.

133
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:24,278
The one who became a hero
instead of me.

134
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:29,158
If I see his face there, I aim
as if my arrow goes through his heart.

135
00:16:30,398 --> 00:16:32,438
I never miss it.

136
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:36,438
Bull's-eye!

137
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:41,078
What about you?
Who's your target?

138
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:43,358
I've never...

139
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:47,198
imagined someone when I shoot.

140
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,758
Someone like you with lack of purpose
is easily swayed.

141
00:16:56,678 --> 00:17:02,718
I'm leaving Songak soon. Father
is sending me far away. I'll survive.

142
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:04,838
You'll be fine.

143
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,318
Of course.

144
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:13,518
I'll come back with great condition.
So you think it through while I'm gone.

145
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:16,318
Who'd be fun to be your target?

146
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:24,318
You and I are getting along
pretty well surprisingly.

147
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:41,918
I'll be back soon.
You better calculate well until then.

148
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:44,958
I'll wait for your comeback.

149
00:18:52,518 --> 00:18:53,518
Let's go.

150
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:16,118
Who's there?

151
00:19:26,478 --> 00:19:27,598
Hello.

152
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:31,758
What are doing here?

153
00:19:32,278 --> 00:19:35,598
Who ordered you to follow me?
Who are you?

154
00:19:35,678 --> 00:19:39,318
I'm just here to play the music
for the dance, not following you.

155
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:40,438
Really?

156
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:46,078
And you followed me first.
Did you forget already?

157
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:49,998
I didn't know you play the music
for the gisaeng school.

158
00:19:50,078 --> 00:19:54,278
I have nothing I can't do well,
but there are more I'm great at.

159
00:19:54,358 --> 00:20:00,318
I didn't know you're here to be gisaeng.
Your talk sounded like a loyal lady.

160
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:04,358
Whatever you are, just do your job.

161
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:07,198
Don't ever judge people like that.
It's a bad habit.

162
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:10,358
Let's tell names as it's our
third time meeting.

163
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:12,918
What is your name?

164
00:20:12,998 --> 00:20:13,998
Boksoon.

165
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:16,278
Woohee, let's go back to our rooms.

166
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:18,078
OK.

167
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:21,918
Boksoon?

168
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:25,118
What a trick.

169
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:29,158
Woohee. Your name is Woohee.

170
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:37,478
Are you not upset?

171
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:46,278
I just saw the sunrise
with the Fourth Prince. That's it.

172
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:51,878
I said I'll go with him
so you're not affected.

173
00:20:56,318 --> 00:20:57,878
I'm not upset.

174
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:00,678
I'm just sad.

175
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:08,358
I've always had you in Damiwon
as I'm only calculating and thinking.

176
00:21:09,278 --> 00:21:12,758
But So just took you out at once.

177
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,318
I'll ask the Emperor for
permission to marry you.

178
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,158
Marry?

179
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:31,278
When I heard you've disappeared,

180
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:33,998
it reminded me when you
entered the palace.

181
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:39,798
I was so afraid that
I might lose you again.

182
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:43,278
I won't repeat that mistake again.

183
00:21:48,718 --> 00:21:54,518
As Lady Hae said,
my nights were never restful.

184
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,038
Because of the pressure of
the expectation and future

185
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:03,958
I felt guilty to sleep well.

186
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:11,158
But then it was you who showed me
smiles and light jokes,

187
00:22:13,158 --> 00:22:14,758
and poems.

188
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:19,158
It was you.

189
00:22:22,358 --> 00:22:24,838
I want to go back home with you
and live happily.

190
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:33,278
I want to repay Lady Hae by giving
all my love to you. Su...

191
00:22:35,998 --> 00:22:37,478
Would you be my half?

192
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:46,278
He's not going to change or hurt me.

193
00:22:46,918 --> 00:22:50,678
I can be happy with him.

194
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,278
If Gwangjong kills him...

195
00:23:00,358 --> 00:23:02,838
Do you not like me anymore?

196
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:04,358
No, it's not that.

197
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,278
Then, you can't trust my promise?

198
00:23:12,118 --> 00:23:13,118
No...

199
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,358
Then will you answer me?

200
00:23:24,078 --> 00:23:25,318
Will you marry me?

201
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:31,118
What are you doing?

202
00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:41,278
It was you who sneaked in
when the Princes were bathing.

203
00:23:43,398 --> 00:23:44,838
I'm so sorry.

204
00:23:45,438 --> 00:23:47,358
I'll explain everything.

205
00:23:47,438 --> 00:23:51,638
Who would be killed first
if this secret meeting is revealed?

206
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:56,278
I'll close down this place.

207
00:23:56,358 --> 00:24:01,078
Anyone having an affair with
a court lady will be punished.

208
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,358
Let's go.

209
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:24,318
- You, leave the palace with me.
- What?

210
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:28,518
Doctor Tae ordered me to go out
to take care of my health.

211
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:32,958
Come with me to my hometown.

212
00:24:35,358 --> 00:24:38,318
I've been watching you and Prince Uk.

213
00:24:40,198 --> 00:24:41,478
The only answer is to avoid it.

214
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:43,638
The Eighth Prince asked me...

215
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:50,398
to marry him.
And I'm going to.

216
00:24:50,478 --> 00:24:55,078
Think of the Fourth Prince!
You can't survive between them.

217
00:24:55,158 --> 00:24:58,318
If anyone changes his mind
you'll die in your early age.

218
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:01,198
The Eighth Prince is different.
He won't ever change.

219
00:25:01,277 --> 00:25:05,718
No, the palace can make
anyone break their promises.

220
00:25:08,358 --> 00:25:10,518
The person I loved...

221
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:16,398
Yes, as you assumed, it's the Emperor.

222
00:25:18,198 --> 00:25:23,398
He wanted to marry me once
but to keep his position...

223
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:29,278
he had to forget about the poor girl.
But I still wanted to be with him.

224
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:33,038
And I decided to live as
a court lady, not a woman.

225
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:39,638
I boiled tea for him,
washed his hair and changed his cloths.

226
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:47,638
I call my lover as Your Majesty,
and cleaned ladies' bodies for him.

227
00:25:55,998 --> 00:26:01,718
Su, think ahead. If you don't escape now,
you'll be miserable, too.

228
00:26:04,598 --> 00:26:07,078
The Prince said...

229
00:26:07,158 --> 00:26:13,078
we'll leave the palace to live in Hwangju.
We can be happy as long as we stay low.

230
00:26:13,158 --> 00:26:15,158
I trust him.

231
00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:30,438
How is it going keeping the Emperor
and the Fourth Prince apart?

232
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:36,518
We have to let the Emperor think Fourth
Prince is the enemy or the Crown Prince.

233
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:40,518
If you pretend you're
giving the Fourth Prince power,

234
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:43,678
I'll take care of the rest.

235
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:48,198
I gave the Crown Prince's uncle's
debt document to the Fourth Prince.

236
00:26:48,318 --> 00:26:52,358
The Crown Prince will be
suspicious of him if he finds that paper.

237
00:26:53,438 --> 00:27:00,438
You will meet up with Wang Sikryum.
Everything is perfect.

238
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:03,398
I'll get ready too.

239
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:18,598
I'm just here to see
if you're OK.

240
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:26,438
I'll tell Court Lady Oh
so you can rest today.

241
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,758
Prince.

242
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:39,398
Please come to the make-up room.
I'll help you.

243
00:27:58,158 --> 00:28:00,598
Anyone will cherish the person

244
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:06,678
who's next to him and cheering
when he's suffering.

245
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,878
It's easy to think that person is
the only one on the same side.

246
00:28:15,678 --> 00:28:17,318
You call that person as a "friend".

247
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:24,278
Friendship and relationships can be
confusing.

248
00:28:26,478 --> 00:28:28,678
But they're different.

249
00:28:30,718 --> 00:28:36,478
I'm worried that you're confused
about those differences.

250
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:47,798
I'm worried about you.

251
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:55,798
And I don't make friends that easily.

252
00:28:57,198 --> 00:29:01,558
Friendship or relationship,
they're all same to me.

253
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:03,878
I only have one.

254
00:29:15,358 --> 00:29:20,798
I know you're trying to push me away
but it's not working for me.

255
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:32,278
I told you to brace yourself.

256
00:29:44,598 --> 00:29:45,798
Don't worry.

257
00:29:46,758 --> 00:29:48,318
I won't do it again
without your permission.

258
00:30:05,358 --> 00:30:07,358
What did you just say?

259
00:30:08,318 --> 00:30:12,078
At the festival, I'll ask the Emperor
to allow Haesu and me to get married.

260
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:17,438
If Su leaves the palace
we'll leave in Hwangju together.

261
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:23,398
I know what you expect of me, but
I'm not interested becoming an Emperor.

262
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,438
I'm just sick of politics.

263
00:30:31,318 --> 00:30:32,638
I just want to live freely.

264
00:30:33,118 --> 00:30:36,558
You'll give up the Emperor's seat,
abandon Mother and me...

265
00:30:37,158 --> 00:30:41,958
to just live as a husband?
Then who'll protect our family?

266
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:45,158
There are many way to protect us
without becoming the Emperor.

267
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:49,718
Trust me.

268
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:56,518
Have I ever stopped your wish?

269
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:02,078
If you know what you want
do it as you wish.

270
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:07,278
But you'll have to brace yourself
as it won't be an easy way.

271
00:31:07,678 --> 00:31:11,438
Su will appreciate you, too.

272
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:23,558
You should stop him.
You should say no!

273
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:29,438
I sometimes get sick of politics, too.
I'm sure he was as well.

274
00:31:30,478 --> 00:31:34,318
Your brother's burden is
a lot heavier than you think.

275
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:38,118
Let him do what he wants.

276
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:40,518
You were framed that
you caused the

277
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,198
Emperor's favorite
court lady's miscarriage

278
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,678
and kicked out of palace
only ten years ago.

279
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:49,318
No one was on our side
even though we knew it was the Empress.

280
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:54,078
Shinju Kang, Myunchun Park
Uisung Hong, Gwangju Wang.

281
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:58,478
These families will attack us
any time if we're not the Emperor.

282
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,198
The Emperor and the Crown Prince are
different and the country has changed.

283
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:05,558
Don't look at this too extremely.

284
00:32:12,318 --> 00:32:16,758
I think it's my time
to leave your wings.

285
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:21,518
Yeonhwa.

286
00:32:21,598 --> 00:32:24,358
I'll change my goal from now on.

287
00:32:25,438 --> 00:32:29,438
I won't be a daughter or a sister
of Emperor, I'll be the King of Emperor.

288
00:32:33,358 --> 00:32:34,678
You don't have to forgive me.

289
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:51,478
Your Highness,
Princess Yeonhwa is here.

290
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:54,358
Princess Yeonhwa?

291
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:05,358
You asked me to come
if I have any fun stories.

292
00:33:06,438 --> 00:33:09,758
I'd like you to hear this today.

293
00:33:11,118 --> 00:33:12,158
Is that so?

294
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,758
I must listen if you insist this much.

295
00:33:19,318 --> 00:33:20,398
I can't wait.

296
00:33:31,438 --> 00:33:32,318
Su!

297
00:33:34,518 --> 00:33:37,318
One, two, three.
You're getting good at this.

298
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:40,158
With all those finger flicks
any dummy could learn.

299
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:43,598
One, two, three!
I got you.

300
00:33:43,678 --> 00:33:45,678
You can hit hard.

301
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:51,278
I'll can get arrested
for hitting a prince.

302
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:55,638
You surprised me more
when you're kidnapped by Fourth Prince.

303
00:33:56,358 --> 00:33:58,318
Where the heck did you take you?

304
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,198
He just rode with me.
It was so much fun.

305
00:34:03,118 --> 00:34:06,998
He's out of control these days.
I don't like it.

306
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:11,758
Please try to understand him.

307
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:14,318
You're well-loved by the Empress.

308
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,438
But he wasn't.
He has no close family.

309
00:34:18,998 --> 00:34:23,478
You have to work hard to be loved.

310
00:34:24,678 --> 00:34:29,918
Since he came up, Mother and Brother Yo
have changed a lot.

311
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:33,038
Don't tell me you're
blaming him for that.

312
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:34,998
It's not only because of him, but...

313
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:41,078
if it wasn't him, I wouldn't have known
Mother and Brother Yo's intention.

314
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,438
Su.

315
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:47,798
I miss our old days,
when we were all good together.

316
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:50,998
You looked prettiest
when you smiled at Uk's house.

317
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,958
I think of that, too.

318
00:34:57,158 --> 00:34:58,638
I want to go back.

319
00:35:02,318 --> 00:35:04,798
Why are you going to
the Crown Prince's family house?

320
00:35:04,878 --> 00:35:09,078
I have some business to do.
Don't tell the Crown Prince.

321
00:35:09,638 --> 00:35:11,318
OK, by the way...

322
00:35:12,998 --> 00:35:16,478
is it true that you
took Su out of the palace?

323
00:35:20,278 --> 00:35:25,478
Su is a court lady. If you treat her like
any girl, you and she will be in danger.

324
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:26,958
Don't make it complicated.

325
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:28,918
I didn't mean that.

326
00:35:28,998 --> 00:35:31,518
I have no intention
of making it more complicated.

327
00:35:33,038 --> 00:35:36,118
I am just...clumsy at this.

328
00:35:37,798 --> 00:35:39,558
I don't know how to treat people well.

329
00:35:42,678 --> 00:35:44,358
Do I have to be criticized for that?

330
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:51,558
I didn't know you
like Su that much.

331
00:35:57,438 --> 00:36:01,998
Only you and Hasu are
my people in this world.

332
00:36:04,398 --> 00:36:07,198
Prince! Prince!

333
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:12,358
We have a big issue.

334
00:36:13,158 --> 00:36:14,758
Numerous complaints are
coming in that

335
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:16,798
the Crown Prince has
collected double taxes.

336
00:36:18,038 --> 00:36:19,358
All of the heads of each village are

337
00:36:19,438 --> 00:36:21,278
asking the Emperor to
relinquish his crown.

338
00:36:37,398 --> 00:36:40,718
Did you know about
your family's embezzlement?

339
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:44,718
We have reports that you were there
when your family collected the taxes.

340
00:36:44,798 --> 00:36:49,118
I found out later.
It was a mistake.

341
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:54,278
It's not like we planned to
rob our people, as you say.

342
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:56,358
Do not even try to frame us.

343
00:36:57,358 --> 00:36:59,118
We found out later.

344
00:36:59,198 --> 00:37:02,398
You still hold accountability
for not catching it earlier.

345
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:06,158
Your Majesty, all members agree that

346
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:10,358
we cannot let the immoral family
rule our country in the future.

347
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:12,358
Please reconsider.

348
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,918
Please reconsider.

349
00:37:19,478 --> 00:37:20,318
Then...

350
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:24,198
who do you want for his seat?

351
00:37:28,918 --> 00:37:31,278
Your Majesty.

352
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:33,918
Will you dethrone the Crown Prince?

353
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:38,678
We need to have a plan
in order to decide that.

354
00:37:40,918 --> 00:37:46,358
So I'm asking you who'd be
the best fit for Goryeo's future.

355
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:53,398
Your Majesty, we think
Fourth Prince will be a good fit.

356
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:56,038
Fourth Prince?

357
00:37:56,118 --> 00:37:57,118
Wang So?

358
00:37:57,198 --> 00:37:59,878
Since Wang So was adopted to another
family,

359
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:03,838
he won't have a family
that will attack.

360
00:38:03,918 --> 00:38:09,078
And through the ritual he is now trusted
among people including foreigners.

361
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:11,678
I see he's the best fit.

362
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:37,398
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know it'd be this complicated.

363
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:39,038
What are you talking about?

364
00:38:39,118 --> 00:38:42,358
I just told So because
I worried about you.

365
00:38:42,438 --> 00:38:45,278
I trusted him that he'll support you.

366
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:48,998
I just showed your uncle's document
to him.

367
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:54,278
Did Fourth know about my family's issue?

368
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:58,158
I told him myself, so I'm sure.

369
00:39:00,158 --> 00:39:03,838
But I didn't know
he'd threaten your seat from this.

370
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:06,278
Please forgive me.

371
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:25,998
It's time for you to go back
to Shinju.

372
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:30,398
Leave after the Ninth.

373
00:39:30,478 --> 00:39:32,598
Do I have to?

374
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:44,318
People suggested you as the Crown
Prince. Your mother and Choonju family.

375
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:48,438
They're planning to get my seat
through you.

376
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:51,958
I have no connection with them.
Why do I have to leave?

377
00:39:52,038 --> 00:39:56,078
A man's heart is cunning.
Even if you don't mean it now,

378
00:39:56,798 --> 00:40:02,358
if you have more followers for you,
you'll lose the faithfulness you have now.

379
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:06,878
You're only the shield
for the Crown Prince.

380
00:40:07,918 --> 00:40:10,518
You don't even know
that your father used you.

381
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:21,638
So my faithfulness doesn't matter to you.

382
00:40:21,718 --> 00:40:26,718
I want to have you by my side
for a long time, but what can we do?

383
00:40:27,718 --> 00:40:30,718
Any challenges should be rooted out
before they grow.

384
00:40:42,118 --> 00:40:44,158
That's how it's going in the palace.

385
00:41:10,038 --> 00:41:12,398
Please make sure
that girl is handling this.

386
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:16,998
Yes, Lady.

387
00:41:24,118 --> 00:41:25,878
I've ordered as you told me.

388
00:41:30,038 --> 00:41:33,718
The Empress should not know
that I ordered you.

389
00:41:33,798 --> 00:41:35,398
Yes, Princess...

390
00:41:37,598 --> 00:41:39,678
I understand.

391
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:03,518
Are you still not
satisfied after all that?

392
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:05,878
When will you leave me alone?

393
00:42:07,038 --> 00:42:09,438
Didn't you say you wanted
to be the Emperor?

394
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:13,918
A mother should
make her son's wish come true.

395
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:19,198
Don't worry, if everything goes well,
you'll be the Emperor.

396
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:21,958
Don't say it's for me.

397
00:42:22,518 --> 00:42:26,718
I don't know what you're planning behind,
but it won't work as you wish.

398
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:28,838
The Crown Prince...

399
00:42:28,918 --> 00:42:34,198
he'll die on September Eighth.
I've sent the poison cup already.

400
00:42:35,718 --> 00:42:38,398
He loves teas, so he'll drink it.

401
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:40,358
Did you think I won't do anything?

402
00:42:41,438 --> 00:42:46,078
How will you tell them how you
knew about the poison? From Mother?

403
00:42:46,158 --> 00:42:49,318
If I have to, I will.

404
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:51,078
Sure.

405
00:42:51,158 --> 00:42:55,318
Then I'll just say
I was trying to make you an Emperor.

406
00:42:55,918 --> 00:42:57,718
I'll just say, to make you the Emperor,

407
00:42:57,798 --> 00:42:59,838
Choongju and Hojuck family worked

408
00:43:00,598 --> 00:43:03,078
to reveal the Crown Prince's
corruption and send poison.

409
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:08,638
We already made a compact that
we'll make you the Emperor.

410
00:43:08,718 --> 00:43:14,678
In this palace, we're eating
each other to survive.

411
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:18,118
If you can stop the Crown Prince's
poisoned tea, try it.

412
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:23,478
Then it'll be your neck
that will have a rope tied to it.

413
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,478
It won't go as you wish.

414
00:43:31,678 --> 00:43:34,158
You still don't know
after the Emperor kicked you out?

415
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:38,798
If we just have one court lady killed
who delivered that tea,

416
00:43:38,878 --> 00:43:42,438
the Crown Prince will be gone.
Then you'll be the Crown Prince.

417
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:51,398
How could I...

418
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:54,478
trust you, Mother?

419
00:43:54,558 --> 00:43:56,158
You said it yourself.

420
00:43:57,278 --> 00:44:00,678
You won't kill your brothers
even if you become the Emperor.

421
00:44:00,758 --> 00:44:02,598
I trust you.

422
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:06,438
That's why I'm supporting you.

423
00:44:20,438 --> 00:44:24,438
Why is the Crown Prince's star so weak?

424
00:44:31,398 --> 00:44:34,358
If we meet in any form later,

425
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:38,678
I won't ever forget my debt to you.

426
00:44:39,558 --> 00:44:43,478
I'll keep our promise from now on.

427
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:47,878
I'll cherish Haesu.

428
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,358
Please look out for us.

429
00:44:53,878 --> 00:44:56,278
SEPTEMBER 9TH

430
00:44:58,558 --> 00:45:02,998
Drinking together with arms hooked.

431
00:45:03,278 --> 00:45:06,158
Who would Baeka choose this
punishment?

432
00:45:06,278 --> 00:45:07,773
The Emperor wasn't picked yet.

433
00:45:08,278 --> 00:45:11,318
Can he be safe again this time?

434
00:45:13,918 --> 00:45:17,318
The one who'll be drinking with me...

435
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:30,638
will be you.

436
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:33,838
I'd like to drink with you.

437
00:45:36,478 --> 00:45:37,478
No.

438
00:45:37,558 --> 00:45:39,998
I'm a grown man, I won't do it.

439
00:45:40,078 --> 00:45:41,718
From here, "no"...

440
00:45:42,278 --> 00:45:44,278
is not a word.

441
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:49,958
Here.

442
00:46:06,518 --> 00:46:09,438
Shall we start again?

443
00:46:13,998 --> 00:46:18,478
First, a wide circle flow
is hung up high...

444
00:46:19,398 --> 00:46:21,438
to show its color.

445
00:46:26,438 --> 00:46:31,478
Second, the pure yellow color
is the color of soil.

446
00:46:38,198 --> 00:46:42,438
Third, blooming later is the bless
of the King.

447
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:54,398
Fourth, a flow blooming out of frost
is strong spirit.

448
00:47:02,478 --> 00:47:03,438
Fifth...

449
00:47:08,398 --> 00:47:10,398
Fifth is...

450
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:14,638
Fifth.

451
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:21,318
Flower flowing on drink
is the food of gods.

452
00:47:22,438 --> 00:47:24,998
It's written by Jongye,
poem "Chrysanthemum."

453
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:33,358
Good job. Jung, martial arts are good,
but focus on study, too.

454
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:35,998
Yes, Your Majesty.

455
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:53,878
The Crown Prince seems to
have no appetite today.

456
00:47:56,318 --> 00:47:59,878
I'm sorry, but it's hard to drink today.

457
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:05,718
We'll then bring out some chrysanthemum
tea. It's for all our good health.

458
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:10,758
- Lady Oh, please bring out the tea.
- Yes, Princess.

459
00:48:26,398 --> 00:48:28,918
We need to bring out
chrysanthemum tea.

460
00:48:28,998 --> 00:48:30,718
OK, hold on.

461
00:48:30,798 --> 00:48:36,678
Can you go for me?
I'm getting a cold.

462
00:48:36,758 --> 00:48:41,358
I'm sorry, but Lady Oh told me
not to serve the Princes for awhile.

463
00:48:43,518 --> 00:48:45,358
Fine, then.

464
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:54,558
Are you OK?

465
00:49:00,798 --> 00:49:05,598
Hurry up! We'll be in trouble
because you took so long to get ready.

466
00:49:07,998 --> 00:49:13,558
What's that face?
Do you think it's because I woke up late?

467
00:49:15,638 --> 00:49:16,758
Look at that bold face.

468
00:49:26,478 --> 00:49:28,318
I greet you, Your Highness.

469
00:49:29,638 --> 00:49:31,118
I said hurry up.

470
00:49:32,438 --> 00:49:34,478
You need to accept her greeting.

471
00:49:34,878 --> 00:49:35,878
What?

472
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:41,038
If you don't accept,
she has to stay like that.

473
00:49:48,438 --> 00:49:49,478
Lift up your head.

474
00:49:59,518 --> 00:50:01,518
I don't want to see you
so turn around now.

475
00:50:03,438 --> 00:50:04,598
Yes, Prince.

476
00:50:04,678 --> 00:50:09,078
From now on, always turn around
whenever you see me.

477
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,638
I don't feel like going anymore.

478
00:50:17,438 --> 00:50:19,478
You can come or stay.

479
00:50:26,478 --> 00:50:30,918
If you're that sad, you should've
become his second wife like I told you.

480
00:50:35,558 --> 00:50:38,519
I can see you like him that much to
offer me that chance.

481
00:50:39,278 --> 00:50:41,478
Please take care of him.

482
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:44,606
Make sure he's not involved in any issue

483
00:50:45,278 --> 00:50:47,638
or hangout with anyone
because he's easily swayed.

484
00:50:47,718 --> 00:50:51,478
I'm his wife now.
That shouldn't be your concern anymore.

485
00:51:04,638 --> 00:51:07,118
We'll test the tea first for poison.

486
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:44,958
Your Majesty, I have something
to tell the Crown Prince.

487
00:51:52,118 --> 00:51:54,078
You can say now.

488
00:51:57,638 --> 00:51:58,918
Actually...

489
00:52:16,278 --> 00:52:19,838
If we just have one court lady killed
who delivered that tea, he'll be gone.

490
00:52:19,918 --> 00:52:22,398
- I've prepared the tea.
- Thank you.

491
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:31,478
So what were you going to say?

492
00:52:33,558 --> 00:52:34,558
Yes.

493
00:52:39,998 --> 00:52:42,678
As I have made you uncomfortable
these days,

494
00:52:42,758 --> 00:52:47,478
I'd like to get your three drinks
to renew our brotherhood.

495
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:51,318
Sure.

496
00:52:52,638 --> 00:52:54,478
But I only have tea, not alcohol.

497
00:52:55,478 --> 00:53:00,318
I feel like I'll be drunk
only with the tea on a day like today.

498
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:04,518
Please send this to him.

499
00:53:22,718 --> 00:53:24,158
I'm so sorry.

500
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:33,038
It's my fault. I had some
oil on my hands from food.

501
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:37,118
Bring the new cup.

502
00:54:12,638 --> 00:54:16,398
First shot is for your longevity.

503
00:54:48,358 --> 00:54:53,758
Second shot is for
your hard work for this country...

504
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:15,038
and to celebrate it.

505
00:55:36,718 --> 00:55:40,878
It wasn't the cup, but the tea.

506
00:55:56,798 --> 00:55:58,038
I'm drinking...

507
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,358
poison from you.

508
00:56:19,998 --> 00:56:21,438
Lastly,

509
00:56:23,158 --> 00:56:27,358
even if anyone tries to part
you and me...

510
00:56:29,118 --> 00:56:31,318
I wish our brotherhood

511
00:56:31,398 --> 00:56:33,518
would never change.

512
00:57:04,478 --> 00:57:07,278
Thanks for your faithfulness.

513
00:57:09,518 --> 00:57:15,800
Your Majesty, you've seen him.
How can I live apart from him?

514
00:57:16,278 --> 00:57:21,078
Please reconsider your order
to send him back to Shinju.

515
00:57:31,478 --> 00:57:34,078
I'll bring more tea, Your Highness.

516
00:57:55,398 --> 00:57:58,718
I will be right back, Your Majesty.

517
00:59:10,638 --> 00:59:14,478
We found poison and valuable things
in the court lady Haesu's room.

518
00:59:14,558 --> 00:59:17,318
Arrest Haesu for attempting
to poison the Prince.

519
00:59:17,398 --> 00:59:19,065
Why do you lock up the innocent one?

520
00:59:19,278 --> 00:59:21,518
I think he knew who did it.

521
00:59:21,598 --> 00:59:25,558
Who did he try to protect with his life?

522
00:59:25,638 --> 00:59:29,918
I won't just let her go like this.
I will find the evidence.

523
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:34,198
Hang Haesu for poisoning the Prince.

524
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:39,518
Haesu!
