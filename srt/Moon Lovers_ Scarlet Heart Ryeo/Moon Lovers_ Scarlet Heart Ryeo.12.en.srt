00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:05,429
MOON LOVERS:
SCARLET HEART RYEO

2
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:13,189
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS.

3
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:16,949
Go to Later Qin Dynasty
as an ambassador.

4
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:20,206
Check how much they're
extending their power.

5
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:22,429
That's too...

6
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:26,909
- dangerous.
- I will follow your order.

7
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:32,469
Will you just go without saying
anything?

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,829
It's an Emperor's order.

9
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:38,909
I will take your order
to leave Songak, but...

10
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:44,669
Haesu has no where to go
but Damiwon.

11
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:47,948
Please have mercy on her.

12
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,948
You still take her side.

13
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:55,029
She's not someone I can forgo.

14
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:00,789
I'll do my best on duty
as an ambassador.

15
00:01:25,589 --> 00:01:29,189
- Take Haesu away.
- I'm sorry?

16
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:32,349
Send her to where
she can never meet any princes.

17
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,149
If he can't forgo her by
himself,

18
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,789
I must do it for him
as father.

19
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:52,709
She had the characteristics
to be an Empress...

20
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:57,309
but she wasn't destined
to be the one.

21
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:01,629
Is that good luck
or bad luck?

22
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:09,789
That's too obvious.

23
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:13,948
She's gone because
she met me.

24
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:17,309
It's the worst.

25
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:22,109
She's lucky because she left
here with no regrets and wishes.

26
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:25,789
Believe so.

27
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:30,629
You need to leave Damiwon.

28
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:34,949
The Emperor said do not say
goodbye to any prince

29
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,109
and to never see them.

30
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:43,629
Where should I go?

31
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:46,948
Where can I go...

32
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:50,469
so I don't see them anymore?

33
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:41,229
How are you feeling?

34
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:43,429
Holding up OK?

35
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:48,948
I will forget someday.

36
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:56,389
Try to forget as soon as
possible, since it's so painful.

37
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,389
Same to you, Prince.

38
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:04,949
Please forget about me.

39
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,269
Stop talking nonsense.
Until I come back...

40
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:22,389
wait for me at Damiwon.

41
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:36,709
I am not waiting.

42
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:41,069
You became like this
trying to help me.

43
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,669
I remember how happy you were

44
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:46,069
when you could live
in the palace.

45
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:54,069
You have to leave far away
all because of me.

46
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:01,109
So please, stop getting confused
between love and friendship.

47
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:08,189
You'll get hurt if you only give
all your energy to one person.

48
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:09,669
I'd say that to you.

49
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:12,949
You'd be unhappy
if you were involved with me.

50
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:15,589
As everyone else.

51
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:27,469
But I still won't let you go.

52
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:32,669
Because I can only be a
bad guy with this face anyway.

53
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,269
You silly.

54
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:48,629
I said I'll respect you.

55
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:03,349
I lied.

56
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,909
I'll use this
as my lucky charm.

57
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:12,948
Because I'll be right back.

58
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:29,509
I'm not going to wait.

59
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:35,989
Even if you'd die for me,
even if you call me yours,

60
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:39,069
I can't.

61
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:51,629
I'm scared to see you.

62
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:56,389
My heart was clearly meant
for someone else.

63
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:01,269
But why is it so hard to let things go
as if they were nothing?

64
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:38,789
Brother!

65
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:43,948
Haesu is gone.
She's nowhere in Damiwon.

66
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:45,669
What if...

67
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:48,029
she's been kicked out?

68
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:18,069
Haesu...

69
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:35,589
Haesu!

70
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:08,709
The person who was like
my right arm has been removed.

71
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,229
Did you do it?

72
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:16,589
I'm sure you wanted to get rid
of it, too.

73
00:11:19,349 --> 00:11:23,309
When I see you like this,
I feel like you're my own daughter.

74
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:26,949
You and I will be
the best partners.

75
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:30,189
It won't happen.

76
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,869
Now I remember.

77
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:38,189
My mother was exiled
after she was framed that

78
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:40,149
she caused the court lady's miscarriage.

79
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,949
That was Court Lady Oh.

80
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:51,109
After all, it's you who killed the woman
that the Emperor loves the most.

81
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:55,989
I can't be close to the Empress who'll
be kicked out anytime if that's revealed.

82
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:04,029
You need to get it straight.

83
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:06,549
You're in the same boat.

84
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:10,509
I swallowed the poison myself.
Who'd be suspicious of me?

85
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:15,149
Anyone who knows the truth
and helped is all gone.

86
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:18,669
Now you're all alone,
Your Highness.

87
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,269
Do not ever make
my mother kneel again.

88
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:33,669
Please take care of yourself well.
You'll need to.

89
00:12:57,469 --> 00:12:59,389
Yeonhwa is something.

90
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:02,149
That makes me crazy about her.

91
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:06,589
She's dangerous.
She has more ambition than any man.

92
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:09,069
Stay away from her.

93
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:11,069
It's fun that way.

94
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:17,029
Have you met Uncle Wang yet?

95
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:22,869
He promised that he'd help
whenever I'd need it.

96
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:28,309
Now you'll be the mother
of an Emperor.

97
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:31,909
He's not going to move at no cost.

98
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:35,749
What does he want?

99
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:38,749
He wants Suhkyungchundo.

100
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:41,389
SUHKYUNGCHUNDO IS
THE CAPITAL OF GORYEO LATER

101
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:50,429
1 YEAR LATER

102
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:02,229
All nobles who never
come to the palace are here.

103
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:04,509
What's going on?

104
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:07,309
The Emperor has mentioned about
ten principals for Princes.

105
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,948
So the second son can also be
the Emperor, not only the first son.

106
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:13,349
They're all here to recommend me.

107
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:16,109
That's funny.

108
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:21,669
How have you been?
I heard you chased out the pirates.

109
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:25,948
Why don't you go greet Mother?
She's not happy.

110
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:28,789
Don't worry about me.
I'm OK on my own.

111
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:31,389
And Mother has you.

112
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:33,309
Look how you talk now.

113
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:37,629
He's changed after hanging out
with you, Uk.

114
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:52,949
I'm worried that he'll be
get trouble being that greedy.

115
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:55,948
We'll see about that.

116
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:28,948
That's wrong!

117
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:33,149
Wrong again.

118
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:36,948
You're not poking there.
You should wrap him with the sword.

119
00:15:36,948 --> 00:15:38,948
You're always wrong
at the same spot.

120
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:41,669
You'll only be embarrassed
like that.

121
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:43,948
- Let's do it again.
- Nope.

122
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:45,029
What?

123
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:49,469
You should know the boundary when
you're ordering people around.

124
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,229
Look at this.

125
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:56,069
Look at my lips, all swollen
after helping you.

126
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:06,349
The wife is waiting for me
with meals, so I need to go.

127
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:08,029
You have a wife?

128
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:12,029
Why?

129
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:15,149
Are you uncomfortable that I'm married?

130
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:18,948
Why would I?
I don't care.

131
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:25,389
How long have you been married?

132
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:28,029
Do you have a kid?

133
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:34,349
Let me see.
Yes, it's been over 20 years.

134
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:36,589
And I have a handsome son.

135
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:38,189
What?

136
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:41,948
It's a wife, but it's my father's wife.

137
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:47,429
I meant that my mother is waiting
for me, so I should get going.

138
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:50,589
You played me.
How dare you.

139
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:52,389
You got fooled.

140
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,149
It's your fault.

141
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:01,549
It's good that you practice,
but don't get hurt.

142
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:03,869
OK?

143
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,469
OK.

144
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:29,789
When I become Emperor,
I'll divorce all my wives and marry you.

145
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:35,389
Your current wife's father
is the vice-premier.

146
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:38,629
How would I trust that you take
out your closest support?

147
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:51,948
He's from Later Baekje.
I need his power to become Emperor.

148
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:54,029
But after that, he's an enemy.

149
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:07,469
I know well of a man's weaknesses.

150
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:11,109
And you know the darkest
of a man.

151
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,948
We're meant to be.
Can't you tell?

152
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:36,589
I'm afraid people will talk about you two
because you come here often.

153
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:41,509
Please don't forget that
you and I are never partners.

154
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:43,109
Don't worry.

155
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:46,309
I'm here to see Yeonhwa,
now you.

156
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:51,029
I now have the reason,
thanks to Father's ten principles.

157
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:55,229
Why don't you just hit the
Emperor now?

158
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:00,469
If the Prince Crown is throned,
things will be complicated.

159
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:04,549
I still can't go against morals.

160
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:06,829
How can a son attack his own father?

161
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:09,948
The father is willing to kill his son.

162
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,749
Why not his son?

163
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:20,389
It's just a joke.

164
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:24,469
Just don't forget your promise that
you'll support me, not the Crown Prince.

165
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:27,948
Sure.

166
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:42,509
I don't understand you.

167
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:47,948
Why don't you want to be the Emperor
but be the shadow of him?

168
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:53,669
If we attack the Crown Prince, I'll become
the traitor even if I'm throned.

169
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:55,948
But...

170
00:19:56,948 --> 00:20:00,948
the traitor who killed the
traitor will become the hero.

171
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:09,629
Right now, it's better to be
his shadow, his trusted shadow.

172
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:13,549
What if the third brother betrays us?

173
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:16,629
You can help with that.

174
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:18,948
What?

175
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:23,309
That ring...

176
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:26,429
it suits you well.

177
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:33,949
Do you want me to be a hostage?

178
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:36,189
Partner or hostage...

179
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:40,509
whichever word you prefer.

180
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:43,109
We have unfinished business.

181
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:46,069
I'm sure you can
endure that much then.

182
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:54,469
I like this so much.

183
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:59,669
The Fourteenth Prince is killing pirates

184
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:02,069
as if he's breaking flowers.

185
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:06,589
The Emperor also regards him as
a great general and likes him.

186
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:07,829
He could be the next Emperor.

187
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:09,389
Really?

188
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:15,109
What about the Eighth Prince?
I heard he's the closest to the Emperor.

189
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:19,709
That's why all nobles with daughters
have asked for the marriage.

190
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:29,149
Haesu, since you're from Damiwon,
I'm sure you've seen Princes.

191
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:30,469
Who's most handsome?

192
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:32,309
Who's the best?

193
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:37,069
Hey, I know you heard me.

194
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:39,189
Can't you hear us?

195
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:43,869
Don't talk about Princes.
You'll get in trouble.

196
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:48,989
So we're too low to even
talk about the Princes?

197
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:53,189
You're kicked out from there.

198
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:56,509
I'm warning you to watch your mouth.

199
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,909
Wow.

200
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:03,589
She won't even let us talk
about them. She's ridiculous.

201
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:09,349
She'd tear up the paper when we
asked to draw the Fourth Prince.

202
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:13,429
I must rinse my clothes now.

203
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:40,949
What are you staring at?

204
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:43,469
You little witch.
How dare you.

205
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:45,909
What...

206
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,629
I said stop.

207
00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:53,229
I heard you killed your superior.

208
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:58,029
Everyone knows Court Lady Oh
died because of you.

209
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:03,789
What an unlucky creature,
no one wants to be near you for that.

210
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:06,309
What a bad day.

211
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:19,709
Here it is.

212
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,789
It must be cool in there.

213
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:31,349
You like it, right?

214
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:36,269
Brother!

215
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,948
Good work.

216
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:53,948
Brother.

217
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:02,349
It was a new walking path.
Did you do that on purpose?

218
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:07,189
It has been a year.
Will you let her be like that?

219
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:09,229
She's a mere maid.

220
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:12,948
She's the lowest in the palace.
Why would I care?

221
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:19,589
I know it all.

222
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:23,829
Brother, you loved her.

223
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,709
You must have another reason.

224
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:33,709
Or you wouldn't act like this.
I know you.

225
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:36,709
Because I can't die with her.

226
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:40,469
The Emperor kicked her out.
I can't go against his will.

227
00:24:43,469 --> 00:24:44,629
You be careful, too.

228
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:50,069
Don't forget that you can be
thrown away at any moment here.

229
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:56,948
Your leg is...

230
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,589
still hurting?

231
00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:02,909
I thought Jung sent you some medicine.

232
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,229
It's only like this
when I'm working long hours.

233
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:10,749
I'm OK.

234
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:13,949
Are you hurt?

235
00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:19,948
Do you hate me?

236
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:27,709
I missed you.

237
00:26:37,948 --> 00:26:41,948
I couldn't come because
I can't promise you anything.

238
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:47,549
I became powerless.

239
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,389
I couldn't help you.

240
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,069
Still, I missed you.

241
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:06,389
I can't bring you because Father
is still furious about what happened.

242
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:09,949
I can't even bring up marriage.

243
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:11,989
Did you miss me?

244
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,349
Even once...

245
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:26,669
have you missed me at all?

246
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:33,469
Every day.

247
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,229
Every moment, I missed you.

248
00:27:50,229 --> 00:27:51,948
Then I'm good.

249
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:56,389
That's enough.

250
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:02,509
Now...

251
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:06,189
things will get better.

252
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:07,429
So...

253
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:09,869
when I become powerful...

254
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:11,749
Don't do anything radical
because of me.

255
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:15,429
Don't risk yourself.

256
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:23,589
I've seen enough of that.

257
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:29,269
Just don't be sick.

258
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:34,669
Don't make me feel guiltier.

259
00:29:21,948 --> 00:29:24,349
How's Later Qin Dynasty?

260
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,349
The King is dead,
and his cousin acceded to the throne.

261
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:33,509
It seems like they'll have a war with
theKitan soon to ensure the territories

262
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:37,789
but they're not going to win with all the
complaints about the new King.

263
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:42,149
So theKitan's era will begin,
huh?

264
00:29:42,229 --> 00:29:44,948
Then go to theKitan this time.

265
00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:46,229
I don't want to.

266
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:48,789
No?

267
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:53,629
You didn't keep the promise you made
when I left, so I won't listen.

268
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,469
You still think of her?

269
00:29:57,109 --> 00:30:01,029
An emperor should know how to
abandon anyone to keep his position.

270
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:04,149
You should be thankful
when I did that for you.

271
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:07,948
I'm not an emperor
nor am I to be the one.

272
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:14,669
If you need more sides for the
Crown Prince, stop controlling me.

273
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:18,509
I'll start living as a human being, too.

274
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:28,669
That...

275
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:33,949
Your Majesty.

276
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:38,309
All children think
they know best.

277
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,948
So don't be to disturbed by that.

278
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:43,948
I'm worried about your health.

279
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:49,869
He should've been like that way before.

280
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:52,669
I'm sorry?

281
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:55,389
He's not going to lose now
with anyone.

282
00:30:56,749 --> 00:31:01,709
I can close my eyes in peace now
seeing that he's so grown up.

283
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:08,029
Your star is still up there,
bright and shiny. Please don't say that.

284
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:12,948
Sometimes a man knows his days
better than heaven.

285
00:31:15,189 --> 00:31:17,948
Be prepared.

286
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:33,269
You never listen to me.

287
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:37,269
I told you to stay at Damiwon.

288
00:32:38,469 --> 00:32:43,349
I guess servant work fits better for you.

289
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,789
I missed you.

290
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:04,549
You can't come here.

291
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:07,869
Please leave.

292
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,349
You're still the same.

293
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:34,149
You're beautiful.

294
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:35,549
Why...

295
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:38,669
did you put that mask again?

296
00:33:39,948 --> 00:33:42,589
Did you forget
how to make that make-up?

297
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:44,549
Or did the scar hurt?

298
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:46,629
You hated that mask that much...

299
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:01,389
I didn't take it off
so I won't forget about you.

300
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:07,229
I was determined
to come back to see you.

301
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:12,509
I'm not a court lady at
Damiwon, but a mere maid now.

302
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:16,349
I can't meet Princes face to face.

303
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:20,709
You're here safely.

304
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:24,229
And I'm well here.

305
00:34:26,509 --> 00:34:28,189
So everything is good.

306
00:34:38,029 --> 00:34:39,789
- Haesu.
- Please go.

307
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:43,429
This isn't a place for you.
Let's go.

308
00:34:43,509 --> 00:34:45,709
I'll solve it no matter what.

309
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:48,189
Please leave me alone!

310
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:54,469
I'm just here because
I can't either die or live.

311
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:56,948
The Court Lady Oh...

312
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:01,948
and the scary life in palace
where you don't know what will happen...

313
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:03,989
I can forget all
if I work as a slave.

314
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,629
As you helped me
I'll take care of you.

315
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,509
I'll help you forget everything
without working long hours.

316
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,509
The last person I want to see is...

317
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:22,429
you.

318
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:29,309
When I see you,

319
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:32,109
all the memories
I want to forget come back.

320
00:35:33,229 --> 00:35:38,389
My heart aches because I'm so afraid
that something could happen.

321
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:43,069
I'm so afraid and nervous
when I'm with you.

322
00:35:45,149 --> 00:35:48,149
And you're still asking me
to come with you?

323
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:54,469
Are you trying to kill me?

324
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,629
Please go back.

325
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:04,709
I'll live like this just fine.
I can survive.

326
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:06,229
And you...

327
00:36:09,149 --> 00:36:11,149
please live in peace.

328
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:14,789
Just forget all, the hatred
and resentment.

329
00:36:16,948 --> 00:36:18,869
Then no one will get hurt.

330
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:31,949
Mencius?

331
00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:35,309
Are you testing your husband?

332
00:36:37,149 --> 00:36:40,869
I can bet my wrist
that I've read it all.

333
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:47,669
This is mine, then.

334
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:49,109
Next!

335
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:53,989
Fine, take it.
Carve all out to take them.

336
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:57,629
My arm, leg and neck!
Take them all!

337
00:37:00,629 --> 00:37:01,669
Next.

338
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:06,309
No way.
This is from Haesu.

339
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:22,429
You...

340
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:25,189
You're not crying, are you?

341
00:37:40,629 --> 00:37:41,949
Father!

342
00:37:47,189 --> 00:37:49,629
My daughter is still well.

343
00:37:50,629 --> 00:37:54,948
By the way, why do you lie on that desk

344
00:37:54,949 --> 00:37:56,589
like that?

345
00:37:56,669 --> 00:38:00,149
You're scaring him to death!

346
00:38:00,229 --> 00:38:04,029
If he dies from it,
he can't survive this world.

347
00:38:06,509 --> 00:38:08,429
Are you hurt?

348
00:38:08,509 --> 00:38:10,149
Should I put some medicine on it?

349
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:51,149
Don't be anxious.
I know my day is coming.

350
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:14,189
It's a new tea from Damiwon.

351
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,789
I don't have any appetite.

352
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:22,949
A new court lady has mixed
and made a new tea, try a sip, please.

353
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:51,948
Did she make it?

354
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:58,869
I wanted to get your appetite back.
I'm so sorry.

355
00:40:03,149 --> 00:40:05,229
Bring her in.

356
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:19,949
I don't think I heard it right.

357
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:23,948
You'll do what?

358
00:40:23,948 --> 00:40:25,709
You've heard it right.

359
00:40:26,948 --> 00:40:29,149
Marry me, please.

360
00:41:13,229 --> 00:41:17,269
I've seen this before
when my grandfather passed away.

361
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:20,709
I don't know what year
Taejo has died but...

362
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:24,109
I'm sure his days aren't many.

363
00:41:28,029 --> 00:41:30,869
You think I will die soon.

364
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:43,069
You're different.
Where are you from?

365
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:50,629
After Court Lady Oh's incident,
I've looked into you.

366
00:41:51,629 --> 00:41:55,069
Your childhood friends,
your relatives...

367
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:59,429
I've asked all Uk's families, too.

368
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:08,349
I can only conclude that
the person has been switched.

369
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:10,389
It's a whole different person.

370
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:17,149
Who are you?

371
00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:24,149
I'm...

372
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:29,509
I'm...

373
00:42:32,269 --> 00:42:34,109
I am...

374
00:42:37,948 --> 00:42:39,189
I'm not that kind of person.

375
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:45,069
I'm the farthest from any man you'd want.

376
00:42:45,149 --> 00:42:46,869
Yes, I know.

377
00:42:46,948 --> 00:42:48,709
That's why I've kept my
distance from you.

378
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:52,469
But...

379
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:56,469
there's something I didn't know.

380
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:04,349
I was a woman after all.

381
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:11,469
I've liked you for a long time.

382
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:14,948
You and I are destined to be together.

383
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:21,949
Did you know that the Fourth
is destined to be the Emperor?

384
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:28,429
I think you're the same kind of Jimong.

385
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:32,309
You'd know something in the future.

386
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:38,948
Even so, do not interfere.

387
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:42,629
Please...

388
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:46,948
send me far away.

389
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:51,948
I can't live here anymore.

390
00:43:51,948 --> 00:43:57,948
Unless you can close your eyes
and be numb about what's going on...

391
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:03,549
everything will be the same,
no matter where you are.

392
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:14,749
The Crown Prince and So are
both destined to be an emperor.

393
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:19,829
No one knows what will happen
here at the palace from now on.

394
00:44:23,948 --> 00:44:26,948
And you'll see all of that.

395
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:33,948
Don't lose the ones you have
now being in the future.

396
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:41,029
If you were like a
daughter to Suyeon,

397
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:44,229
same for me,
so I'm giving you this advice.

398
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:47,829
Are you OK?

399
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:51,229
- Let me see.
- Stop, it's nothing.

400
00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:53,669
It's not OK.
You've fallen a lot today.

401
00:45:54,269 --> 00:45:55,669
Let me see.

402
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:11,029
I shouldn't ask...

403
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:15,069
what happened, right?

404
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:23,429
Then can I hug you?

405
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:26,429
Can I do that?

406
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:37,429
When you go through hardship,

407
00:46:38,749 --> 00:46:41,109
I'm sorry I couldn't be with you.

408
00:46:42,149 --> 00:46:43,349
It was before I met you.

409
00:46:43,429 --> 00:46:45,069
I feel even more terrible.

410
00:46:46,549 --> 00:46:49,029
That's what I'm most sorry about.

411
00:46:50,549 --> 00:46:51,629
That I didn't know about you.

412
00:46:53,948 --> 00:46:57,948
Now I want to give you
happy memories only.

413
00:47:00,669 --> 00:47:01,948
Trust me.

414
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:07,749
How would you?

415
00:47:08,509 --> 00:47:10,829
I've never asked you to do that.

416
00:47:14,589 --> 00:47:15,629
Woohee.

417
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:20,829
I have one more to tell you.

418
00:47:40,469 --> 00:47:42,469
What's wrong?

419
00:47:43,149 --> 00:47:45,229
Why are you so down?

420
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:51,469
Did something happen
with you and Baeka?

421
00:47:53,509 --> 00:47:56,069
How did you meet him again?

422
00:47:57,189 --> 00:47:58,229
Oh...

423
00:47:59,989 --> 00:48:04,069
Before I entered the palace,
I met him on the street.

424
00:48:04,149 --> 00:48:08,549
He knew my sister, too.

425
00:48:08,629 --> 00:48:10,389
I think he's a good person.

426
00:48:11,749 --> 00:48:14,029
I can assure that.

427
00:48:14,948 --> 00:48:18,309
I would never meet him

428
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:20,709
if I were old me.

429
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:26,749
Now that I'm in this position,
I meet a man like that.

430
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:31,669
I can't tell you everything,
but...

431
00:48:31,749 --> 00:48:36,948
he's only coming here for you.

432
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,669
So don't push him away.

433
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,948
No.

434
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:44,349
I won't get close to him anymore.

435
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:47,189
Because...

436
00:48:48,949 --> 00:48:50,589
I'll leave soon.

437
00:48:50,669 --> 00:48:51,709
Leave?

438
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:53,509
To where?

439
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:59,948
When we first met, we got closer
because we had similar scars.

440
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:03,429
We didn't ask each other

441
00:49:04,589 --> 00:49:06,469
how we got the scars.

442
00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:09,629
Let's keep it that way.

443
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:13,309
It'd be better not to know

444
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:17,909
so you won't be in trouble
if anything happens later.

445
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:22,949
Tomorrow is the day.

446
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:25,709
You'll make me pretty, right?

447
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:28,589
Sure, of course.

448
00:49:29,389 --> 00:49:32,269
I'll make you the prettiest of all.

449
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:37,948
Please make me a woman that
no one can forget about.

450
00:49:40,469 --> 00:49:41,948
Will you do that?

451
00:49:48,589 --> 00:49:50,149
I want to be remembered like that.

452
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:03,549
Are you done prepping
with the girl?

453
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:05,949
This is our only chance.

454
00:50:06,029 --> 00:50:10,829
She's full of hatred towards
the Emperor. So don't worry.

455
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:15,789
Please make it a secret to Mother.
As much as she hates Father,

456
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:17,629
she loves him as well.

457
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:56,429
Let's cancel the event.
You don't look well, Your Majesty.

458
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,509
I agree, Your Majesty.

459
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,549
It's not a regular event you go to either.

460
00:51:02,629 --> 00:51:05,269
You're only going because of the nobles.

461
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:10,389
Uncle Wang is coming too, but the
Eighth Prince and I can handle him.

462
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:11,989
Please rest.

463
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:19,549
I think you should go,
Your Majesty.

464
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:25,149
Today's purpose is to show them
you're as strong as ever.

465
00:51:26,189 --> 00:51:29,509
You have to show them even
a little bit to make the rumors go away.

466
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:37,189
You're right.
I can't show my weaknesses.

467
00:51:42,629 --> 00:51:43,948
Let's go.

468
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:40,349
Haesu.

469
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:53,269
Let's get married.

470
00:52:53,349 --> 00:52:54,349
What?

471
00:52:54,429 --> 00:52:57,989
If we get married,
we can get away from here.

472
00:52:58,069 --> 00:52:59,669
Let's do that.

473
00:53:01,109 --> 00:53:02,829
I can't do that.

474
00:53:08,149 --> 00:53:12,269
If you really hate me,
we can get divorced after we get out.

475
00:53:12,349 --> 00:53:15,349
I'll do that.
Let's get out of here first.

476
00:53:16,948 --> 00:53:19,149
You have your duties.

477
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:22,149
You don't have to leave
because of me.

478
00:53:25,389 --> 00:53:26,989
And the Emperor...

479
00:53:29,629 --> 00:53:32,349
thinks of you and worries
about you.

480
00:53:32,429 --> 00:53:34,389
He continuously test his own son.

481
00:53:35,189 --> 00:53:36,989
He's not a father, but an emperor.

482
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,948
I don't want to be with him.

483
00:53:46,469 --> 00:53:47,948
What if...

484
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:53,229
you'll be the Emperor?

485
00:53:55,389 --> 00:53:57,429
Will you still leave here?

486
00:54:00,229 --> 00:54:04,429
If I'm the Emperor,
will you leave with me?

487
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:11,669
It was hard to be the ambassador,
but I felt free often,

488
00:54:12,269 --> 00:54:13,629
every time I thought of you.

489
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:18,069
I wanted to give you that freedom.

490
00:54:19,509 --> 00:54:23,069
I just want to be with you,
nothing else to worry about.

491
00:54:24,189 --> 00:54:30,189
If I can't do that,
being Emperor is meaningless for me.

492
00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:38,948
Come with me.

493
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:41,709
You're mine, remember?

494
00:54:47,709 --> 00:54:49,309
No.

495
00:54:50,229 --> 00:54:54,189
I can't marry you
just to get out of the palace.

496
00:55:02,989 --> 00:55:04,029
Haesu.

497
00:55:10,669 --> 00:55:12,948
How can a prince marry a maid?

498
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:18,229
Don't play with her with that nonsense.

499
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:20,109
If I say I'll get married,
I mean it.

500
00:55:23,549 --> 00:55:25,349
She became like that...

501
00:55:28,469 --> 00:55:29,549
all because of you.

502
00:55:31,949 --> 00:55:34,429
Because she was involved in the fight
between you and the Empress.

503
00:55:34,509 --> 00:55:36,349
She's been unfairly treated here.

504
00:55:37,789 --> 00:55:39,429
You started it.

505
00:55:41,749 --> 00:55:43,549
And now you ask her to marry?

506
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,989
I can't forgive you.

507
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:49,429
Same goes to you.

508
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:54,589
I let you know everything
to make Haesu shine...

509
00:55:55,229 --> 00:55:57,189
but you couldn't pull it off.

510
00:55:59,509 --> 00:56:01,509
I resent your incapability.

511
00:56:02,229 --> 00:56:03,589
You!

512
00:57:30,549 --> 00:57:35,309
Wrong again! You're not poking
there you should wrap him with the sword.

513
00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:26,509
Don't pretend you care.
Just keep ignoring.

514
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:31,948
Now we're not even related.

515
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:05,589
She's the only one who knows
about Father's condition. Find her now!

516
00:59:05,669 --> 00:59:08,709
I don't know your real intention.

517
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:12,029
I'm prioritizing who to attack first.

518
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:16,549
Since there must be no mistake
to be the Emperor.

519
00:59:16,948 --> 00:59:18,109
Why did you hide the truth?

520
00:59:18,189 --> 00:59:19,189
You've changed.

521
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,948
- I'll become the Emperor.
- I'll become the Emperor.
