1
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:05,484
SCARLET HEART

2
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:12,924
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS.

3
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:36,284
- Your highness!
- Your highness!

4
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:41,883
- Your highness!
- Your highness!

5
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:43,764
Your highness.

6
00:00:50,964 --> 00:00:52,404
Your highness!

7
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:55,883
- What should we do, brother?
- Find 8th.

8
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:57,044
Now!

9
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:06,883
Go.

10
00:01:07,404 --> 00:01:08,764
Now.

11
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:21,164
- Take him in.
- Yes, sir.

12
00:01:37,684 --> 00:01:39,844
Is this it?

13
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:43,404
No, it's not it.

14
00:01:43,924 --> 00:01:46,883
That's highly inappropriate
for a strong man like you.

15
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:51,204
Life is transient.
Empty.

16
00:01:53,883 --> 00:01:56,964
What did I live so hard for?

17
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:01,883
You erected an empire.

18
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:05,804
Empire...

19
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:14,244
Will Goryeo last forever?

20
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:20,284
My choice of Jeongyun,
is it the right decision?

21
00:02:22,124 --> 00:02:25,883
We will prove that you were right.

22
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:30,564
Jeongyun will take the throne.

23
00:02:37,444 --> 00:02:40,883
I'm glad to have good friends.

24
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:48,884
My war is over.

25
00:02:50,883 --> 00:02:53,684
Now it's your fight.

26
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:57,924
Take care of...

27
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:04,324
Jeongyun and 4th Prince.

28
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:09,964
Your highness...

29
00:03:20,724 --> 00:03:23,564
Let's get married.

30
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:25,364
What?

31
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:29,324
Once married,
we can leave the palace.

32
00:03:58,883 --> 00:04:02,644
I heard Father regained his appetite
after drinking someone's tea.

33
00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:04,764
I knew it was you.

34
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:07,764
It's a secret.
And it's temporary.

35
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:12,404
Once I mix the leaves as Lady Oh taught
I will leave.

36
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:14,484
Did I say something?

37
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,604
It's been a while since
my sis inhabited Damiwon.

38
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:19,604
I'm just happy.

39
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:28,764
I experienced the battlefields.

40
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:31,324
Once back,

41
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:35,564
I really wanted to drink
my sister's tea.

42
00:04:36,883 --> 00:04:38,084
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:41,244
Don't say that.

44
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:45,924
I can't even help your situation.
I'm useless.

45
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:52,884
I will get you back here.

46
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:55,324
I'm an adult now.

47
00:04:57,804 --> 00:04:59,724
I'm okay.

48
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:03,324
I'll stop calling you "sis."

49
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:07,804
I'll take care of everything.
Wait for me.

50
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:19,764
Jeongyun can't know about the situation.

51
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:22,883
I've already blocked
all ways out of Songak.

52
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:25,204
The moment Father passes

53
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:28,444
we need to secure the will
and take the upper hand.

54
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:34,684
Brother,
what about Father?

55
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:09,684
What are you doing?

56
00:06:09,844 --> 00:06:12,324
Princes.
Go back.

57
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:15,364
The Emperor will
soon be giving out orders.

58
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:17,004
Can't do.

59
00:06:17,284 --> 00:06:19,484
In case something happens to the Emperor,

60
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:22,044
we need to guard Cheondeokjeon
so no one changes his will.

61
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,604
Perhaps you want to change his will?

62
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:32,883
If you don't want that suspicion,
leave now.

63
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:37,004
Brother So disappeared.

64
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:38,684
What?

65
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:45,044
Whoever enters Cheondeokjeon
without the Emperor's approval

66
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:48,883
will be charged with treason
and will be slain.

67
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:51,004
Princes, please.

68
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:53,883
Leave now.

69
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:21,164
Move away.

70
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,804
I need to see the Emperor.

71
00:07:28,524 --> 00:07:30,044
You dare block me?

72
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:32,883
- Do you want to die?
- Guard the door.

73
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:40,884
Jimong.
Are you hiding his condition?

74
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:43,844
- I'm sorry.
- And the princes?

75
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:46,284
Have you done something to them?

76
00:07:46,764 --> 00:07:47,964
Of course not.

77
00:07:48,204 --> 00:07:50,883
They'll be heading back
to their respective quarters.

78
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:57,124
You're buying time
till Jeongyun gets back.

79
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:15,964
Your Highness.

80
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:23,844
Even the scent of your tea
resembles Suyeon's.

81
00:08:24,644 --> 00:08:26,044
How are you doing?

82
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:29,564
I'll die soon.

83
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:34,964
Bring Jeongyun.

84
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:38,004
He must not be late.

85
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:40,164
Me?

86
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:44,244
- I'll find someone who can do it.
- No.

87
00:08:45,164 --> 00:08:46,883
It has to be you.

88
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:52,044
Except for my people here...

89
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:55,924
no one can find out about my death...

90
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:59,444
before Jeongyun gets here.

91
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:01,444
What?

92
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:07,804
Once you leave
someone will approach you.

93
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:13,244
He'll ask about my condition.

94
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:18,164
Is he asks how I am

95
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:22,684
just answer that I asked for tea.

96
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:29,284
Beware of the one
who asks of my death.

97
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,724
That person...

98
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:37,924
...is the one targeting the throne.

99
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:47,004
Go now.

100
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:50,364
Do not trust anyone.

101
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:53,444
The fate of Goryeo...

102
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:57,324
...depends on you.

103
00:10:00,324 --> 00:10:04,324
It's probably one of the reasons
you got here.

104
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:06,564
- Heighten security.
- Yes, general.

105
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:25,044
Move away or you'll die.

106
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,324
No one can leave Songak.

107
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:39,604
It must have been Uk's orders.

108
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:42,883
My assumption was right.

109
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:46,964
Last night,
Uk was wearing armor.

110
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:49,883
I saw it underneath his sleeves.

111
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:55,164
I wondered why
he appeared in armor.

112
00:10:57,883 --> 00:11:01,564
Was he planning to attack Father
at the recital?

113
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:13,924
Su.

114
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:30,724
Where are you going?

115
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:37,084
The Emperor asked for tea.

116
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,684
I'm headed to Damiwon.

117
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:46,883
Marrying So?

118
00:11:47,564 --> 00:11:50,604
I didn't know you were that close.
I'm surprised.

119
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:52,883
It's a misunderstanding.
4th Prince is...

120
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:58,883
Anyway, I'm on an errand
for the Emperor.

121
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:01,883
I'll explain when I'm back.

122
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:12,604
- Actually...
- Perhaps...

123
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:14,883
Is Father...

124
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:17,644
...dead?

125
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:23,444
I'm just worried.

126
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,604
Is Father...

127
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:27,964
...dead?

128
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:31,284
Beware of the one
who asks of my death.

129
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:36,804
That person...

130
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,124
...is the one targeting the throne.

131
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:51,124
Do you want...

132
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:55,883
...to be...

133
00:12:57,924 --> 00:12:59,804
...the Emperor?

134
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:02,204
Last night doesn't matter.

135
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,883
Father has fallen anyway.

136
00:13:04,924 --> 00:13:07,364
Now the question is,
who takes the throne.

137
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:10,764
Jeongyun is the successor.
That's father's will.

138
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:12,284
What about you?

139
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:15,844
Do you...
want to be Emperor?

140
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:20,124
Do you...

141
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:25,883
...want to be Emperor?

142
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:32,204
Emperor...

143
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:35,604
I didn't know
it was that easy to become.

144
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:37,924
If I help, yes.

145
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:42,044
If this Hwangbo family girl
takes your side,

146
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,124
yes, you can be Emperor.

147
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:48,364
When I lost you...

148
00:13:50,284 --> 00:13:52,844
...I felt powerless.

149
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:56,844
In this palace...

150
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,444
...if I want to protect
the ones I love,

151
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:03,164
I learned that I need ultimate power.

152
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:07,804
What can I do
if I become Emperor?

153
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:10,524
The world becomes yours.

154
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,284
You can have everything.

155
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:15,324
Does that...

156
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:18,444
...include someone's heart?

157
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:22,044
Once I'm Emperor...

158
00:14:22,684 --> 00:14:25,364
...can I have the heart
of someone I desperately love?

159
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:27,404
If you asked
if I want to be Emperor...

160
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,883
the answer is "Yes."

161
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:33,884
If that's the case...

162
00:14:35,644 --> 00:14:36,924
...my answer is "Yes."

163
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:41,883
I will...

164
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:45,284
...become Emperor.

165
00:14:55,883 --> 00:14:59,084
Emperor!
Are you okay?

166
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:07,724
Emperor...

167
00:15:08,844 --> 00:15:10,684
Are you conscious?

168
00:15:36,404 --> 00:15:38,364
Suyeon...

169
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:58,524
He's gone.

170
00:16:05,724 --> 00:16:06,883
No...

171
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:14,883
You can't go without me.

172
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:18,404
Wake up!

173
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:20,883
Empress.

174
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,724
Don't leave me like this.

175
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:28,644
Come back.

176
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,204
Don't go like this.

177
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:34,484
You can't leave me like this!

178
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:37,764
Come back!

179
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:40,804
Come back...
Wake up.

180
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:45,204
Come back!
Come back...

181
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:52,364
Come back!

182
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,364
You miserable...

183
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,164
For you...

184
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,364
...I will become Emperor.

185
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:04,284
For me?

186
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,964
Because of me?

187
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:07,844
It's already happening.

188
00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:09,444
Tomorrow.

189
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:12,284
I'm attacking Cheondeokjeon
with 3rd brother.

190
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:14,444
No, you can't.

191
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:17,244
It's treason.

192
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:19,883
Haesu.

193
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:23,124
Jeongyun won't be back in time.

194
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:26,524
It's whoever takes the empty space.

195
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:32,604
So, don't tell anyone.

196
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:35,684
Hide and wait for me.

197
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:39,364
Can you?

198
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:45,284
I'll ask again.

199
00:17:47,284 --> 00:17:48,564
Is Father...

200
00:17:50,124 --> 00:17:51,883
...already dead?

201
00:17:52,244 --> 00:17:53,804
The Emperor...

202
00:17:56,244 --> 00:17:58,244
...asked for tea.

203
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,004
Jeongyun is...

204
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:16,364
...south of Chahyeon.

205
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,883
You won't be able to reach him.

206
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:53,804
Become the Emperor
just to win someone's heart?

207
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,883
Is the throne that petty to you?

208
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:57,684
Yes, it is.

209
00:18:58,564 --> 00:18:59,844
Step aside.

210
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:03,924
Or I will treat this as treason.

211
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:08,484
I'm the one trying to stop treason
at this critical time.

212
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:13,524
I can't make way not knowing
who you're trying to bring in.

213
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:16,884
No exceptions.
Go back.

214
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:30,724
You blew it.
If it wasn't for you...

215
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:33,684
I could have killed him off.

216
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,164
Did you disguise yourself as a geisha
to assassinate the Emperor?

217
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,684
I'm terrified of you.

218
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:45,844
Why did you do it?

219
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:49,604
- What deep grudge did you have?
- Your father...

220
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:52,724
...killed my family.

221
00:19:55,924 --> 00:19:57,204
Everyone.

222
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:01,044
Only I survived.

223
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:04,964
Everyone else is dead.

224
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:16,604
Is that why you slit your wrist?

225
00:20:21,244 --> 00:20:22,883
Because of my father?

226
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:29,204
I'm sorry.

227
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:32,244
I apologize instead.

228
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:35,364
I'm sorry.

229
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,084
I'm sorry I'm his son.

230
00:21:09,364 --> 00:21:10,644
I think...

231
00:21:11,284 --> 00:21:13,883
...Father is already dead.

232
00:21:14,444 --> 00:21:16,124
Or nearing it.

233
00:21:16,724 --> 00:21:20,164
If we don't do anything,
Jeongyun will take the throne.

234
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:24,883
Hey, great timing.

235
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:27,684
Did you hear anything?

236
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:29,804
Do you know if Father...

237
00:21:30,884 --> 00:21:33,524
- Passed away?
- Watch what you say.

238
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,883
He drank Damiwon tea.
Probably recovering now.

239
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:39,004
- So, don't say that.
- Are you sure?

240
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:43,524
Then why are they still
keeping our mothers there?

241
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:46,883
Still?
Are they still in Cheondeokjeon?

242
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:49,444
They're hiding Father's condition.

243
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,883
Hence keeping the Empresses locked in.

244
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:55,883
- I'll see what I can do.
- Wait.

245
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,244
The Damiwon part.

246
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:01,004
Who told you about the tea?

247
00:22:02,164 --> 00:22:06,284
Father seems to regain his appetite
when he drinks Haesu's tea.

248
00:22:07,004 --> 00:22:10,444
She brought him tea
last night and this morning.

249
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:13,883
Find the girl.

250
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:17,644
She's the only one
who knows his condition.

251
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:21,724
We have to stop her from
giving information to Jeongyun.

252
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,883
Find her.
Now!

253
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,364
- Have you seen Haesu?
- Who is Haesu?

254
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:38,404
You know, the girl
who works with the geishas.

255
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:43,204
Don't know?

256
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:48,324
The Emperor has passed.

257
00:22:51,564 --> 00:22:52,724
What?

258
00:22:53,484 --> 00:22:56,724
The last time I saw him,
he was on his last breath.

259
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,204
So probably...

260
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:06,004
He told me to
go get Jeongyun secretly.

261
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:13,524
I heard 3rd Prince is going to
attack Cheondeokjeon tomorrow.

262
00:23:14,764 --> 00:23:16,883
We have to get Jeongyun
and stop him.

263
00:23:17,444 --> 00:23:18,883
How did you know?

264
00:23:22,044 --> 00:23:24,084
That's not important.

265
00:23:27,924 --> 00:23:30,204
Jeongyun is at
the old Hubaekje grounds.

266
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:33,804
All ways out of Songak are blocked.

267
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:36,764
We need to find another way.

268
00:23:37,244 --> 00:23:38,524
Hubaekje...

269
00:23:40,883 --> 00:23:42,684
I know who can help.

270
00:23:48,444 --> 00:23:51,604
No one knew your intentions,
thanks to the commotion.

271
00:23:52,844 --> 00:23:56,964
Can't you just put it in the past
and be with me?

272
00:24:00,004 --> 00:24:01,284
Uhui.

273
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:07,444
Didn't you say
you were from Hubaekje?

274
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:12,884
- Why do you ask?
- We need to go get Jeongyun.

275
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:15,204
- What?
- How can we trust her?

276
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:19,804
She's my friend.
You can trust her.

277
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:24,364
I don't know what you need,
but I vouch for her.

278
00:24:27,564 --> 00:24:28,804
It seems...

279
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:31,883
- Father has passed.
- What?

280
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:41,883
Are you sure?

281
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,964
I believe so.

282
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:48,884
Soon, brother Yo...

283
00:24:50,764 --> 00:24:51,964
and Uk...

284
00:24:53,804 --> 00:24:55,883
will attack Cheondeokjeon
to take the throne.

285
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:02,724
I'll stop the two.
You bring Jeongyun.

286
00:25:03,604 --> 00:25:05,124
It'll take two days.

287
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,284
Uk has secured the exits.

288
00:25:11,364 --> 00:25:12,883
There's a way out...

289
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:15,804
...that no one else knows.

290
00:25:21,883 --> 00:25:26,844
If So was trying to get out,
it must have been to get Jeongyun.

291
00:25:27,604 --> 00:25:31,924
- Do you think Father already passed?
- I'm not sure.

292
00:25:32,804 --> 00:25:35,484
Mother is still locked in.

293
00:25:35,883 --> 00:25:38,804
That means no one outside
knows about Father's condition.

294
00:25:39,484 --> 00:25:40,964
This is our chance.

295
00:25:41,364 --> 00:25:43,924
Let's attack Cheondeokjeon
and get Mother out.

296
00:25:44,324 --> 00:25:47,484
We can say you were the successor
in Father's will.

297
00:25:47,604 --> 00:25:49,164
No one will be able to refute.

298
00:25:50,044 --> 00:25:53,284
It's too risky to tamper with his will.

299
00:25:53,364 --> 00:25:56,484
- We'll lose if we hesitate.
- Didn't I tell you?

300
00:25:56,883 --> 00:26:00,444
I don't want to be an Emperor
that's labeled as a traitor.

301
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:05,883
I want perfection.
I need to be flawless.

302
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:10,484
I don't know what your
real intention is.

303
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:15,044
You wore armor yesterday.

304
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:19,764
I thought you were with Yo.
But now you're backing off from Jeongyun?

305
00:26:20,564 --> 00:26:21,883
I'm confused.

306
00:26:22,324 --> 00:26:24,244
I'm just trying to figure out...

307
00:26:25,604 --> 00:26:27,804
...who is better to attack first.

308
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:32,284
Jeongyun?
3rd brother?

309
00:26:34,004 --> 00:26:35,364
Or...

310
00:26:42,764 --> 00:26:46,724
I cannot make a mistake
on my way to the throne.

311
00:26:48,844 --> 00:26:50,564
Brother, you've changed.

312
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:57,164
Now you seem like
you really want to be Emperor.

313
00:26:58,844 --> 00:26:59,924
I'm happy.

314
00:27:03,604 --> 00:27:05,883
If the circumstances don't change,
I must.

315
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:10,204
I do have one worry.

316
00:27:12,124 --> 00:27:13,883
A betrayal.

317
00:27:29,844 --> 00:27:32,484
Why?
Do you want to sit there?

318
00:27:33,844 --> 00:27:34,884
No.

319
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:37,324
I don't.

320
00:27:40,684 --> 00:27:42,764
Everyone is risking their lives for that.

321
00:27:43,883 --> 00:27:45,244
But you don't want it?

322
00:27:45,924 --> 00:27:47,964
To protect that seat...

323
00:27:48,644 --> 00:27:51,404
the Emperor let go of Lady Oh.

324
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:53,604
And you...

325
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,883
You have to fight your brothers.

326
00:28:03,524 --> 00:28:05,124
I'm terrified.

327
00:28:11,884 --> 00:28:14,004
When you fight tomorrow...

328
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:19,084
...you won't hurt him, will you?

329
00:28:20,804 --> 00:28:22,084
Worried about Uk?

330
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:26,524
Because you're relatives?

331
00:28:29,684 --> 00:28:31,444
Then why did you come to ask me?

332
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,004
You could have just stood by.

333
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,883
He said it was because of me.

334
00:28:42,244 --> 00:28:47,044
He said he was angry
he couldn't stop my banishment.

335
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:51,924
He said he was helpless.

336
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:56,604
That's why he wanted power.

337
00:28:58,924 --> 00:29:00,004
Yeah.

338
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:03,444
I was like that before.

339
00:29:06,883 --> 00:29:08,204
The Emperor told me...

340
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,724
...to go with the flow.

341
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:17,204
So I will take Jeongyun's side.

342
00:29:20,084 --> 00:29:22,883
But if 8th Prince gets hurt...

343
00:29:25,124 --> 00:29:26,844
...it will scar me...

344
00:29:28,804 --> 00:29:30,564
...for the rest of my life.

345
00:29:32,883 --> 00:29:33,924
Understood.

346
00:29:35,244 --> 00:29:38,284
Can't say for sure,
but I will try my best.

347
00:29:41,444 --> 00:29:43,404
I don't want Uk dead either.

348
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:48,124
I might get hurt too.

349
00:29:48,883 --> 00:29:50,484
Not worried about that?

350
00:29:51,604 --> 00:29:53,804
You'll be all right.

351
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,564
That...

352
00:29:59,284 --> 00:30:00,724
...I know for sure.

353
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:07,004
Even the most immortal of beings...

354
00:30:07,883 --> 00:30:09,844
eventually die.

355
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:21,883
Now that you say it like that,

356
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:24,764
I do feel invincible.

357
00:30:26,484 --> 00:30:29,804
At least it's not tomorrow...

358
00:30:31,124 --> 00:30:33,883
...if history is correct.

359
00:30:46,883 --> 00:30:47,964
Go away.

360
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:50,204
He's mine.

361
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:52,164
Don't touch him.

362
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:56,844
He wouldn't want to be seen like this.

363
00:30:56,883 --> 00:30:58,244
What do you know?

364
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:03,124
Have you ever been
truly loved by him?

365
00:31:06,084 --> 00:31:07,404
I said don't!

366
00:31:12,883 --> 00:31:15,804
Don't miss the big picture,
immersed in your feelings.

367
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:19,764
Empress.

368
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:33,883
I came...

369
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:37,444
...to say goodbye.

370
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:43,604
How did you get in?

371
00:31:44,684 --> 00:31:45,844
Is Yo here too?

372
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:47,883
And Jeong?

373
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:21,244
His last words were...

374
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:23,324
Fleeting life.

375
00:32:24,764 --> 00:32:26,244
Life is transient.

376
00:32:27,284 --> 00:32:28,604
Empty.

377
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:31,844
Nothing lasts.

378
00:32:50,883 --> 00:32:52,883
2 YEARS AGO
SHINJU

379
00:32:53,044 --> 00:32:57,883
Does father think one mask a year
fulfills his duty as a parent?

380
00:34:06,684 --> 00:34:07,844
Jimong.

381
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,364
How many guards and weapons
do we have in Cheondeokjeon?

382
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,604
Tell the general to find out.

383
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:21,284
When the sun comes up...

384
00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:24,883
...3rd Prince Yo
and 8th Prince Uk...

385
00:34:25,644 --> 00:34:26,964
...will commit mutiny.

386
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:32,883
The Emperor wanted
Jeongyun to succeed him.

387
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:36,724
We will fulfill his wishes.

388
00:34:37,164 --> 00:34:39,044
I will ask the general.

389
00:34:41,564 --> 00:34:46,044
Did you say Uk?
I heard wrong, didn't I?

390
00:34:48,764 --> 00:34:49,924
I'm sorry.

391
00:34:51,644 --> 00:34:52,844
Mutiny?

392
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,404
What about Yo?

393
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,844
He's probably coming to get me.

394
00:34:58,004 --> 00:35:01,564
He just wants to know
why you locked me in.

395
00:35:05,924 --> 00:35:07,284
Don't touch Yo.

396
00:35:07,883 --> 00:35:11,004
If you lay your hands on him
I will kill you.

397
00:35:13,284 --> 00:35:15,883
It's treason.
And you want him to live?

398
00:35:17,164 --> 00:35:19,324
You are asking too much.

399
00:35:29,404 --> 00:35:30,883
Leave my son alone!

400
00:35:31,883 --> 00:35:35,164
Treason?
You bastard!

401
00:35:38,524 --> 00:35:40,883
Shut up.
Are you stupid?

402
00:35:41,124 --> 00:35:43,444
Our sons' lives are at stake.

403
00:35:43,804 --> 00:35:46,084
We need to figure out a way
to save them.

404
00:35:46,604 --> 00:35:50,084
Forget about being a wife;
now we need to be mothers.

405
00:35:50,404 --> 00:35:51,644
Understood?

406
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:11,364
Keep going.

407
00:36:11,924 --> 00:36:14,124
A quick rest saves more time.

408
00:36:14,604 --> 00:36:17,164
Your wound will get worse if we don't.

409
00:36:18,204 --> 00:36:20,044
You might not even make it.

410
00:36:32,444 --> 00:36:34,884
I never wanted to hide
that I was a prince.

411
00:36:36,124 --> 00:36:38,284
I wasn't deceiving you.

412
00:36:41,044 --> 00:36:42,404
I know.

413
00:36:44,684 --> 00:36:46,244
You're not like that.

414
00:36:51,724 --> 00:36:53,484
I hid too.

415
00:36:56,244 --> 00:36:57,883
I guess we're even.

416
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:06,924
If I was just a musician
and you were a dancer...

417
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:11,804
...would it have been different?

418
00:37:14,404 --> 00:37:15,884
You know, us...

419
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,444
Would we be different?

420
00:37:25,883 --> 00:37:27,924
You need to rest.

421
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:31,244
One more mountain...

422
00:37:33,924 --> 00:37:35,124
and then...

423
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:39,684
It's old Hubaekje territory.

424
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,204
My homeland.

425
00:37:43,004 --> 00:37:46,804
Is tomorrow...
our last day together?

426
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:50,964
We'll probably never meet again.

427
00:37:52,724 --> 00:37:53,883
I don't want to.

428
00:37:56,764 --> 00:37:57,844
Okay.

429
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:02,124
Well, that's you.

430
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,844
If today is our last day,
then...

431
00:38:15,924 --> 00:38:19,883
Can I do whatever I want tonight?

432
00:38:24,883 --> 00:38:29,604
Then will you confess your love?

433
00:38:31,244 --> 00:38:38,204
That you love me too

434
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:55,604
Strangely quiet.

435
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:59,124
Like they're expecting us.

436
00:38:59,284 --> 00:39:03,524
Jeongyun took most of the army.
There aren't many left.

437
00:39:04,564 --> 00:39:08,244
It will take him at least
another day to get here.

438
00:39:09,084 --> 00:39:10,804
Can I ask a favor?

439
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:14,604
Whatever you want.

440
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:19,524
If 4th Prince So gets in our way...

441
00:39:22,564 --> 00:39:24,604
...please take his life.

442
00:39:24,883 --> 00:39:26,964
That's not a favor.

443
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:30,964
I was going to kill him anyway.

444
00:40:03,883 --> 00:40:08,724
Bringing army into the palace
is clearly treason!

445
00:40:09,084 --> 00:40:11,724
Mother has been gone for a day.

446
00:40:12,044 --> 00:40:14,924
I need to know why
you locked Cheondeokjeon down.

447
00:40:15,364 --> 00:40:18,604
The Emperor needs absolute rest.

448
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:22,404
Do you think I believe your lies?

449
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:25,684
Let my mother out, or else...

450
00:40:26,484 --> 00:40:29,484
I will take it that you're trying to
drive Jeongyun out

451
00:40:29,564 --> 00:40:30,883
and take the throne.

452
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:56,364
Jeongyun!

453
00:42:06,084 --> 00:42:08,883
Uk!
Get into Cheondeokjeon...

454
00:42:20,324 --> 00:42:23,244
Are you betraying me?

455
00:42:23,484 --> 00:42:25,524
I was never on your side.

456
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:27,444
So it's not betrayal.

457
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:30,883
Uk already told me about your plans.

458
00:42:31,324 --> 00:42:33,284
That's why I'm back.

459
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:37,644
Uk, you made a great contribution.

460
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,084
It's my honor, Jeongyun.

461
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:48,883
So, it was to trap me all along?

462
00:43:13,964 --> 00:43:15,444
The Emperor...

463
00:43:17,884 --> 00:43:19,844
...has just passed.

464
00:43:22,883 --> 00:43:26,644
His will was to have
Jeongyun succeed him.

465
00:43:27,884 --> 00:43:30,644
The Empresses confirmed his death...

466
00:43:31,044 --> 00:43:33,164
and his will.

467
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,284
I announce this to all of the Princes.

468
00:43:37,884 --> 00:43:39,044
Father...

469
00:43:42,764 --> 00:43:44,684
Greetings to the new Emperor.

470
00:43:44,804 --> 00:43:47,724
Hurray! Hurray!
Hurray!

471
00:43:51,724 --> 00:43:53,244
Greetings to the Emperor.

472
00:43:53,484 --> 00:43:56,084
Hurray! Hurray!
Hurray!

473
00:43:56,364 --> 00:43:57,964
What are you all doing?

474
00:43:58,484 --> 00:44:01,883
Serve your new Emperor!

475
00:44:02,044 --> 00:44:05,804
Hurray! Hurray!
Hurray!

476
00:44:57,684 --> 00:44:59,324
Is he really dead?

477
00:45:04,564 --> 00:45:06,164
I don't believe this.

478
00:45:10,404 --> 00:45:11,604
Emperor...

479
00:45:17,804 --> 00:45:18,883
Father...

480
00:45:21,884 --> 00:45:23,284
Father...

481
00:45:27,924 --> 00:45:29,684
Wait and see, Emperor.

482
00:45:30,883 --> 00:45:33,924
You always wanted me out
because I was too ambitious.

483
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:39,364
I, Yeonhwa, promise you
I will make this throne... mine.

484
00:45:48,964 --> 00:45:50,164
Are you crazy?

485
00:45:50,244 --> 00:45:52,644
I have to see my father off.

486
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,604
You can't go in the palace.

487
00:45:54,764 --> 00:45:57,804
Because... you're sick.

488
00:45:58,364 --> 00:46:01,044
What are you saying?
I'm not sick.

489
00:46:01,164 --> 00:46:03,564
You're like dying, sick.
Can't even move, sick.

490
00:46:03,684 --> 00:46:06,804
That's why you can't show up.

491
00:46:07,124 --> 00:46:08,883
That's the only way to survive.

492
00:46:12,284 --> 00:46:13,564
Die?

493
00:46:13,883 --> 00:46:15,764
I don't understand.

494
00:46:15,883 --> 00:46:18,924
Do you know the first thing
a new Emperor does?

495
00:46:20,883 --> 00:46:24,604
He kills his brothers and nephews
who endanger the throne.

496
00:46:33,883 --> 00:46:34,884
Kill?

497
00:46:35,164 --> 00:46:37,764
You have to lay low
if you want to live.

498
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,883
You have to make the Emperor
forget about you.

499
00:46:44,604 --> 00:46:47,684
Why are you giving me your armor?

500
00:46:47,884 --> 00:46:50,883
You want me to live instead?
Wearing your armor?

501
00:46:51,284 --> 00:46:53,883
Show some respect.

502
00:46:54,684 --> 00:46:58,404
Are you willing to live and die with me?

503
00:46:58,484 --> 00:47:01,324
Are you crazy?
I'm not going to die with you.

504
00:47:06,404 --> 00:47:08,883
I mean, we don't have to die.

505
00:47:10,684 --> 00:47:11,883
Let's...

506
00:47:13,604 --> 00:47:14,883
...live together.

507
00:47:15,724 --> 00:47:18,644
Only heaven knows our fate.
But still...

508
00:47:18,724 --> 00:47:21,924
We're married.
It would be depressing to die alone.

509
00:47:24,084 --> 00:47:25,524
My prince!

510
00:47:34,324 --> 00:47:36,284
You were already on Jeongyun's side.

511
00:47:37,883 --> 00:47:40,004
Why did you lie to me?

512
00:47:45,044 --> 00:47:46,883
On purpose?

513
00:47:47,924 --> 00:47:50,604
- Were you testing me?
- You...

514
00:47:51,524 --> 00:47:53,684
You went to So.

515
00:47:55,883 --> 00:47:57,004
Were you...

516
00:47:58,284 --> 00:48:00,844
...planning to kill 4th Prince?

517
00:48:06,524 --> 00:48:08,883
I wasn't lying when I said
that I wanted to be Emperor.

518
00:48:09,883 --> 00:48:13,084
It makes sense to get rid of obstacles.

519
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:16,684
I...

520
00:48:18,044 --> 00:48:22,324
You knew how hurt I was
when Lady Oh had to go like that.

521
00:48:23,883 --> 00:48:26,883
You tried to use me
to kill 4th Prince.

522
00:48:31,084 --> 00:48:32,484
You changed.

523
00:48:34,324 --> 00:48:37,084
- I don't know you.
- Ditto.

524
00:48:37,883 --> 00:48:39,564
Why did you hide the truth?

525
00:48:39,964 --> 00:48:42,883
I wanted you to tell me
Father had passed.

526
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,164
Did you...

527
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,924
Did you not care if I died?

528
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:53,164
The Emperor wanted me to help
Jeongyun succeed him.

529
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:54,764
That's the right way.

530
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:58,124
I couldn't disobey him.
And...

531
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:01,884
4th Prince...

532
00:49:03,964 --> 00:49:06,964
He promised me
he wouldn't hurt you.

533
00:49:09,564 --> 00:49:10,844
You...

534
00:49:11,924 --> 00:49:14,124
You begged So for my life?

535
00:49:18,564 --> 00:49:20,084
Do you remember?

536
00:49:22,404 --> 00:49:25,044
You wanted to leave Songak together
and live a simple life.

537
00:49:28,764 --> 00:49:30,444
Now is the time.

538
00:49:31,364 --> 00:49:34,764
- The new Emperor will grant us our wish.
- We can't.

539
00:49:36,084 --> 00:49:37,883
Something always comes up.

540
00:49:38,724 --> 00:49:40,204
There is no other way.

541
00:49:48,604 --> 00:49:51,364
You said you wanted to be Emperor for me.

542
00:49:54,764 --> 00:49:56,844
You're deceiving yourself.

543
00:50:04,364 --> 00:50:05,844
Now...

544
00:50:08,164 --> 00:50:11,324
...I won't be able to look at you
like before.

545
00:50:14,204 --> 00:50:16,124
Let's keep our distance.

546
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,604
Is it because of So?

547
00:50:24,004 --> 00:50:25,883
Have you...

548
00:50:27,883 --> 00:50:30,684
Have you ever had confidence in me?

549
00:50:32,604 --> 00:50:34,764
Have you ever even...

550
00:50:35,684 --> 00:50:37,044
...trusted me?

551
00:50:42,883 --> 00:50:44,604
I will make you come back.

552
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:50,324
It won't be easy.

553
00:50:57,604 --> 00:51:04,524
Please do not forget

554
00:51:05,883 --> 00:51:10,883
My love never stops

555
00:52:22,324 --> 00:52:24,044
Don't treat him like an animal.

556
00:52:36,644 --> 00:52:39,764
- I'll convince him.
- No.

557
00:52:40,804 --> 00:52:44,844
You won't be able to.
He's still your brother.

558
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:13,244
Give up.

559
00:53:13,883 --> 00:53:16,764
Would you?

560
00:54:22,764 --> 00:54:23,883
Brother.

561
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:32,883
Brother...

562
00:54:33,524 --> 00:54:34,844
Brother!

563
00:55:24,524 --> 00:55:25,883
Nonsense.

564
00:55:28,444 --> 00:55:29,844
It can't be.

565
00:55:31,404 --> 00:55:32,884
No way.

566
00:55:34,284 --> 00:55:35,684
Not Yo.

567
00:55:39,884 --> 00:55:42,204
This can't be happening.

568
00:55:43,404 --> 00:55:46,124
I can find him.
I'll go find him.

569
00:55:46,883 --> 00:55:48,044
Yo...

570
00:55:48,524 --> 00:55:50,884
If I call him, he will come.

571
00:55:51,084 --> 00:55:52,324
Mother...

572
00:55:57,044 --> 00:55:59,124
I told you to keep away from him.

573
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:03,324
Look what he did to my boy!

574
00:56:05,924 --> 00:56:07,324
Jeong...

575
00:56:07,924 --> 00:56:11,564
This can't be happening to me!

576
00:56:11,684 --> 00:56:13,644
- Jeong!
- Mother...

577
00:56:13,883 --> 00:56:16,964
I'm still here.
I'll be by your side.

578
00:56:17,404 --> 00:56:18,964
I won't leave you.

579
00:56:19,644 --> 00:56:21,004
Yo...

580
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,604
My boy.

581
00:56:23,883 --> 00:56:25,364
My boy!

582
00:56:25,484 --> 00:56:26,764
Yo!

583
00:56:58,324 --> 00:57:00,444
Why did you want to see me?

584
00:57:10,604 --> 00:57:13,364
- What is it?
- I thought...

585
00:57:14,644 --> 00:57:16,564
...even if you can't forgive...

586
00:57:17,844 --> 00:57:19,844
...you'd at least understand.

587
00:57:27,883 --> 00:57:29,084
I...

588
00:57:32,444 --> 00:57:34,004
I killed my brother.

589
00:57:52,883 --> 00:57:59,844
I'll be the wind,
I'll hug you

590
00:58:00,124 --> 00:58:06,964
For one day, for today,
please be by my side

591
00:58:08,164 --> 00:58:14,924
I'll be the moonlight,
I'll shine on you

592
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:21,164
Wherever you are, I will be there

593
00:58:23,044 --> 00:58:27,404
I love you

594
00:58:27,484 --> 00:58:31,164
I want you so much

595
00:58:31,324 --> 00:58:38,004
I watch from afar,
and go back again

596
00:58:38,364 --> 00:58:42,604
I confess to you

597
00:58:42,684 --> 00:58:46,724
With all my heart

598
00:58:46,884 --> 00:58:49,964
My love, my love, my love

599
00:58:50,044 --> 00:58:54,044
Can you hear me,
my love?

600
00:58:56,844 --> 00:58:58,684
SCARLET HEART

601
00:58:59,124 --> 00:59:03,883
Do you want me to give up
or keep looking at you?

602
00:59:03,924 --> 00:59:06,964
If you're not coming to me,
don't give me hope.

603
00:59:07,883 --> 00:59:09,324
Brother So is getting married?

604
00:59:09,444 --> 00:59:11,964
Yeah, to Emperor's daughter.
Didn't you know?

605
00:59:12,564 --> 00:59:15,724
I want you to appoint me as successor.

606
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:19,204
The only way to protect our family
was to commit treason.

607
00:59:19,524 --> 00:59:20,804
Is it because of Haesu?

608
00:59:20,964 --> 00:59:23,564
Mutiny?
Did you say mutiny?

609
00:59:23,844 --> 00:59:26,124
A successful mutiny is not treason.

610
00:59:26,484 --> 00:59:28,644
Find the Emperor.
Now!

611
00:59:31,044 --> 00:59:32,324
You!
