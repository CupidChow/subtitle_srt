1
00:00:03,152 --> 00:00:04,792
SCARLET HEART

2
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:12,632
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS

3
00:00:56,352 --> 00:01:00,511
- Rain! It's rain!
- Thank you!

4
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:46,872
Gwangjong...

5
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:39,912
A hero.
He became a hero.

6
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:43,192
How did he hide that big scar?

7
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,072
Probably make-up.

8
00:02:45,392 --> 00:02:48,511
Whoever helped, that person must be good.

9
00:02:55,432 --> 00:02:58,072
The heavens chose
4th brother for a reason.

10
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,511
From now on we must behave properly
in front of brother So.

11
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:29,232
It was 4th Prince.

12
00:03:30,312 --> 00:03:33,432
Wang So is King Gwangjong!

13
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:39,832
Brothers, nephews, loyal servants...

14
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:44,511
Gwangjong killed them all.

15
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:46,552
Killed...

16
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:59,072
The prince saved us!

17
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:02,312
The dragon's son!

18
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:06,872
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir!

19
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:12,912
Does he become emperor
because I hid his scar?

20
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:16,511
No.
History says different.

21
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:20,511
He became emperor without my help.

22
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:37,072
But does prince Wang So really
kill his brothers?

23
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:43,912
Su, we have rain.

24
00:04:44,032 --> 00:04:46,312
He'll soon celebrate it with...

25
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:51,312
Su, what is it?

26
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,152
Does everyone die because of me?

27
00:04:56,392 --> 00:04:57,511
What?

28
00:04:58,592 --> 00:04:59,992
Him...

29
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,432
Does he do it?

30
00:05:05,232 --> 00:05:06,511
Because of me?

31
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:10,952
I want you to be safe.

32
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:49,072
The heavens' first choice was 4th Prince.

33
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:58,552
The heavens couldn't have chosen him.

34
00:06:00,712 --> 00:06:04,672
Should have been me.
It was my place.

35
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:07,472
I should have brought rain!

36
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:32,472
- Mother...
- You lost this great opportunity.

37
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:34,872
When someone tries to steal it,

38
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:37,672
you should bitten his neck
if you had to.

39
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:39,511
You should have taken it back!

40
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:41,712
A mistake.
It was a mistake, mother.

41
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:44,312
- Can't I make one?
- No!

42
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:46,312
You can't.

43
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,472
If you want me to become
mother of the Emperor,

44
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:51,552
be tenacious, be strong.

45
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,352
The Hae family girl in Damiwon.

46
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:59,232
She's the one who
put make-up on So's face.

47
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:03,112
Mother of the Emperor...

48
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:05,272
Damiwon.
Damiwon!

49
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:08,792
The Damiwon girls are all trouble.

50
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:12,511
I will burn that place down.

51
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,392
4th Prince So,
greetings to the Emperor.

52
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:30,511
Prince Wang So.

53
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:33,272
You did a splendid job.

54
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:35,352
You saved the country.

55
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:39,272
I dare conducted the rain ritual
instead of Jeongyun.

56
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:41,511
That's not important.

57
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:45,512
I was cut off by a band of thieves.
I wasn't going to make it anyway.

58
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,511
I am sorry.

59
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:52,511
It's been years since
I've seen your bare face.

60
00:07:57,472 --> 00:08:00,992
A lot of history in that scar.

61
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:08,112
I'm sorry I worried you...

62
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:13,352
Father.

63
00:08:15,952 --> 00:08:19,072
From now on, show your face
and show confidence.

64
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:22,912
Help Jeongyun
build this country properly.

65
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:24,712
Be his support.

66
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,912
I believe in you.

67
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:31,072
I will...

68
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:33,592
do as told.

69
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,511
We can stay here
till they bring the raincoats.

70
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:04,272
Did you cover So's scar?

71
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:14,032
You can get into trouble
for touching a prince's face.

72
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:17,512
But it was the right thing.
Don't worry.

73
00:09:20,112 --> 00:09:21,392
And...

74
00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:26,832
Even if So performed the ritual
in Jeongyun's place...

75
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:29,072
nothing changes.

76
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:31,511
Really?

77
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:33,992
Yes.

78
00:09:36,832 --> 00:09:38,792
It needs to change.

79
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:42,511
Or does it not?

80
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:47,712
Now we have rain, the Emperor
will soon distribute pardons.

81
00:09:48,312 --> 00:09:51,472
It has been a while since
the last court ladies were pardoned.

82
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:53,992
I'm sure it'll happen.

83
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:55,832
Not like this.

84
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:57,992
I need to check.

85
00:10:15,752 --> 00:10:19,511
Do you know who the next Emperor is?

86
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:28,192
Apart from a drastic change,
it should be Jeongyun.

87
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:30,552
Then...

88
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,832
who comes after Jeongyun?

89
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:37,232
- The next is...
- Gwangjong?

90
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:40,511
- You said so.
- What?

91
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,432
I heard you call Prince Wang So
Gwangjong.

92
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:52,832
It just came out of my mouth.
I don't know how.

93
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,192
I was around four or five.

94
00:10:58,712 --> 00:11:00,511
I almost drowned to death.

95
00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:03,272
Actually, I probably did die.

96
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:06,432
But they said I woke up after a day.

97
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:11,672
You were dead...

98
00:11:12,592 --> 00:11:14,511
then alive again?

99
00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:17,072
Mother sometimes told me...

100
00:11:17,632 --> 00:11:20,672
I was different after I came back.

101
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:23,152
I was grown up inside.

102
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:29,511
I didn't tell anyone but...

103
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:33,192
Sometimes I see things.
I don't know if they're real or not.

104
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:36,672
I saw huge birds carry people
and fly in the sky.

105
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:39,511
Stairs or rooms that move up and down.

106
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:43,832
Houses as tall as the sky
filled with people.

107
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:47,511
Is he from the present like me?

108
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:54,432
Does he not remember
because he was too young?

109
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:02,992
I heard you also died
then lived again.

110
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:08,952
I wonder if that made you
see things like I do.

111
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:16,511
Ask me again.

112
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:19,912
What do you really want to know?

113
00:12:21,112 --> 00:12:23,632
Is Wang So really Gwangjong?
Does he kill everyone?

114
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:26,511
And Wang Uk,
what happens to him?

115
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:36,392
What...

116
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:40,872
- should I do?
- Nothing.

117
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:43,511
Don't do anything.

118
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:46,511
Whatever you saw,
let it be.

119
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:49,512
- Don't interfere.
- What if I can change it?

120
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:54,072
I might be able to stop the incident.

121
00:12:54,511 --> 00:12:56,552
Change the direction
so it has a positive outcome.

122
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:59,312
You already manipulated
Wang So's face.

123
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:05,072
Does...

124
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:09,832
his future...

125
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:13,632
change?

126
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:16,872
I don't know.

127
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:20,912
The moment we understand the heavens
it becomes fate.

128
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:24,792
Who knows if it changed
or it was meant to be?

129
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:29,392
Man can never steer away
from the heaven's will.

130
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:33,392
Just let things take their course.

131
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:36,592
That way, you're safe.

132
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:00,392
Since brother So brought rain,

133
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:03,912
I'm sure father will
favor him from now on.

134
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:08,952
Yeah.

135
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:11,472
Probably.

136
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:17,192
If Jeongyun wasn't available,
it should have been you.

137
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:19,312
It was a good opportunity.

138
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,511
That place was meant for So.

139
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:29,072
It called for him.

140
00:14:30,032 --> 00:14:32,192
I shouldn't desire something like that.

141
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,511
Once you're in the Emperor's favor,
other thoughts creep in.

142
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:41,552
I'm just saying there's one more
to worry about now.

143
00:14:42,511 --> 00:14:45,511
Haesu told me So will change.

144
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,872
Now you too?

145
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:50,072
What if...

146
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,712
the Emperor does favor So?

147
00:14:55,872 --> 00:14:58,511
Think of what he went through.

148
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:01,352
Haesu told you to
be careful of So?

149
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:02,552
Why?

150
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:05,592
The person who helped
So take off his mask...

151
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:08,872
...was Haesu.

152
00:15:10,912 --> 00:15:13,632
She's probably worried
she might be punished.

153
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:25,432
I'm sure...

154
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:29,792
there's a position for me out there.

155
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:36,312
What...

156
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:39,511
could...

157
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:44,072
that be?

158
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:14,511
It's me.

159
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:18,832
I...

160
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:21,832
I didn't know.

161
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:26,232
I didn't mean otherwise.
I was just scared.

162
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:28,072
I'm sorry.

163
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,392
Did I say something?

164
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:38,952
I should be the one who's sorry.

165
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:53,232
For the first time in my life...

166
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,511
I called the Emperor, father.

167
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:03,592
For the first time in fifteen years,
he looked at my face, my eyes

168
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:05,912
and told me to be confident.

169
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:11,511
Once I heard that...

170
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:14,511
all my anger and sorrow was wiped away.

171
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:19,672
As he said...

172
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:22,511
I will wholly help Jeongyun.

173
00:17:24,272 --> 00:17:26,952
Everyone thanks me.

174
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:31,512
No one is scared of me.
No one calls me a beast.

175
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,072
I know it's funny...

176
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:37,592
but I kind of like it.

177
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:40,912
And...

178
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:50,952
the one who changed me
is Haesu...

179
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:53,232
You.

180
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:03,872
How does this man
become a brutal killer?

181
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,512
I don't believe it.

182
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:10,872
I know Choe Jimong told me
not to interfere, but...

183
00:18:11,232 --> 00:18:14,552
maybe I can help
and change Gwangjong's future.

184
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:23,632
However angry you are
suppress it.

185
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:27,472
And never hurt others.

186
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:34,272
From now on everyone will like you.
They will never hurt your feelings.

187
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:36,992
Am I being scolded?

188
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:41,792
It's nice.

189
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:54,632
I can do it.

190
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:56,512
I will not look away.

191
00:18:57,432 --> 00:18:59,912
I will keep everyone happy.

192
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:17,511
A while back, your wife asked me
to take care of your daughter Sundeok.

193
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:22,432
I was thinking of marrying her
to one of my sons.

194
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:26,912
You mean the princes?

195
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:38,312
I think 14th Prince is a good fit
with Sundeok.

196
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,992
They both cherish martial arts
and their fortunes align.

197
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:47,232
If they get in a fight,
they'll bring total destruction.

198
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:53,312
What about 13th Prince, Baeka?

199
00:19:53,712 --> 00:19:55,512
The most handsome in Songak.

200
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:58,592
All the women of Goryeo
will be jealous.

201
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:01,872
What if all those women
decide to throw stones at my daughter?

202
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:07,312
What about 4th Prince?

203
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:13,832
They've trained together.
Must have formed some sort of bond.

204
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:18,511
One killed wolves,
the other killed bears.

205
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,032
I'm sure they have
never even met.

206
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,511
So you don't like anyone?

207
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:29,712
8th Prince?

208
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:34,432
He does need to remarry, but
he's too different from Sundeok.

209
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:38,792
Hey, if you want to count down,
go in order.

210
00:20:39,352 --> 00:20:40,511
You know...

211
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:44,511
- You left one out.
- Who?

212
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:50,872
Who?

213
00:20:54,511 --> 00:20:55,672
Are...

214
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:58,272
you sure?

215
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,632
Su, I have something to give you.
Can you make time?

216
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:17,512
Okay.

217
00:21:19,432 --> 00:21:21,072
The Emperor.

218
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:27,511
Greetings to the Emperor.

219
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,192
Good work, everyone.

220
00:21:31,872 --> 00:21:34,512
Especially my 4th son,
you helped end the drought.

221
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,472
I want to give you a prize.
Anything you want?

222
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:43,511
What about land for a house
and fields?

223
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:47,511
I'm sorry, but there is something
I want more than land.

224
00:21:47,511 --> 00:21:49,232
What is it?

225
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:56,352
I want Damiwon court lady
Haesu to serve me.

226
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:57,511
What?

227
00:22:03,511 --> 00:22:05,511
Hmm... okay.

228
00:22:05,952 --> 00:22:09,352
It's good to have help close.

229
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:15,952
Damiwon court lady Haesu,
I promote you to upper court lady.

230
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:18,952
Do your best and support 4th Prince.

231
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:21,312
Yes...

232
00:22:22,232 --> 00:22:24,752
I will do as told.

233
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:30,872
To celebrate the rain,
I will have a prince wedding.

234
00:22:31,072 --> 00:22:32,511
Once the day is chosen,

235
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:35,632
I want General Park Sukyeong's
daughter Sundeok to...

236
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:40,232
marry 10th Prince Eun.

237
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:48,672
Brother, you're getting married.
Congratulations.

238
00:22:49,472 --> 00:22:52,592
I don't want to get married.

239
00:22:58,272 --> 00:22:59,592
Embarrassed?

240
00:22:59,952 --> 00:23:04,312
Make a family
so you can contribute more.

241
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:08,511
4th brother is still single and
8th Prince just lost his wife.

242
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:11,912
I'm not even of age...

243
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,632
And the Park girl...

244
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:20,672
Anyway, no.
I do not want to marry her!

245
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:28,072
Emperor, please take it back.

246
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:30,192
I really don't want to.

247
00:23:31,592 --> 00:23:33,592
If you keep insisting...

248
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:36,792
I will kill myself.

249
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:48,592
You'd rather die than follow my orders?

250
00:23:56,592 --> 00:23:59,832
Do you really want to disobey me
and die?

251
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:09,432
Your highness.

252
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:12,472
10th brother made a mistake
because he was too happy.

253
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:16,112
Eun, thank the Emperor.
Now.

254
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:36,832
I'm forever in your debt.

255
00:24:51,511 --> 00:24:55,632
You can only distinguish women
until the first night.

256
00:24:55,872 --> 00:24:57,952
After that, they're all the same.

257
00:24:58,232 --> 00:25:01,432
Sometimes I mix up the names of
my first and second wife.

258
00:25:01,512 --> 00:25:04,032
I don't want to live like you.

259
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:14,392
You shouldn't watch.

260
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:16,152
That will cheer me up.

261
00:25:16,232 --> 00:25:19,232
- Not a good idea.
- Get out of my way.

262
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:59,272
Warrior!
Warrior!

263
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:05,152
Warrior!
Warrior!

264
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:06,511
Brother.

265
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,392
Brother, she's great.

266
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:13,032
Your wife is better than a man.
A real warrior.

267
00:26:13,152 --> 00:26:15,511
Eun, I'm jealous.

268
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:18,552
They call her a warrior.

269
00:26:19,232 --> 00:26:21,432
I'm marrying a warrior!

270
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:23,912
Warrior!
Warrior!

271
00:26:24,312 --> 00:26:25,872
What's wrong with a warrior?

272
00:26:26,992 --> 00:26:30,832
Warrior!
Warrior!

273
00:29:00,511 --> 00:29:02,511
I was practicing sword dance.

274
00:29:03,272 --> 00:29:05,712
Don't be scared.
I'm not going to hurt you.

275
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,992
Here's taffy.

276
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,432
- Give me.
- Me too.

277
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:15,672
- Take your time and share.
- Yes, sir.

278
00:29:16,152 --> 00:29:18,511
- Go now.
- Thank you, sir.

279
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:32,272
We've met before.
The Baekje lady, right?

280
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:35,552
You owe me for the drawing.

281
00:29:35,992 --> 00:29:37,632
If you don't have money...

282
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:40,312
show me your sword dance.

283
00:29:41,992 --> 00:29:46,072
And you are that...
loser artist?

284
00:29:46,232 --> 00:29:48,872
- Loser artist?
- Drawings, instruments...

285
00:29:48,992 --> 00:29:51,832
Trying hard to
please your noble masters?

286
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:55,472
- Way to go.
- Did you hear me play?

287
00:29:55,511 --> 00:30:00,112
Well, all the dancers in Songak
do go crazy when I play.

288
00:30:00,352 --> 00:30:01,912
Let me see your dance.

289
00:30:02,072 --> 00:30:04,592
Who knows, I might play
some instrumental for you.

290
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:08,192
- I don't dance in front of strangers.
- Picky...

291
00:30:09,472 --> 00:30:11,912
What about an introduction?

292
00:30:12,152 --> 00:30:14,032
I'm Baeka.
And you?

293
00:30:14,232 --> 00:30:15,312
Baeka?

294
00:30:16,872 --> 00:30:20,511
If you're Baeka
then maybe I'm a princess.

295
00:30:21,192 --> 00:30:23,632
Do you think everything is a joke?

296
00:30:24,112 --> 00:30:26,152
Your talent is great.
Too bad your life isn't.

297
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:29,192
I really am Baeka.

298
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:36,832
Oh, you didn't know because
you're new here in Songak.

299
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:39,632
I'm the 13th...

300
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:48,712
Gone again?

301
00:30:55,872 --> 00:30:59,672
Looks weird just like its owner.

302
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:05,832
Before, I was a loser,
now my life sucks?

303
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:10,511
We've only met twice.
Act like you have some manners.

304
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:36,872
You know...

305
00:31:46,752 --> 00:31:49,192
A thank you gift for the bracelet.

306
00:31:51,672 --> 00:31:55,152
Or to celebrate
my pardon from the palace.

307
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,672
Cousin said...

308
00:32:11,152 --> 00:32:14,392
you have too many worries.

309
00:32:14,552 --> 00:32:18,112
She wanted me to help you sleep well.

310
00:32:22,952 --> 00:32:24,432
Thank you.

311
00:32:28,552 --> 00:32:31,472
Oh, I have something too.

312
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:43,232
A... book?

313
00:32:45,912 --> 00:32:48,112
I'll study hard.

314
00:32:50,472 --> 00:32:51,511
Look.

315
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:10,032
I know this!

316
00:33:10,232 --> 00:33:12,272
I used to do it with my friends.

317
00:33:12,352 --> 00:33:14,312
Did you draw it yourself?

318
00:33:25,152 --> 00:33:26,912
Because of Eun's marriage...

319
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:30,272
from the rain celebration...

320
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:34,752
court ladies pardon was omitted.

321
00:33:43,512 --> 00:33:45,832
My time will come.

322
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:48,511
I'm lady Oh's best lady.

323
00:33:48,512 --> 00:33:52,032
I was worried Damiwon would
miss me, anyway.

324
00:33:52,272 --> 00:33:53,912
I was also promoted so...

325
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:58,511
I don't know when
our next chance will come.

326
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:02,232
If you can wait...

327
00:34:03,511 --> 00:34:05,511
I can wait too.

328
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:12,511
But this...

329
00:34:13,112 --> 00:34:15,472
I've seen this before.

330
00:34:21,672 --> 00:34:28,432
I am happy to be with you

331
00:34:30,712 --> 00:34:33,232
I didn't want to say I'm worried.

332
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:35,872
So I told him to wait for me

333
00:34:36,712 --> 00:34:38,112
I fear...

334
00:34:38,752 --> 00:34:40,992
things might go wrong.

335
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:46,592
When it snows again...

336
00:34:47,511 --> 00:34:49,552
let's walk...

337
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,152
together.

338
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:55,872
I'll wait for you.

339
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:06,392
Look into my mind,
find the road there

340
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,312
I...

341
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:11,672
love you.

342
00:35:16,472 --> 00:35:21,472
Please be with me...

343
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:24,752
Forever...

344
00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:34,232
Oh, with you.

345
00:35:37,912 --> 00:35:43,312
Oh, with you.

346
00:35:44,712 --> 00:35:49,511
The emperor likes wild plant tea
more than flower or leaf tea.

347
00:35:49,552 --> 00:35:51,752
Be extra careful.

348
00:35:52,952 --> 00:35:56,592
He had chronic headaches
and dim vision since he was young.

349
00:35:56,712 --> 00:35:59,192
So he enjoys
cassia seed and boxthorn.

350
00:36:00,112 --> 00:36:04,312
He wakes up a lot from thirst
so it's good to mix in some yam.

351
00:36:04,432 --> 00:36:06,152
Yes, miss.

352
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:12,511
Watch out for prince Wang So.

353
00:36:13,832 --> 00:36:14,952
What?

354
00:36:15,032 --> 00:36:17,511
He craved love.
And you taught him to love.

355
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:21,072
If you don't have him in mind
make sure it shows.

356
00:36:22,872 --> 00:36:24,272
What if...

357
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:27,472
I can change his life trajectory?

358
00:36:27,512 --> 00:36:29,712
Should I still keep distance?

359
00:36:36,712 --> 00:36:40,511
The man I loved
before I came here...

360
00:36:41,072 --> 00:36:45,072
He was an unknown soldier whom
I used to collect plants and flowers with.

361
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:49,272
With me, I thought he could
give up his ambitions.

362
00:36:50,472 --> 00:36:54,432
But he climbed the ladder
to places I can not reach.

363
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,232
Do you understand?

364
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:02,592
You can never change a person.

365
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:08,112
So throw away your belief
that you can make change.

366
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:28,512
Let's go.

367
00:37:28,952 --> 00:37:31,511
- What are you doing?
- Are you Haesu?

368
00:37:31,511 --> 00:37:34,072
We need to go see 10th Prince.

369
00:37:35,312 --> 00:37:37,512
Only you can convince him.

370
00:37:37,712 --> 00:37:40,912
I'm worried he might get hurt.
I need you.

371
00:37:43,072 --> 00:37:46,232
I don't know what's going on,
but it's not my business.

372
00:37:46,312 --> 00:37:47,672
You can be his second wife.

373
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,511
If you can serve him well...

374
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:57,712
I'll be okay.

375
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:02,752
I'll make sure it's okay with
the Emperor and my father.

376
00:38:10,752 --> 00:38:12,511
You sure this is okay?

377
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:14,592
If he doesn't come,
he will die.

378
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:16,472
If you want him to live,
break it down.

379
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:21,992
Wait!

380
00:38:35,511 --> 00:38:37,472
It's me, Haesu.

381
00:38:38,072 --> 00:38:40,192
Open the door, please.

382
00:38:40,392 --> 00:38:42,792
You shouldn't be here.
Go back.

383
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:47,592
Open the door, now!

384
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,792
If you don't
I'll never speak to you again.

385
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,672
Do things change if you're drunk?

386
00:39:27,511 --> 00:39:30,472
Do you think getting drunk
will cancel the marriage?

387
00:39:31,472 --> 00:39:33,511
You don't know what I'm going through.

388
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:39,152
You like me, but you have to
marry a girl you don't like.

389
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:47,511
Did you know?
Then why, I mean...

390
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,992
Then, Su...

391
00:39:54,072 --> 00:39:55,232
Will you...

392
00:39:56,552 --> 00:39:59,352
be my second wife?

393
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:04,952
Father and brothers have many wives.
So it's no shame.

394
00:40:05,872 --> 00:40:09,952
I know you can't be my first,
but I'll only look at you.

395
00:40:10,232 --> 00:40:12,511
- Su, please...
- No.

396
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,352
I can't live like that.

397
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:21,392
Sharing my love with other women.

398
00:40:21,992 --> 00:40:25,952
I don't want to grow old
waiting for my turn.

399
00:40:29,312 --> 00:40:30,511
Lies...

400
00:40:32,511 --> 00:40:34,752
Even if you were to be my first wife...

401
00:40:38,032 --> 00:40:39,632
you would have said no.

402
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:55,752
I know I'm not too bright.

403
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:59,272
When my brothers read ten books

404
00:41:00,511 --> 00:41:02,511
I have a hard time with one.

405
00:41:03,872 --> 00:41:06,152
My father's words...

406
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:09,511
Royal scholar's teachings...

407
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:14,232
I've never understood them well.

408
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:19,152
I was always...

409
00:41:19,552 --> 00:41:21,472
the stupid one.

410
00:41:23,511 --> 00:41:25,912
That's why you don't like me.

411
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,072
I was the happiest
when I was with you.

412
00:41:33,392 --> 00:41:37,352
You laugh when you're happy,
you cry when you're sad.

413
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:41,552
So in front of you
I didn't have to be nervous.

414
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,511
I could laugh, cry
and even be angry.

415
00:41:45,632 --> 00:41:47,511
Don't pity me.

416
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:52,392
I knew you were a bad girl.

417
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,272
I knew from the beginning...

418
00:41:56,072 --> 00:41:59,952
That you'd never be mine.

419
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:09,792
If I say I'm sorry...

420
00:42:11,032 --> 00:42:12,832
that would be very bad of me.

421
00:42:15,912 --> 00:42:17,511
So...

422
00:42:19,672 --> 00:42:21,511
I won't apologize.

423
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:24,072
Did you...

424
00:42:29,152 --> 00:42:31,032
ever even like me?

425
00:42:33,392 --> 00:42:34,952
I did, and I do.

426
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:46,792
Be happy.

427
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:55,832
Then will you confess your love?

428
00:42:57,511 --> 00:43:03,952
That you love me too

429
00:43:14,352 --> 00:43:15,392
Brother!

430
00:43:15,472 --> 00:43:17,232
- Grab him!
- No need.

431
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:21,312
I will go willingly.

432
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,632
Let's get married.

433
00:43:28,432 --> 00:43:31,472
We have to hurry.
We'll be late!

434
00:43:39,272 --> 00:43:43,552
I prepared five rolls of ramie cloth
and five rolls of silk.

435
00:43:43,672 --> 00:43:46,511
I hope you make my brother happy
with beautiful clothes.

436
00:43:48,432 --> 00:43:50,872
I brought pearls to wish
for precious babies.

437
00:43:52,511 --> 00:43:56,512
A mirror to reflect each other.
Wish you a happy marriage, Eun.

438
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,511
Eun means silver.
So silver for you.

439
00:44:05,272 --> 00:44:06,912
Benevolence over beauty
they say.

440
00:44:06,992 --> 00:44:11,032
Between man and wife
character triumphs looks.

441
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:14,511
Of course, if you do look good
all the better.

442
00:44:14,592 --> 00:44:16,511
We will cherish everything.

443
00:44:17,672 --> 00:44:20,192
What a great wife, brother.

444
00:44:20,472 --> 00:44:23,072
You cruel girl...
never treated me like that.

445
00:44:24,511 --> 00:44:27,511
Keep smiling like that,
you'll get a Glasgow smile like me.

446
00:44:29,511 --> 00:44:32,672
I sent a tree that flowers
and bears fruits well.

447
00:44:32,752 --> 00:44:34,512
In the summer,
sit in its shade.

448
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,752
In the fall,
enjoy its fruits.

449
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:40,872
Once we have a nice shade,
I'll invite you all.

450
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:43,992
Maybe we can wrestle in the shade.

451
00:44:44,632 --> 00:44:47,552
- Wrestle a newlywed?
- You'll lose anyway.

452
00:44:51,352 --> 00:44:53,592
- Good idea.
- Do it.

453
00:45:37,432 --> 00:45:38,552
Su!

454
00:45:41,752 --> 00:45:44,432
Are you okay, Su?
Su?

455
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:46,312
Watch out for Prince Wang So.

456
00:45:49,511 --> 00:45:51,152
Watch out for Prince Wang So.

457
00:45:51,312 --> 00:45:54,032
Avoid him.
Don't ever get in his way.

458
00:45:54,152 --> 00:45:55,312
Or else...

459
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:58,672
Or else everyone dies.

460
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:02,511
Look at me.
Look, Su!

461
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,392
What do you mean?
Who dies?

462
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:09,432
I want to leave.

463
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,032
I want to get far away from here.

464
00:46:23,472 --> 00:46:25,192
Yes, okay.

465
00:46:25,912 --> 00:46:30,072
I'll make it happen.
Please calm down, Su.

466
00:46:31,232 --> 00:46:32,992
It's going to be okay.

467
00:46:47,512 --> 00:46:52,432
The reason I wanted to see you alone
is to hand out new assignments.

468
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:55,352
3rd Prince Yo.

469
00:46:55,511 --> 00:46:59,432
Leave Songak and
survey the 'po's around the country.

470
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:05,992
Not to mention the volume,
many are attacked by thieves.

471
00:47:06,072 --> 00:47:07,672
PO
HARBORS STORING TAXED CROPS

472
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:11,312
Last year, a royal transporter
was killed managing a po.

473
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:13,192
That's why I want you to go.

474
00:47:13,712 --> 00:47:16,832
Your presence will urge
the officials to be more proactive.

475
00:47:17,912 --> 00:47:20,792
Only take the minimum amount of men.

476
00:47:23,232 --> 00:47:26,032
I will do as told.

477
00:47:26,672 --> 00:47:27,872
Your highness.

478
00:47:28,032 --> 00:47:31,192
What about the management of arms
that 3rd Prince was doing?

479
00:47:32,192 --> 00:47:34,832
4th Prince So can take over.

480
00:47:39,511 --> 00:47:41,192
I will do as told.

481
00:47:48,511 --> 00:47:49,912
Is the Emperor...

482
00:47:50,752 --> 00:47:52,832
- abandoning me?
- Huh?

483
00:47:53,672 --> 00:47:55,112
Of course not.

484
00:47:55,232 --> 00:47:58,511
He's trusting the better prince
to do the harder task.

485
00:48:00,272 --> 00:48:03,312
When you took my place
and gave it to So...

486
00:48:03,712 --> 00:48:07,152
And now father's choices
will lead to a bloodbath among sons.

487
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,592
Will you say
all this is the heavens' plan?

488
00:48:10,952 --> 00:48:14,392
Since you were young
you've always desired Jeongyun's place.

489
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:19,952
Now you should find your own.

490
00:48:20,112 --> 00:48:21,672
Wait and see...

491
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:25,392
where my place will be.

492
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:55,432
Why so surprised?
It's just a family dinner.

493
00:48:55,592 --> 00:48:57,032
Isn't that so, mother?

494
00:48:58,072 --> 00:49:00,752
I'm happy you bared your face.

495
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:05,192
I'm proud the Emperor trusts you.

496
00:49:05,952 --> 00:49:08,312
I was waiting for this day.

497
00:49:09,232 --> 00:49:11,232
Let's erase all bad memories.

498
00:49:11,472 --> 00:49:13,512
May we eat?
Let's eat.

499
00:49:19,592 --> 00:49:23,511
It's my first time having dinner with you
brother So.

500
00:49:24,672 --> 00:49:27,511
When you were born
I was already in Shinju.

501
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:31,232
Let's erase past mistakes
and see each other more.

502
00:49:31,392 --> 00:49:32,592
Yes, brother.

503
00:49:42,511 --> 00:49:45,112
You loved meat when you were young.

504
00:49:51,872 --> 00:49:54,272
I still do.

505
00:49:55,511 --> 00:49:56,792
Eat up.

506
00:50:22,072 --> 00:50:25,952
Heard you're taking over Yo's job.
Must have a lot to learn.

507
00:50:26,472 --> 00:50:29,952
I need to leave. Take your time
and learn from Jeongyun.

508
00:50:30,032 --> 00:50:31,872
- Will do.
- I guess...

509
00:50:31,992 --> 00:50:34,511
You'll spend a lot of time with Jeongyun.

510
00:50:34,792 --> 00:50:37,392
Probably just the two of you.

511
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:39,512
What?

512
00:50:47,352 --> 00:50:48,511
Of course...

513
00:50:50,432 --> 00:50:52,312
You wanted something from me.

514
00:50:52,392 --> 00:50:53,632
Kill Jeongyun.

515
00:51:00,392 --> 00:51:03,192
It's not your first time killing for me.

516
00:51:05,832 --> 00:51:07,272
Will you do it?

517
00:51:08,912 --> 00:51:11,511
Mother, your joke has gone too far.

518
00:51:11,511 --> 00:51:15,912
Throughout history,
every king killed off his brothers.

519
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:19,592
If I don't become emperor,
we're all dead.

520
00:51:20,272 --> 00:51:22,032
We need to attack first.

521
00:51:22,152 --> 00:51:25,272
Jeongyun is different.
He won't kill his brothers.

522
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:34,432
Do you really want this?

523
00:51:35,511 --> 00:51:36,592
Yes.

524
00:51:37,112 --> 00:51:38,511
Then...

525
00:51:39,032 --> 00:51:40,512
I will do it.

526
00:51:41,872 --> 00:51:43,312
And then...

527
00:51:44,992 --> 00:51:48,272
- I will be emperor.
- What?

528
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:53,232
You want a son to become emperor.
Why not me?

529
00:51:53,352 --> 00:51:54,872
Once I get the throne

530
00:51:55,832 --> 00:51:58,952
I promise I won't touch
my blood brothers.

531
00:52:00,232 --> 00:52:01,712
Don't boast.

532
00:52:01,792 --> 00:52:05,632
If I performed the ritual instead,
I would have been credited for rain.

533
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:08,511
Do you think the ritual qualified you?

534
00:52:09,472 --> 00:52:11,872
The heavens are on my side.

535
00:52:12,512 --> 00:52:14,872
You only have mother's family.

536
00:52:14,952 --> 00:52:19,152
Jeongyun's mother's side is weak too.
Do we agree to kill him?

537
00:52:19,352 --> 00:52:22,592
Your brother is the emperor
in the heavens' plan.

538
00:52:22,992 --> 00:52:24,712
Know your place!

539
00:52:29,712 --> 00:52:31,912
I was joking.
Don't overreact.

540
00:52:32,312 --> 00:52:34,511
You make me think otherwise.

541
00:52:36,511 --> 00:52:37,912
Emperor...

542
00:52:40,112 --> 00:52:45,352
I know everyone wants it.
What if I take it?

543
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:52,032
A little make-up
and you forgot who you are.

544
00:52:55,511 --> 00:52:58,112
Do you really think
you're important now?

545
00:52:58,992 --> 00:53:00,912
The reason you performed the ritual

546
00:53:01,072 --> 00:53:04,592
was to make you a scapegoat
in case rain didn't fall.

547
00:53:05,072 --> 00:53:08,152
You're just arrow fodder,
someone to take the fall.

548
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:11,512
Didn't you know
your father used you?

549
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:15,792
I wasn't used.

550
00:53:16,472 --> 00:53:18,511
It was my choice to crawl in.

551
00:53:26,632 --> 00:53:29,472
Even the food was better
on the other side.

552
00:53:29,511 --> 00:53:31,712
Eat with your own family
from now on.

553
00:53:32,312 --> 00:53:34,112
Don't ever call me again.

554
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:51,752
As expected,
he's hard to bring around.

555
00:53:52,792 --> 00:53:54,511
We should cut him off.

556
00:53:55,512 --> 00:53:56,872
You've gone too far!

557
00:53:56,992 --> 00:54:00,312
We're brothers. Why are you
giving kill orders over dinner?

558
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:04,032
If you wanted us to be enemies
why did you even have me?

559
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:07,632
Hey, you.

560
00:54:08,112 --> 00:54:09,511
Jeong!

561
00:54:38,952 --> 00:54:40,511
I was foolish...

562
00:54:42,552 --> 00:54:44,592
to even hope.

563
00:54:45,832 --> 00:54:52,792
For one day, for today,
please be by my side

564
00:54:53,712 --> 00:55:00,672
I'll be the moonlight,
I'll shine on you

565
00:55:01,792 --> 00:55:07,112
Wherever you are,
I will be there

566
00:55:08,712 --> 00:55:12,592
I love you

567
00:55:12,952 --> 00:55:16,792
I want you so much

568
00:55:16,952 --> 00:55:23,872
I watch from afar,
and go back again

569
00:55:24,192 --> 00:55:28,632
I confess to you

570
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:32,392
With all my heart

571
00:55:32,672 --> 00:55:35,552
My love, my love, my love

572
00:55:35,712 --> 00:55:40,032
Can you hear me?

573
00:55:41,432 --> 00:55:43,072
My love

574
00:55:44,472 --> 00:55:51,152
Like the sun rises and sets

575
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:58,432
It is all meant to be

576
00:56:01,272 --> 00:56:05,232
Watch out for Wang So.
Don't ever get in his way...

577
00:56:05,992 --> 00:56:08,832
Watch out for Wang So...

578
00:56:10,312 --> 00:56:14,352
Don't ever get in his way...

579
00:56:45,712 --> 00:56:47,072
Su.

580
00:56:56,032 --> 00:56:58,952
- Let me go.
- Just a minute...

581
00:57:00,632 --> 00:57:02,272
Be with me.

582
00:57:04,752 --> 00:57:06,672
I'm tired.

583
00:57:08,912 --> 00:57:10,552
No!

584
00:57:12,352 --> 00:57:14,432
I'm scared of you.

585
00:57:19,232 --> 00:57:21,472
You said you weren't.

586
00:57:21,952 --> 00:57:26,511
I thought I could change things...
but I was wrong.

587
00:57:27,032 --> 00:57:30,272
Eventually,
you'll destroy everything.

588
00:57:30,511 --> 00:57:33,272
Go away.
Leave us alone!

589
00:57:33,352 --> 00:57:34,872
Don't do this to me!

590
00:57:42,552 --> 00:57:46,511
Please don't push me away.
Don't tell me to leave.

591
00:57:47,511 --> 00:57:51,672
Don't tell me I'm cursed.
Don't tell me I'm an animal.

592
00:57:54,552 --> 00:57:56,511
Not you...

593
00:57:58,552 --> 00:57:59,992
You're...

594
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,072
My girl.

595
00:58:04,432 --> 00:58:06,511
I'm not your girl.

596
00:58:06,992 --> 00:58:09,872
You are my girl.
Mine!

597
00:58:10,472 --> 00:58:12,432
Without my permission,

598
00:58:13,112 --> 00:58:15,072
You can't leave me.

599
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,752
You can't die.

600
00:58:20,432 --> 00:58:22,272
You are my girl.

601
00:58:32,712 --> 00:58:38,712
Hide the tears in your heart

602
00:58:38,992 --> 00:58:44,872
Erase the memories

603
00:58:45,511 --> 00:58:51,872
If we aren't meant to be,
let's stop here

604
00:58:52,352 --> 00:58:59,272
Even if we are in tears
for the rest of our lives

605
00:59:00,712 --> 00:59:06,511
Like the winds scattering away

606
00:59:09,511 --> 00:59:10,752
SCARLET HEART

607
00:59:10,912 --> 00:59:12,872
I will ask the Emperor
to let me marry Haesu.

608
00:59:12,992 --> 00:59:15,752
From now on
I have a new purpose.

609
00:59:15,912 --> 00:59:20,511
Not the daughter or sister of an emperor,
I will be a god who looks down on him.

610
00:59:22,511 --> 00:59:25,632
We won't be safe, you or me.

611
00:59:25,832 --> 00:59:27,992
Who's your target?
Think about it.

612
00:59:28,112 --> 00:59:30,872
Who's the better target?

613
00:59:30,952 --> 00:59:34,511
Yes, we are married
but I don't think of you as my wife.

614
00:59:34,512 --> 00:59:36,632
Stop us from poisoning
Jeongyun if you can.

615
00:59:36,712 --> 00:59:39,232
We only need to get rid of
the tea delivery girl.

616
00:59:39,312 --> 00:59:40,392
Jeongyun will die.

617
00:59:40,472 --> 00:59:42,392
I will stop you.

618
00:59:49,232 --> 00:59:51,511
SCARLET HEART
