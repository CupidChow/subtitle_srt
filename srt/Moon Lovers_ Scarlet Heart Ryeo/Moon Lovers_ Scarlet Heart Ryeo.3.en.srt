00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:06,086
SCARLET HEART

2
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:13,366
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS.

3
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:22,246
She is my wife's sister.

4
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:27,286
She has nothing to do with this.
Let her go.

5
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:29,526
I lost the assassin because of her.

6
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:35,566
Do you really want to shed
unwanted blood?

7
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:41,325
I was just lost.
That's it.

8
00:00:42,606 --> 00:00:45,325
- Trust me.
- Why should I?

9
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:47,366
I don't know you.

10
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,006
So.

11
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:08,046
With the imperial army searching,
we will get the others.

12
00:01:08,406 --> 00:01:10,966
Then we will know
if she is to blame or not.

13
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:14,486
Until then, for my sake...

14
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:17,286
Please let her go.

15
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:34,006
Are you okay?

16
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:39,486
There...

17
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:42,646
Over there, people were...

18
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:45,686
killed.

19
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,325
Killed?

20
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:55,325
Wearing the same mask and outfit.

21
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:12,566
It was a bad idea to let
4th Prince take my place.

22
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:15,766
He wanted to use this
as the chance to stay in Songak.

23
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:18,206
You shouldn't be doubting yourself.

24
00:02:18,325 --> 00:02:19,406
Don't say that.

25
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:22,686
Using my brother's desperation
alone is a crime.

26
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:27,046
He was even hurt.

27
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:41,246
- Search the premises.
- Yes, sir.

28
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:49,726
What did you see?

29
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:52,325
Did the dead just disappear?

30
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:54,646
It was here.

31
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:58,206
I'm sure.
They were stabbed from behind.

32
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:01,886
It was right around here.

33
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,246
- Where did they all go?
- Killed?

34
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:09,006
Who did it?

35
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:12,325
- Tell me who did it!
- How should I know?

36
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:14,326
Yes, there was bloodshed.

37
00:03:16,726 --> 00:03:19,566
Seems like the conspirator
killed off all of his henchmen.

38
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:24,406
It wasn't the imperial army?
Any reports?

39
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,325
They took the bodies.

40
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:30,526
They were thorough.

41
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:33,286
So the one you killed
was our last hope.

42
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:37,286
We don't have any traces.
What are we going to do?

43
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:44,566
Even so...

44
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:48,366
I couldn't risk Su being hurt.

45
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:54,246
We can continue when the sun is up.

46
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,726
First, let's get you patched up.

47
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:26,325
It's over now.
Let's go home.

48
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:56,806
He kept saying he'd kill me.
If I looked, he'd kill me.

49
00:04:56,926 --> 00:04:59,166
I just wanted to give him
what he left behind.

50
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:09,325
Su.

51
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:12,006
It'll all be okay.

52
00:05:15,126 --> 00:05:17,046
What if he really kills me?

53
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,766
Even just now,
he told the assassin to kill me.

54
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:23,646
He doesn't care about anyone.

55
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:26,526
What did I do to deserve this?

56
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,325
Su, it's okay.

57
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:47,526
Stop crying now.
It's okay, Su. It's okay.

58
00:05:48,326 --> 00:05:49,846
Stop crying.

59
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,406
Stop crying,
and let's go home.

60
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:09,325
It's okay.

61
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:32,046
Where is Jeongyun?

62
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,886
I'm here, your highness.

63
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,246
So.

64
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:25,846
He messed it all up.

65
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,126
Tonight should have been the night
you became Jeongyun.

66
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:32,325
I took care of all loose ends.

67
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:37,325
Not one assassin is left breathing.

68
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:43,606
The emperor will not be able to
engage in successor talks for a while.

69
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:45,966
A small victory.

70
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:05,006
I can't believe So took Jeongyun's place.

71
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:08,566
Choe Jimong is also suspicious.

72
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:12,286
I'm sure there's a connection
between the two.

73
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:14,325
Like Jeong said...

74
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:18,006
So has mastered martial arts.

75
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:22,366
The Gang for sure
wouldn't have taught him.

76
00:08:23,206 --> 00:08:27,446
We need to know who So met
and who he's indebted to.

77
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:31,926
If Choe Jimong is involved...

78
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,325
...maybe the Emperor is too.

79
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:41,526
Our spy in Shinju told us
So has met with no one.

80
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,126
Look deeper.

81
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:50,886
We need to know what he's up to,
to figure whose side he's on.

82
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,686
Do not forget.

83
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:00,246
Goryeo must fall into
the hands of my son.

84
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,766
It's not for you to do.

85
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,325
Can't let the servants do it either.

86
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:13,325
How long will you remain in Shinju?

87
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,006
Like your brothers,

88
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:17,726
it'd be better for you to
learn from the best here in Songak.

89
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:19,486
I'm different from Uk.

90
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:22,926
I feel more comfortable
hunting wild beasts.

91
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:26,846
You've only learned to
hide your emotions.

92
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:59,325
That's good for now.

93
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:04,406
Stay and heal here.
I'll let the servants know.

94
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:12,325
Yeonhwa.

95
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:23,126
I sometimes wondered
what kind of woman you'd grow up to be.

96
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,325
You could've been really hurt.
What...

97
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:50,366
What were you thinking?

98
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:53,926
It was just...

99
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:57,766
I was lost.

100
00:12:00,326 --> 00:12:02,325
They were after Jeongyun's life.

101
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,406
- You should be glad she's safe.
- That's right!

102
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:08,966
Today I learned again
how lucky I am.

103
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:13,446
It's a miracle I only got a scratch
from all that.

104
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:15,526
Stop it.

105
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:20,766
- Go and rest now.
- Okay.

106
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:22,286
We're not done yet...

107
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:36,846
Thank you for saving Su.

108
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:40,966
I'm sorry that we're always a burden.

109
00:12:42,246 --> 00:12:43,366
Burden?

110
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:47,046
I've never thought of her like that.

111
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:51,366
I rather enjoy it.

112
00:12:54,846 --> 00:12:56,325
Enjoy it?

113
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:07,446
Our family is the burdened one.

114
00:13:09,086 --> 00:13:12,526
Everyone comes to me
to complain about life's hardships.

115
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,966
They also want a lot.

116
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:19,446
But...

117
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:21,326
Su is different.

118
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:26,126
She always tries to do things
by herself.

119
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:30,286
I enjoy watching her.

120
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:32,286
I feel relieved.

121
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:39,366
I see myself waiting
to see her again.

122
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:51,325
I'm happy and thankful
that you cherish Su.

123
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:15,286
Stop.

124
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:26,886
Why?

125
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:30,846
What now?

126
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:48,206
I told you everything.

127
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:50,846
I was too busy running away.
That was it.

128
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:53,246
It's the truth.

129
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,046
The men with swords stabbed
the masked men from behind.

130
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,086
It happened so fast...

131
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:04,206
Like it was all pre-planned
that they stabbed the...

132
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:08,766
Think harder.
Every little detail. Think!

133
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:15,966
That's enough.

134
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,966
Fur clothes.

135
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:31,966
Everyone else wore black...

136
00:15:33,206 --> 00:15:35,086
But one wore fur clothing.

137
00:15:35,846 --> 00:15:37,325
He gave the kill orders.

138
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,325
Did you see his face?
What did he look like?

139
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:52,846
I couldn't see his face,
but I'm sure he was the leader.

140
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:55,325
He acted like it.

141
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:06,006
Who else knows about this?

142
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:11,325
You're the only one
questioning me.

143
00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:13,126
Erase everything you saw.

144
00:16:13,646 --> 00:16:16,325
There was no man in fur.

145
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:20,325
Su, he's right.

146
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,526
It's safer if no one knows
what you saw.

147
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:28,046
Can I go now?

148
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,325
You!

149
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:37,606
Keep out of my sight.

150
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,366
What did I do wrong?

151
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:51,526
You wanted to kill me.

152
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:54,246
Kill me yourself.

153
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:57,046
Should I have given up?

154
00:16:57,606 --> 00:17:00,325
I tried my best to live,
to not die in vain!

155
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:04,325
Su.

156
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:16,686
Is it a sin to want to live?

157
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:21,966
Isn't everyone the same?

158
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:24,806
Why are you doing this to me?

159
00:17:38,126 --> 00:17:39,526
You bastard!

160
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,606
It'd be better to have
the lights on tonight.

161
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:54,246
Bad experiences lead to
bad nightmares.

162
00:17:57,846 --> 00:18:00,566
What about you?
Will you be okay?

163
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:05,846
- Me?
- Yes, you.

164
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:08,686
To save me, you...

165
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:11,726
...killed a man.

166
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:16,086
You're the one
who might have nightmares.

167
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:19,325
You know, post-traumatic
stress kind of thing.

168
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:25,566
If I had nightmares
every time this happens...

169
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,726
...it'd be too hard for me.

170
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:31,366
So today was not the first?

171
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:33,246
You've killed another...

172
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:43,325
I was 11.

173
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:47,286
The first time I killed a man...

174
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:50,046
was when I was 11.

175
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:55,325
A pack of robbers attacked
my mother and Yeonhwa.

176
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,006
Just like earlier...

177
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:02,086
With a dagger.

178
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:14,966
But I had no nightmares.

179
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:19,806
I protected my family
with my own hands.

180
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:24,325
I was happy.

181
00:19:27,926 --> 00:19:29,286
I was proud.

182
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:40,325
I'm a prince.
I have to live through these things.

183
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:42,926
But it still sticks with you.

184
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:48,566
You still remember.
How could you be at ease?

185
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:53,086
Probably just baring it out.

186
00:19:57,926 --> 00:19:59,646
It's my burden to bear.

187
00:20:02,806 --> 00:20:05,406
I won't cling on to you.
So don't worry about me.

188
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:07,766
What?

189
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:13,526
I won't be a burden.
You can live that much lighter.

190
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:17,126
So don't worry about me.

191
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:20,126
I can take care of myself.

192
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:28,726
I guess where memory left,
bravado crept in.

193
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,726
By the way...

194
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:38,726
...what did you mean by
st... stre...

195
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:39,806
stress?

196
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:49,566
If you're confused if this is love or not

197
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:55,686
Don't think about it and just hug me

198
00:20:55,966 --> 00:21:02,006
If your heart pounds, then it is love

199
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:09,006
Then will you confess your love?

200
00:21:10,006 --> 00:21:12,766
TAEJO YEAR 25 (942 AD)
NEW YEAR'S DAY

201
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:17,166
An attack on Jeongyun
in front of me, inside the palace.

202
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:21,366
It's most certainly treason,
also with strong backing.

203
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:23,366
TAEJO WANG GEON

204
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:26,286
Jimong,
did we capture the assassins?

205
00:21:26,846 --> 00:21:28,246
ASTROLOGER
CHOE JIMONG

206
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:30,846
The princes pursued,
but we couldn't capture any alive.

207
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:35,126
We are doing autopsies,
so we'll know if there are any leads.

208
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:39,325
The assassins are Songak residents.
I'll question who allowed them in.

209
00:21:39,526 --> 00:21:41,246
JEONGYUN
CROWN PRINCE MU

210
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,126
Go ahead.

211
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,325
How is the wound?

212
00:21:56,086 --> 00:21:59,566
It wasn't too bad.
I had it treated at 8th Prince's house.

213
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,246
Why did you take Jeongyun's place?

214
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:06,086
You put your life in danger.

215
00:22:07,446 --> 00:22:08,646
4TH PRINCE
SO

216
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:11,566
Jeongyun saved my life
15 years ago, so...

217
00:22:12,846 --> 00:22:16,325
I hope to stay in Songak
and find out who was behind all this.

218
00:22:19,526 --> 00:22:20,566
Is that so?

219
00:22:21,046 --> 00:22:24,325
If you permit me,
I will find the perpetrators.

220
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,325
Fine.

221
00:22:30,886 --> 00:22:31,966
Jimong.

222
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:36,325
Tell my Shinju friends
that So has work to do here.

223
00:22:36,326 --> 00:22:38,325
He will be returning late.

224
00:22:38,486 --> 00:22:39,886
Will do, your highness.

225
00:23:04,326 --> 00:23:06,325
Brother,
you know 4th brother...

226
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:08,325
did he really never receive
martial arts training?

227
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:12,766
By the looks of how he took on
the Bangsangsi role like this...

228
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:15,006
He has lived among beasts.

229
00:23:15,606 --> 00:23:17,325
Don't flatter him.

230
00:23:18,006 --> 00:23:21,406
He looked way too good
to be self-trained.

231
00:23:21,686 --> 00:23:25,486
I'm sure he was properly
taught by a master.

232
00:23:25,686 --> 00:23:30,325
Are you saying that the Shinju Gang
taught a hostage martial arts?

233
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:32,406
I doubt it.

234
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:37,086
If you hear anything, let me know.

235
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:38,486
It'll be interesting.

236
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,886
You want us to find out
who taught 4th brother?

237
00:23:42,846 --> 00:23:46,406
Baeka, you know many people.
It won't be too hard of a task.

238
00:23:47,006 --> 00:23:51,286
I only have musicians and artists around.
Won't be as easy as you think.

239
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:59,166
Didn't you go after
the assassins last night?

240
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:02,486
I did.

241
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:09,206
But I got lost on the way.
Assassins? Not a soul in sight.

242
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:16,566
I heard you went into Dongji woods.
So I thought you could have caught one.

243
00:24:19,446 --> 00:24:20,966
Yeah, it sucks.

244
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:26,086
If I was on the right track,
I wouldn't have lost them like you did.

245
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,606
Greetings to the Emperor.

246
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:39,926
At ease.
Enjoying Wondanmati?

247
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,326
WONDANMATI
NEW YEAR'S FESTIVITIES

248
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:44,406
I thank you for the
great showing last night.

249
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:48,646
If anyone is hurt, don't hesitate
to see the imperial doctor.

250
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:52,286
Will do.
Do not worry.

251
00:24:56,806 --> 00:24:58,646
Eun, what's that bruise about?

252
00:24:59,246 --> 00:25:00,325
Yes?

253
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:02,726
Oh, it's from...

254
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:07,166
- I had a fight.
- A fight?

255
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,686
What fight leaves a bruise
on a prince's face?

256
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:14,246
Who dare tries the dignity
of the imperial family?

257
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:19,726
Who was it?
Tell me right now.

258
00:25:21,046 --> 00:25:22,325
It was...

259
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,246
It was...

260
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:30,646
So 10th Prince is bringing
the Emperor's punishment?

261
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:34,126
Yes, it's usually taken care of
by the police.

262
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:36,325
But 10th Prince insisted to
bring it himself.

263
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:39,646
He wants to see how I'll react.

264
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:44,325
Do you think they will
cut off my arms and legs?

265
00:25:44,446 --> 00:25:48,966
If that was the case,
8th Prince would have known.

266
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:50,486
Right?

267
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:55,126
It won't be too bad.
I'm sure.

268
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:58,006
Right?

269
00:26:01,846 --> 00:26:02,966
Prince!

270
00:26:03,846 --> 00:26:05,126
Prince!

271
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:10,166
- Prince!
- Wait up, Prince!

272
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,286
Oh, look who was waiting for me.

273
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:25,325
Did you bring
the Emperor's punishment?

274
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:28,926
The Emperor was furious
after he saw the bruise.

275
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,166
10TH PRINCE
EUN

276
00:26:30,446 --> 00:26:32,046
He said to give you a lashing.

277
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:37,286
Why me?
You're the one that prompted it.

278
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:41,366
I guess you left out the part
where you were in the wrong?

279
00:26:42,325 --> 00:26:44,206
I'm not as narrow-minded
as you think.

280
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:47,806
You wouldn't believe
how I asked for your forgiveness.

281
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:51,926
If the girl who hit a prince
needs to be punished

282
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:55,166
what punishment is in it for me
for letting her do it?

283
00:26:55,486 --> 00:26:59,086
A speech for the history books.

284
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:01,446
What do you think?
You should thank me.

285
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,766
Well...

286
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:05,766
I don't know where you found
that kind of generosity.

287
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:08,926
But yes, thank you so much.

288
00:27:10,646 --> 00:27:11,886
Now what?

289
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:15,126
I have something to say.

290
00:27:17,526 --> 00:27:18,566
Well...

291
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:20,486
So...

292
00:27:22,526 --> 00:27:24,325
You can leave us now.

293
00:27:26,606 --> 00:27:29,325
You too.
Go away!

294
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,366
Want another fight?

295
00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:37,325
Fight? As I said,
I'm not as narrow-minded as you think.

296
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:38,406
Then what?

297
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:40,606
It's...

298
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:43,325
You know...

299
00:27:45,686 --> 00:27:46,806
It's because...

300
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,806
Oh, please no.

301
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:00,846
Does he like me?

302
00:28:02,046 --> 00:28:04,646
Is he attracted because
no one's ever treated him like this?

303
00:28:07,046 --> 00:28:12,325
I have to say no one's ever
treated me, a prince, like this.

304
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:13,766
Really?

305
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:15,726
What?

306
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:20,246
I didn't know men have been saying that
for a thousand years ongoing.

307
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:23,126
- What a line.
- A thousand years?

308
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:27,926
Anyway, I haven't fought like that
after my teens.

309
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:32,046
Usually people fear my family
and don't fight back.

310
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:34,246
I've never had a real fight.

311
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,325
- It was really fun.
- Of course.

312
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:40,846
Stop by often.
We can really fight some more.

313
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:44,286
Are you saying
you want to see me often?

314
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:49,246
I still have my limbs thanks to you,
so I guess I'm returning the favor.

315
00:28:52,526 --> 00:28:55,646
Then today is
our official first day!

316
00:28:57,846 --> 00:29:02,726
The one who wanted to protect you

317
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:08,326
I get choked up just watching you

318
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:12,806
Feel like I'm going to cry

319
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:18,325
I love only you,
I will remember forever

320
00:29:18,326 --> 00:29:22,606
I want to protect you

321
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:28,566
I am teary watching you leave...

322
00:29:29,806 --> 00:29:31,566
- There's a fight!
- Where?

323
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,366
- Hurry up!
- Over there!

324
00:29:34,046 --> 00:29:35,726
There's a fight!

325
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:44,646
I miss you today

326
00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:51,926
Whenever you think of me,
come looking for me

327
00:29:52,886 --> 00:29:54,526
Forever

328
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:59,886
My love, I miss you,
goodbye

329
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:04,526
For you, goodbye

330
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:08,325
I will smile for you

331
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:11,766
You live in my heart

332
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:18,606
So goodbye

333
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:23,646
Who's next?

334
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:38,846
Brother.
Brother, please.

335
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:55,326
Brother, please.
Forgive me this one time.

336
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:57,086
Can't do.

337
00:31:01,446 --> 00:31:04,166
Then sell the drawing.
I'll buy it.

338
00:31:06,286 --> 00:31:07,686
More expensive than your house.

339
00:31:09,126 --> 00:31:11,566
I won't go down without a fight.

340
00:31:11,646 --> 00:31:14,246
You sneaked out in
peasant clothes as well!

341
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:18,686
I'm here with the Emperor's orders
to sketch our people's lives.

342
00:31:19,006 --> 00:31:21,046
Open your eyes, kid.
You're done!

343
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:24,526
- Brother!
- Don't follow.

344
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:27,246
- I'm going somewhere important!
- You're just going to Uk's.

345
00:31:33,486 --> 00:31:34,686
Hey.

346
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:41,526
- Thank you, brother!
- Stop right there!

347
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:24,686
Reminds me of the days
we grew up together.

348
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:27,686
It was like a dream.

349
00:32:28,926 --> 00:32:31,206
I don't understand my brother.

350
00:32:32,446 --> 00:32:34,325
13TH PRINCE
BAEKA

351
00:32:34,325 --> 00:32:37,766
I wish he would
pay more attention to you, sis.

352
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:42,566
Stop saying 'sis.'
Your brother might hear you.

353
00:32:42,886 --> 00:32:46,166
You were my sis
long before you were his wife.

354
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:49,966
I knew you before him.
Even he can't object to that.

355
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:53,526
That's why he lets it go,
pretending he didn't hear.

356
00:32:54,126 --> 00:32:56,886
- Be more careful.
- I don't want to.

357
00:32:57,526 --> 00:32:59,446
Once my sis, always my sis.

358
00:33:07,126 --> 00:33:08,325
Yes.

359
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:10,766
Yes, okay.

360
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:13,325
Isn't that Haesu?

361
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,486
Yes.

362
00:33:16,846 --> 00:33:20,646
Yes, yes!
Yes.

363
00:33:23,046 --> 00:33:25,206
Make that blossom right!

364
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:27,766
You should know your sins!

365
00:33:31,446 --> 00:33:34,686
You should not spy on a married couple.

366
00:33:35,086 --> 00:33:37,726
I hope I don't catch you again.

367
00:33:38,286 --> 00:33:40,006
Understood?

368
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:42,526
Not understood.

369
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:47,406
After she hurt her head,
she really became a different person.

370
00:33:47,606 --> 00:33:51,926
Like the fight with 10th brother.
I really enjoy her presence.

371
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:56,325
Although she lost her memory,
she seems to be nicer.

372
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,566
Even I'm surprised.

373
00:33:57,806 --> 00:34:00,325
Yes.
Yes, okay.

374
00:34:00,726 --> 00:34:03,286
Her nursing skills deteriorated too.

375
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:07,006
She...

376
00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:10,606
...reminds me of you, Baeka.

377
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:15,086
That's a harsh comparison.

378
00:34:16,606 --> 00:34:18,325
No boundaries...

379
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:22,325
Saying whatever is on her mind.
A free soul.

380
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:27,206
Likes to have fun.
Hates to lose.

381
00:34:27,325 --> 00:34:29,325
I'd believe she's your sister.

382
00:34:30,406 --> 00:34:33,326
Your sis should be her.
Not me.

383
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:37,206
Don't say that.

384
00:34:37,766 --> 00:34:39,806
You know how I think of you...

385
00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:46,046
Don't you?

386
00:34:55,006 --> 00:34:56,166
Cousin!

387
00:35:56,566 --> 00:35:59,486
They have no tongue.
What the...

388
00:36:00,126 --> 00:36:03,286
What could you promise
for that kind of loyalty?

389
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:06,526
For a professional group
it could make sense.

390
00:36:06,726 --> 00:36:09,325
How? Were they Geomgye?
Or with Chilsal?

391
00:36:10,206 --> 00:36:12,046
Doesn't look like Heoksawol either.

392
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:18,446
My old brain has its limits.
Please put your fresh ones to use!

393
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:20,846
Daegyuhwanjiok,
Outcry Hell.

394
00:36:21,286 --> 00:36:24,886
Pour molten steel on tongues of
murderers and adulterers.

395
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:27,326
Save our souls.

396
00:36:31,646 --> 00:36:33,446
Maybe they didn't have tongues.

397
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,686
What?

398
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:38,406
They weren't cut off.
Maybe they didn't have tongues.

399
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:41,726
I heard that was a punishment
for some apostate monks.

400
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:43,325
Keep going.

401
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:47,325
A monk who commits a crime
is punished and banned.

402
00:36:47,486 --> 00:36:50,486
Maybe someone used
those monks as assassins.

403
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:54,325
The masked assassins were seen
at the Beopwang Temple party.

404
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:00,486
Then...

405
00:37:02,046 --> 00:37:03,446
...who could be behind all of this?

406
00:37:04,966 --> 00:37:06,766
Someone who wills the power...

407
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:11,246
Someone who could secretly govern
the monks for an extended period.

408
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:16,766
Jimong, look into the temples.
See who made large donations.

409
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:18,206
Yes, Jeongyun.

410
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:25,406
What are you doing?

411
00:37:25,686 --> 00:37:26,886
It was you.

412
00:37:27,406 --> 00:37:29,325
You tried to kill Jeongyun.

413
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:31,406
Are you trying to set me up?

414
00:37:31,646 --> 00:37:32,926
Do you have proof?

415
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:38,446
You brought the apostate monks in
and killed them all off.

416
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:40,926
- No?
- You're crazy.

417
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:42,326
Let go!

418
00:37:46,406 --> 00:37:47,606
Or was it mother?

419
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:53,486
What?

420
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,326
Was mother the mastermind?

421
00:38:01,325 --> 00:38:03,446
Don't disgrace our mother!

422
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:28,166
Don't hurt yourself.

423
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:55,325
And this.
This one is old too.

424
00:38:58,406 --> 00:39:01,006
Cousin, what is all that?

425
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:05,406
Prince wants to donate food
and clothing

426
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:07,486
to the village that
suffered a cold wave.

427
00:39:08,486 --> 00:39:09,606
Oh, is that so?

428
00:39:10,406 --> 00:39:11,726
Aren't you going?

429
00:39:13,206 --> 00:39:15,806
Me? Well...

430
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:18,325
Prince usually goes alone.

431
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:20,926
You should go with him.

432
00:39:21,246 --> 00:39:24,806
You can help, get some fresh air.
Everyone wins.

433
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,646
I'll help you with make-up.

434
00:39:34,526 --> 00:39:36,046
I don't know.

435
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:41,206
This must be for eyebrows.

436
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,486
And is this powder?
Oh, okay.

437
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:57,126
I had a dream.

438
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:02,006
I went around selling cosmetics.

439
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:07,566
I helped friends and customers
with make-up, just like this.

440
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:10,526
I really enjoyed it.

441
00:40:12,006 --> 00:40:13,326
You know, like...

442
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:17,926
I felt I was someone important.

443
00:40:19,406 --> 00:40:23,246
I helped people feel special.
That made me happy.

444
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:26,566
Being needed felt great.

445
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:33,926
I guess I tricked myself into thinking
I was some happiness giver.

446
00:40:35,846 --> 00:40:38,886
Smell it.
A nice rose aroma.

447
00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:42,486
This product is for customers
with patchy skin tone.

448
00:40:45,325 --> 00:40:46,646
Hey, here.

449
00:40:47,886 --> 00:40:49,246
Gidong!

450
00:40:58,686 --> 00:41:04,966
But the face I helped make pretty
cheated on me.

451
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:10,046
I was genuinely stabbed in the back.

452
00:41:11,646 --> 00:41:13,646
The two deceived me.

453
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:17,325
And stole everything I had.
Even my house.

454
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:23,886
Like a fool,
I didn't even really confront them.

455
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:27,726
What a nightmare.

456
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,325
You should erase it from your memory.

457
00:41:32,006 --> 00:41:33,325
Nightmare?

458
00:41:37,326 --> 00:41:38,686
Yeah.

459
00:41:39,726 --> 00:41:40,846
Maybe...

460
00:41:41,446 --> 00:41:44,325
Maybe that life was the dream.
A nightmare.

461
00:41:45,446 --> 00:41:46,486
Done!

462
00:41:48,325 --> 00:41:51,966
I'm not used to the stuff here,
so it's not my best work, but...

463
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:55,126
What do you think?
Pretty?

464
00:42:00,206 --> 00:42:01,325
Wow...

465
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:06,926
Look at my skin glow.

466
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:11,326
How skilled you are.

467
00:42:23,806 --> 00:42:25,166
Thank you, sir.

468
00:42:52,886 --> 00:42:54,606
Kids, come here.

469
00:42:58,566 --> 00:43:00,566
Share it with your friends.

470
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:03,326
Thank you.

471
00:43:04,406 --> 00:43:05,566
Hey!

472
00:43:09,766 --> 00:43:12,726
Come here, you little...!
Come here!

473
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:14,006
Gotcha!

474
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:16,326
Should you steal from your friends?

475
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:18,325
Are you going to do it again?

476
00:43:18,646 --> 00:43:20,046
No?

477
00:43:20,526 --> 00:43:22,325
Okay, let's go now.

478
00:43:30,325 --> 00:43:33,006
- Okay, have that ready.
- Yes, sir.

479
00:43:49,286 --> 00:43:51,526
I didn't know you were
interested in herbs.

480
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:55,206
After I got here, oh...

481
00:43:55,686 --> 00:43:59,325
After I hurt my head,
just happy to see something I remember.

482
00:44:00,325 --> 00:44:04,686
Silkworm, mung beans.
This is aconite, and aroma ginger.

483
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:08,646
When did you learn all that?

484
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:10,606
I don't even know that.

485
00:44:10,846 --> 00:44:12,446
I used to make soap.

486
00:44:14,006 --> 00:44:15,126
Soap?

487
00:44:17,646 --> 00:44:19,325
You know when you bathe...

488
00:44:20,046 --> 00:44:21,486
To clean up.

489
00:44:23,686 --> 00:44:26,325
These are all ingredients to make
Okyongsan soap.

490
00:44:26,486 --> 00:44:28,325
If you use this to clean up,

491
00:44:28,325 --> 00:44:30,846
you become as pretty as
the legendary beauty Seosi.

492
00:44:31,206 --> 00:44:33,566
Oh, I'll make one for your wife.

493
00:44:38,326 --> 00:44:40,325
Medicine for your wife is ready.

494
00:44:40,366 --> 00:44:43,086
And this is the ointment you requested.

495
00:44:43,325 --> 00:44:45,446
- Good work.
- Thank you.

496
00:44:50,966 --> 00:44:52,766
- Su.
- Yes?

497
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,726
Use this.

498
00:45:01,446 --> 00:45:03,566
Wouldn't want a scar left
on a lady's neck.

499
00:45:07,046 --> 00:45:08,325
Thank you.

500
00:45:51,726 --> 00:45:53,325
It might get infected.

501
00:45:54,206 --> 00:45:56,325
Or you can call a doctor.

502
00:47:09,325 --> 00:47:11,325
Madam, Prince is here.

503
00:48:20,325 --> 00:48:26,846
I hold my breathe and look at you

504
00:48:27,526 --> 00:48:31,325
Like the world has stopped

505
00:48:33,366 --> 00:48:40,325
Like the wind passing by,
even if you hadn't seen me

506
00:48:41,646 --> 00:48:46,046
My heart is towards you

507
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:53,606
It hurts to love you

508
00:48:54,246 --> 00:48:59,046
It's sad I can't empty my heart

509
00:48:59,325 --> 00:49:00,366
Mom.

510
00:49:02,325 --> 00:49:05,086
Did you cry a lot because of me?

511
00:49:06,686 --> 00:49:10,206
Don't worry.
I'm well here.

512
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,486
To tell the truth.

513
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:25,046
My heart is swaying a bit.

514
00:49:27,646 --> 00:49:29,886
I know I shouldn't, but...

515
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:37,166
I can't help it.

516
00:49:40,646 --> 00:49:47,286
I hope one day I can love you

517
00:50:31,326 --> 00:50:33,325
We found the assassins' hideout!

518
00:52:32,846 --> 00:52:34,406
Who's the leader?

519
00:52:35,325 --> 00:52:36,366
Come forth.

520
00:52:40,606 --> 00:52:44,246
Is there really no one
who can speak?

521
00:53:05,086 --> 00:53:08,046
Who made this god forsaken place?

522
00:53:11,046 --> 00:53:12,846
Who is it?

523
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:27,325
Are you the leader?

524
00:55:27,806 --> 00:55:32,726
These monks had their tongues scorched
due to their horrible sins.

525
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:37,086
It was my karma
to take care of these men.

526
00:55:38,325 --> 00:55:39,446
Then...

527
00:55:40,446 --> 00:55:42,325
...you're the one I need to get rid of.

528
00:55:43,325 --> 00:55:46,206
Who are you doing this for?

529
00:55:48,086 --> 00:55:52,325
Does your mother know about this,
Prince?

530
00:55:55,325 --> 00:55:57,766
I thought this place was for the mute.

531
00:55:59,325 --> 00:56:01,325
Someone is talking too much.

532
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:42,566
You've lived well
thanks to the Empress.

533
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,046
Now die for her.

534
00:57:26,606 --> 00:57:28,606
Jimong!
Are you sure this is the right place?

535
00:57:28,686 --> 00:57:30,206
Yes, I'm sure.

536
00:57:30,446 --> 00:57:32,646
I have no idea what happened.

537
00:57:33,046 --> 00:57:36,126
Go put out the fire!
See if anyone is alive!

538
00:57:36,325 --> 00:57:37,325
Yes, sir!

539
00:57:44,846 --> 00:57:46,526
Daegyuhwanjiok,
Outcry Hell...

540
00:58:19,326 --> 00:58:20,446
Who is it?

541
00:58:22,526 --> 00:58:24,325
It's me, mother.

542
00:58:28,286 --> 00:58:29,366
You can't come in here.

543
00:59:00,646 --> 00:59:02,246
SCARLET HEART

544
00:59:02,325 --> 00:59:05,325
I want you to only rely on me
from now on.

545
00:59:05,686 --> 00:59:07,726
Do you have feelings for her?

546
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:10,686
- She's mine.
- What did you say?

547
00:59:10,766 --> 00:59:12,766
I said she's mine.

548
00:59:13,126 --> 00:59:14,686
I came to correct your thoughts.

549
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:17,806
There is nothing for you here.

550
00:59:18,046 --> 00:59:19,325
Tread lightly.

551
00:59:20,006 --> 00:59:21,526
Don't ever say I'm yours again.

552
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:24,325
What about "my girl"?

553
00:59:24,366 --> 00:59:25,566
I promise.

554
00:59:25,886 --> 00:59:29,366
From now on,
no one will treat you like that.

555
00:59:29,806 --> 00:59:31,966
Your life is as good as mine.

556
00:59:32,046 --> 00:59:34,206
I will save you, even if I die.

557
00:59:34,325 --> 00:59:35,446
I thought I lost you.

558
00:59:37,325 --> 00:59:40,606
I was scared
I'd never see you again.

559
00:59:47,046 --> 00:59:49,486
SCARLET HEART
