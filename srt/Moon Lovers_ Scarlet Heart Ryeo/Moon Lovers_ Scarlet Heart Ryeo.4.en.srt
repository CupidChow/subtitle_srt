MOON LOVERS:
SCARLET HEART RYEO

2
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,059
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS.

3
00:00:13,659 --> 00:00:15,659
EPISODE 4

4
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:43,859
Who is it?

5
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,859
It is me, Mother.

6
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,539
How dare you!

7
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:17,818
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:22,819
Do you know what I did for you?

9
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:27,259
I have removed all of your remainings...

10
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,818
so no one can hurt you.

11
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,579
What are you talking about?

12
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:37,659
I don't understand.

13
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,139
I've burnt them all.

14
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:42,219
So there's no trace of you.

15
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:49,539
Did you kill them all?

16
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,979
They lived, thanks to you.

17
00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:55,059
I'm sure they're happy to be dead for you.

18
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:03,459
You thought I'd be proud of you?

19
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:06,818
You thought I'd worry whether
you're hurt or not?

20
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:09,739
You monster.

21
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,339
Go!

22
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:13,659
I can't stand that sick blood smell!

23
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:20,259
- It's just for you, my mother...
- Stop saying that, "mother"!

24
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:24,419
It's appalling and disgusting
to hear that word come out of your mouth.

25
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,819
I don't want to see your face.
Get out of here!

26
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:38,659
I've been wondering.

27
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:43,179
How come Mother doesn't feel pity for me?

28
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:48,739
If she was my mother, she'd worry
whether her child was in agony.

29
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:54,019
How come my mother has
never cared about me?

30
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,179
I've waited so long, but you never...

31
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:59,579
Because you're not my son.

32
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:03,619
You...
are son of the Kangs in Shinju.

33
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:28,099
It is my face, then.

34
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:34,819
You sent me for adoption
instead of my older brother.

35
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,779
And you continue to turn your back on me.

36
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,739
It's all because of this face!

37
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:09,579
Do you know how I live
with the Kangs?

38
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:18,779
One time, they abandoned me
in the biggest wolves' den.

39
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:23,139
I spent all night fighting the wolves
with their sharp teeth.

40
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,419
Then I burned down the whole mountain.

41
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:33,819
After burning all living animals
on the mountain...

42
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:40,339
I was able to survive.

43
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,939
I still can smell the stench of
burning flesh on my body.

44
00:04:57,818 --> 00:05:00,539
That crazy lady Kang is...

45
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:05,019
not letting me out of her sight,
thinking that I was her dead son.

46
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:10,939
And when she comes to her senses,
she'd beat me and lock me up.

47
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:15,859
She'd ask where her son is...

48
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,739
and how this monstrous
person is next to her.

49
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:26,179
Three days, four days...

50
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,939
It didn't matter how long I didn't even
drink water, no one cared.

51
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,139
So what?

52
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:45,739
A mother knows which son
will make her shine.

53
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:51,459
You're only my shame,
disgrace and flaw.

54
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:56,899
That's why I sent you away.

55
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:04,139
Well, I learned beautiful justice
thanks to you.

56
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:36,819
You'll have to remember today.

57
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,379
You've abandoned me, Mother.

58
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:44,699
But I won't leave.

59
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:49,339
From now on...

60
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:52,818
I'll make you look only at me.

61
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:00,739
Shut up!

62
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:05,619
If you do this again,
you won't be able to come, Songak!

63
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:13,979
How dare him.

64
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,818
- Stop!
- I'll destroy all!

65
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:51,539
Stop it! Please!

66
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:52,619
Move!

67
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:58,099
Blood...

68
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:04,299
Yes, it's blood.

69
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,499
From the ones I killed today.

70
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:09,818
Mother built this for her sons?

71
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:12,818
Instead of building these,

72
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:15,659
she should come and beg me!

73
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:24,219
- Let go! Move!
- Please stop!

74
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:27,099
Do you want to die too?
Let me go.

75
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:28,419
You are hurt!

76
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,179
Did you get hurt somewhere else?

77
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:42,818
I said I killed people.

78
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:48,899
They tell me, why?

79
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,579
Did you kill for fun?

80
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:03,459
Yes.

81
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:11,979
Go.

82
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:17,818
You said the palace is like that.

83
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:24,819
Where you have to grab
swords since you're young.

84
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,459
Where you have to kill first
if you don't want to get killed.

85
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:34,339
But what can we do?

86
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,379
Wanting to survive isn't your fault.

87
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:44,499
It can't be forgiven.

88
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:48,259
But I can still understand.

89
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:52,939
Because I can imagine

90
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,019
how much pain there is...

91
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,299
in you right now.

92
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:45,739
We chased after the killers at the
Narye ritual but no trace was found.

93
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:49,818
I think the one behind them killed
them all to keep them quiet.

94
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:54,499
We've found the hideouts, a temple,
but they're all killed and burning.

95
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:56,219
But...

96
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,939
the owner of the temple is...

97
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:04,379
That temple is...

98
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:07,979
owned by Empress Yu.

99
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:18,819
Are you saying I'm the one behind it?

100
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:21,739
To kill the Crown Prince?

101
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:24,419
To anyone's eyes,
it seems like it.

102
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:26,979
Empress Yu.

103
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:31,539
Did you hire the assassins
to kill the Crown Prince...

104
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,099
and let them in the palace?

105
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:36,699
I've never done that.

106
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:41,779
Your Majesty, it's all my fault.

107
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:43,379
It's all my fault.

108
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:47,579
I didn't know about that temple
and I took Mother's duty.

109
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:49,179
Please allow me to die.

110
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,499
It's all on me.
Son's fault is Mother's fault.

111
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,499
I did it, Your Majesty.

112
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:04,019
I'm the one who attacked
the temple and burned it.

113
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:07,019
It was me.

114
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:13,339
You tried to kill the Crown Prince?

115
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:19,819
Your Majesty, assassins
stayed at Empress Yu's temple

116
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:24,019
and killed them all and made it look
like we did it, and this all must be

117
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:25,779
a conspiracy to make the royal family
fight each other.

118
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:33,818
Just like he said, I was afraid
that Mother would be framed for it.

119
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,818
Please forgive my poor decision.

120
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:44,818
- You do it this time.
- It's your turn.

121
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,019
I don't want to.

122
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,459
You do it.

123
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:49,939
Chaeryeong.

124
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:51,818
Madam.

125
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,339
What's going on?

126
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:54,818
We have guests here.

127
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:58,818
No one wants to give meal
to the Fourth Prince.

128
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:01,179
How can you take this so lightly?

129
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:07,819
Just take one girl
who takes full charge of it.

130
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:09,299
I don't want to see this again.

131
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:23,859
Me?

132
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,619
Look at you.

133
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:31,379
You said I was the lady,
it's not my job to deliver meals.

134
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:32,459
Right?

135
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:51,619
Why can't he eat
in his room?

136
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:53,739
What's up with the picnic?

137
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:56,579
Oh, my.

138
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:58,979
This isn't right.
So tired.

139
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:04,139
What?

140
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:08,499
As if nothing happened last night...

141
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:11,539
What an innocent posture right there.

142
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:13,579
It even seems like he's lonely.

143
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,459
Here's your meal, Your Highness.

144
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,579
Leave it there.

145
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:39,779
You'll just eat alone?

146
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:42,179
Sure, you can.

147
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:11,099
I have to take the empty plates.

148
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,818
Just hurry up.

149
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:20,819
You didn't see yesterday.

150
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:24,019
No need to say anything.

151
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:27,019
Even if you ask me to,
I can't tell anyone.

152
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:28,818
I couldn't even believe myself.

153
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:31,219
You know

154
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:35,979
I'm busy living my life.
No time to speak other business.

155
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,818
You always tell me that.

156
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:44,859
By the way, is it more
delicious if you eat out here?

157
00:15:48,818 --> 00:15:51,139
Is it because of that palace
you can see from here?

158
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:54,939
It's your home anyway.

159
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,619
Why would you care
so much about it?

160
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:03,699
It it's my home...

161
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,299
I should have my family.

162
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:07,779
What?

163
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:10,019
I heard your parents and
brothers all live there.

164
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,299
By any chance,
let me ask...

165
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:19,818
What happened yesterday?

166
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:21,979
You!

167
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,699
How did you get in that night?

168
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,619
Chaeryeong said
the chicken is really good.

169
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:40,379
Is the doctor here yet?

170
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:43,259
Please hang in there.

171
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:47,139
Can you give us a moment?

172
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:48,819
What?

173
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:51,859
What is it?
What's wrong?

174
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:53,818
Now.

175
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:08,818
Get a second wife.

176
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:15,818
Hae...

177
00:18:19,818 --> 00:18:22,339
I'm too weak.

178
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:29,219
I haven't done anything for you

179
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:32,818
as a wife or managing the house well.

180
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:35,818
Prince.

181
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,339
Please meet another lady.

182
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:46,699
Or you can get a divorce
from me before then.

183
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:52,339
I have to repay you for my sin

184
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:56,659
so I can live happily
in heaven.

185
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:00,619
I don't want to.

186
00:19:05,818 --> 00:19:07,179
You have to.

187
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:12,619
And I know...

188
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:16,339
you don't really...

189
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:29,259
...love me.

190
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:05,139
Stop!

191
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:08,779
What are you thinking?

192
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:14,859
You'll forget anything that
bothers you if you play hard.

193
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,779
It's my gift to you.

194
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:27,379
I don't know what you like
so I brought everything I saw.

195
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:30,299
A top.

196
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:33,419
A tag.

197
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:39,339
And my favorite slingshot,
that is accurate.

198
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:40,979
I'll give it to you.

199
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:45,219
You've never seen this, right?

200
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,579
It's a silk ball from Jin Dynasty,
I heard all girls like it.

201
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:55,419
How old are you
to play with these?

202
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:00,818
Then what do you like?

203
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:02,859
Come on.

204
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:04,779
I already have a headache.

205
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,818
Take this all with you
and play by yourself.

206
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:13,859
They say you have to share
the burden to make it lighter.

207
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,699
I can help with anything.

208
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:20,779
I'm the Prince.

209
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:25,059
Have you gotten married?

210
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:32,818
Not yet.

211
00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:34,659
How many wives will you have?

212
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:38,818
I haven't thought about that.

213
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,259
Then will you get married again
if your wife is sick?

214
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:45,818
No!

215
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:49,139
I hate all the dramas from marrying
too many times, like Father.

216
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:53,779
I'll marry the one I love
and live happily forever.

217
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:58,818
I wish everyone was like you.

218
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,899
Surprisingly faithful, you are.

219
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:12,379
That's too fast...

220
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:14,818
...for me.

221
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:22,659
Put that in the room secretively.

222
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:26,019
Not in too obvious a place.
Somewhere you'll find it way later.

223
00:22:35,818 --> 00:22:36,818
No!

224
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:41,219
If I get busted,
I'm a dead person.

225
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:44,779
It's his anyway
so he won't say anything.

226
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:53,619
You must clean it well
while the Prince isn't here.

227
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:54,818
Yes, ma'am.

228
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:57,019
What are you doing here?

229
00:23:01,939 --> 00:23:04,179
- You...
- No!

230
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,259
I didn't try to steal anything.

231
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:26,859
Say it, what else did you steal?

232
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:28,818
I didn't steal...

233
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,059
I swear.

234
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:36,059
Then were you trying to
give some gift to the Prince?

235
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,539
Hit her.

236
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:45,059
Stop!

237
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:54,659
What has she done
to deserve this?

238
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:56,818
She stole the Prince's item.

239
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:01,179
That hairpin?

240
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:04,779
I asked her to put it there.
She didn't steal it.

241
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,219
It's not something
you can easily put your hands on.

242
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:08,419
It doesn't make sense.

243
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:09,818
It's because it was his.

244
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:13,259
Then she stole it.
Start again.

245
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:21,339
Then hit me instead.

246
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:25,818
I can't explain,
but it's not her fault.

247
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:29,659
So if you have to hit someone
then hit me who ordered her.

248
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:30,818
Lady.

249
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,179
Tie her.

250
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:41,339
Lady.

251
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:46,779
You should stop her.

252
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,379
She'll get beaten.

253
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:51,818
Why? We have rules
and punishment is a good rule.

254
00:24:51,818 --> 00:24:54,539
I think that servant
is already beaten.

255
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:58,818
She's ruthless with that.

256
00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:07,859
Yeonhwa.

257
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:14,899
Let it go.

258
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:16,818
Enough.

259
00:25:16,818 --> 00:25:18,819
It's my duty to
control girls in the house.

260
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:25,818
She's mine.

261
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:40,259
What did you just say?

262
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:43,659
I said...

263
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:45,939
she's mine.

264
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:01,099
That hairpin is mine.

265
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:04,818
So I can decide
what to do with that girl.

266
00:26:04,818 --> 00:26:06,139
Brother!

267
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:07,818
No!

268
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:11,499
She said she picked it up
in the room of Fourth Brother...

269
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,059
I mean I saw her picking it up.

270
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:17,699
You, too?

271
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:18,818
Untie her.

272
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,539
Now!

273
00:26:58,419 --> 00:26:59,818
Your judgment was

274
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,539
poor this time.

275
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:11,539
I think you did good.

276
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:14,339
Those low ones
should be punished.

277
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,859
What is this?

278
00:27:17,379 --> 00:27:18,779
I must go.

279
00:27:18,818 --> 00:27:20,259
I'm off, too.

280
00:27:22,939 --> 00:27:23,939
Let's go.

281
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:27,299
- She needs some ointment.
- Haesu!

282
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,818
- Come, you childish older brother.
- Let me go.

283
00:27:29,818 --> 00:27:31,979
Please let go.

284
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:50,818
She makes you feel that pity?

285
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:58,818
The brother I know wouldn't
stop me like this.

286
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:02,099
Do you...

287
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:05,059
really like her?

288
00:28:08,818 --> 00:28:09,818
If I ever...

289
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:14,019
made you embarrassed
in front of people, I'm sorry.

290
00:28:46,818 --> 00:28:48,699
I heard it's mine.

291
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:54,419
I'm just letting you know.

292
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:58,979
There's nothing
belongs to you here.

293
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:07,059
Yeonhwa, Haesu, and everyone else.

294
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:08,459
They're all mine.

295
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:15,379
Do not ever
treat my brothers and my women...

296
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:18,818
without respect.

297
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:44,818
Haesu.

298
00:29:50,818 --> 00:29:53,818
If you're awake,
take this ointment.

299
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:56,539
Make sure to put this on.

300
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:07,579
And...

301
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:13,659
please forget
what happened earlier.

302
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:24,818
I'm sorry.

303
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,459
I was too embarrassed to see you...

304
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:31,859
so I pretended I fell asleep.

305
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:38,739
I know.

306
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:42,819
Does it...

307
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:45,459
still hurt a lot?

308
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,139
It's not my body
that hurts.

309
00:31:51,818 --> 00:31:54,339
It hurts to be treated
as that kind of person.

310
00:31:56,859 --> 00:31:58,219
Is this...

311
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:02,379
how it is?

312
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:07,539
You can't be treated as a human
if you're not from a powerful family?

313
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:16,539
How can a person tie up
another like that and hit...

314
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:21,179
Goryeo is...

315
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:24,939
just like this?

316
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:40,019
I'm sorry I couldn't stop it.

317
00:32:41,818 --> 00:32:42,818
But...

318
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:45,818
I promise.

319
00:32:47,818 --> 00:32:49,659
No one will...

320
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:52,859
ever treat you like that again.

321
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:56,818
Trust me.

322
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:04,299
Don't do this again, Haesu.

323
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:07,379
What you do right now
only hurts his wife.

324
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,099
Oh, it hurts so much.

325
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:49,219
You bumped in to me.

326
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:50,739
'She's mine'?

327
00:33:50,818 --> 00:33:51,819
Why would you say that
giving people wrong idea?

328
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,419
You don't know how to say
thank you?

329
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,619
I saved you from
beating you to death.

330
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:00,979
Before you argue,
you need to say thanks first.

331
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:02,859
You always bother me,

332
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:06,179
so I was just wondering what was
wrong with you that day.

333
00:34:07,818 --> 00:34:09,179
Thanks.

334
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:17,818
Why do you have that hairpin?
Where did you get it?

335
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,499
You dropped it in the bathroom.

336
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:25,979
It's all not to say I've seen your face...
which I didn't.

337
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:27,859
I kept my promise.

338
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:34,779
You're not scared of me?
You always talk back.

339
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:39,818
You're not an easy one

340
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:41,659
but I'm not scared of you.

341
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,379
But...

342
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:48,819
do not say "she's mine" again.

343
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:49,899
Why now?

344
00:34:49,979 --> 00:34:52,259
I'm not a thing,
I'm a human.

345
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:53,979
I don't belong to anyone.

346
00:34:58,579 --> 00:34:59,859
Then...

347
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:07,059
should I say "my person?"

348
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:11,818
Not that either.

349
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,939
I think a title that sounds a bit
too pressuring shouldn't be called.

350
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:17,379
Think of something else.

351
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:53,419
Who's this?
Fourteenth Prince is here!

352
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:01,899
Let me go!

353
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:07,899
Stop! Release me!

354
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:09,019
Oh, no.

355
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:10,659
Isn't he the Fourteenth Prince?

356
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:11,819
Yes!

357
00:36:11,899 --> 00:36:13,259
You!

358
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,259
You get some people.

359
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,818
What about you?

360
00:36:18,818 --> 00:36:19,819
Just us won't be enough.

361
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:22,139
I'll follow them,
you go get some help.

362
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:23,699
Hurry! Hurry!

363
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:39,019
Let me go! Stop!

364
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:46,818
How dare you!
You'll all be dead!

365
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:50,939
You're the one who made
my arm like this.

366
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:53,179
- You act too naive.
- I've never done that.

367
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:56,459
Right. You just lost
the fight with me.

368
00:36:57,419 --> 00:37:00,619
But who made me like this,
Prince Won?

369
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:03,019
I didn't know about it.

370
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:04,219
So...

371
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:14,859
Let me go.
How dare you!

372
00:37:14,939 --> 00:37:16,379
Is there anyone?

373
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:23,339
OK.

374
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:25,419
Here you are.

375
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:30,819
You! Bastards!

376
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:33,579
Go away! Away!

377
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:35,099
You jerks.

378
00:37:36,818 --> 00:37:38,819
I'll cook your intestines!

379
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:42,459
Don't dare to look straight.
You'll all die.

380
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:46,299
You all die!
Stop looking at me!

381
00:37:46,379 --> 00:37:49,939
You little fucking douchebags!

382
00:37:52,818 --> 00:37:54,779
Every time I see her,

383
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:57,379
my daughter-in-law's
health is deteriorating.

384
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:01,339
She asked him for a divorce.

385
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:03,419
How thankful.

386
00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:04,659
What?

387
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:06,339
Is that right?

388
00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:09,859
I won't abandon my lady.

389
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:13,139
Please don't consider.

390
00:38:13,219 --> 00:38:16,818
We should consider your
new marriage for your future.

391
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:24,459
I should get remarried like the Third
Brother so the Emperor can hate me?

392
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:26,818
There are many ways
to avoid suspiciousness.

393
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:27,899
Yeonhwa.

394
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:33,699
It's Hae's family
who brought us back to Songak.

395
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:38,379
I think we should keep our royalty.

396
00:38:39,499 --> 00:38:41,539
- She's a sick person.
- But Mother!

397
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:44,579
Prince! Your Highness!

398
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:45,659
You!

399
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:49,819
Something happened to Haesu.

400
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:52,859
You should go now.

401
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:02,099
- Are you OK?
- I'm sorry to drag you into this.

402
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,818
Let's run first.

403
00:39:04,818 --> 00:39:05,819
What?

404
00:39:05,899 --> 00:39:07,539
Run away!

405
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,419
I can't just go.
I'll punish...

406
00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:11,659
Are you insane?
Just go!

407
00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:13,579
Prince!

408
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:19,139
Oh, my!

409
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:23,219
Prince!

410
00:39:26,818 --> 00:39:30,019
Don't worry.
I'll save you no matter what.

411
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:31,779
Who save whom?

412
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:34,019
Stop!

413
00:39:40,899 --> 00:39:42,299
Brother.

414
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:55,019
Brother.

415
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:57,379
Are you OK?

416
00:39:57,818 --> 00:39:59,499
I'm OK.

417
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:01,499
How about you?

418
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,019
Hit him!

419
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:46,739
You can never put your guard down.

420
00:40:57,818 --> 00:40:59,019
That's right.

421
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:03,818
It's him.

422
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:06,059
You shouldn't put
your guard down easily.

423
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:07,459
That's him!

424
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:09,099
What should we do?

425
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,818
Should we run away?

426
00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:12,219
Let's go.

427
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:15,939
You're not running away, huh?

428
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:19,179
Are you being brave?

429
00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:20,459
Or...

430
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:26,019
you all want to get killed?

431
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:00,818
Hurt?

432
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:03,139
No.

433
00:42:04,419 --> 00:42:06,059
It was good that So came.

434
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,899
Thanks for your help, brother.

435
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:16,818
Also, you saved my arm,
so I'll remember.

436
00:42:16,818 --> 00:42:19,779
Now, your life
is as good as mine.

437
00:42:19,818 --> 00:42:22,339
I'll save you
even if I die.

438
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:27,818
What a cute youngest.

439
00:42:27,818 --> 00:42:31,179
You'll be a good man later.

440
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:35,419
Oh.

441
00:42:39,419 --> 00:42:42,339
I thought of my
young brother back home.

442
00:42:42,419 --> 00:42:44,499
It's OK.

443
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:46,419
Sister Haesu.

444
00:42:48,339 --> 00:42:49,339
Sister?

445
00:42:51,818 --> 00:42:54,818
Just look.
I'll become a great man.

446
00:42:56,059 --> 00:42:59,739
Sure, you will.
You go, Prince!

447
00:43:01,499 --> 00:43:03,818
You...go?

448
00:43:03,819 --> 00:43:05,379
Go!

449
00:43:06,139 --> 00:43:07,979
You go, Prince!

450
00:43:09,259 --> 00:43:10,579
Yes.

451
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:14,659
Funny.

452
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:17,979
Wait for me!

453
00:43:20,259 --> 00:43:22,818
Please slow down.

454
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:28,219
Are you mad?

455
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:30,699
Why?

456
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:39,339
Oh, my...

457
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:44,499
I can't walk anymore.

458
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:50,819
Ouch.

459
00:43:51,818 --> 00:43:55,818
I didn't know I sprained my ankle.

460
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:00,818
How much am I hurt?

461
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:03,818
I can't even walk a step.

462
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:12,619
I thought I lost you.

463
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,818
What?

464
00:44:17,818 --> 00:44:18,818
I was...

465
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:22,339
scared that...

466
00:44:25,818 --> 00:44:27,619
I may not see you anymore.

467
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:50,818
- Prince!
- Lady!

468
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:52,059
Prince!

469
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:54,818
Over there!
Lady Haesu!

470
00:44:59,818 --> 00:45:01,979
Are you OK?

471
00:45:02,818 --> 00:45:04,419
What about you, Prince?

472
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:07,499
Haesu.

473
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:11,818
You worried about me so much.
I'm sorry.

474
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:18,419
We were worried we couldn't
find you with all our soldiers.

475
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:21,579
Mother has been so worried.

476
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:23,339
Go to the palace tomorrow...

477
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:27,818
Brother Uk!

478
00:45:51,419 --> 00:45:53,139
You even disguised yourself
going outside?

479
00:45:54,739 --> 00:45:56,459
I came here,
so Mother doesn't know.

480
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:00,339
Thanks a lot for your consideration.

481
00:46:01,818 --> 00:46:05,619
You must go out like this often
to meet people like them.

482
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:08,699
I was just out of luck.

483
00:46:08,779 --> 00:46:10,939
Out of luck?

484
00:46:11,379 --> 00:46:15,699
He lost an arm and his family
is all ruined, just out of luck?

485
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:19,219
What will you do?

486
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:21,819
I said I didn't know!
I didn't do it.

487
00:46:24,099 --> 00:46:27,419
Then your responsibility goes away, too?

488
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:31,219
You're the Prince.
The crown has a responsibility.

489
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:33,818
That's funny.

490
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:36,818
Since when were you
in the high position to act like this?

491
00:46:37,499 --> 00:46:38,699
Oh, right.

492
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:42,379
It's because Mother only
hates you, right?

493
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:46,379
Or are you pushing down your
younger brother before he's too good?

494
00:46:46,459 --> 00:46:48,659
Brother Yo was right.

495
00:46:49,979 --> 00:46:55,499
I'm embarrassed to say
that we share a same mother.

496
00:46:57,739 --> 00:46:59,379
You stupid one.

497
00:46:59,459 --> 00:47:00,779
- So.
- You.

498
00:47:01,899 --> 00:47:03,819
- Go away.
- So!

499
00:47:06,818 --> 00:47:08,739
Don't go near him.

500
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:10,539
You'll be in danger.

501
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,459
Mother, he saved me.

502
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,299
I'd have lost my arm
if it wasn't for him.

503
00:47:15,379 --> 00:47:17,099
Don't get fooled by it.

504
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:20,659
He'll make everyone
around him unfortunate.

505
00:47:21,419 --> 00:47:25,259
I've been there, too.
Don't get close to him.

506
00:47:25,339 --> 00:47:26,379
Never, OK?

507
00:47:26,459 --> 00:47:28,818
Mother, but he saved me.

508
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:30,739
You answer me.

509
00:47:31,818 --> 00:47:34,339
Promise that you'll
stay away from him!

510
00:47:36,699 --> 00:47:40,299
If you say so, I'll do so.

511
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:45,619
Until when will you be a mama's boy?

512
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:51,139
Jung, let me see.
Did you get hurt?

513
00:47:51,219 --> 00:47:52,219
Jung.

514
00:47:52,699 --> 00:47:53,979
Jung.

515
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:57,379
What's all these?

516
00:47:58,619 --> 00:47:59,619
Jung.

517
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:03,339
You'll break my heart if you get hurt.

518
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:07,859
What are you doing?
Get the doctor right now!

519
00:49:53,739 --> 00:49:54,859
Go away!

520
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,899
Don't get near him.
You'll be in danger.

521
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:14,299
Let the Fourth live in Songak?

522
00:50:18,818 --> 00:50:20,818
Is that for saving Jung?

523
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,979
I'd like to keep him
as my man.

524
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:29,059
Your Majesty.

525
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:31,819
I've seen Fourth Prince's star
in Songak's sky.

526
00:50:31,899 --> 00:50:33,819
I guess it was indicating this.

527
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:36,818
Fourth Prince's star
is in harmony with...

528
00:50:36,818 --> 00:50:39,419
Your mother tried to kill the
Crown Prince.

529
00:50:41,818 --> 00:50:44,979
Your older brother
wanted to be the Crown Prince.

530
00:50:47,019 --> 00:50:50,939
I've never been a part of their plan.

531
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:54,779
Then...

532
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:58,818
what about the reason
you're adopted?

533
00:51:00,818 --> 00:51:04,818
It was to console Lady Kang,
who lost her son.

534
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:10,219
I was never...

535
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:14,818
a son to them.
I was a mere hostage.

536
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:20,739
Shouldn't you know better, Your Majesty?

537
00:51:28,179 --> 00:51:30,818
What kind of person
will you be for the Crown Prince?

538
00:51:31,979 --> 00:51:35,818
Will you be Chungju Yu
or Shinju Kang?

539
00:51:45,259 --> 00:51:47,659
I'll be yours and the
Crown Prince's subject.

540
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:52,379
Not a son, nor a brother.
I'll be a loyal subject.

541
00:51:59,059 --> 00:52:00,779
Jimong.

542
00:52:01,259 --> 00:52:02,259
Yes, Your Majesty.

543
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:05,899
You said Fourth Prince's star
has appeared Songak?

544
00:52:07,299 --> 00:52:10,699
It's perfectly in harmony
with you and the Crown Prince's stars.

545
00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:14,699
If he stays in Songak,
it'll be great fortune for the nation.

546
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:23,419
Tell the Kangs in Shinju
and Songak.

547
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:28,859
From now on, I allow the Fourth Prince,
Wang So, to live in Songak.

548
00:52:32,818 --> 00:52:35,818
Thank you for your mercy.

549
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:37,939
Thank you, Your Majesty.

550
00:52:55,818 --> 00:52:58,539
You don't seem to have an appetite.

551
00:53:01,499 --> 00:53:04,818
Don't worry about me.
You should eat more as well.

552
00:53:10,299 --> 00:53:12,979
I'm worried that you eat less and less.

553
00:53:17,459 --> 00:53:19,939
I'm coming in.

554
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,818
Come in.

555
00:53:31,818 --> 00:53:34,019
I called you so we could have
a meal together.

556
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:38,139
I can just eat at my room.

557
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:41,139
You didn't eat any.

558
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:46,179
I thought it'd be better
if we eat together. Come sit.

559
00:53:57,819 --> 00:54:01,619
I know it was for Fourteenth Prince,
but going alone was too risky.

560
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:05,699
You could've been in big trouble
without the Prince.

561
00:54:06,459 --> 00:54:07,539
Right.

562
00:54:09,419 --> 00:54:11,699
Thank you for saving me.

563
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:14,699
I only did what I should.

564
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:21,818
It's because you're not settled.

565
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:25,299
You're not interested in
any of household's work.

566
00:54:27,619 --> 00:54:29,779
You can do sewing or...

567
00:54:30,818 --> 00:54:32,379
knitting cotton?

568
00:54:33,939 --> 00:54:36,059
I'll look for some hobbies.

569
00:54:40,779 --> 00:54:42,459
I'll get going first.

570
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:45,339
I have some books to read.

571
00:55:09,818 --> 00:55:11,419
Are you destroying them again?

572
00:55:14,499 --> 00:55:16,859
I'm not destroying,
I'm building them up.

573
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,019
That's unexpected.

574
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:25,419
What wish did you pray for?

575
00:55:27,499 --> 00:55:29,659
Now you worry about
other people's wish?

576
00:55:33,779 --> 00:55:36,419
I'm leaving this house.

577
00:55:39,219 --> 00:55:40,818
I'll live at the palace.

578
00:55:42,299 --> 00:55:44,419
So you won't see me so often.

579
00:55:45,818 --> 00:55:46,979
Oh.

580
00:55:48,819 --> 00:55:54,059
So I don't have to deliver
the meal? That's so great.

581
00:55:54,699 --> 00:55:56,818
Like you did a lot.

582
00:55:56,818 --> 00:56:01,019
Please keep a low profile at the palace.

583
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:06,859
Don't kill or get killed.

584
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:10,979
Don't stare at people
just because they don't listen to you.

585
00:56:11,059 --> 00:56:14,699
And no swords for anything.

586
00:56:15,818 --> 00:56:19,739
And don't just destroy
other people's hard work.

587
00:56:19,818 --> 00:56:20,818
Stop it.

588
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:22,179
Just eat well...

589
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:25,779
and sleep well.

590
00:56:26,939 --> 00:56:30,818
Don't have bad dreams.

591
00:56:41,259 --> 00:56:42,339
What?

592
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:45,659
Why are you looking at me like that again?

593
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:54,818
I remember you said you're not
scared of me.

594
00:56:57,819 --> 00:56:59,179
That's strange.

595
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:03,818
I'm scared of myself the most.

596
00:57:03,859 --> 00:57:06,459
Not you.

597
00:57:07,539 --> 00:57:12,979
I don't even know where
my own heart's going.

598
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:17,379
No matter how hard
I tried to change direction,

599
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:21,059
it's not working.

600
00:57:28,939 --> 00:57:31,859
The stars up there won't be
worried about this, right?

601
00:57:37,659 --> 00:57:40,859
There are lots of stars here in Goryeo.

602
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:44,499
Goryeo has many stars?

603
00:57:45,739 --> 00:57:48,539
Don't tell me you believe
only Goryeo has stars.

604
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:53,739
Jimong would be in shock
if he heard this.

605
00:58:00,739 --> 00:58:02,259
It's snowing.

606
00:58:10,499 --> 00:58:12,699
Nice.

607
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:14,219
I'd like to keep her beside us
and see her smile for a long time.

608
00:59:14,299 --> 00:59:16,219
I feel the same.

609
00:59:16,299 --> 00:59:19,818
I'm waiting for a woman who'll
care about me, not an expensive woman.

610
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:22,539
Please accept Haesu as your wife.

611
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:26,539
Please take good care of him for me.

612
00:59:26,619 --> 00:59:29,379
She's the one who had a fist fight
with Eun?

613
00:59:29,459 --> 00:59:31,339
I'm so sorry, Your Majesty!

614
00:59:31,419 --> 00:59:33,379
What did I do wrong?

615
00:59:33,459 --> 00:59:35,859
You and my brother have
feelings for each other!

616
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,899
You thought no one would know?

617
00:59:37,979 --> 00:59:40,859
I'm sorry that you had to hear that.
It's all my fault.

618
00:59:40,939 --> 00:59:42,859
Don't blame yourself.
