MOON LOVERS:
SCARLET HEART RYEO

2
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:12,989
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS.

3
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:18,629
2 YEARS LATER

4
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:22,869
EPISODE 14

5
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:30,748
Lady Haesu.

6
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:33,189
I told you not to call me by that.

7
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:39,509
I'm so used to it.
Court Lady Hae doesn't sound right.

8
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,748
Are these letters, as well?

9
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:48,069
Yes, they are.
You should learn how to read them too.

10
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:54,748
At this age? No way. I've memorized
all names for tea, so I'm good.

11
00:00:57,748 --> 00:00:58,869
Congratulations.

12
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:06,509
Today's your birthday!
It's for your knees.

13
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:09,349
So pretty.

14
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:14,989
Thank you.
I'll wear it whenever my knees hurt.

15
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:20,748
But the biggest present is
you being here at Damiwon.

16
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:25,389
That's because the Prince
brought me for you.

17
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:31,949
You do know that the Prince
still cares about you a lot, right?

18
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:44,909
The Emperor would like to
increase and reorganize the army.

19
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:50,748
So we'll include noblemen's private
military with loyal army.

20
00:01:50,748 --> 00:01:52,949
We can share the support.

21
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:03,709
As you all know,

22
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,189
the Emperor can't participate in
morning meeting because of his health.

23
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:11,748
He has ordered us to not postpone
urgent matters.

24
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:39,749
If you're Baeka,
let's say I'm Jongjaki.

25
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:45,749
You're never sincere.
Live your life upright with that skill.

26
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:33,229
It's not...

27
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:35,349
...a dream, right?

28
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:46,748
It's not like you'd disappear...

29
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:50,509
when I touch you, right?

30
00:03:57,149 --> 00:03:58,748
I've been...

31
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:01,869
thinking about you.

32
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:06,469
I hoped that the wound I made is...

33
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:10,749
not yet healed.

34
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:14,309
So...

35
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:20,109
that you won't forget about me.

36
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:35,748
I couldn't go find you because I was
worried that you'd be hurt to see me.

37
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,309
I tried not to come...

38
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:41,989
because I was afraid that
seeing you would hurt me.

39
00:04:43,109 --> 00:04:45,069
But I couldn't help it.

40
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:51,469
Thank you.

41
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:53,749
Thanks.

42
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,389
Why so surprised?

43
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,629
Are you helping with
the Emperor's bath?

44
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,389
Yes, sir.

45
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:28,789
Right, keep up the good work.

46
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:36,789
Here. It's my present to you
to take care of him well.

47
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,189
No, I can't.

48
00:05:40,429 --> 00:05:41,748
I can't accept it.

49
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:45,189
Come on, you deserve it.

50
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:07,748
These days I get too sluggish
after the bath.

51
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:14,909
After I wake up,
it's hard to know what day it is.

52
00:06:15,748 --> 00:06:17,709
I can't think well.

53
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:20,989
The doctor said you'd have lack of sleep.

54
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:24,109
I'll prepare tea and pillow
that'll help you.

55
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:29,709
I'll leave Chaeryeong here.
Please take your time.

56
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:57,748
Are you adding more herbs?
The scent will get too strong.

57
00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:02,109
Yes, Your Majesty.
The old bag is no good any more.

58
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:20,309
Congratulations for your birthday.
I just knew this is for you.

59
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:28,349
It's from a Persian merchant,
and he said it's from Bulgaria.

60
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:36,748
It's roses. Very valuable
oil made from roses.

61
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:39,749
It will be great for a perfume.
I like it.

62
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:48,069
He said he couldn't choose one,
so he just came back with empty-handed.

63
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:52,709
It's a mere court lady's birthday.
Having Prince present is the present.

64
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:57,829
Yes, right. I'm just grateful to be born
since I'm a mere court lady.

65
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:41,109
Was that you howling?

66
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:42,349
Yes.

67
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:47,789
It sounds so alike.
I was worried that you wouldn't notice.

68
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:54,229
It sounded like a creature that's not
a dog nor a wolf but had its neck choked.

69
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:58,029
Whatever, you came out here.

70
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:16,309
Let's go.

71
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,389
What?

72
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:31,509
I'll show you somewhere
for your birthday.

73
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:35,549
Let's go.

74
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,748
I said that's a fixed star.

75
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:51,909
And that's an anchor star.

76
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:56,349
So you mean the Polar star.

77
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,789
And Cassiopeia.

78
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:04,549
Did you forget how many times
I go in and out of the observatory tower?

79
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:08,509
You've learned all wrong
in the beginning.

80
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:16,149
That Cassiopeia is created
when Queen Cassiopeia from Ethiopia said

81
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:19,629
that her daughter is more beautiful than
Ocean's fairy,

82
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:22,869
the god of Ocean punished her.

83
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:24,149
Look.

84
00:10:24,229 --> 00:10:27,309
Doesn't it look like
an upside-down chair?

85
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:33,149
To tame her vanity, she's being punished
by hanging upside-down half a day.

86
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:50,789
Before...

87
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:57,149
when I was a lot younger
I went to greet my mother.

88
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:05,229
She was telling a story to
Jung lying on her lap.

89
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,469
I wished that he wasn't born.

90
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:15,669
I wished that her lap was for me.

91
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:22,989
Mother saw me with that face,
and she hid Jung all of sudden.

92
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:29,309
She must have known that
I'd strike on my own brother.

93
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:37,229
That's everyone's thinking
with younger siblings.

94
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:40,189
Same for me too.

95
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:44,748
I wished my younger sibling was gone.
Why would they have this to bother me?

96
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:55,189
Are you trying to make me
give up on you or focus more on you?

97
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:58,509
What?

98
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:03,669
Whenever I bring problems to you,
you make it so light.

99
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:06,109
That's why I must be with you.

100
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:14,149
If you're not coming to me...

101
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:17,748
don't let me have hope for you.

102
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:20,509
For me...

103
00:12:22,229 --> 00:12:23,309
it's torturing.

104
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:36,029
I thought you said you'd ask first.

105
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,269
- Can I?
- Nope.

106
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:49,229
You said you wouldn't do it.

107
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:51,469
Fine.

108
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:56,429
The Emperor will send you as
a second wife of the military general.

109
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:00,509
That won't never happen.
He trusts me for sure.

110
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,748
Stop showing off.

111
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:23,869
Your day off is coming soon, right?
Let's go to the Wish Tower together.

112
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:27,748
Wish Tower?

113
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:30,949
There's something I want to say.

114
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:34,109
But I need to say that there.

115
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,149
Will you come?

116
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:01,748
Uk.

117
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,429
It's strange these days.

118
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:12,629
I can't sleep at all.
When I sleep, I have nightmares.

119
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:21,429
The summer is coming soon,
but why is it so cold?

120
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:24,629
Your Majesty.

121
00:14:26,469 --> 00:14:27,469
I think...

122
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,549
the time has come.

123
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:34,549
Why don't you...

124
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:37,749
abdicate the throne for me?

125
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:41,149
What?

126
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:48,189
I know and Jimong spread the lie
that you're the son of Dragon.

127
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:55,829
And you also lied that you had scales
on your body when it was just rashes.

128
00:14:57,748 --> 00:14:59,069
Uk, you...

129
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:03,309
Once you abdicate, I will take care of...

130
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:05,909
you for the rest of your life.

131
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,909
Being the Emperor is such
a heavy burden, so for everyone...

132
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:15,469
please let it go now.

133
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:18,629
Brother.

134
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:39,349
Princess, please come.
It's not scary.

135
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:46,469
Go! You need to go
so our nation will survive.

136
00:15:52,229 --> 00:15:55,229
Father, I don't want to get married.

137
00:15:55,309 --> 00:16:00,509
You stupid girl,
it's for your sake. Go now!

138
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:04,789
Go! Hurry!

139
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:10,829
Your Majesty, she's too young
to go to the foreign country.

140
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:16,029
If she's married there,
they'll send the army when I'm in danger.

141
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:26,189
Didn't you hear something?
It was horses.

142
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:31,149
Hurry up! Go!
You can't survive here!

143
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:35,029
Father!
Your Majesty.

144
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:39,589
Mother! Mother!

145
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:44,629
Mother! Mother!

146
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:50,869
- Please!
- Go!

147
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:54,829
Hurry up!

148
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:58,748
Your Majesty!
Father, please!

149
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:00,509
Just go, now!

150
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:02,748
Stop it!

151
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:05,829
It's the Kitan.

152
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:12,109
She'll only be a hostage there.
Please see things straight!

153
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:14,229
What do you know?

154
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:19,069
I didn't sleep for one good night
being afraid of assassins.

155
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:22,389
Every night there are guys out there!

156
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:24,909
They ask for my authority.

157
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:32,509
Everyone will die in this way.
Then who will protect us?

158
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:35,869
Your Majesty.

159
00:17:39,469 --> 00:17:40,509
Will you do it?

160
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:44,989
You get married to the princess.

161
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,149
And protect us?

162
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:08,869
Welcome.

163
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:18,069
Oh no, I didn't know you'd come.

164
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:19,669
So I took my time, did you wait long?

165
00:19:22,748 --> 00:19:25,029
You said you have something
important to tell me.

166
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:26,469
Important thing?

167
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:31,748
Right, I said that.
What was that?

168
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:33,669
What?

169
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:36,789
I can't remember.

170
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:41,589
What was it?

171
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:43,589
Why would you ask me that?

172
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:51,669
You said you have to
say that here since it's important.

173
00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:00,069
What? Did you expect
something surprising?

174
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:05,149
Then I feel too sorry.

175
00:20:05,229 --> 00:20:06,469
No, I didn't.

176
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:08,749
Sure.

177
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,669
Let's do something else
since I feel bad for you.

178
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:54,589
Can't you go faster?
You should feel the breeze on a boat.

179
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:57,429
Will you do it then?

180
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:05,949
I wanted to ask before.
Is this your boat?

181
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:10,869
I brought this
when I came to the palace.

182
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:15,349
I don't need to sneak out
if I use this boat.

183
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,549
This is my favorite thing
in the whole palace.

184
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:25,748
I've never seen you on it much
for it to be your favorite.

185
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:32,789
I loved it too much.

186
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:39,589
If I do what I love too often, I was
afraid that I didn't want to leave here.

187
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:42,349
So I didn't ride it on purpose.

188
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:48,189
What?

189
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:54,789
I've just imagined what it'd like
to face away from what you like.

190
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:02,069
And I'm glad that you don't
have to feel that way any more.

191
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:08,069
I'm sorry.

192
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:10,748
What?

193
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:12,469
The important thing.

194
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:16,469
For forgetting
what I wanted to tell you.

195
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:18,949
It will come back some day.

196
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:23,429
Take your time.

197
00:22:43,949 --> 00:22:45,749
You've made a big decision.

198
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:52,909
If I get married to the princess,
both noble families will think

199
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:59,829
I'll be the next Emperor.
They'll tame the other nobles, too.

200
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:02,189
Then the attack on
the Emperor will reduce.

201
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:07,829
You've calculated that far.
Now you're becoming a political expert.

202
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,989
But there's still a question.

203
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:17,389
Would I be his guard dog again
with shackles?

204
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:21,429
Is this my destiny?

205
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:28,989
I'm sick of living with having to
face away from what I love.

206
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:30,589
But it's always not working out.

207
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:35,069
Tell me.

208
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:39,509
How can I run away from those shackles?

209
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:46,149
Most of people would bite the master
and take the master's house.

210
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:49,389
Are you suggesting a coup?

211
00:23:50,949 --> 00:23:52,189
No way.

212
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:58,389
Thanks for protecting the Emperor.

213
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:05,069
He won't keep you that long.

214
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:26,229
Why do you just stare at me?
You're here to put some make-up on.

215
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:30,229
It's important to make your skin
brighter first.

216
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:48,189
This is roses.
Don't tell me you used my present here!

217
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:51,748
This is my profession.

218
00:24:51,748 --> 00:24:55,349
I've used a lot so his skin will glow.

219
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:59,349
Why would you use that valuable thing
to this face that fights in a sword fight?

220
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:00,549
Brother!

221
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:01,949
Stay tight.

222
00:25:03,748 --> 00:25:06,389
You can't move for two hours.

223
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:11,349
Lady, the Princess will love it.

224
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:17,549
Wow, you really look brighter,
just like Haesu said.

225
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:20,109
Really?
And no moles?

226
00:25:20,189 --> 00:25:24,909
Right, your face is glowing
and shiny, it looks great.

227
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:29,748
Your face is a lot brighter too.
It's so tight now.

228
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:36,509
Look at you!
Glowing and tight?

229
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:40,989
What kind of language is that?

230
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:42,789
You're misunderstanding it, brother.

231
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:45,469
You were suspicious about me
and Haesu before,

232
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:47,389
and now you're flirting with my brother?

233
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:50,509
Haesu isn't like you.

234
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:52,669
Stop it please.

235
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:57,748
I didn't say it before
but you're so mean.

236
00:26:02,748 --> 00:26:04,748
Look at that temper.

237
00:26:04,748 --> 00:26:10,149
You were just jealous of us.
Why did you have to bring Haesu up?

238
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:16,349
You really don't know
your own heart.

239
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:21,589
You love your wife,
but always mistreat her.

240
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:23,748
Stop it.

241
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:28,748
The worst thing you can do is
get married, you just live alone, Jung.

242
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:32,469
I'll tell Brother So to stop when he can.

243
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:35,109
So is getting married?

244
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:37,629
You didn't know?

245
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:43,309
He'll be the husband of the princess.
The wedding is soon.

246
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:04,429
You've heard.

247
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:09,789
You can hate me and resent me.

248
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:12,749
It's all my fault.

249
00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:18,389
What I can hate and resent?

250
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:22,029
You didn't promise me anything.

251
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:25,149
When I said I'd bring you
out of the palace

252
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:29,149
and I wanted to see you free,

253
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:32,749
all of them were promises.

254
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,748
I'm sorry that I can't keep them.

255
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:39,789
You don't even try to make excuses?

256
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:44,749
It's already done and
you're already hurt.

257
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:51,149
No matter what the reason is
your trust for me has broken.

258
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:55,189
I don't want to bring it up again.

259
00:27:58,748 --> 00:27:59,949
I understand.

260
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:04,029
I won't ask then.

261
00:28:08,189 --> 00:28:09,269
Congratulations...

262
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:13,229
on your wedding.

263
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:44,269
This letter is from Wang Gyu.

264
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:57,869
I've already beseeched you twice before

265
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:02,389
to kill the Fourth Prince So.

266
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,789
It's because his brother Yo has
already done wrong to you.

267
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:07,989
Stop reading it.

268
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:11,229
The meaning of the letter will be...

269
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:15,989
telling me to give you the throne anyway.

270
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,829
So I don't have to hear it anymore.

271
00:29:26,229 --> 00:29:30,429
I think you're misunderstanding
me a big time.

272
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:36,349
I was being loyal and said that
to lighten up your burden.

273
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:39,549
Are you upset for it?

274
00:29:40,189 --> 00:29:41,549
No.

275
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:47,749
As you suggested, I will
share my burden with my brother.

276
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:52,349
Your Majesty,
the Fourth Prince is here for you.

277
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:55,149
Let him in.

278
00:30:05,748 --> 00:30:07,509
I greet you, Your Majesty.

279
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:08,748
Sure.

280
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:15,748
So you get married to
my elder daughter.

281
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:16,749
What?

282
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:21,789
I told him he can have her
as a second wife

283
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:23,748
since she's too young
to make a family.

284
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:32,749
I have received the date from Jimong.

285
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:47,949
As you suggested, Uk...

286
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:51,748
I will abdicate for So.

287
00:30:54,349 --> 00:30:56,789
He's the brother of the Emperor
and the husband of the princess.

288
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,949
What can be more perfect?

289
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:04,389
Don't you think so?

290
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:08,069
Of course.

291
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:16,109
Congratulations on your wedding.

292
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:24,429
I bet there are girls crying,
who'll miss this nice husband figure.

293
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,869
Don't you think so, Your Majesty?

294
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:42,829
It's me Baeka.

295
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,189
I'm coming in.

296
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:50,029
Hello.

297
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:53,869
How do you feel?

298
00:31:53,949 --> 00:31:55,989
It's same old, same old.

299
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:02,869
Brother had me give you
this letter for him.

300
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:06,109
He said it'd be his excuse.

301
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:19,789
I didn't know he had
such great handwriting.

302
00:32:22,829 --> 00:32:28,949
There are lots of things I don't know
about him, I thought I did.

303
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:31,269
I was stupid.

304
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:52,429
He was sincere about
leaving here with you. I know that.

305
00:32:55,749 --> 00:33:01,349
When I sit around the water,
there's a cloud.

306
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:09,789
When I sit around the water,
there's a cloud.

307
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:15,789
When I sit around the water,
there's a cloud.

308
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:23,349
When I sit around the water,
there's a cloud.

309
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:43,748
Is Mother inside?

310
00:33:43,748 --> 00:33:47,429
She said not to interrupt
during her prayer time.

311
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:51,429
I'm fine, I'm worried about her.

312
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:55,869
I'm sorry, but...

313
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:25,869
Is he really a general
to be that timid?

314
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:30,149
What happened?

315
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:38,069
I was going to explain slowly.
Don't be surprised.

316
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:45,309
He's alive.
Heaven is on my side.

317
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:48,709
Then why did you pretend
to be dead until now?

318
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:53,789
I'm the criminal.
Why would I come forward?

319
00:34:56,748 --> 00:34:59,389
I barely survived.

320
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:01,829
Without the care of Uncle Wang...

321
00:35:03,029 --> 00:35:04,469
I'd be dead.

322
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:09,869
I'll ask the Emperor
to redeem your position.

323
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:13,389
I've done a lot for him
and he's a warm-hearted person.

324
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:17,829
Redeem my position?

325
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:27,909
I tried to take his seat. If he
finds out, he'll kill me on the spot.

326
00:35:29,149 --> 00:35:32,749
And you didn't hear about
So getting married to the princess?

327
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:38,549
The Emperor is about to
give the throne to So.

328
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:45,109
I oppose that So be the Emperor.

329
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:50,829
But I still can't agree with you
if you're against the Emperor.

330
00:35:52,189 --> 00:35:54,189
Conspiracy is good enough
for one time.

331
00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:56,748
How stupid is that?

332
00:35:57,748 --> 00:36:00,269
When you succeed your conspiracy,
it's no conspiracy anymore.

333
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:03,949
I will redeem my throne.

334
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:09,589
I can lose once, but not twice.

335
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:16,109
I'm also the object of the Emperor.
Even if it's you, I will stop you.

336
00:36:16,189 --> 00:36:18,829
The Emperor is a lunatic!

337
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:24,149
The rumor is that
he killed the assassins in his room

338
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:30,469
but actually he killed
court ladies by mistake.

339
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:32,869
Can you let that kind of person...

340
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:37,269
rule Goryeo?

341
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:39,949
Can you?

342
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:43,709
The Emperor has banned
anyone to be out at night.

343
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:47,309
Bring everyone in,
no matter what position and age they are.

344
00:37:07,029 --> 00:37:09,349
I think he's inside of Damiwon.

345
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:21,748
He has nowhere to go but this room.

346
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:24,748
Should we break the door?

347
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,989
What's going on?

348
00:37:40,229 --> 00:37:44,869
Damiwon is not for everyone.
Please get out of the garden.

349
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:49,748
The one who sneaked in
just came here. We have to look.

350
00:37:49,749 --> 00:37:54,829
I was reading, but I didn't see anything.
Please look some other place.

351
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:01,109
Where are you going?

352
00:38:02,269 --> 00:38:06,269
I'm the head lady here.
I serve the Emperor.

353
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:10,589
I cannot bring any guy
inside the room.

354
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:14,269
Move away.
I will check my own.

355
00:38:20,669 --> 00:38:21,989
No.

356
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:26,748
It's the room of an unmarried woman.

357
00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:30,748
If I'll be disgraced,
I'd rather die.

358
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:37,509
If you need to come in,
please get the Emperor's order.

359
00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:41,509
No one is an exception.

360
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:48,029
Are you sure
there's no one inside?

361
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:49,309
Yes.

362
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:51,748
I'm sure.

363
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:06,589
Look for other places.

364
00:39:06,669 --> 00:39:07,749
Yes, sir.

365
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:12,949
Let's go.

366
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:31,069
Su!

367
00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:34,469
They might still be here.

368
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:47,748
Let me see.

369
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:51,349
You got a little scar.

370
00:39:54,229 --> 00:39:56,149
Were you going to stab for real?

371
00:39:56,909 --> 00:39:59,829
If they'd come in,
what choices do I have?

372
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:03,749
Why would you do that?
You can just let me get arrested.

373
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:06,429
Why would you say that?

374
00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:10,989
You must avoid the Fourth Prince.

375
00:40:12,229 --> 00:40:13,909
You'd do the same
for others, too right?

376
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:14,989
What?

377
00:40:16,469 --> 00:40:21,748
You'd help other brothers
the same way, not just me, right?

378
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:24,189
Of course.

379
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:38,309
If our brothers split up
and start fighting...

380
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:42,869
which side will you be on?

381
00:40:44,748 --> 00:40:46,909
I don't take sides.

382
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:50,669
Maybe I can be the referee.

383
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:58,909
It's greedy to miss the days when
we gathered at Eighth Prince's house.

384
00:41:00,748 --> 00:41:05,029
We've changed and
you'll have to choose.

385
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:13,989
It's late now.
Please take a nap and go when it's quiet.

386
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:22,189
Even if you're in it...

387
00:41:23,909 --> 00:41:27,029
I can't decide this time.

388
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:32,949
Because I hope
no one gets hurt.

389
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:36,949
I'll make sure that would happen.

390
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:56,469
Jung was in your room, right?

391
00:42:58,469 --> 00:42:59,749
No.

392
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:04,349
I couldn't sleep a bit,
thinking of that.

393
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:07,149
Tell me the truth.
It was Jung.

394
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:12,349
Or make some excuses at least.

395
00:43:14,189 --> 00:43:16,749
You come up with yours first.

396
00:43:18,149 --> 00:43:23,229
Not just a letter.
Tell me so I can understand.

397
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:27,829
Why are you getting married
all of sudden?

398
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:31,509
Is it true that other people...

399
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:34,749
think, are you here
for the laundry as well.

400
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:42,389
If I let her be...

401
00:43:44,029 --> 00:43:47,229
she was to go
to the Kitans as a hostage.

402
00:43:50,189 --> 00:43:52,069
I didn't have any other option.

403
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,549
If you've told me that before...

404
00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:05,589
I wouldn't think you'd be that mean.

405
00:44:07,509 --> 00:44:09,549
I have to ask you to endure again.

406
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:18,389
I know you hate multiple wives.
That's why I tried to avoid it...

407
00:44:20,029 --> 00:44:21,149
but I was out of options.

408
00:44:22,469 --> 00:44:24,389
What can I say to that?

409
00:44:33,189 --> 00:44:34,309
Yesterday...

410
00:44:35,748 --> 00:44:37,909
it was Jung.

411
00:44:39,669 --> 00:44:43,149
He forgot about the banned rule
and was coming back from the martial art.

412
00:44:44,189 --> 00:44:45,949
It was nothing.

413
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:51,748
Don't lie again.

414
00:44:53,029 --> 00:44:57,949
It's the same for you and he that
we'd like to see the inside of the

415
00:44:58,748 --> 00:45:00,869
What about things
I don't want to talk about?

416
00:45:02,189 --> 00:45:04,069
What should I do then?

417
00:45:07,149 --> 00:45:09,229
Then just say you don't want to say it.

418
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:13,589
I don't want you to lie there.

419
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:18,429
I will.

420
00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:26,869
I won't like that either.

421
00:45:31,189 --> 00:45:32,229
Then...

422
00:45:33,789 --> 00:45:35,748
are you OK now?

423
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:45,789
Do you regret that you're married?

424
00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:56,429
No, it's to protect the Emperor.

425
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:03,189
The princess is out to live at a temple.
That was said.

426
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:08,748
Before...

427
00:46:12,349 --> 00:46:14,109
you said you have someone special.

428
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:18,748
Is that Jung?

429
00:46:21,149 --> 00:46:24,509
Not at all.

430
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:29,989
On the day we were on the boat,

431
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:32,389
the important thing you forgot...

432
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:36,829
you didn't forget, did you?

433
00:46:42,189 --> 00:46:43,748
What was that?

434
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:00,709
I...

435
00:47:04,469 --> 00:47:05,669
love you.

436
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:25,309
For next time,
don't you ever forget.

437
00:48:35,149 --> 00:48:36,389
Brother.

438
00:48:37,909 --> 00:48:39,109
What are you doing here?

439
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:43,029
We have a guest who'd like to see you.

440
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:48,149
A guest?

441
00:49:08,149 --> 00:49:11,748
Long time no see, Uk.

442
00:49:14,629 --> 00:49:19,509
I heard that you've been getting
mercury inside the Damiwon.

443
00:49:19,989 --> 00:49:23,829
It's scary to see what
a smart person can do.

444
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:31,349
I'm a man of loyalty.
I couldn't just let him go away.

445
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:35,389
You seem to have...

446
00:49:36,389 --> 00:49:38,989
a lot to tell me.

447
00:49:39,748 --> 00:49:45,309
Of course. It will take all night.
I have a lot.

448
00:50:15,149 --> 00:50:16,748
Attack!

449
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:38,989
Find the Emperor, now!

450
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,509
Yes, sir!

451
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:47,429
Rebellion?

452
00:50:49,069 --> 00:50:50,989
Did you just say rebellion?

453
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:56,989
I've brought you here
for your safety.

454
00:50:57,949 --> 00:51:01,069
When things are quiet,
you can go back to the palace.

455
00:51:03,309 --> 00:51:07,909
How can you help the Third?
He'll strike us first when he's in power.

456
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:11,229
It's better than having So in power.

457
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:14,189
Yo offered and we still had
some use for each other.

458
00:51:15,189 --> 00:51:16,469
He won't attack us.

459
00:51:16,549 --> 00:51:19,189
How can we trust that?

460
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:23,748
I've never raised my son
as a rebel. I'm disappointed.

461
00:51:26,509 --> 00:51:29,949
This is the only way to protect
you and our family.

462
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:35,069
If you'd just want safe life,
you shouldn't have so much responsibility.

463
00:51:36,748 --> 00:51:37,869
Is this for Haesu?

464
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:43,909
I'm asking you if Haesu
has anything with this.

465
00:51:49,069 --> 00:51:50,389
Yes.

466
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:53,469
You're right.

467
00:51:55,829 --> 00:51:57,509
It's for her.

468
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:04,549
Stop! Get out of the way!

469
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,309
You'll all die!

470
00:52:12,748 --> 00:52:14,869
Your Majesty!

471
00:52:17,709 --> 00:52:22,029
Your Majesty!
Are you all right?

472
00:52:25,749 --> 00:52:31,748
Who are you?
Let me go! Stop! Your Majesty!

473
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:53,309
Please spare my life.

474
00:53:18,748 --> 00:53:20,389
Your Majesty!

475
00:53:22,748 --> 00:53:23,829
Your Majesty!

476
00:53:25,748 --> 00:53:30,989
It's too dangerous for him.
Please stop, I beg you.

477
00:53:34,509 --> 00:53:37,229
Your Majesty!

478
00:53:43,069 --> 00:53:47,389
I think you're destined to be
floundering all your life like that.

479
00:53:50,509 --> 00:53:56,989
If the Emperor knew about it,
he wouldn't make you the Emperor.

480
00:53:57,069 --> 00:54:01,509
Please hang in there,
Your Majesty!

481
00:54:06,149 --> 00:54:10,309
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty!

482
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:29,069
I think it's done.

483
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:35,349
I can lose once...

484
00:54:37,229 --> 00:54:39,309
but not twice.

485
00:55:13,029 --> 00:55:15,109
You!

486
00:55:27,269 --> 00:55:28,748
Stop!

487
00:55:51,069 --> 00:55:52,748
Your Majesty.

488
00:55:54,869 --> 00:55:56,229
Your Majesty.

489
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:01,109
Your Majesty.

490
00:56:04,109 --> 00:56:05,509
Your Majesty.

491
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:11,109
Your Majesty.

492
00:56:13,989 --> 00:56:15,909
Please open your eyes.

493
00:56:19,749 --> 00:56:20,989
Why...

494
00:56:43,229 --> 00:56:45,069
I didn't kill him.

495
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:48,748
He was already dying
from poison.

496
00:56:51,869 --> 00:56:52,869
What?

497
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:57,349
Haesu has been putting
mercury in bathing water.

498
00:57:03,149 --> 00:57:06,869
The Emperor didn't want
anyone but you for this.

499
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:13,989
But the bathing water has
this mercury. What happened?

500
00:57:17,149 --> 00:57:20,748
I don't know anything about it.

501
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:22,789
I'll give you two options.

502
00:57:23,789 --> 00:57:28,829
You can die with this girl
to show your loyalty to the dead brother.

503
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:33,709
Or you can accept me
and leave with the girl.

504
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:36,949
Of course,

505
00:57:37,029 --> 00:57:40,389
I will leave her sin
for poisoning the Emperor.

506
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:45,429
So whenever I need,

507
00:57:45,509 --> 00:57:47,748
I can get her for her crime.

508
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:02,309
Let her go, now!

509
00:58:02,389 --> 00:58:07,469
A wolf only follows after
one female wolf until the death.

510
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:10,748
And you're also an animal
like an wolf.

511
00:58:11,669 --> 00:58:12,748
Won!

512
00:58:19,949 --> 00:58:23,549
Choose. Is it Haesu or...

513
00:58:23,629 --> 00:58:26,269
the dead Emperor?

514
00:59:00,949 --> 00:59:02,629
I greet you, Your Majesty.

515
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:06,109
To make the Wang's war
as genuine one, get Eun.

516
00:59:06,189 --> 00:59:08,589
You have your guard dog, Your Majesty.

517
00:59:08,669 --> 00:59:13,748
Haesu is dying to know
who put mercury in the water.

518
00:59:14,748 --> 00:59:17,869
Did you really kill the brother?

519
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:20,549
You're great.

520
00:59:20,629 --> 00:59:22,989
It'd be great if we were like this
from the beginning.

521
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:26,989
Haesu had hidden Eun's couple
inside Damiwon.

522
00:59:27,069 --> 00:59:29,709
Please run away.
I'll cover for you, hurry!

523
00:59:30,748 --> 00:59:34,748
Please let her go!
No!
