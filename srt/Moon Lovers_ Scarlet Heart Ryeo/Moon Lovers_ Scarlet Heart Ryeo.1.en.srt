1
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:05,544
SCARLET HEART

2
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:12,913
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS.

3
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:38,804
Mister...

4
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:45,085
...have you ever wanted to sleep for
a hundred or a thousand years?

5
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:52,804
Everything is twisted with
no sign of getting untangled.

6
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:56,925
I thought it would get better over time.

7
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,645
But then something else happens.

8
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,525
Sometimes...

9
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:11,125
...I want to sleep and never wake up.

10
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,565
I want to forget everything.

11
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,365
But I can't.

12
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:30,565
The guy who put me heavily in debt...

13
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:35,725
...the girl who deceived me
and ran away with him...

14
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:42,765
...I should have never trusted them.

15
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,765
Mister, you know...

16
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:51,565
I thought if I didn't change,

17
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:55,804
all the people I trusted
wouldn't change either.

18
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:00,525
But that wasn't the case.

19
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:10,845
How did my life end up like this?

20
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:17,804
You can't change your life
even if you wanted to.

21
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:22,245
Maybe you can
if you come back from the dead.

22
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:24,804
What?

23
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:16,925
Mister!

24
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,765
No way. Someone else
must have seen this too.

25
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:30,445
When I jump in, someone will have
already jumped in first.

26
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:34,685
Hajin, this is not a good idea.

27
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:37,485
It doesn't have to be me.

28
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:40,405
Why me, again?
Why?

29
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:51,725
Honey! Our son!
Eunyul!

30
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:53,005
Eunyul!

31
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:54,605
Eunyul!

32
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:58,005
Eunyul! Hold on!

33
00:04:58,645 --> 00:04:59,365
Eunyul!

34
00:05:12,804 --> 00:05:13,645
Here.

35
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:21,525
Hold my hand.

36
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,165
How could you...?

37
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:49,405
Are you crazy?

38
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:47,804
GORYEO
SONGAK (GAESEONG)

39
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:23,005
- It's the Wolf Dog!
- Wolf Dog!

40
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:01,325
Wolf Dog...

41
00:08:03,085 --> 00:08:04,725
4TH PRINCE
SO

42
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:06,805
IMPERIAL PALACE
DAMIWON

43
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:08,245
- Let's go.
- Okay, but be careful.

44
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:11,805
10TH PRINCE
EUN

45
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:14,845
14TH PRINCE
JEONG

46
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:24,925
- Jeong!
- Yes, brother.

47
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,845
3RD PRINCE
YO

48
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:35,765
13TH PRINCE
BAEKA

49
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:49,804
8TH PRINCE
UK

50
00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:56,845
9TH PRINCE
WON

51
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:58,804
Brother, touch this.

52
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:00,365
Check how ripped I am.

53
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:02,685
Jeong, I'm moving out.

54
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:04,804
Brother, don't leave me behind.

55
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:06,765
Brother.

56
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:18,965
Brother.

57
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:24,325
Is So still not here?

58
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:27,925
If he wants attend the Narye ritual,
he should be bathing right now.

59
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:31,125
Since when has he gone by our rules?

60
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,804
Don't bother.
It will only get you riled.

61
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:36,205
Don't you know brother Uk?

62
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:38,804
He's always worried about others.

63
00:09:40,804 --> 00:09:42,925
So and I were born in the same year.

64
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:44,445
It makes sense that I worry about him.

65
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:47,565
Isn't So attending Narye
for the first time?

66
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:51,005
I wonder if there's a reason
father invited him.

67
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:55,804
Make sure the steam doesn't put
any wrinkles into it.

68
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:02,405
Baeka.

69
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:07,365
Did you hear that So slaughtered
a Shinju official's whole family?

70
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:11,565
Heard it was gruesome,
like a wolf did it.

71
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:15,045
Do you believe everything you hear?

72
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:19,045
I've heard nothing from any of
the wandering bards or jesters.

73
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:22,765
I heard it from the monk
who comes in every month.

74
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:25,165
It's all hearsay.

75
00:10:25,485 --> 00:10:28,245
Attack a local official by himself?
What about the royal army?

76
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:31,045
Not even a master martial artist
could have done that by himself.

77
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:33,805
And So has never even had
a proper master to learn from.

78
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:38,045
Jeong, since you and So
come from the same mother,

79
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,405
you might turn into a wolf too.

80
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:44,804
Shut up!

81
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:53,525
Since I have the same mother as well,
am I also not human?

82
00:10:57,765 --> 00:10:59,165
Eun's joke was a bit much.

83
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:02,085
I'll talk to him.
Please calm down.

84
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:06,205
Fourth Prince So will go back to Shinju
once the Narye ritual is over.

85
00:11:07,804 --> 00:11:10,805
If anyone says anything to father,
prepare for the worst.

86
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:13,365
Understood?

87
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:17,804
Brothers...

88
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:20,165
...want to see who floats the longest?

89
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:22,685
Let's go outside.

90
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:25,525
Eun, stop it.

91
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:27,325
I said don't!

92
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:32,804
If you let me, I will quiet him.

93
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:33,804
It's okay.

94
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:37,525
Brothers, come on in.

95
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:40,965
Jeong, come on.

96
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:07,804
Where am I?

97
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:11,565
I think I'm alive, thank god.

98
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:12,965
Thank god!

99
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:28,565
Who... who are you?

100
00:12:28,804 --> 00:12:29,725
A girl!

101
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:31,925
Brothers!

102
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,005
Hey, brothers!

103
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:35,845
Brothers!

104
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:37,845
Brothers, look!

105
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:42,725
Miss!

106
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:44,085
Me?

107
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:45,804
- Who is it?
- Look!

108
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:49,805
- It's a girl.
- A girl!

109
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:52,365
- Miss!
- It's a girl!

110
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:54,125
Is no one around?

111
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:57,725
Hey, you! Stop!

112
00:12:58,085 --> 00:12:59,445
- Brother!
- Hey!

113
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:03,125
You dare peek on us princes?

114
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:11,525
Haesu...

115
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:18,205
Miss, we have to go!
Hurry up.

116
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:24,885
We can't be here! Come on!

117
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:36,285
You were under water for so long
I thought something bad happened.

118
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:39,765
Once the princes started bathing,
I couldn't get to you.

119
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:42,485
I'm going to go crazy.
Hurry up.

120
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:47,725
Are you okay now?

121
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:52,804
Miss?

122
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:54,365
Prince?

123
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:55,804
This is strange.

124
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:57,725
How did I end up here?

125
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,565
- Let's go.
- Wait.

126
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:08,085
Do you know me?

127
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,125
This doesn't look like a park.

128
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:12,965
Why am I here?

129
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:15,804
Miss!

130
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:21,765
What do you mean,
"Why am I here?"

131
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:24,645
This is the largest bathing spot
in all of Songak.

132
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:43,765
Of course I'm dead.

133
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:46,285
So this is...

134
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,804
...the afterlife?

135
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:51,365
Miss Su!

136
00:15:10,965 --> 00:15:11,965
Open up!

137
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:23,205
I will leave a servant for you.

138
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:27,645
So, don't hesitate to return
after the Narye is over.

139
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,805
Do not forget you're an adopted son
to our Gang family.

140
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:36,725
Put up a good image
in front of the Emperor.

141
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:39,365
Adopted son?

142
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:45,445
I thought I was a hostage.

143
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,645
You can't carry a knife on royal grounds.

144
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:55,804
Sir.

145
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:58,445
Should I prepare another horse
for your way back?

146
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:03,804
I'm not going back.

147
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,245
I am not going back.

148
00:17:35,885 --> 00:17:38,804
I will not go back to Shinju
as a hostage.

149
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:22,405
Su.

150
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:28,804
Finally you're awake.

151
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:37,804
Does it still hurt a lot?

152
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:41,804
Was I badly hurt?

153
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:46,285
You fell down so hard,
I thought you cracked your skull.

154
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:48,804
Madam was very worried.

155
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,804
- Haesu.
- Excuse me.

156
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:57,645
Why do you keep calling me Haesu?

157
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,525
My name is Go Hajin.

158
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:04,804
What?

159
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:10,045
Haesu, miss,
I don't know why you call me that.

160
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:17,205
Oh, that's right.
I died.

161
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:20,685
You're not dead.

162
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:23,365
- You just almost died.
- I'm not dead?

163
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,605
If this isn't a dream,
and if I'm not dead...

164
00:20:26,165 --> 00:20:27,804
...where the hell am I?

165
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:30,804
Su.

166
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:34,725
Su.

167
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:43,365
- Bring the doctor, hurry.
- Yes, ma'am.

168
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:46,005
Where am I?

169
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:49,405
No. Who am I?

170
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:53,045
You can't remember anything?

171
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:55,045
Your name is Haesu.

172
00:20:55,845 --> 00:20:56,685
Haesu.

173
00:20:57,804 --> 00:20:59,485
I'm your cousin Myeongi.

174
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:01,205
Haesu?

175
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:03,565
I'm Haesu?

176
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:07,205
Am I possessing someone else's body?

177
00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:17,645
Think hard.

178
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:19,405
Look at me closely.

179
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:21,965
This is Songak.

180
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:26,645
We're in the Emperor's 8th son,
Prince Wang Uk's house.

181
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,725
By Songak...

182
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:33,205
...do you mean Goryeo?

183
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:38,805
The dynasty that follows
the Three Kingdoms of Korea?

184
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:42,605
Do you remember now?
Yes, that Goryeo.

185
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:51,965
Then...

186
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:56,765
...who is the king right now?

187
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:02,525
Our Emperor is the one
who founded this country.

188
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:05,804
The Emperor who founded Goryeo...

189
00:22:06,565 --> 00:22:07,525
No way.

190
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:08,965
King Taejo Wang Geon?

191
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:21,685
The bird that was fed
Jeongyun's breakfast today...

192
00:22:21,765 --> 00:22:22,804
JEONGYUN
GORYEO'S CROWN PRINCE

193
00:22:22,804 --> 00:22:24,965
...it died after its first bite.

194
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:25,885
TAEJO
YEAR 24 (941 AD)

195
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:29,045
Thank god our crown prince
had no appetite.

196
00:22:29,885 --> 00:22:31,765
TAEJO WANG GEON

197
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:33,205
Why so quiet?

198
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:36,845
Capture the one behind this.

199
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:39,804
We should look at the root cause.

200
00:22:40,165 --> 00:22:41,405
Capturing the suspect...

201
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,325
MINISTER
WANG SIKRYEOM

202
00:22:42,485 --> 00:22:43,645
...won't change anything.

203
00:22:45,645 --> 00:22:46,804
Minister Wang Sikryeom,

204
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:49,045
what are you trying to say?

205
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:52,045
Is he worthy of our Jeongyun title?

206
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:54,285
JEONGYUN
CROWN PRINCE MU

207
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:58,245
He's left in front of foreign ambassadors
during ceremonies.

208
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:03,804
He only visits battlefields
or famous hot springs.

209
00:23:04,804 --> 00:23:09,565
Some even say Jeongyun
has a permanent illness.

210
00:23:12,165 --> 00:23:15,405
I, Wang Sikryeom,
plead to you, your highness,

211
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:19,804
to please dethrone Prince Mu
from Jeongyun

212
00:23:20,804 --> 00:23:23,885
and throne a new Jeongyun.

213
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,085
Does everyone else agree?

214
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:30,765
Speak up.

215
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:34,925
If not Mu,
which one of you wants Jeongyun?

216
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:48,325
Take back those words, your highness.

217
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:51,365
None of us want to replace Jeongyun.

218
00:23:54,285 --> 00:23:57,565
Yes, your highness.
Please take back those words.

219
00:24:01,165 --> 00:24:03,765
Yes, take back those words.

220
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:10,605
Take back those words, your highness.

221
00:24:13,804 --> 00:24:14,805
Astrologer.

222
00:24:17,685 --> 00:24:19,485
ASTROLOGER
CHOE JIMONG

223
00:24:19,565 --> 00:24:22,805
I, Choe Jimong,
send you a message from the heavens.

224
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:29,525
Jeongyun Wang Mu's star
is the first star of the Little Dipper,

225
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:32,125
which also forms the heavenly palace,

226
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:34,805
and is shining brighter by the day.

227
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:40,045
Along with our majesty's Leo,
Goryeo's force cannot be stronger.

228
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,525
This means he is more than worthy
of the Jeongyun title.

229
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:49,804
Goryeo has stood strong for 24 years.

230
00:24:50,965 --> 00:24:54,125
Crown Prince Wang Mu
has fought many battles with me

231
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:55,804
to form a strong foundation
for this country.

232
00:24:57,645 --> 00:24:58,845
Astrologer.

233
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,765
For this Narye,
Jeongyun will take on Bangsangsi.

234
00:25:02,804 --> 00:25:04,804
BANGSANGSI
GOD WHO EXORCISES DEMONS

235
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,045
Thoroughly prepare in advance!

236
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:07,565
Yes, your highness.

237
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,605
EMPRESS YU

238
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,485
Is that so?

239
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:31,685
Jeongyun's luck is quite surprising.

240
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:34,765
Must have nine lives.

241
00:25:35,804 --> 00:25:37,804
Now he will become more cautious.

242
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,365
It's court lady Kim, ma'am.

243
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:47,965
Tell him I don't want to see anyone.

244
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:51,565
It's So's first visit in two years.

245
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:53,165
Why not meet...

246
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:55,325
I'm not feeling good.

247
00:25:56,165 --> 00:25:58,365
No one can intrude on my rest!

248
00:26:10,605 --> 00:26:11,365
And my mother?

249
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:15,804
She has caught a cold
and is taking a nap.

250
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:19,045
Why don't you stop by later, sir?

251
00:26:52,804 --> 00:26:54,205
That's when I died.

252
00:26:54,965 --> 00:26:59,045
This Haesu possibly also
drowned at the same time.

253
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:05,405
Then who am I?
Go Hajin or Haesu?

254
00:27:09,365 --> 00:27:13,365
I don't know how I ended up in Goryeo
in this girl's body, but...

255
00:27:14,804 --> 00:27:16,285
...look on the bright side...

256
00:27:16,365 --> 00:27:17,804
I received another chance

257
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:19,725
to live again.

258
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:22,205
How lucky am I?

259
00:27:22,285 --> 00:27:26,565
Okay, so don't get caught and stand firm.

260
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:31,685
If I stand firm...

261
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:38,125
...soon enough they will find out
that I'm not Haesu.

262
00:27:39,485 --> 00:27:40,405
Miss!

263
00:27:40,885 --> 00:27:43,645
Su, come out so we can talk.

264
00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:45,325
Please come out.

265
00:27:46,325 --> 00:27:49,485
Miss, please open the door.

266
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:52,685
What are you trying to prove?

267
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:56,805
What kind of world lies out there?

268
00:27:58,445 --> 00:27:59,165
I'm scared.

269
00:28:00,485 --> 00:28:01,804
I'm scared to death.

270
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:05,525
I don't know anything about Goryeo.

271
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:10,804
The founding father of Goryeo
was Taejo Wang Geon.

272
00:28:11,804 --> 00:28:13,405
Who was next?

273
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:17,845
The next king was...

274
00:28:17,925 --> 00:28:19,605
Come on, miss!

275
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,005
...King Gwangjong?

276
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:26,765
My wife.

277
00:28:27,804 --> 00:28:28,605
Honey.

278
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:33,804
- What's wrong?
- It's Miss Su.

279
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:34,804
What about her?

280
00:28:35,405 --> 00:28:38,725
She was under water for over an hour.

281
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:43,765
The doctor said
she stopped breathing for a while.

282
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:46,885
Do you mean Su has died?

283
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:48,205
No, almost.

284
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:52,085
But she's forgotten everything.
Even her name.

285
00:28:55,804 --> 00:28:59,605
I'm worried she might harm herself.

286
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:37,925
Don't be scared, Su.

287
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:44,804
Since I'm the one who brought you here,
I will help you to the end.

288
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:53,125
You brought me here?

289
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:55,885
It won't get better if you avoid it.

290
00:29:59,445 --> 00:30:00,245
Cheer up.

291
00:30:12,804 --> 00:30:16,045
Trust me, and come out.

292
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:27,685
If I can't go back...

293
00:30:28,645 --> 00:30:30,804
...if I have to stay like this...

294
00:30:36,005 --> 00:30:36,805
...I want to live.

295
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:39,845
I don't want to die.
I want to live.

296
00:30:49,005 --> 00:30:50,045
I want to live.

297
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,565
Remarry?

298
00:31:23,205 --> 00:31:24,804
- Your highness.
- Step away.

299
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:27,885
YOUNG SO
JEONGYUN MU

300
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:30,645
Tae is dead.

301
00:31:31,965 --> 00:31:34,245
Our eldest son is dead.

302
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:38,285
And you mention another marriage?

303
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:40,845
Goryeo's southern borders are falling.

304
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:45,085
I need to prevent it with this marriage.

305
00:31:45,525 --> 00:31:48,205
You're the father of my child
before being a king.

306
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:50,804
Are you not sad?

307
00:31:51,045 --> 00:31:53,125
Is your heart not wrenching?

308
00:31:53,485 --> 00:31:55,845
Don't you want him back?

309
00:31:57,805 --> 00:31:59,405
Fate lies in the heavens.

310
00:32:03,165 --> 00:32:04,125
Your highness.

311
00:32:14,525 --> 00:32:18,965
If we don't mean anything to you,
there is no reason to live.

312
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:20,805
Mother.

313
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:30,804
Is it marriage or your son?

314
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,804
- Empress!
- Choose.

315
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,804
Is it Goryeo or your son's life?

316
00:32:37,485 --> 00:32:38,605
Let So go.

317
00:32:39,445 --> 00:32:41,565
This won't stop the marriage.

318
00:32:44,645 --> 00:32:48,325
You are so stubborn, aren't you?

319
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:54,804
Before my mind goes insane,
I might as well end it now.

320
00:33:16,805 --> 00:33:17,805
So!

321
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:25,804
Is anyone there?
Call the doctor!

322
00:33:47,805 --> 00:33:50,804
Why don't you have him
serve Jeongyun here in Songak?

323
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:54,804
We don't know if he will be
the shield that guards

324
00:33:54,804 --> 00:33:57,125
or the sword that stabs.

325
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:13,804
8TH PRINCE UK'S RESIDENCE

326
00:34:28,725 --> 00:34:32,445
You liked the arrow game,
so you would often make bets.

327
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:36,805
And that tree, we planted it together.

328
00:34:38,804 --> 00:34:40,804
You were also a good shuttlecock kicker.

329
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:45,045
Wait, so I liked the arrow game
and shuttlecock kicking...

330
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:50,925
and I'm here to be the caretaker
and chat buddy for my cousin.

331
00:34:52,205 --> 00:34:53,885
My name is Haesu.

332
00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:59,485
And you're my handmaid
Miss Chaeryeong, right?

333
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:07,804
I think I'm getting my memory back now.

334
00:35:08,885 --> 00:35:10,725
Why are you speaking like that?

335
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:14,245
Please snap out of it.

336
00:35:14,885 --> 00:35:16,205
Oh, that's right.

337
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:22,525
Chaeryeong, don't worry.

338
00:35:23,485 --> 00:35:25,485
So, is it really coming back?

339
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:30,165
Maybe, maybe not.
Don't worry.

340
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:35,565
I'm like a sponge, you know?
I'm a very quick learner.

341
00:35:36,804 --> 00:35:37,804
I'll try my best.

342
00:35:40,645 --> 00:35:43,804
Are you sure you don't remember anything?

343
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:49,965
It's just the two of us.
You can tell me the truth.

344
00:35:50,845 --> 00:35:52,045
You're faking it, right?

345
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:57,165
Maybe the prince and madam don't know,

346
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:01,205
but I've seen you one too many times
pretend otherwise.

347
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:04,165
So, what is it?

348
00:36:05,085 --> 00:36:07,925
Did you date someone
you weren't supposed to?

349
00:36:08,804 --> 00:36:10,525
Or are you in debt?

350
00:36:17,485 --> 00:36:21,525
So, Haesu would do those things?

351
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:29,804
Did she pretend to be decent,
and then wander off at night?

352
00:36:30,245 --> 00:36:31,804
Not like that.

353
00:36:33,765 --> 00:36:36,205
Why do you keep talking
like you're not her?

354
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:40,965
You really are hurt, aren't you?

355
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:42,045
Keep pretending.

356
00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:45,365
If I say I'm not Haesu,
they will just say I'm crazy.

357
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,125
- Chaeryeong.
- Yes, miss.

358
00:36:51,804 --> 00:36:55,125
I have another girl inside me.

359
00:36:58,804 --> 00:37:02,085
Never mind, I might die like this again.

360
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:02,965
Never mind.

361
00:37:10,804 --> 00:37:11,565
Chaeryeong.

362
00:37:13,205 --> 00:37:16,804
- I have no wrinkles here, right?
- What?

363
00:37:23,485 --> 00:37:25,045
Look how bouncy it is.

364
00:37:27,365 --> 00:37:30,685
It's been a while since
I've been super moisturized like this.

365
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:33,485
Wow.

366
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:37,885
These vegetarian Goryeo people
have the best skin ever.

367
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:43,685
Miss, I think you really were hurt badly!

368
00:37:45,485 --> 00:37:48,045
There are some good things
about being alive again.

369
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:53,245
IMPERIAL PALACE OBSERVATORY

370
00:38:09,325 --> 00:38:12,005
Wow, look at this.
What is it?

371
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:13,525
What is that?

372
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,725
- Jimong!
- Yes, 10th Prince.

373
00:38:21,285 --> 00:38:22,725
This is a flying wing.

374
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:24,804
Flying?

375
00:38:25,645 --> 00:38:26,765
What do you mean?

376
00:38:26,925 --> 00:38:29,925
It's a device to fly like a bird.

377
00:38:30,605 --> 00:38:36,205
When your kids have kids,
and they have kids, and so on and so on...

378
00:38:36,725 --> 00:38:40,804
...that's when people will be able to fly
to China

379
00:38:40,805 --> 00:38:43,445
and to Japan.
The day will come!

380
00:38:44,804 --> 00:38:46,965
Jimong, you're always
inventing amazing devices.

381
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,245
Watching the stars every night
put weird thoughts in your head.

382
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:52,845
Jeongyun's star speech...

383
00:38:53,804 --> 00:38:55,285
...is it true?

384
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:56,804
Say that again.

385
00:38:57,165 --> 00:39:01,885
We all know the star watcher
is siding with Jeongyun.

386
00:39:02,045 --> 00:39:05,085
I read the heavens.
I can't possibly lie.

387
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:08,165
Okay, Jimong,
what about my fortunes?

388
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,685
If you read my fortune correctly,
I will believe you.

389
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:24,804
On the 13th Prince's birthday,
the five planets aligned nicely.

390
00:39:25,325 --> 00:39:27,565
It's the sign of a great man being born.

391
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:31,805
I especially see many women on your side.

392
00:39:32,285 --> 00:39:33,925
You are truly the luckiest man alive!

393
00:39:36,645 --> 00:39:37,805
Even I can see that.

394
00:39:38,605 --> 00:39:42,325
We all know the women of Songak
adore our brother Baeka.

395
00:39:42,804 --> 00:39:45,804
If that's the case,
3rd brother has honor.

396
00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:48,205
- 9th brother has wealth.
- That's right.

397
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,725
8th brother has knowledge.

398
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:53,445
And our 10th brother has...

399
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:56,765
What does he have?

400
00:39:56,804 --> 00:39:59,085
I have great brothers.

401
00:40:00,605 --> 00:40:02,245
You little...

402
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:06,805
Princes, I'm hurt.

403
00:40:06,965 --> 00:40:12,245
You all used to love to hear my stories,
but now you treat me like this?

404
00:40:12,325 --> 00:40:13,925
We were kids.

405
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:16,804
Now that we're grown up,
we don't believe it anymore.

406
00:40:17,605 --> 00:40:23,605
Yes, now that you're all adults,
it's hard to seduce you with my words.

407
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:25,165
Are we grown-ups now?

408
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:27,685
I'm not fully grown yet.

409
00:40:27,765 --> 00:40:29,165
I know something
that's fully grown on you.

410
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:35,165
I'm talking about his thoughtful mind.

411
00:40:38,805 --> 00:40:39,804
Right?

412
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:49,804
I heard 4th brother is back.

413
00:40:49,925 --> 00:40:52,165
Did he come to say hello?

414
00:40:52,245 --> 00:40:56,005
I heard that brother So
cut off his horse's head when he arrived.

415
00:40:56,525 --> 00:41:01,205
Guards who witnessed it are all on leave
due to nightmares.

416
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:03,045
Why would he do such a thing?

417
00:41:03,565 --> 00:41:07,005
A bastard like that,
I'm glad he didn't stop by.

418
00:41:07,485 --> 00:41:09,125
He's probably taking it the hardest.

419
00:41:10,445 --> 00:41:12,845
Don't talk like that.
He's still our brother.

420
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:29,045
Long time no see.

421
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:32,965
Yeah.

422
00:41:44,205 --> 00:41:45,365
Brother, are you okay?

423
00:41:45,805 --> 00:41:48,805
Was I the only one not breathing?

424
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:49,885
Well...

425
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,925
Chaeryeong,
about the 8th Prince,

426
00:42:11,805 --> 00:42:14,804
how is he?
I'm sorry I can't remember.

427
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:18,205
The best man in all of Goryeo.

428
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:21,804
More knowledgeable than any scholar,

429
00:42:21,925 --> 00:42:24,765
most thoughtful of the 25 princes.

430
00:42:25,804 --> 00:42:32,205
Everyone says the Jeongyun title
should have gone to him instead of Mu.

431
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:35,804
Then is he King Gwangjong?

432
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,485
What a nice couple.

433
00:42:49,005 --> 00:42:53,525
Of course.
He's so devoted to his sick wife.

434
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,485
And our madam really depends on him too.

435
00:42:57,165 --> 00:42:58,804
Everyone is jealous.

436
00:43:00,365 --> 00:43:04,804
I have secret that no one knows

437
00:43:06,325 --> 00:43:12,405
Where did it all begin?

438
00:43:12,525 --> 00:43:17,525
Even if you don't remember,
I'm all for you

439
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:24,005
Are you thinking the same thing as me?

440
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:27,965
That's what I'm most curious about

441
00:43:29,885 --> 00:43:34,804
I'm confused if this is love or not

442
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:38,805
I did feel like I could trust him.

443
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:48,765
If your heart pounds, then it is love

444
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:53,445
Then will you confess your love?

445
00:43:55,804 --> 00:44:02,325
That you love me too

446
00:44:03,205 --> 00:44:04,045
How rude.

447
00:44:17,605 --> 00:44:19,804
We bow to you, Princess.

448
00:44:21,804 --> 00:44:26,445
Miss, please bow to Princess Yeonhwa.

449
00:44:28,085 --> 00:44:29,804
She's a princess?

450
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:35,125
Since there is an emperor and princes,
why not a princess?

451
00:44:35,245 --> 00:44:35,925
Let her be.

452
00:44:36,525 --> 00:44:39,125
I heard she got hurt and lost her memory.

453
00:44:39,765 --> 00:44:42,725
I guess she lost her manners as well.

454
00:44:43,325 --> 00:44:47,485
Well, her manners were never great.
Maybe a new start is better.

455
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:54,245
She's getting on my nerves.

456
00:44:54,605 --> 00:44:57,485
You should not spy on a married couple.

457
00:44:57,804 --> 00:45:00,645
Even if you are her little cousin.

458
00:45:00,725 --> 00:45:02,804
I hope I don't catch you again.

459
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:05,245
Understood?

460
00:45:09,965 --> 00:45:12,165
That tilted smile and those eyes...

461
00:45:12,804 --> 00:45:15,205
Look at her fist clenching.

462
00:45:16,205 --> 00:45:19,565
I've been through some things in my life.
I can recognize that...

463
00:45:19,804 --> 00:45:21,805
Just say you don't like me.

464
00:45:24,645 --> 00:45:25,405
What?

465
00:45:25,605 --> 00:45:30,685
I can tell you were waiting for me to slip
so you could then chew me out.

466
00:45:32,085 --> 00:45:33,804
That doesn't work with me.

467
00:45:33,885 --> 00:45:35,804
I've been to hell and back.

468
00:45:36,085 --> 00:45:38,485
What is this kid talking about?

469
00:45:38,725 --> 00:45:40,125
Forgive us, Princess.

470
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:44,804
Our miss is still recovering...

471
00:45:44,805 --> 00:45:48,165
- Are you saying I'm crazy?
- No, it's not like that.

472
00:45:48,325 --> 00:45:50,845
You little twat.
Do you know who I am?

473
00:45:51,045 --> 00:45:52,165
Twat?

474
00:45:54,005 --> 00:45:55,005
What's the fuss?

475
00:45:57,805 --> 00:45:58,804
Brother.

476
00:46:24,925 --> 00:46:28,485
Did you lose your manners
along with your memory?

477
00:46:29,645 --> 00:46:30,245
Hi.

478
00:46:32,005 --> 00:46:33,205
Hello...

479
00:46:34,645 --> 00:46:35,405
Sir...

480
00:46:37,805 --> 00:46:42,365
If you don't remember anything,
I guess you don't recognize me either.

481
00:46:42,804 --> 00:46:44,965
I heard you were the 8th Prince.

482
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:47,525
You heard?

483
00:46:51,085 --> 00:46:54,804
Did you lose your memory before or after
you spied on us?

484
00:46:56,405 --> 00:46:59,165
I don't remember.

485
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,725
So, what's your plan?

486
00:47:08,605 --> 00:47:10,804
I'll let you do whatever you want.

487
00:47:11,804 --> 00:47:12,685
Huh?

488
00:47:14,725 --> 00:47:18,285
Once your cousin wanted you here,
I decided I'd take care of you.

489
00:47:19,245 --> 00:47:21,485
You can heal here or go back home.

490
00:47:22,645 --> 00:47:26,285
If it's hard to live without memory,
I'll help you set up a...

491
00:47:26,405 --> 00:47:27,125
Why?

492
00:47:34,205 --> 00:47:35,005
Why?

493
00:47:35,925 --> 00:47:39,804
I'm the one who is hurt.
Why are you taking care of it, mister?

494
00:47:43,245 --> 00:47:44,804
Oh, I was your wife's cousin.

495
00:47:46,445 --> 00:47:51,804
Even then, it's not my character
to be a dependent hippo.

496
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:54,804
I'll take care of myself.

497
00:47:57,645 --> 00:47:59,365
Hip... hippo?

498
00:48:01,605 --> 00:48:04,325
I have no idea what that means.

499
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:06,285
What's a "dependent hippo"?

500
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:09,845
And "mister"?

501
00:48:11,804 --> 00:48:15,365
Anyway, I want to stay here.
You know, bear it out.

502
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:24,045
Since I don't remember anything,
I can't go anywhere else.

503
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:29,005
Since my cousin Chaeryeong and you
are all very nice,

504
00:48:29,085 --> 00:48:31,965
I think I can bear it out...

505
00:48:32,925 --> 00:48:35,205
I'm good at everything.

506
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:39,125
I'm smart.
I'm a fast learner.

507
00:48:39,725 --> 00:48:44,525
You'll see,
I'll become someone you can't do without.

508
00:48:46,165 --> 00:48:50,365
I'll learn fast,
so I'm not a burden to...

509
00:49:02,085 --> 00:49:06,045
You really feel like someone else.

510
00:49:11,685 --> 00:49:18,285
I never knew you well,
but you do seem very different.

511
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:28,405
- I don't care.
- What?

512
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:34,325
I don't care if you don't remember
or if you spied on us.

513
00:49:35,325 --> 00:49:37,365
But don't worry my wife.

514
00:49:40,165 --> 00:49:40,965
Okay?

515
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,804
Yes, Prince.

516
00:49:48,605 --> 00:49:49,445
Go now.

517
00:49:49,765 --> 00:49:51,804
I'll do my best, sir.

518
00:50:02,685 --> 00:50:03,685
Bear it out...

519
00:50:31,765 --> 00:50:34,805
New edition, want to borrow it?

520
00:50:39,325 --> 00:50:40,525
Why did you call me?

521
00:50:44,804 --> 00:50:48,285
The maid who made Jeongyun's breakfast
hung herself.

522
00:50:50,885 --> 00:50:55,405
Murder disguised as suicide in the palace.
It must be someone from the royal family.

523
00:50:56,405 --> 00:50:58,845
Probably one of the princes.

524
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:02,685
Find who did it.

525
00:51:05,405 --> 00:51:07,804
Find? Am I a dog?

526
00:51:09,804 --> 00:51:12,845
So, everyone's saying "wolf dog,"
and now you think I'm a dog?

527
00:51:14,005 --> 00:51:16,245
What about the horse?
Was it all for fun?

528
00:51:18,005 --> 00:51:20,245
Wouldn't you want to live here
rather than being a hostage?

529
00:51:23,804 --> 00:51:25,845
This is your opportunity.

530
00:51:26,485 --> 00:51:28,085
Take it while you have the chance.

531
00:51:28,325 --> 00:51:29,165
Look at me.

532
00:51:29,725 --> 00:51:32,485
I told the Emperor his dream meant
founding this country.

533
00:51:32,565 --> 00:51:34,245
Look where I'm at now.

534
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:36,805
Told you to stop those tricks.

535
00:51:37,965 --> 00:51:41,045
The kid who liked your petty stories
is no longer alive.

536
00:51:44,085 --> 00:51:46,165
Don't mess with me.

537
00:51:48,804 --> 00:51:50,645
It's what Jeongyun wants.

538
00:52:04,045 --> 00:52:07,685
We have intel that someone is trying
to assassinate Jeongyun at the Narye.

539
00:52:13,325 --> 00:52:14,804
You want me to take your place?

540
00:52:17,605 --> 00:52:18,965
What will you promise me?

541
00:52:19,765 --> 00:52:21,365
If you find out who is behind all of this,

542
00:52:21,925 --> 00:52:24,804
I'll grant you any wish.

543
00:52:33,325 --> 00:52:35,885
I want to live here in Songak.

544
00:52:55,725 --> 00:52:58,804
Our lanterns were always the prettiest
thanks to you.

545
00:52:58,845 --> 00:53:00,605
Guess not this year.

546
00:53:00,965 --> 00:53:03,045
Maybe I'm not fully healed.

547
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:05,845
I can't control my hands well.

548
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:08,885
Well, you're not bad on purpose.

549
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:12,245
Go rest, take off.

550
00:53:16,325 --> 00:53:18,804
I'm fine.
I can't rest alone.

551
00:53:19,245 --> 00:53:21,205
I'll do whatever.
What should I do?

552
00:53:22,085 --> 00:53:23,405
How generous.

553
00:53:24,804 --> 00:53:25,804
Let's see...

554
00:53:26,085 --> 00:53:29,645
Chaeryeong, show your miss
where we stir the glue.

555
00:53:30,045 --> 00:53:32,045
That won't be too hard, will it?

556
00:53:32,765 --> 00:53:34,965
Of course.
How hard could it be?

557
00:53:44,965 --> 00:53:47,445
Oh, this Princess Yeonhwa girl

558
00:53:48,285 --> 00:53:50,405
pretending to take care of me...

559
00:53:50,485 --> 00:53:51,525
This little...

560
00:53:54,525 --> 00:53:56,165
How much longer?

561
00:53:59,605 --> 00:54:02,165
I'm a certified skincare therapist,

562
00:54:02,245 --> 00:54:07,245
a masseuse, and a make-up artist.

563
00:54:08,725 --> 00:54:13,965
Look at my poor self, a pity...

564
00:54:20,804 --> 00:54:25,565
A complicated day,
I try to work around it with my smarts

565
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:30,325
I just realized
everyone is gone except for you

566
00:54:30,805 --> 00:54:35,005
I saw you last spring by chance,
I hope it's not by chance anymore

567
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:40,165
I want to hold your hand
and walk along this road together

568
00:54:43,205 --> 00:54:45,085
Oh my god, I knew this would happen!

569
00:54:53,405 --> 00:54:57,365
Princess Yeonhwa wanted me to
take care of this important glue task.

570
00:55:01,245 --> 00:55:05,685
You said you would learn fast
and bear it out...

571
00:55:05,925 --> 00:55:09,725
Seems like you're doing well.

572
00:55:12,165 --> 00:55:15,005
You are something.

573
00:55:23,485 --> 00:55:25,565
When is So coming?

574
00:55:25,804 --> 00:55:27,405
We need practice
in order to get it together.

575
00:55:27,685 --> 00:55:29,845
Fourth Prince will arrive soon.

576
00:55:30,804 --> 00:55:32,725
When this Narye is over...

577
00:55:32,804 --> 00:55:34,804
NARYE
ANNUAL RITUAL TO EXORCISE DEMONS

578
00:55:34,804 --> 00:55:37,485
...is father really going to perform
Seonwi to brother Jeongyun?

579
00:55:37,565 --> 00:55:39,804
SEONWI
HANDING OVER THE THRONE

580
00:55:40,485 --> 00:55:41,245
What?

581
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:44,725
Is that the rumor?

582
00:55:46,285 --> 00:55:47,804
I had no idea.

583
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:52,765
Even if it was true, the Emperor
never consults with me on those things.

584
00:55:53,365 --> 00:55:54,804
I'm just the astrologer.

585
00:55:55,725 --> 00:56:00,645
Now I need to get Jeongyun ready.
You all go ahead and prepare yourselves.

586
00:56:07,485 --> 00:56:10,605
Watch your mouth.
What if our father hears about it?

587
00:56:13,325 --> 00:56:14,525
Stupid.

588
00:56:15,285 --> 00:56:18,205
Don't scold him too much.
He's not the only one who's curious.

589
00:56:19,525 --> 00:56:22,645
Jimong didn't really deny it either.

590
00:58:28,045 --> 00:58:32,685
Your smile

591
00:58:32,765 --> 00:58:38,325
And your scent

592
00:58:38,525 --> 00:58:44,845
I've awaited,
I've looked forward to

593
00:58:44,965 --> 00:58:49,804
Wherever you are,
you're my only one

594
00:58:49,925 --> 00:58:54,565
What was I dreaming?

595
00:58:54,804 --> 00:59:00,765
Did I want it?
I awaited...

596
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:04,804
I love you every day...

597
00:59:04,804 --> 00:59:06,765
SCARLET HEART

598
00:59:06,804 --> 00:59:10,245
Fourth Prince has to duck
as soon as he spots it coming.

599
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:11,485
Did you see it?

600
00:59:11,804 --> 00:59:14,085
You're the one who spied on us bathing.

601
00:59:14,205 --> 00:59:15,085
I said no!

602
00:59:15,165 --> 00:59:17,765
You laid hands on the son of our Emperor.

603
00:59:18,965 --> 00:59:19,885
Another prince?

604
00:59:20,205 --> 00:59:21,965
You will be harshly punished.

605
00:59:23,005 --> 00:59:27,725
This is a rare chance.
Be sure to finish it off.

606
00:59:28,685 --> 00:59:29,804
Guard the Emperor!

607
00:59:30,405 --> 00:59:31,165
Get him!

608
00:59:31,565 --> 00:59:35,325
This is clear treason,
and someone powerful is behind it.

609
00:59:38,804 --> 00:59:40,365
Who are you working for?

610
00:59:40,565 --> 00:59:42,285
Don't kill me, please.

611
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:51,285
SCARLET HEART
