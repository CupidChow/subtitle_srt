00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,359
SCARLET HEART

2
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:12,639
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS.

3
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,799
Another space, another time
but you are my love

4
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,519
Even through the scent in the wind
I can tell it is you

5
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:51,719
But I don't know when
you started to live in my heart

6
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:56,999
But I don't know
why I flutter when I see you

7
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:03,519
You can pass by me
because you forgot all about me

8
00:01:03,638 --> 00:01:10,399
I will wait for you
until you remember me

9
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:17,239
Same space, same time,
we are together

10
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,919
You can come to me
where you belong

11
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,999
For you...

12
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,239
Wait!

13
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,638
Wait. Stop for a minute.

14
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:27,879
You shouldn't throw a person
like they are a bag or something.

15
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:36,239
Hey, wait!
Stop!

16
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,638
You shouldn't ride like that
on a narrow road.

17
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,279
Look at all those people
pushed back.

18
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,599
Cars are...

19
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,359
I mean, horses are supposed to
serve humans, not hit them.

20
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:12,159
Hey, you! Wait!
Hey!

21
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:15,799
What kind of...

22
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,638
Miss, let it be.

23
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,559
Call the police.
I mean...

24
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,519
Guards. Where are the guards?

25
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,999
We have to arrest
those kind of crooks.

26
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:29,559
You really don't know 4th Prince?

27
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:31,879
Be thankful you're alive.

28
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,239
4th Prince?

29
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,839
Another prince?

30
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,638
How many sons does Taejo have?
01:03:4:28 01:03:45:28
Miss!

31
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,719
Miss, oh, miss!

32
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,319
What are you doing here?

33
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:53,638
Chaeryeong.

34
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:57,638
Did you see the man about this tall
with big eyes?

35
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:58,799
He left our house.

36
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:00,759
Was he a guest?

37
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:03,599
You can't be here like this.

38
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:07,479
Princess Yeonhwa has gone crazy
looking for you!

39
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,239
Princess Yeonhwa?

40
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,759
I don't think 4th brother is coming.

41
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:21,638
Sister, thinking about brother So
gives me migraines.

42
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,519
Two days I ago,
I accidentally stepped on him, and...

43
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,638
He said, "Want to die?"
I almost pooped my pants.

44
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:29,919
Good for you.

45
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:34,599
Although we have the same mother,
I haven't really talked to him.

46
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:36,679
He doesn't even say "Hi."

47
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,399
4th brother is a real buzzkill.

48
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,479
Hello, brother.

49
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:33,159
You're late.
I'll help you practice for Narye.

50
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,638
NARYE
ANNUAL RITUAL TO EXORCISE DEMONS

51
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:35,679
Whatever.

52
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,479
I hadn't heard from you, and
was about to send someone to Shinju.

53
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:39,839
SHINJU
TODAY'S HWANGHAE PROVINCE

54
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,279
How could you be so indifferent?

55
00:05:41,638 --> 00:05:43,079
So I'm here.

56
00:05:43,638 --> 00:05:47,879
While in Songak, stay at my place.
I'm curious about your Shinju stories.

57
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,638
Yes, that would be better for you.

58
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,519
Uk, you're trying too hard.

59
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:59,638
He doesn't speak our language.
He speaks the language of beasts.
1:06:03:09 01:06:04:18
So that's why...

60
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,839
I could understand you better.

61
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:15,638
Princess, the snacks are ready.

62
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,719
What are you doing?
Come in.
1:07:01:00 01:07:04:01
- Have we met before?
- No.

63
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,199
- You look familiar...
- I'm not.

64
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,119
You're the one who spied on us.

65
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,759
- No.
- Yes!

66
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,319
I said no!

67
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,279
What have you done?

68
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,559
Brother, is she really that girl?

69
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,638
Guessing from her reaction, yes.

70
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,839
But she's changed.

71
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,799
She was shy before.
Wasn't she, brother Uk?

72
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:47,638
Well, I wasn't that close to her, so...

73
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:49,638
I don't know.

74
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:51,638
Eun, you've mistaken her.

75
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,079
How could she have been in Damiwon?
It's only for royals.

76
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,319
I'm good at remembering faces.

77
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,679
I'm sure it's her.

78
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:04,439
That tiny prince should learn
to take "no" as an answer.

79
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:08,999
I'm going insane.

80
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:13,599
Calm down.

81
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,638
I probably won't see him again.

82
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,638
Oh, that tiny prince.

83
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,999
Where did she go?

84
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,959
That way?

85
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:35,638
This way?

86
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:39,519
Stop.

87
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:42,519
Who was it?

88
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,479
So you did peep on her.

89
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:53,799
Are you accusing me?
I'm a prince.

90
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:57,479
Do you really think
I peeped on a servant?

91
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,799
Yes, I do.

92
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:06,599
Are you sure it was me?

93
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,919
Answer me.
Are you sure it was me?

94
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,279
I... I'm...

95
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:23,519
I'm not sure.

96
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,638
See?
Don't you ever accuse a prince again.

97
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:35,479
Although Chaeryeong's not sure
I am.

98
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,638
I understand
you're interested in girls.

99
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,679
But still, peeping is wrong.

100
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,239
Apologize.

101
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,638
Apologize?

102
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:49,638
You want a prince to
apologize to a servant?

103
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:52,638
It will never happen.
Get out of my way.

104
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:56,119
Aren't you ashamed?

105
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:57,799
You shameless prince.

106
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,519
What...

107
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:01,759
What did you just say?

108
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:04,839
Disrespectful.
Move away!

109
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,638
Come back and apologize.

110
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,519
Oh, you little rascal!

111
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,399
You little...!

112
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,599
- Hey!
- What?

113
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:29,679
- Let go of me!
- You let go!

114
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,919
Let go! Now!

115
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,638
I think someone is fighting.

116
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:42,239
Oh, it's brother Eun again.

117
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,638
Let go! I said let go!

118
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,839
Childish as always.

119
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:51,279
- Let go. Right now!
- You let go.

120
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,719
Yep.
Fights are the best entertainment.

121
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,599
Come on. Let's go!

122
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,638
You little...!
How do you like that?

123
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,679
- You!
- I'll kill you!

124
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:19,159
You're dead!

125
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,279
Hey, get off of me!

126
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:28,599
- You're in trouble.
- Sex offender!

127
00:12:28,638 --> 00:12:30,599
- Sex offender!
- You're the slut!

128
00:12:31,638 --> 00:12:33,199
Really?

129
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:47,239
People like you need
a nice beating.

130
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,159
Let go.

131
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:03,638
Brother, hold her.

132
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,119
- You little...
- Eun.

133
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,638
Brother!

134
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,919
Servants are watching.
Stop it.

135
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:19,679
Don't laugh.

136
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:24,638
What was I dreaming?

137
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:30,639
Did I want it?
I awaited...

138
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:36,239
I'll shout out
I love you every day...

139
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:37,599
Hey.

140
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,919
Hey, wait.

141
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,638
You did it again.
Do I look like a bag?

142
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,759
- Apologize.
- Who do you think you are?

143
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,279
Me?
I... I'm...

144
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:57,799
I'm Haesu.
My name is Haesu.

145
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,319
Did I ask your name?

146
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:02,959
What class are you in?

147
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:06,519
What does apologizing
have to do with class?

148
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:09,399
Will you apologize if I'm a royal
and not if I'm a peasant?

149
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,959
What a twisted world.

150
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,319
So...

151
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,279
- You want me to say I'm sorry?
- Yes.

152
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:19,839
Not only you,
the other tiny prince too.

153
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,119
I'm going to ask him too.

154
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:26,599
If you think you're noble,
act like one.

155
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,638
Okay, but...

156
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,119
Once I utter the words
"I'm sorry"...

157
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,638
I'll have to kill you.

158
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:46,039
But I guess that's okay.

159
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,039
Then...

160
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,319
- I am...
- Cousin!

161
00:14:58,119 --> 00:14:59,639
You came for me, didn't you?

162
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,999
Let's go.
We can talk later.

163
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,159
Hurry up, let's go.

164
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:16,638
Haesu.

165
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,638
Whatever the reason
you've laid hands on the Emperor's son,

166
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:47,639
it will be hard to avoid punishment.

167
00:15:48,638 --> 00:15:49,639
Maybe...

168
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,839
my prince will be punished too.

169
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,319
Can't you help me?

170
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,719
I'll try my best and talk to the emperor.

171
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,759
Do you think you're allowed to meet him?

172
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:13,119
I don't know how you've changed so much.

173
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,999
You were so gentle before.

174
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:26,638
The mothers of Songak
pray for their children here.

175
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:31,119
I'm childless, but I still come.

176
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,479
Did you know that?

177
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,199
This pile is for Empress Hwangbo.

178
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,719
For her son and Princess Yeonhwa.

179
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:50,919
And this...

180
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,638
This pile is for you.

181
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,399
For me?

182
00:17:01,638 --> 00:17:04,599
When you first came here...

183
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,279
you were severely sick with the plague.

184
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:15,719
A motherless child,
I thought of you not as a sister...

185
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:19,039
but as a daughter.

186
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,639
Your mother would have done
the same thing.

187
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,759
I tried my best to be one.

188
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:35,479
Considering today's events,
I wonder if my praying wasn't enough.

189
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:40,399
I don't know what your mother would say.

190
00:17:42,638 --> 00:17:43,799
I'm ashamed.

191
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,638
Mom...

192
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,079
My mother...

193
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:15,759
Su.

194
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,919
Please.

195
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,638
What should I do with you?

196
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:33,119
Think of your mother,
and try to fit in.

197
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:38,159
Mom...

198
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:41,839
It's okay.

199
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,799
Go Hajin...

200
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:06,759
You're a burden wherever you go.

201
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:09,839
Causing trouble.

202
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:13,359
Can't I go back?

203
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:17,119
I want to go back if I can.

204
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:20,638
Mom will be waiting for me.

205
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,399
Miss.

206
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:28,879
Miss, what are you doing here?

207
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:31,639
It's cold. Let's go inside.

208
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:36,519
Chaeryeong, have you found out
who I was looking for?

209
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:39,638
You know the other guest.

210
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,719
Well, we have many guests here.

211
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,519
I think you should clean up first.

212
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:51,999
The place where I was hurt before.

213
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,638
It was a bathhouse.

214
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,999
- A girl!
- It's a girl!

215
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,479
A girl!

216
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,159
Miss!

217
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,559
We have to go.

218
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,999
This is the largest bathing spot
in all of Songak.

219
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:15,839
No, not there.
That place is bad luck for us.

220
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,679
I'll prepare hot water.
Let's go.

221
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:23,719
I'm sure I saw him
before I died.

222
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:32,638
The bruise will turn blue.

223
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:34,638
Or maybe purple.

224
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:37,638
More colorful than my drawings.

225
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:41,919
She will pay for this.

226
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,039
Hit a prince?

227
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:45,719
Brother.

228
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,559
Her name is Su, and
she lives with 8th Prince.

229
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,839
What a lively lady.

230
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,679
Hard to find these days.

231
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,719
A good experience.

232
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:59,559
Yes, to recognize someone
you've seen only once

233
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:01,638
and then get beaten up?

234
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,279
Maybe she's your destiny.

235
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:08,119
Destiny? What destiny?

236
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:09,719
I'd say misfortune!

237
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,319
You don't know girls.

238
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:14,638
She hit you because
she's interested.

239
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:19,959
Then...

240
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:24,638
You think she hit me
because she likes me?

241
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,839
Maybe, maybe not.

242
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:36,319
IMPERIAL PALACE
DAMIWON

243
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,039
Prince!

244
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,959
I came to greet my mother.

245
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:44,638
EMPRESS YU

246
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:53,159
- How have you been?
- I heard you were here.

247
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,279
I was about to call for you.

248
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,679
4TH PRINCE
SO

249
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,638
I met my brothers, but not you.

250
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,638
14TH PRINCE
JEONG

251
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:05,638
Mother, I think brother So
has mastered martial arts.

252
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:08,199
- Martial arts?
- Yes.

253
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,039
He was very agile
at the Narye practice.

254
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:14,159
From what 10th brother said...

255
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,439
It's all hearsay.

256
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,638
3RD PRINCE
YO

257
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:21,638
The murder of a Shinju official
is all meaningless rumor.

258
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,199
What have you to say?

259
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,479
Did you master martial arts?

260
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,599
Not really.

261
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,599
No wonder.

262
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:41,638
The Gangs wouldn't teach martial arts
to a cub who could bite them back.

263
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,999
Mother, have you heard a wolf dog
appeared here in Songak?

264
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:52,638
So ugly that he's lesser
than a beast.

265
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:54,079
I heard that from Shinju.

266
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:01,599
Since it's been a while,
have fun while you're here.

267
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:04,638
I've prepared gifts for your mother.

268
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:09,719
Don't worry about greeting me.
You can go now.

269
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:13,639
It's been two years.
You want me go already?

270
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:18,638
Your stepmother will fall sick
if she doesn't see you.

271
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,999
I was planning to stay longer.

272
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,359
What if I stay with my brothers?

273
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:30,799
Nonsense!

274
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,599
You are Shinju Gang's family now.

275
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,919
If you stay here,
you will fuel fire to another war.

276
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:44,199
I thought I was adopted there.

277
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,799
I guess I'm just a hostage.

278
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:58,159
A hostage? That's nonsense.

279
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:03,959
Mother is just worried about
your stepmother.

280
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:05,999
Yo is right.

281
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:09,439
Why would I send you as a hostage?

282
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:16,079
If you say so, I believe you.

283
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,639
Oh, and by the way...

284
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:23,479
Mother, I brought a present.

285
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,638
Oh my god.

286
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,039
Jeong, I really like it.

287
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:41,639
I know you love hairpins, Mother.

288
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,638
So I had the silver master
cast a special piece for you.

289
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,599
For this Narye.

290
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,039
Thank you.

291
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,519
I'm leaving.

292
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:03,719
A prince that ugly...

293
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:06,719
How embarrassing.

294
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:29,719
When Narye is over,
make sure to send him away.

295
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:32,638
If he resists...

296
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,759
use our private army
to get him out of my sight.

297
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,638
Don't worry.
He won't resist.

298
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:43,879
Have you heard?

299
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,479
There many rumors of So
on Namdae Street.

300
00:26:47,638 --> 00:26:51,879
Some say Mother made So's face
look like that.

301
00:26:54,638 --> 00:26:55,879
Nonsense.

302
00:26:56,999 --> 00:27:01,239
Jeong, stop visiting Namdae Street.
The rumors are false.

303
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,359
Okay.

304
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,399
4th Prince.

305
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,119
ASTROLOGER
CHOE JIMONG

306
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:21,638
You should bathe
before Narye starts.

307
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:24,639
Prepare our prince for bathing.

308
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,079
Yes, sir.

309
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:36,999
Does anyone know when
brother So got that scar?

310
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:40,719
- Do you know?
- No, but I know about his.

311
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,879
Yeah, I know about mine.

312
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,199
I'm sure it was the homeless man.

313
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,239
It might be some sort of sign
that I saw the same man.

314
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,279
Maybe I'm still alive
and there's a chance to go back.

315
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,399
The only way to find out is...

316
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,799
I laid hands on a prince...
I must go back before I'm punished.

317
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,359
I knew it would be hard to live here.

318
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:53,839
Oh, my god!
I almost died!

319
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,159
Did you see it?

320
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,839
Did you see it!

321
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:45,199
Please let me go.

322
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,638
Forget...

323
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:56,479
about me.

324
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,638
Erase everything or else...

325
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,519
I'll make your face look like mine.

326
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:14,239
Like the wind,
like the dust

327
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:21,279
I can't touch it,
I can't see it

328
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:35,719
I thought it was love,
I called it fate

329
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:39,638
Oh, my pounding heart.

330
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:50,638
I live in your eyes

331
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,319
Only answer to me

332
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:58,079
- Did 4th Prince leave?
- Let's clean up.

333
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:03,638
Hold me, I'm shaking

334
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:08,399
My love

335
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:14,638
My love

336
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,479
Miss!

337
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,479
Where have you been?

338
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,319
Were you all waiting for me?

339
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,638
Where were you?

340
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:48,239
I was dirty, so I took a bath.

341
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:53,479
You should have said so.
The whole family was worried.

342
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,599
Family?

343
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:04,919
Bring her in.
Make her warm.

344
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:06,519
Yes, sir.

345
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:07,839
Let's go.

346
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,638
Come on in.

347
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,559
I'm...

348
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:30,638
I'm home.

349
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:40,638
- Let's go.
- Okay.

350
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:47,239
You never listen.

351
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:49,879
I told you not to go there.

352
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:52,399
But, Chaeryeong...

353
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,959
The 4th Prince...

354
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,519
How is he?

355
00:33:57,638 --> 00:34:00,159
- Did you meet him?
- No!

356
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:04,679
Us Goryeo men and women
bathe together,

357
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:06,399
so you could have meet him, but...

358
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:10,638
you have to avoid 4th Prince
at any cost.

359
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:11,999
Avoid? Why?

360
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:16,638
His mother is Empress Yu and
his stepmother is a Shinju Gang.

361
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,638
Both are very strong families.

362
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,638
And infamous for their brutality.

363
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,919
- Prince!
- Prince So!

364
00:34:27,638 --> 00:34:29,839
- Prince!
- Sir!

365
00:34:43,638 --> 00:34:46,359
How did he survive?

366
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,319
He made a hobby out of hunting
from a young age.

367
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:02,079
Rumor has it that he killed
every single wolf in Shinju.

368
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,799
And killed people too.

369
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:12,079
Especially people who saw his scar.

370
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,359
His scar?

371
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:19,039
I saw him with his mask off.
I almost died then.

372
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:23,999
If not a prince, he probably
wouldn't be able to enter Songak.

373
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:25,719
Good for him.

374
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,519
What's wrong with
having a scar on your face?

375
00:35:30,638 --> 00:35:33,638
Everything.
Here, everyone likes beauty.

376
00:35:35,638 --> 00:35:39,638
So even in the past, you have to
come from a good family to be respected.

377
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,638
I hate this world.

378
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:04,639
We're only rushing because
Seonwi is being performed to Jeongyun.

379
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,199
SEONWI
HANDING OVER THE THRONE

380
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,959
Since he's pretending to be strong,

381
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:11,719
I wonder how he'll look
facing death.

382
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,879
This is a rare chance for us.

383
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:18,919
Make sure you get it done
at this Narye.

384
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:22,319
Do not worry.

385
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:31,839
So Jeongyun is taking on Bangsangsi.

386
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:47,159
NARYE
ANNUAL RITUAL TO EXORCISE DEMONS

387
00:37:27,638 --> 00:37:28,679
Are we done?

388
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,919
Welcome.

389
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,119
Today, inside this palace,

390
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:29,638
I hope there is no one
prettier than myself.

391
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:33,919
If I see anyone...

392
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:39,919
Of course there won't be.

393
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,559
Three flowers inside the palace.

394
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:04,839
EMPRESS YU

395
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:06,799
Empress Hwangbo...

396
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,879
You look elegant.

397
00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:11,439
EMPRESS HWANGBO

398
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,638
Empress Yu,
you are the one who is gorgeous.

399
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:16,839
Princess Yeonhwa.

400
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:18,519
Don't just stay with your mother,

401
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,519
stop by and tell fun stories for me.

402
00:39:22,638 --> 00:39:24,879
Sons are not as talky.

403
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:29,999
I'm not a good talker,
but I will stop by with fun stories.

404
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,359
I'll expect you.

405
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:33,439
Shall we go in?

406
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:35,119
Let's go.

407
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:56,799
You can't turn pale
as soon as you see her.

408
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:03,399
I'm worried you'll have to
take her on all by yourself.

409
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:07,239
Brother should be by your side.

410
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,999
We are inside the palace.
Please watch what you say.

411
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,839
Madam Hae is right.

412
00:40:14,638 --> 00:40:16,519
You have to be stronger.

413
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,359
Or look the other way.

414
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:23,319
My grudge is deep.

415
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:28,799
Why didn't you bring Haesu?

416
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:33,799
Everyone here knows
what she's done.

417
00:40:35,638 --> 00:40:37,679
She's become a bit clumsy
after the accident.

418
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:40,119
I told her to stay and rest.

419
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:46,119
The Emperor is waiting.
Let's hurry now.

420
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:14,479
Father will be proud
to see you perform.

421
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:17,638
After the ritual is over
I will prepare a feast.

422
00:41:17,638 --> 00:41:19,239
Yes, Jeongyun!

423
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:26,679
Brother Uk,
will your wife and Haesu come?

424
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:28,839
Yeah, probably.

425
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:32,199
- Really?
- Why?

426
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:34,559
You think she'll beat you up
because your dance sucks?

427
00:41:35,638 --> 00:41:39,039
No, I just want payback.

428
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:42,759
Bad idea.
You'll get another black eye.

429
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:50,638
- Stop laughing.
- That eye.

430
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,719
I said stop laughing!

431
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:08,479
Brother, are you okay?

432
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,638
I got you!

433
00:42:10,638 --> 00:42:11,999
Tricked again.

434
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,679
You dare stand up to me?

435
00:42:59,638 --> 00:43:04,399
BANGSANGSI
GOD WHO EXORCISES DEMONS

436
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,839
JINJA
ROYAL DESCENDANTS PERFORMING NARYE

437
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,319
CHANGSU
EXORCIST WHO RECITES SPELLS

438
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:15,239
All the Jinjas are here.
Let the exorcism begin!

439
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:28,759
Jeongyun is very good at
the Bangsangsi role.

440
00:45:29,638 --> 00:45:32,638
Battlefields are like a home to him.

441
00:46:26,479 --> 00:46:29,479
Gabjak eats famine.
Biwi eats plague.

442
00:46:29,759 --> 00:46:32,919
Woongbaek eats goblin.
Deunggan eats sinister.

443
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:37,399
The twelve gods will
exorcise the demons upon us.

444
00:46:37,638 --> 00:46:41,479
I will break your neck
and slice your liver.

445
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:45,439
I will cut your skin
and take out your lungs and bowels.

446
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,919
Guard the Emperor!

447
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:19,359
Mu!

448
00:48:55,719 --> 00:48:56,759
Get them!

449
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:06,639
Royal army, follow me!

450
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,959
Jeongyun!

451
00:49:11,399 --> 00:49:12,599
Mu!

452
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:21,279
You're my 4th son.

453
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,119
Where is Jeongyun?

454
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:33,239
Where is Jeongyun?

455
00:49:36,638 --> 00:49:37,839
I'm here, your highness.

456
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:53,639
Are you okay, 4th Prince?

457
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:13,519
So...

458
00:50:17,638 --> 00:50:18,719
I'll go after the rest.

459
00:50:35,638 --> 00:50:36,679
Jeongyun.

460
00:50:58,439 --> 00:51:01,279
- Look at that.
- And over there.

461
00:51:56,479 --> 00:51:58,319
Honey or soy sauce.
One, two, three.

462
00:51:58,399 --> 00:51:59,999
- Honey!
- Yes!

463
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:15,039
Please slow down.

464
00:52:15,638 --> 00:52:18,839
I'll grow old before
I ever get married.

465
00:52:19,479 --> 00:52:22,799
You're much younger than me.
Girl up!

466
00:52:22,879 --> 00:52:24,759
We're only a year apart.

467
00:52:26,759 --> 00:52:28,399
Oh, that's right...

468
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:46,159
Chaeryeong, wait here.

469
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:48,638
Miss! Miss Su!

470
00:55:11,319 --> 00:55:13,079
You'll never leave alive.

471
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:15,638
Tell me who you work for.

472
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:20,199
If you talk, I'll ask for a pardon
from the Emperor.

473
00:55:26,279 --> 00:55:28,759
I am Wang So, the 4th Prince.

474
00:55:30,479 --> 00:55:32,079
I give you my word.

475
00:55:51,279 --> 00:55:54,799
Over there, people are...
They're doing...

476
00:56:06,879 --> 00:56:07,999
Kill her.

477
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:13,039
Kill her.

478
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:18,599
Or...

479
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:21,439
I can do it for you.

480
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,279
Please, I want to live.

481
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:43,319
He might really kill me.

482
00:56:44,638 --> 00:56:47,879
I don't care about this girl.

483
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:52,239
Stop messing around.
Tell me who is behind this.

484
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:55,519
Now!

485
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,759
Why!

486
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,079
I almost had him.

487
00:57:53,759 --> 00:57:55,638
But because of you...

488
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:12,638
Stop.

489
00:58:14,879 --> 00:58:16,079
She's innocent.

490
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:17,919
Let her go.

491
00:58:35,959 --> 00:58:37,399
I refuse.

492
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:00,839
SCARLET HEART

493
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:03,279
There's something connecting the two.

494
00:59:03,638 --> 00:59:07,639
He messed everything up.
Keep a closer eye on him.

495
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:10,999
It was you.
You tried to kill Jeongyun.

496
00:59:11,239 --> 00:59:12,959
You're trying to frame me.

497
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:16,638
I need my son to rule Goryeo.

498
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:19,119
Trying to pick another fight?

499
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:22,079
You're the first girl
to treat me like that.

500
00:59:22,399 --> 00:59:24,399
A beautiful lady should not have scars.

501
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:28,119
Don't worry about me.
I can do well by myself.

502
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:31,559
You know how I feel about my sister.

503
00:59:31,638 --> 00:59:33,879
- Are you happy?
- I feel relieved.

504
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,638
I keep looking forward
to seeing her.

505
00:59:50,638 --> 00:59:53,239
SCARLET HEART
