00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:05,405
MOON LOVERS:
SCARLET HEART RYEO

2
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:13,125
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS.

3
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:15,925
LAST EPISODE

4
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:44,325
Let me show you something
for your birthday present.

5
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:07,885
The Emperor has banned weddings.

6
00:01:09,045 --> 00:01:11,125
But I prepared it secretly.

7
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:15,285
- Are you disappointed
- This is good enough.

8
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:24,645
Don't worry. I just wanted
to take you out of the palace.

9
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:26,925
We're still friends
even after the wedding.

10
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:29,485
I don't worry about it.

11
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:32,924
It's quiet here far from the main house.
You'll like here.

12
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:36,365
It's also close to my
favorite place, so come out anytime.

13
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:41,125
And this.

14
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:47,685
Thanks for saying that you want it.

15
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:53,005
Damn it!

16
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:02,925
You've mastered another skill.

17
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:06,725
I think you've practiced enough.

18
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:16,205
Let me see how sweet
you can be to your hubby.

19
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,725
Never mind.

20
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:30,525
Let's get in. I asked the loyal doctor
to stop by before he retires.

21
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:31,805
A doctor

22
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:34,885
I'm OK.

23
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,725
You've gone through a lot,
you should check.

24
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:39,005
Let's go.

25
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,946
There was no sign of fetus pulse

26
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:05,065
when you left the palace.

27
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:07,626
- But...
- It was very early stage.

28
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,586
Of course you wouldn't know.

29
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,666
Fetus Then...

30
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:17,914
As I have advised you before

31
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:21,034
your condition isn't good
from extreme stress.

32
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:23,554
but your pregnancy makes you weaker.

33
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:28,394
- If you insist on being pregnant...
- I'll be fine.

34
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:31,034
As long as...

35
00:04:32,394 --> 00:04:34,394
- the baby is good, I'm OK.
- That's nonsense!

36
00:04:36,394 --> 00:04:37,994
Please keep this confidential.

37
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,190
You should postpone your retirement.

38
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:42,982
- Stay in this house for awhile.
- Sure.

39
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,670
Please keep yourself warm always.

40
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,190
Also stay in bed as much as possible.

41
00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:01,390
Baeka said their marriage
is just a mere formality!

42
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,909
But look at this.

43
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,909
It says the Fourteenth Prince's wife
was with him

44
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:10,150
while he practiced martial arts.

45
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,230
They were holding hands
and they care for each other!

46
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:18,909
Your Majesty.
You know her better.

47
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:22,150
They were close friends
since they were young.

48
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,670
And she's a lively person.

49
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,230
She also doesn't discriminate
men and women for her friends.

50
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,230
Su!

51
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,670
Su!

52
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:58,430
Why did you come out
You can't get cold with the baby.

53
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,710
Get up.

54
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,670
Don't worry about me
and go to your bed.

55
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,230
Why do you want to kick me out
on our first night together

56
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,230
Now that we see each other like this
we've gotten older.

57
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,950
The time has passed so fast.

58
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,909
Good days and bad days come around.

59
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,590
And they go around, too.

60
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,190
I've lived enough to know that.

61
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,590
Do you remember
when we met for the first time

62
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,909
I think it was
the Eighth Prince's library

63
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,909
Or when I saved you

64
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,550
When you were swinging
that big stick

65
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,030
I was so surprised.

66
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,710
I've never seen that
brave woman like you in my life.

67
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,830
And when you were in
fight with Eun.

68
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,910
Every time I think of it
I'd smile.

69
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,390
Your hair was messy,
Eun had this huge bruise on his face.

70
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,909
- You'd still show a bold front.
- Right.

71
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,190
How come you don't keep the promise
that you'll sing for my birthday

72
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,270
I've been waiting every year.

73
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,190
Fine, I'll sing this year for sure.

74
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,270
Do you remember that
You sneaked into Princes' bath.

75
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,870
What were you even thinking

76
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:22,990
Now that I see,
you were perverted somewhat.

77
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,990
That's not so true.

78
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,750
I was so shocked that
I couldn't see much.

79
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,909
Don't lie.

80
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,910
You saw it all, right

81
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,070
What about my body

82
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,270
From now on...

83
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,630
do not report about them.

84
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:10,909
Make sure I don't hear about them.

85
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,909
Finally we're alone together.

86
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,870
It's you and me
and me and you.

87
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,950
Without any worries...

88
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,830
I can love you as much as I can now.

89
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:47,909
ABOUT SIX MONTHS LATER

90
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,950
How's Su
How come the baby came out this early

91
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,750
But the girl is healthy.

92
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:10,909
She's very beautiful.

93
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,670
This girl was born...

94
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,909
dead.

95
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:18,065
Do you understand

96
00:11:18,106 --> 00:11:19,306
Bring her to her nanny.

97
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:21,906
Do not tell anyone.

98
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,506
She's used up all her energy.

99
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:58,146
Don't worry about the baby.

100
00:11:58,226 --> 00:12:01,346
The baby is lucky.
Very pretty and healthy.

101
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:04,546
The best nanny is hired.

102
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:06,226
That's good to hear.

103
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:14,626
So don't worry about the baby.

104
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:16,626
Think of yourself first.

105
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:20,786
Please get well soon.

106
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:31,546
Please.

107
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:46,026
Do you want to show
the Emperor the baby

108
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:53,426
I want to...

109
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,065
see the baby.

110
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:04,626
Sure.

111
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:12,546
Please give this to the Emperor.

112
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,626
Please make sure he reads
as soon as possible.

113
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:18,026
Wait.

114
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:27,426
It'd look strange if my wife writes
the same style as the Emperor.

115
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:15,065
Your Majesty.

116
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:17,666
This is from the Fourteenth Prince.

117
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:31,065
He won't get tired about it

118
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:38,506
Why won't you read it

119
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,786
It'd be full of complaints.

120
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:43,386
I don't want to feel bad reading it.

121
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:46,586
He said there's something
you must know.

122
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,065
He even sent a messenger.

123
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:51,065
Do you think I have to time for that

124
00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:53,706
I'm sorry.

125
00:15:12,386 --> 00:15:14,386
He has not come yet, right

126
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,186
I've sent many letters.

127
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:29,186
He must hate me so much.

128
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:36,946
Please send a messenger.

129
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:41,106
If the messenger conveys my message,

130
00:15:41,186 --> 00:15:42,866
he'll come.

131
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:44,706
I did, but...

132
00:15:47,186 --> 00:15:50,386
Right, I forgot.
I'll send a messenger.

133
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:58,666
Let's get out.
Let's get some air and get healthy soon.

134
00:15:58,746 --> 00:16:01,546
I've called the best band in Songak.

135
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:04,346
I've also prepared peony blossom.

136
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:06,746
Don't you want to see them

137
00:16:09,546 --> 00:16:11,186
Peony blossom

138
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:22,026
Do you have any particular song
you'd like to listen to

139
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:30,386
Please play your best song.

140
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:33,546
This song is popular with the story

141
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,466
that a court lady became
the Emperor's favorite after playing it.

142
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:38,466
The Emperor

143
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:44,826
I'd like to hear it.

144
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:15,506
Do you remember your promise...

145
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:21,466
that you'd regard my life...

146
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,706
as your own

147
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,866
My baby...

148
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,866
please...

149
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:45,066
take care of her for me.

150
00:18:48,306 --> 00:18:50,306
Do not send her to the palace.

151
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,106
Why do you say that

152
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:03,466
He won't come.

153
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:25,065
Su.

154
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,306
In your next life...

155
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:32,306
will you remember me

156
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:37,066
I will forget about you.

157
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:41,866
I'll forget about everything.

158
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,066
Not even in my dream...

159
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,306
I won't remember...

160
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:01,386
Su wouldn't...

161
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,306
hate me this much.

162
00:21:08,506 --> 00:21:10,906
They said she has been
sending you letters.

163
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:14,266
Did you read them

164
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:56,506
Life is like a dream.

165
00:21:57,706 --> 00:22:00,906
Right or wrong,
love and hatred...

166
00:22:02,065 --> 00:22:05,706
they all pass by with the time
and are buried.

167
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:11,826
Are you still upset for our love

168
00:22:17,106 --> 00:22:19,626
The opposite of love is...

169
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:21,293
not hatred.

170
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:24,506
It's neglecting.

171
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:29,571
Because I left you
with hatred, not love

172
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:32,716
I'm always worried that
I may have made you

173
00:22:32,906 --> 00:22:34,065
restless.

174
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:38,637
I still love you.

175
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,626
When you stood by me in the rain
giving up everything you had...

176
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:49,174
when you threw yourself for me
from the arrow...

177
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,826
that's when you've become
unforgettable for me.

178
00:22:57,786 --> 00:22:58,826
I miss you.

179
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:02,065
And I miss you more.

180
00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:04,866
But I can't get close to you.

181
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:10,426
I'm getting tired of coldness
from the sweetest person.

182
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:14,706
I hope we encounter again
on the curvy bridge.

183
00:23:16,706 --> 00:23:18,066
I'm waiting for you...

184
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,065
every day.

185
00:24:18,106 --> 00:24:19,466
Su!

186
00:24:22,065 --> 00:24:24,346
Where's Su Where is she

187
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,066
Su.

188
00:24:28,986 --> 00:24:30,986
Stop playing!

189
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:34,065
Su! Where are you

190
00:24:34,986 --> 00:24:36,266
Where are you

191
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:38,346
Su! Su!

192
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:47,186
Why are you looking for her now

193
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,026
Don't pretend you're sad now.

194
00:24:57,786 --> 00:24:59,026
You made me act this way.

195
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,786
It was your name on the envelope.

196
00:25:03,186 --> 00:25:05,786
I didn't know it was from Su!

197
00:25:07,065 --> 00:25:10,266
That's because her handwriting
is just like yours...

198
00:25:11,786 --> 00:25:14,306
But you'd know that
she was dying at least.

199
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,027
I know you've put spies here!

200
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:21,707
Because you've shared the same room
and showed affection with her.

201
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,066
He didn't get any report about Su.

202
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:56,906
Su.

203
00:25:57,386 --> 00:25:58,786
Don't go.

204
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:01,065
Please don't leave.

205
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:07,135
No, you can't.
She's my wife!

206
00:26:08,186 --> 00:26:09,386
Get out of my way.

207
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:11,877
Su is dead but...

208
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:14,186
she's still mine.

209
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:16,642
Please!

210
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:19,001
You know it better!

211
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:22,722
Who Su would like to stay with.

212
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:41,841
If you really care about Su,

213
00:26:42,094 --> 00:26:43,803
please stop fighting with the Emperor.

214
00:26:45,122 --> 00:26:46,122
Haesu's life was...

215
00:26:47,762 --> 00:26:51,584
stuck in our lives.
She couldn't do anything.

216
00:26:54,453 --> 00:26:55,493
Would you...

217
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:58,854
still make her sadder

218
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:18,442
You...

219
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:22,882
Su...

220
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:27,237
What a stupid.

221
00:27:56,172 --> 00:27:58,172
I'm OK since I'm not alone.

222
00:28:02,442 --> 00:28:05,082
I have you.
Why am I alone

223
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:14,063
I won't leave you.

224
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:33,082
Let me go!

225
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,419
I was almost the Emperor!

226
00:28:38,444 --> 00:28:40,604
If you'll kill me,
kill me in front of the Emperor!

227
00:28:47,702 --> 00:28:50,502
So I should kill myself

228
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,660
What
Did the Emperor tell you

229
00:29:03,685 --> 00:29:05,245
to check on me
making sure I'm dead

230
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:07,364
I have something for you.

231
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:10,682
It's Haesu's favor.

232
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:20,399
- She died a long time ago.
- She left...

233
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,470
her will to give you the letter.

234
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,282
I'm sorry that

235
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:31,082
I can't be more help.

236
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:01,841
I know my end has come.

237
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:05,559
Can I go to you...

238
00:30:07,293 --> 00:30:08,893
for this chance

239
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,050
Since I don't know
when I can get out of the palace.

240
00:30:13,716 --> 00:30:14,956
I am just...

241
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:17,803
a silly girl

242
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:20,211
who can only love one person.

243
00:30:22,996 --> 00:30:24,196
Silly girl.

244
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:28,626
How can you not hate me

245
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,442
It's the son's birthday.

246
00:30:44,522 --> 00:30:46,882
How can you not see us not even once

247
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:51,187
Your care for him
would be good enough.

248
00:30:51,322 --> 00:30:52,882
He's afraid of his father.

249
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:54,811
Because you treat him

250
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:58,442
like your competitor.

251
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:02,790
You've cleared up all other nephews.

252
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:05,833
You should trust your son at least.

253
00:31:08,122 --> 00:31:09,322
Excuse me, Empress.

254
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:14,411
I know well about people
who hide their real face behind.

255
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:17,682
You and the boy...

256
00:31:18,882 --> 00:31:21,322
I know you'd strike me anytime.

257
00:31:24,443 --> 00:31:28,803
So you'll only remember her

258
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:40,122
Haesu was the only one who said
that all people are equal.

259
00:31:41,682 --> 00:31:44,122
You're banning slavery
because you can't forget about her.

260
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,242
Did you think I wouldn't know that

261
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,682
Let's say you're right.

262
00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:54,882
But what difference would that make

263
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:03,322
Now that I see it...

264
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,482
I think I know

265
00:32:07,762 --> 00:32:09,402
why she left you.

266
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:37,202
Be careful!

267
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:51,922
You bumped into me first.

268
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:01,722
Who are you

269
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:08,922
Father!

270
00:33:15,722 --> 00:33:16,922
I greet you, Your Majesty.

271
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:29,642
You're not supposed to leave
Choongju, why are you here

272
00:33:29,722 --> 00:33:31,642
It's Su's anniversary...

273
00:33:31,722 --> 00:33:34,001
I'm so sorry.
I was out of my mind.

274
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:35,722
It won't happen again.

275
00:33:37,322 --> 00:33:38,522
Is she your daughter

276
00:33:41,882 --> 00:33:42,922
Yes, Your Majesty.

277
00:33:46,402 --> 00:33:49,001
I remember approving your re-marriage
as your family requested.

278
00:33:50,402 --> 00:33:51,442
But...

279
00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:56,762
she's pretty older.

280
00:33:59,962 --> 00:34:03,522
- How old is she
- You must be busy with work.

281
00:34:03,602 --> 00:34:05,001
You don't need to worry
about my children.

282
00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:07,347
Let's go.

283
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:11,602
Stop.

284
00:34:21,962 --> 00:34:23,082
Leave her here.

285
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:36,282
I can't do that
unless you kill me.

286
00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:40,602
Is that so

287
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:42,842
She said...

288
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:47,842
her daughter can't live in the palace.

289
00:34:49,482 --> 00:34:51,001
Because it's so scary and lonely...

290
00:34:52,282 --> 00:34:53,842
she didn't want to send her there.

291
00:34:55,842 --> 00:34:57,001
Haesu was...

292
00:34:57,842 --> 00:35:00,282
worried about that
until her last moment.

293
00:35:21,001 --> 00:35:22,642
For the Fourteenth Prince,
Wang Jung...

294
00:35:26,642 --> 00:35:28,562
the order that bans from the palace
will be removed.

295
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:36,642
You can come to the palace
from time to time.

296
00:36:10,282 --> 00:36:14,162
I don't understand why you'd
like to bring children to the palace.

297
00:36:14,642 --> 00:36:17,762
This is hard-earned chance
from the Emperor

298
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,402
to bring them as friends
of the Prince for his birthday.

299
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:24,202
So pack for them.

300
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:27,482
You should convince your wife too.

301
00:36:28,282 --> 00:36:29,762
I don't...

302
00:36:31,646 --> 00:36:33,366
want to send them to the palace.

303
00:36:36,482 --> 00:36:37,842
After I die...

304
00:36:39,482 --> 00:36:42,642
- he'd remove the ban from my children.
- No.

305
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:45,134
Your children must
get used to the palace.

306
00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:51,001
I will make your son Chi next Emperor.

307
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:57,350
- What
- You've turned down my dream

308
00:36:57,485 --> 00:36:59,725
and Yeonhwa betrayed my dream.

309
00:37:00,716 --> 00:37:04,996
But I haven't given up yet.

310
00:37:29,134 --> 00:37:30,974
You'll get caught by Father.

311
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,001
You must be the daughter of Uk.

312
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:45,922
I'm your uncle.

313
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:48,722
- Thirteenth uncle.
- You're lying.

314
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:50,442
You look like a wanderer
with an instrument.

315
00:37:51,642 --> 00:37:53,922
I'm not lying.

316
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:56,362
- What's your name
- My name

317
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:57,882
It's Boksoon.

318
00:37:59,002 --> 00:38:01,562
What's your name

319
00:38:01,751 --> 00:38:05,110
- It's Boksoon.
- Woohee! We need to go now.

320
00:38:05,337 --> 00:38:06,777
OK.

321
00:38:10,442 --> 00:38:13,001
Boksoon

322
00:38:28,566 --> 00:38:29,886
Is that yours

323
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,859
- Where did you get it
- I don't know.

324
00:38:35,002 --> 00:38:36,442
I always had it.

325
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,482
It's my favorite.

326
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,212
I wish

327
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,791
I wasn't Baekjae's people.

328
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:12,001
I want to be...

329
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:16,802
wholly yours.

330
00:39:49,029 --> 00:39:51,749
I heard that you're still going out

331
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,420
and not thinking about getting married.

332
00:39:57,084 --> 00:40:01,084
The life would be boring
without any romance.

333
00:40:10,602 --> 00:40:15,722
The Emperor spent time
reading books at first

334
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,790
and now he's putting it into work.

335
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:23,402
He investigates slaves
and open fair tests.

336
00:40:25,402 --> 00:40:27,802
It's all to weaken
nobles' power.

337
00:40:29,211 --> 00:40:32,851
You're still interested
in the affairs.

338
00:40:33,802 --> 00:40:36,001
I'm just watching it.

339
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:42,602
Because I wonder what kind
of Emperor would So be.

340
00:40:46,637 --> 00:40:48,037
Maybe...

341
00:40:49,203 --> 00:40:53,443
Goryeo has the greatest
Emperor in history.

342
00:40:55,895 --> 00:40:58,975
He has given up that much too.

343
00:41:13,273 --> 00:41:14,312
Recently...

344
00:41:15,802 --> 00:41:18,522
I think of many faces.

345
00:41:18,874 --> 00:41:20,074
Do you still...

346
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:22,796
miss Haesu

347
00:41:30,602 --> 00:41:32,001
Well...

348
00:41:42,407 --> 00:41:43,808
I've always...

349
00:41:45,665 --> 00:41:46,865
made mistakes

350
00:41:48,865 --> 00:41:51,585
when giving my heart
to someone.

351
00:41:56,065 --> 00:41:58,105
I've learned that too late.

352
00:42:55,145 --> 00:42:57,345
You want to leave that much

353
00:42:58,264 --> 00:42:59,585
Yes.

354
00:43:00,264 --> 00:43:01,945
I think of him a lot.

355
00:43:05,945 --> 00:43:07,145
It's not what you promised.

356
00:43:08,264 --> 00:43:11,945
You said you only belong
to the Emperor.

357
00:43:13,305 --> 00:43:14,505
Right.

358
00:43:15,702 --> 00:43:18,342
But there's only one Emperor for me.

359
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,029
He was like my brother,

360
00:43:22,264 --> 00:43:26,545
my friend and my master.

361
00:43:32,505 --> 00:43:36,264
Maybe Haesu isn't from this world.

362
00:43:37,736 --> 00:43:40,376
There have been many instances
to prove it.

363
00:43:41,164 --> 00:43:42,364
So please forget about her.

364
00:43:43,172 --> 00:43:47,172
If you miss someone you can't reach,
you'll become like me.

365
00:45:21,436 --> 00:45:23,796
Then should I call you, my girl

366
00:45:27,716 --> 00:45:29,716
You're my only Empress.

367
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:12,035
Why again

368
00:46:14,035 --> 00:46:15,716
Who is it to make me feel this way

369
00:46:29,276 --> 00:46:32,796
THE CULTURE OF GORYEO'S MAKE-UP

370
00:46:33,516 --> 00:46:36,676
Due to the influence of Buddhism,
Goryeo's been advanced in

371
00:46:36,756 --> 00:46:40,756
the culture of face wash, bath
bathing items and make-up skills.

372
00:46:41,556 --> 00:46:46,316
The envoy of Son dynasty writes that...

373
00:46:46,396 --> 00:46:48,756
I've been dreaming the same dream
for one year now.

374
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,676
It's a guy with this big scar
on his face.

375
00:46:52,756 --> 00:46:55,116
He covers it with his mask.

376
00:46:55,196 --> 00:46:57,035
The clothes are from old days.

377
00:46:57,035 --> 00:46:59,516
Because you woke up from death.

378
00:46:59,596 --> 00:47:01,556
You've been unconscious for a year
after you were almost drowned.

379
00:47:02,756 --> 00:47:04,396
I'm healthy now.

380
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:11,196
But why every time I dream
about him...

381
00:47:13,196 --> 00:47:15,196
I cry that much

382
00:47:18,396 --> 00:47:20,396
The tea culture was also advanced.

383
00:47:21,556 --> 00:47:24,396
They also had today's face masks.

384
00:47:25,236 --> 00:47:27,596
From trading...

385
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:31,756
they brought roses
from today's Bulgaria.

386
00:47:32,556 --> 00:47:36,196
And they made cosmetic products.

387
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:52,669
Hello.

388
00:48:04,035 --> 00:48:06,035
- Your last name is "Ko"
- What

389
00:48:07,156 --> 00:48:09,916
Right, my name is Hajin Ko.

390
00:48:10,356 --> 00:48:13,476
Did you know today's "Ko"
was Goryeo's "Hae"

391
00:48:14,035 --> 00:48:16,276
Oh, yes

392
00:48:16,356 --> 00:48:19,356
Our company advertises Goryeo's
cosmetic culture too.

393
00:48:19,436 --> 00:48:21,116
It's a funny coincidence.

394
00:48:21,196 --> 00:48:23,076
There's no coincidence.

395
00:48:23,196 --> 00:48:25,556
Everything will come back
to its place.

396
00:48:30,396 --> 00:48:33,116
I smell rose fragrances here.

397
00:48:33,196 --> 00:48:36,676
Yes, we've put rose oil
in our products.

398
00:48:36,756 --> 00:48:38,035
Especially in this serum.

399
00:48:39,156 --> 00:48:40,276
We've added

400
00:48:40,356 --> 00:48:44,035
- Bulgarian rose oil...
- Bulgarian rose oil.

401
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:45,156
Did you put that in

402
00:48:54,035 --> 00:48:55,716
Are you OK

403
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,916
Nothing.

404
00:49:02,035 --> 00:49:06,035
It's good for your skin
if you put on this serum every day.

405
00:49:08,035 --> 00:49:12,076
Did you know even Goryeo had
something like BB cream

406
00:49:12,156 --> 00:49:15,356
- Even men use this these days...
- Brace yourself.

407
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:19,076
I won't never lose you.

408
00:49:25,581 --> 00:49:27,261
I think you should rest.

409
00:49:28,221 --> 00:49:30,100
What's wrong with me

410
00:49:31,421 --> 00:49:34,621
I think you should go. Don't worry
about here, I'll take care of it.

411
00:49:36,222 --> 00:49:37,422
I'm sorry.

412
00:50:38,741 --> 00:50:40,301
Gwangjong

413
00:50:44,821 --> 00:50:47,100
It wasn't a dream.

414
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,581
It's not a dream.

415
00:50:51,621 --> 00:50:54,461
Thank you for your mercy,
Your Majesty.

416
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:56,781
Don't worry.
I'll protect you no matter what.

417
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:13,781
How can you enjoy this party
all by yourself, brother

418
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:40,141
You're mine.
I said that girl is mine.

419
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:43,421
Brace yourself.
I won't never lose you.

420
00:51:44,221 --> 00:51:46,621
Even when you put
your hand on my face

421
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,421
I won't ever lose you.

422
00:51:58,701 --> 00:52:00,100
HIS NAME IS 'SO'.

423
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,781
HE ESTABLISHED
SLAVE INVESTITURE ACT...

424
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:03,701
THE GREATEST KING OF ALL...

425
00:52:03,781 --> 00:52:07,061
DOUBTING HIS OWN RELATIVES...
THE EMPEROR OF BLOOD...

426
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:18,381
You won't be remembered
as a bloody emperor in history.

427
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,701
I will help you.

428
00:52:57,621 --> 00:52:58,781
I'm sorry.

429
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,100
I'm sorry I left you alone.

430
00:53:35,981 --> 00:53:37,100
I'm sorry.

431
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,100
The Eighth brother has...

432
00:53:57,981 --> 00:53:59,100
left us now.

433
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,781
I don't have anyone else to see.

434
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:08,781
I'm leaving again.

435
00:54:12,501 --> 00:54:13,621
I wish you a comfortable life.

436
00:55:07,381 --> 00:55:08,381
Transient life.

437
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:17,541
Father's last words
were "transient life".

438
00:55:17,621 --> 00:55:19,981
The life is vain and empty.

439
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,100
He said that's the life.

440
00:55:26,381 --> 00:55:28,581
But I think he's wrong.

441
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:33,621
It can't be vain
when we're together like this.

442
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:52,781
That look on your face
makes me nervous.

443
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,981
It seems like
you'll leave me far away.

444
00:55:57,981 --> 00:56:01,461
What are you afraid of
What are you hiding

445
00:56:04,421 --> 00:56:05,661
Just...

446
00:56:07,421 --> 00:56:10,421
living here every day is nervous.

447
00:56:12,621 --> 00:56:14,421
Every step...

448
00:56:15,661 --> 00:56:18,061
I feel like I'm walking
on a thin ice sheet.

449
00:56:20,421 --> 00:56:22,061
Sometimes it suffocates me.

450
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:27,661
Even if you're with me

451
00:56:31,661 --> 00:56:33,581
I sometimes wish

452
00:56:33,661 --> 00:56:37,100
if we met in a different time
at different places.

453
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,421
It must be great.

454
00:56:42,421 --> 00:56:44,061
If that happens...

455
00:56:45,661 --> 00:56:47,661
I won't be afraid of anything.

456
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:50,061
And I can...

457
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,861
love you...

458
00:56:56,061 --> 00:56:57,661
as much as I want.

459
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:35,100
If your world and mine
are different...

460
00:57:36,061 --> 00:57:38,100
I'll go find you.

461
00:57:40,421 --> 00:57:44,021
My Su.

462
00:58:01,501 --> 00:58:02,781
Like here...

463
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:12,100
Here, come up.

464
00:58:13,221 --> 00:58:15,381
- Please get up.
- It's OK.

465
00:58:24,528 --> 00:58:26,864
- Now we're off to go.
- Sure.

466
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:28,609
Let's go.
