1
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:05,227
SCARLET HEART

2
00:00:10,707 --> 00:00:13,107
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS

3
00:00:29,187 --> 00:00:31,427
You're not well.
Why are you here?

4
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,507
Let's go back.

5
00:00:41,947 --> 00:00:43,147
Let's go.

6
00:00:43,707 --> 00:00:45,906
I was waiting to talk to you.

7
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:52,587
I'm not...

8
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:56,147
going back to that room.

9
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:03,347
Don't do this to me
because of Chaeryeong.

10
00:01:04,427 --> 00:01:05,906
She deceived you.

11
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:09,707
She was never truthful.

12
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:16,147
I'm doing well.

13
00:01:16,227 --> 00:01:18,387
I'm doing well.

14
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:23,187
Chaeryeong.

15
00:01:25,906 --> 00:01:27,787
She was truthful.

16
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:29,906
Whatever you say.

17
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:34,707
- She was truthful.
- So?

18
00:01:36,507 --> 00:01:38,747
Are you trusting her
instead of me?

19
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:43,307
I want to leave the palace.

20
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:47,867
I want to get out of here.

21
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,547
I can't...

22
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:54,906
stand it any longer.

23
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:58,147
What about me?

24
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:01,787
I won't let you go.

25
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:04,227
You...

26
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:07,906
You can never leave me.

27
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:22,787
I'll be the moonlight,
I'll shine on you.

28
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:29,267
Wherever you are,
I will be there.

29
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:34,627
I love you.

30
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:38,906
I want you so much.

31
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:45,587
I watch from afar,
and go back again.

32
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:50,667
I confess to you.

33
00:02:52,987 --> 00:02:55,427
If you abandon
your brother and family,

34
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,587
devote yourself as my Empress...

35
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:02,787
Then I will appoint our child
as the next Jeongyun.

36
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:10,906
Goryeo must become my son's.

37
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,906
Deliver this to Chaeryeong's family.

38
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:25,147
This is all I have.

39
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:29,667
If they need more,
I'll see what I can do.

40
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:31,467
You don't need to do this.

41
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:34,227
I'm worried you'll bring out
the Emperor's wrath.

42
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:38,347
To the moment she died,
she worried about her family.

43
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:42,906
She asked for my help.

44
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:47,907
I'm sure the Emperor won't mind.

45
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:57,307
Come on in.

46
00:03:58,187 --> 00:03:59,747
Hey, Jimong.

47
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:06,906
Chaeryeong is dead.

48
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:10,987
Oh yeah?

49
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:13,347
Don't be nonchalant.

50
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,067
She died for you.

51
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:18,187
What?

52
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:22,987
- Are you crazy?
- You'll regret it.

53
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:25,906
Treating her like that.

54
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:30,907
The day will come
when you will regret everything.

55
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:35,906
Now that you're the Emperor's mistress,

56
00:04:35,947 --> 00:04:38,787
do you think you can say
whatever you want?

57
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:39,906
Mistress?

58
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:52,187
Your highness.

59
00:05:01,987 --> 00:05:03,747
Did you call me?

60
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,787
Jimong told me.

61
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,906
I'll proclaim you as concubine.

62
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,947
- No need.
- It's better than being mistress.

63
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:14,347
I want to.

64
00:05:15,187 --> 00:05:18,307
First I'll make you Lady
right beneath Empress.

65
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:22,906
Once you have my baby,
I'll appoint you second Empress.

66
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,907
The reason I want to leave
isn't about my position.

67
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,907
Consult with Jimong
and decide on a name.

68
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:34,507
- Your highness...
- Stop being stubborn.

69
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:42,147
Let's not fight.

70
00:05:42,707 --> 00:05:45,347
Don't you remember
how long we were apart?

71
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:51,027
Let's not waste energy
on petty fights like this.

72
00:06:09,227 --> 00:06:10,827
Read Jeonggwanjeongyo?

73
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:12,707
JEONGGWANGJEONGYO
TANG TEXTBOOK ON KINGSHIP

74
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:15,027
I can't figure out
what his intentions are.

75
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:24,906
Let's get a hawk.

76
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:29,107
Find one that's swift
and is a good hunter.

77
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:34,347
Whatever he's up to...

78
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:37,467
If he wants to hunt,

79
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:39,387
let him hunt.

80
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:43,067
Brother.
You know how 4th brother is like.

81
00:06:43,307 --> 00:06:46,707
We can't trust him.
Can't let down our guards.

82
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:49,467
Let's get rid of his limbs.

83
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:52,387
You mean Baeka?

84
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:55,027
He fools around with geishas.

85
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:57,906
It'll be easy to cut him off.

86
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:04,947
Why are you hesitating again?

87
00:07:05,107 --> 00:07:09,107
We already have you adopted.
Mother is looking forward to see you.

88
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,267
Is it because of what happened?

89
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:18,427
I already asked the Emperor
to free all the Baekje slaves.

90
00:07:18,787 --> 00:07:20,906
It won't happen again.

91
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,347
DONOBI
RUNAWAY SLAVES

92
00:07:29,427 --> 00:07:31,906
Why didn't Hubaekje slaves
pay taxes for pardon?

93
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:54,867
Baekje slaves have already
burnt down a dozen nobles' houses.

94
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:57,906
Number of dead nobles and commoners
are in the dozens.

95
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:00,867
We can't stand by any more.

96
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:04,627
The nobles are requesting for
military deployment.

97
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:07,906
Once the army is involved
we will have casualties.

98
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,427
It could make things worse.

99
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:14,267
If the commoners join the slaves
it'll lead to a countrywide uprising.

100
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:16,547
You need to protect the nobles.

101
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:19,906
Without military help
they are fearing for their lives.

102
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:22,427
They've started recruiting militia.

103
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:23,906
Yes, your highness.

104
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:26,587
Please protect the nobles first!

105
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,906
Yes, your highness.

106
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:34,906
Alright.

107
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:40,667
I will deploy the army,
but they will only use blunt weapons.

108
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:45,147
I've just taken over the throne.
I wish no blood shed.

109
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:51,067
I request 13th brother Baeka
to lead the army.

110
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:56,907
Baeka has no battle experience.
Why would you want him to lead?

111
00:08:57,067 --> 00:09:00,667
Rumor is that the Emperor
favors personnel originating from

112
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:03,187
Silla or Baekje like Baeka,
rather than those native to here.

113
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:08,227
Furthermore, Baeka had his family
adopt a Baekje court lady

114
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:09,747
in order to marry her.

115
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:12,147
I approved that.

116
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:17,147
It means your right-hand man
is controlled by Baekje refugees.

117
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,467
That's all speculation.

118
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:22,147
Speculation might soon
turn into reality.

119
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:27,507
That's how rumors work.
People start to believe them.

120
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:36,987
No way.

121
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:39,707
You're an artist.
You don't wield swords.

122
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,467
I don't like Uhui looked down upon
because she's from Baekje.

123
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:43,947
And I don't like...

124
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:47,507
You being stuck in a difficult situation
because of us.

125
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:53,587
I'll lead the troops instead.

126
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:58,907
You are currently laying low
to make nobles put their guards down.

127
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:04,467
It's a tricky situation.
You can't take either side.

128
00:10:04,547 --> 00:10:05,947
I won't die.

129
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:11,827
You can't let the nobles play you.
You need to stay strong.

130
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:15,147
I'll be fine.

131
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:33,587
Always watched you from afar.

132
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:42,627
Because I thought you were my love.

133
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:48,467
I thought you were the same.

134
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:53,667
But it was not.

135
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:57,267
No regrets?

136
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:00,987
I pretended to be strong.

137
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:03,667
I might get hurt.

138
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:08,547
Now that you have a wife.
I'm sure you'll be okay.

139
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:13,906
I don't want to be a widow.

140
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:22,867
When I come back...

141
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:26,906
Let's get married.

142
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:33,187
You're my...

143
00:11:34,787 --> 00:11:36,027
companion for life.

144
00:11:37,507 --> 00:11:41,906
I wish I wasn't
the daughter of Baekje.

145
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:47,906
I am your companion for life.

146
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:57,906
Wait!
What's that?

147
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:02,906
I, the Emperor of Goryeo

148
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:05,987
promise the Baekje refugees.

149
00:12:07,906 --> 00:12:13,187
I will look into the slave situation.

150
00:12:13,427 --> 00:12:17,906
I promise you justice will be served.

151
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:23,707
Baekje refugees who are post-war slaves,
will be reinstated as commoners.

152
00:12:24,347 --> 00:12:31,147
If anyone tries to slave a refugee,
regardless of class, you will be punished.

153
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:36,947
Reinstated slaves are permitted
to return to their homeland.

154
00:12:37,227 --> 00:12:39,827
Taxes will be temporarily exempted.

155
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:45,227
The practice of discrimination
by land of origin is to be terminated.

156
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:50,147
You can apply for government positions
and will be treated as Goryeo citizens.

157
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,947
End discrimination?

158
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:57,267
They're lying to us again.

159
00:12:57,507 --> 00:13:01,187
They can't fool us.
We won't be fooled!

160
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:04,587
They treated us like pigs!

161
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:07,227
- Let's go!
- Attack!

162
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:35,067
You were exiled.
You can get in trouble here.

163
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,867
Let him do what he wants.
I'm not scared of him.

164
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:56,187
Didn't I warn you
he was going to leave you to die?

165
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:59,267
He should've let me lead.

166
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:03,947
Don't die.

167
00:14:05,747 --> 00:14:07,707
Even if you get wounded...

168
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:09,906
Don't die.

169
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,507
I can't stand it any more.

170
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:21,427
Did you receive what Haesu sent?

171
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:24,907
- The hairpin.
- Yes.

172
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:28,267
But there was no message.

173
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:29,906
This is the message.

174
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:32,707
I want it.

175
00:14:33,787 --> 00:14:34,906
I want it?

176
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:38,027
Did she really say that?

177
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:41,747
Yes, she did.

178
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,187
Haesu said...

179
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:47,587
I desperately want it.

180
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:50,587
That's her message.

181
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:54,307
I don't know what it means, but...

182
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:56,987
Help her.

183
00:14:57,827 --> 00:15:00,187
I might not be able to come back.

184
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:04,947
I want you to stand by her as a friend.

185
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:10,747
She's having a hard time with the Emperor.

186
00:15:11,906 --> 00:15:13,906
Worry about yourself.

187
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:16,747
Why isn't anyone seeing you off?

188
00:15:17,906 --> 00:15:19,787
What about the court lady?

189
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:23,627
I told Uhui to stay at home.

190
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:30,906
Please take care, brother.

191
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:03,787
SAMHANILTONG
GORYEO, BAEKJE, SILLA ARE ONE

192
00:16:09,906 --> 00:16:10,947
Uhui?

193
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:16,667
Princess?
It's princess Uhui!

194
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:19,867
- Princess! No!
- Princess!

195
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:28,906
Uhui!

196
00:16:39,627 --> 00:16:40,787
Stop.

197
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:50,707
You're not...

198
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:55,387
Don't do this.

199
00:16:57,027 --> 00:16:58,227
Turn around.

200
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:01,187
Turn around!

201
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,387
If you watch...

202
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:25,867
You won't be able to forget.

203
00:17:35,627 --> 00:17:36,906
Uhui!

204
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:42,587
I thought I could live unnoticed.

205
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:46,987
I could forget about my parents.

206
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:51,867
But I couldn't forget about my people
who think of me as their mother.

207
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:57,267
If I did,
my life would have no meaning.

208
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,627
Goryeo and Baekje.

209
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:06,987
Our king Gyeonhwon,
yours, Wang Geon.

210
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,307
Their sins...

211
00:18:11,906 --> 00:18:13,987
I hope my death can forgive it all.

212
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:21,067
Maybe this was my life's purpose.

213
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:26,187
Baeka.

214
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:29,507
I love you.

215
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,067
You are...

216
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:37,467
my only companion.

217
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:17,307
Blown away by the seasons.

218
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:24,587
Fallen flower petal.

219
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:31,387
Alone by itself.

220
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:38,147
Sad.

221
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:45,547
The stars have left.

222
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:51,227
The sky in sorrow.

223
00:19:52,906 --> 00:19:57,547
I know you can't stop thinking about her.
But you should take care of yourself.

224
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:01,427
Why didn't she tell me?

225
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:10,107
Maybe I put her in that situation.

226
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:14,906
It was all my greed.

227
00:20:16,906 --> 00:20:20,667
A refugee of a fallen country.
A geisha.

228
00:20:21,707 --> 00:20:22,906
An orphan.

229
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:27,267
I didn't care about her background.

230
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:31,707
I was proud I loved her.

231
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:34,227
It was my narcissism.

232
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,906
I didn't try to see the real Uhui.

233
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:44,867
Why she was sad,
why she was in pain...

234
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:50,187
Why she couldn't smile brightly...

235
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:54,147
I didn't ask.

236
00:20:57,027 --> 00:20:59,187
My love was artificial.

237
00:21:00,787 --> 00:21:02,747
Uhui was wrong.

238
00:21:06,906 --> 00:21:08,906
We both gave our all.

239
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:11,987
Eventually...

240
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:16,267
She wasn't selfish.

241
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:20,147
She's bad.

242
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:31,667
The Emperor knew everything.

243
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:37,267
Right?

244
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:54,347
You look horrible.

245
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:57,427
I'll send the royal doctor.
Seek treatment.

246
00:21:57,507 --> 00:22:00,067
Uhui installed an imperial banner.

247
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:03,867
Did you make a deal?

248
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:06,987
I didn't know she'd kill herself.

249
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:11,906
I told her she could save you
with that banner.

250
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:14,867
That was when I found out
she was a Hubaekje princess.

251
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:18,787
I wanted to save you.

252
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:21,867
I wrote the banner as a last resort.

253
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:25,906
I didn't know she'd commit suicide.
But even if I knew...

254
00:22:26,906 --> 00:22:28,627
My choice remains the same.

255
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:31,507
To me...

256
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:34,827
You are more important.

257
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:37,067
I know.

258
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:41,906
I know but...

259
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:45,467
It's hard to accept.

260
00:22:49,627 --> 00:22:52,027
It's hard to stand beside you.

261
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,906
Don't do this.
I...

262
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:15,867
I was wrong.

263
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,307
No.

264
00:23:23,947 --> 00:23:27,707
I'm too small of a man to support you.
I'm the one who's sorry.

265
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:31,387
Long life to you.

266
00:23:33,906 --> 00:23:35,067
Brother.

267
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:44,147
Baeka.

268
00:23:45,787 --> 00:23:47,707
Baeka!

269
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:28,707
Are you sure about your conviction?

270
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:30,947
Yes.

271
00:25:01,787 --> 00:25:04,427
I heard you wanted to hunt.
I brought Haedongcheong.

272
00:25:04,507 --> 00:25:06,627
HAEDONGCHEONG
HAWK USED FOR HUNTING

273
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:09,227
Hawk hunting is my favorite.

274
00:25:16,187 --> 00:25:18,987
Hyojeyaja, Giwiinjibon.

275
00:25:19,187 --> 00:25:21,947
Filial love and brotherhood
are the basis of virtue.

276
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:25,827
What great brotherhood.

277
00:25:25,906 --> 00:25:29,107
Harmony in the family will help
harmony in the country.

278
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:01,907
- It's a dead hawk.
- A dead hawk!

279
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:06,547
A hawk symbolizes the Emperor.
He's put a curse on you!

280
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:09,307
This is a grave crime!

281
00:26:10,147 --> 00:26:11,267
Your highness.

282
00:26:12,147 --> 00:26:14,187
It's a misunderstanding.
It's...

283
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,187
- There must have been a mistake.
- Brother.

284
00:26:17,747 --> 00:26:20,707
You brought it in yourself.
Who are you trying to blame?

285
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,707
Curse the Emperor?

286
00:26:32,227 --> 00:26:35,307
I guess it's treason.

287
00:26:35,947 --> 00:26:38,467
Yes, it sure is!

288
00:26:38,747 --> 00:26:41,307
Yes, it is!
Your highness!

289
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:48,587
Your highness!
It's a mistake!

290
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,667
I'm being framed!

291
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:01,707
The punishment for treason...

292
00:27:02,906 --> 00:27:04,906
is death.

293
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,467
Empress.

294
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:33,347
Greetings.

295
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:36,907
Uk is being framed.
He might be executed.

296
00:27:37,627 --> 00:27:41,027
I heard he committed a crime,
too grave to revoke.

297
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,707
You need to save your brother.

298
00:27:47,906 --> 00:27:49,187
I refuse.

299
00:27:51,307 --> 00:27:52,547
Empress.

300
00:27:55,627 --> 00:27:59,427
I can't interfere in state affairs
just to save my brother.

301
00:27:59,906 --> 00:28:01,906
His crime is too grave.

302
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,707
Our Hwangju elders agree with me.

303
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:08,827
Don't keep your hopes high.

304
00:28:09,906 --> 00:28:10,907
What?

305
00:28:11,507 --> 00:28:14,827
This is a matter of life or death
for your own brother!

306
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:19,787
Now I am the Empress.

307
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,507
I do value my family and brother.

308
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:26,027
But look at the big picture.

309
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,947
Let go of me, mother.

310
00:29:16,987 --> 00:29:18,907
Forgive brother Uk.

311
00:29:20,906 --> 00:29:22,787
He must have been framed.

312
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:24,787
Spare him.

313
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:31,867
Your highness!

314
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,906
You shouldn't kneel down.

315
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,906
It might impair your walking.
Stand up.

316
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:44,787
You promised
you wouldn't hurt your brothers.

317
00:29:45,906 --> 00:29:46,987
Don't do this.

318
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:50,347
I know you care for my brothers.

319
00:29:51,507 --> 00:29:54,507
But kneeling down for him...

320
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:56,827
I don't like it.

321
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,627
- Stand up.
- You killed...

322
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:05,906
the hawk.

323
00:30:08,187 --> 00:30:11,747
You killed the hawk
in order to corner Uk.

324
00:30:23,267 --> 00:30:24,427
Why?

325
00:30:25,627 --> 00:30:26,906
Can't I?

326
00:30:29,387 --> 00:30:33,387
Uk killed big brother and Eun.
He also drove out Baeka.

327
00:30:34,147 --> 00:30:37,747
He tried to kill me.
He played us against each other.

328
00:30:37,827 --> 00:30:41,747
If you go on like this,
it'll all come back as karma.

329
00:30:42,906 --> 00:30:48,147
Doling out extreme punishment
will make everyone your enemy.

330
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:55,067
I don't want future generations
to remember you as...

331
00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:57,547
the 'Monarch of Blood'.

332
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:02,747
All right.
I'll let him live.

333
00:31:05,707 --> 00:31:08,307
But I will sentence Uk to exile.

334
00:31:09,507 --> 00:31:13,307
He will be confined to his house.
He won't be able to take a step out.

335
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,267
He desired Goryeo.

336
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:20,907
But his world will only be his house.

337
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:26,387
He will suffocate and rot.

338
00:31:38,347 --> 00:31:39,347
Well...

339
00:31:40,747 --> 00:31:42,787
Instead of just killing him off...

340
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:45,947
I guess it fits him better to rot.

341
00:32:46,307 --> 00:32:48,187
Playing with flowers?

342
00:32:48,827 --> 00:32:50,547
Pathetic.

343
00:32:58,147 --> 00:33:00,387
I heard about Uk.

344
00:33:01,987 --> 00:33:06,107
I'm sure you must feel bad for him.

345
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:11,906
Since we were young,
he always let me do whatever I wanted.

346
00:33:13,947 --> 00:33:17,987
I was worried if I was the one
who put him in this position.

347
00:33:19,147 --> 00:33:20,867
I urged him to be Emperor.

348
00:33:21,906 --> 00:33:24,307
To own this palace together.

349
00:33:25,107 --> 00:33:27,267
I kept pressing him.

350
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:32,507
But you know what?

351
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:36,387
I wasn't the one
who essentially changed him.

352
00:33:39,627 --> 00:33:40,827
It was you.

353
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,947
- Excuse me?
- He told me.

354
00:33:45,906 --> 00:33:48,387
You told him to be
cautious of 4th Prince.

355
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:52,147
To get out of Wang So's way,
or else he might get killed.

356
00:33:56,906 --> 00:33:57,906
Because...

357
00:33:59,627 --> 00:34:03,107
Because I told Uk to
look out for 4th Prince?

358
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:05,107
Ever since he heard that,

359
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:08,027
he believed 4th Prince
would become Emperor.

360
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:11,467
And because he loved you...

361
00:34:12,027 --> 00:34:15,747
he couldn't bear the fact that
you admitted another man as Emperor.

362
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:21,267
Yes, I did press my brother.

363
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,907
But you put in the finishing blow.

364
00:34:27,227 --> 00:34:29,187
It all started with you.

365
00:34:31,147 --> 00:34:36,467
The reason I wanted to be Emperor,
even if I had to kill my brothers, was...

366
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:39,907
because you...

367
00:34:41,906 --> 00:34:45,267
You cleaned up So's scar
and let him take my place.

368
00:34:47,107 --> 00:34:49,587
He took my place...

369
00:34:51,107 --> 00:34:52,906
Watch out for Prince Wang So.

370
00:34:52,987 --> 00:34:56,867
Avoid him.
Don't ever get in is way, or else...

371
00:34:58,747 --> 00:35:00,387
Or else everyone dies.

372
00:35:10,147 --> 00:35:11,906
All my fault?

373
00:35:12,427 --> 00:35:14,947
If you hadn't warm him about 4th Prince,

374
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:19,547
if you hadn't told him
4th Prince was going to be Emperor...

375
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,906
My brother wouldn't have changed
to the point that he is now.

376
00:35:27,187 --> 00:35:28,906
You brought everyone down.

377
00:35:30,147 --> 00:35:32,667
And you have the audacity to live?

378
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:53,906
- It's my favorite, Su.
- Mine is Ujeon tea.

379
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:58,987
All because of me?

380
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:41,667
Draw it correctly.

381
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:45,627
So when someone sees it
they feel like they saw me.

382
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:48,227
Isn't this for the museum?

383
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,187
Since you're not on the throne

384
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:53,627
people won't be able to tell
if you're a prince or the Emperor.

385
00:36:53,747 --> 00:36:56,906
I'm still young.
This isn't a portrait for when I'm dead.

386
00:37:01,307 --> 00:37:02,827
It's a gift.

387
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,947
No.
You can't come in.

388
00:37:17,906 --> 00:37:19,307
Greetings to the Emperor.

389
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:25,067
You broke exile again.

390
00:37:25,906 --> 00:37:28,267
Do you really want to die?

391
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:31,787
I needed to ask a favor, Emperor.

392
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:35,787
If I told you beforehand
I thought you'd stop me.

393
00:37:38,707 --> 00:37:40,587
Former Emperor's orders.

394
00:37:53,906 --> 00:37:58,347
I permit the marriage of
Prince Jeong and court lady Haesu.

395
00:38:04,906 --> 00:38:05,907
It's fake.

396
00:38:07,906 --> 00:38:09,147
Fabricated.

397
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:17,667
You succeeded the throne
without a proper will.

398
00:38:17,906 --> 00:38:20,507
Is that why you're neglecting
an official order?

399
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:25,267
Compare this order
with his other writings.

400
00:38:25,627 --> 00:38:28,347
It's exactly the same.

401
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:32,187
Even if it's a real order
I disapprove the content.

402
00:38:34,227 --> 00:38:35,906
You can't marry Haesu.

403
00:38:36,027 --> 00:38:39,906
It was approved by our former Emperor,
I have every right to.

404
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:42,667
Everyone knows my relationship with Haesu.

405
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:45,906
But marry you?

406
00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:49,467
Stop this nonsense.

407
00:38:49,547 --> 00:38:52,906
Haesu isn't an Empress
nor a concubine.

408
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:54,627
Not even your wife.

409
00:38:54,906 --> 00:38:58,906
There is no reason for us
to not get married.

410
00:38:59,906 --> 00:39:03,467
The lieges are already all informed.

411
00:39:04,627 --> 00:39:07,187
They all wait for your approval.

412
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:12,347
Jimong.

413
00:39:15,627 --> 00:39:17,227
Punish Wang Jeong for...

414
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:19,907
- Abandoning...
- Haesu wants this.

415
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:24,667
What?

416
00:39:25,627 --> 00:39:26,906
Check with her.

417
00:39:27,906 --> 00:39:28,906
Haesu

418
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:31,147
wants to

419
00:39:31,987 --> 00:39:33,347
marry me.

420
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:45,067
Need more honey.

421
00:39:46,507 --> 00:39:48,867
That's why it's easily crumbled.

422
00:39:49,907 --> 00:39:51,987
Use flower aroma for the ladies

423
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:56,347
and grass or peppermint aroma
for the princes and Emperor.

424
00:39:56,507 --> 00:39:57,507
Yes, miss.

425
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:06,107
Jeong wants to...

426
00:40:08,427 --> 00:40:09,867
marry you.

427
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:14,787
He had an official order
from the former Emperor.

428
00:40:15,187 --> 00:40:16,467
Did you know?

429
00:40:18,907 --> 00:40:22,067
When was that order issued?

430
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:23,627
September, year of Musin.

431
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,427
That's when Jeong came back
victorious against Kitan.

432
00:40:32,107 --> 00:40:35,547
Jeong said you wanted to
marry him too, but...

433
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,427
I know it's a lie.

434
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:41,707
- I can nullify the order and...
- I want it.

435
00:40:47,387 --> 00:40:49,906
Disobeying an order is a grave crime.

436
00:40:50,507 --> 00:40:53,027
If I do disobey,
someone will find out.

437
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:56,147
They will try to dethrone you.

438
00:41:00,987 --> 00:41:05,906
When we were apart,
I used to always miss you.

439
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:10,067
My heart ached thinking about you.

440
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:12,906
But now...

441
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:17,227
We see and laugh with each other
everyday...

442
00:41:18,906 --> 00:41:20,267
But I'm scared.

443
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:23,906
Sometimes I hate you.

444
00:41:25,227 --> 00:41:26,387
Hate?

445
00:41:26,827 --> 00:41:31,906
If we keep on like this,
one day only hatred will be left.

446
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:37,906
I don't want that to happen.
I'd rather leave you now.

447
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:41,906
Never.

448
00:42:15,227 --> 00:42:18,906
People suspect your legitimacy.
You can't ignore the order.

449
00:42:21,787 --> 00:42:24,667
You made me abandon
my family and brother.

450
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:28,787
Why can't you let Haesu go?

451
00:42:28,907 --> 00:42:30,067
Yeah.

452
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,427
I can't let Haesu go.

453
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:40,827
I'll see how long you can hold on to her.

454
00:42:43,107 --> 00:42:45,547
Maybe you can throw away the throne.

455
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:48,427
But I can't.

456
00:43:07,987 --> 00:43:11,587
THOUGH THEY SAY THE SUN IS NAUGHT,
TO ME THE SUN IS AGLOW.

457
00:43:21,427 --> 00:43:23,067
Stand up now.

458
00:43:23,906 --> 00:43:27,507
The Emperor promised to let you live.

459
00:43:30,987 --> 00:43:34,707
You might get yourself into trouble.

460
00:43:37,987 --> 00:43:39,387
Look at me.

461
00:43:41,187 --> 00:43:43,347
I know you don't have any affection left.

462
00:43:45,147 --> 00:43:48,906
I would have done this
for any of the princes.

463
00:43:50,107 --> 00:43:51,827
The Emperor understands.

464
00:44:01,547 --> 00:44:03,027
Let it go.

465
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:08,906
The throne or your love...
if you don't leave the palace,

466
00:44:09,906 --> 00:44:12,547
no one can escape the pain.

467
00:44:13,187 --> 00:44:14,507
You have to...

468
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:18,147
let it go.

469
00:44:24,147 --> 00:44:30,187
You turn your back to me,
you step away.

470
00:44:30,427 --> 00:44:36,906
Tears I held back start to flow.

471
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:45,027
Like the flower petals falling.

472
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:52,787
My poor love,
is this the end?

473
00:44:53,587 --> 00:45:00,547
When the day we meet again comes

474
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:06,227
Let's not split up again.

475
00:45:06,627 --> 00:45:11,787
My love.

476
00:45:17,627 --> 00:45:20,787
Brother, I need your help.

477
00:45:37,547 --> 00:45:39,747
So you have an earnest request?

478
00:45:41,067 --> 00:45:44,906
I brought you in
only because the Empress begged me.

479
00:45:45,906 --> 00:45:48,906
Empress, can you leave us alone?

480
00:45:50,787 --> 00:45:51,947
Brother...

481
00:46:00,267 --> 00:46:02,467
I respectfully plead...

482
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:07,267
Please listen carefully to
what my brother has to say.

483
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,107
I...

484
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,907
I have a confession to make about Haesu.

485
00:46:31,307 --> 00:46:32,307
Haesu?

486
00:46:32,427 --> 00:46:36,867
It seems like you
still don't know something.

487
00:46:37,307 --> 00:46:38,906
So I will reveal it.

488
00:46:41,547 --> 00:46:42,906
We...

489
00:46:46,107 --> 00:46:48,187
pledged to marriage.

490
00:46:53,787 --> 00:46:57,906
Do you really want to die?

491
00:46:58,027 --> 00:47:00,587
Long before she was your lady...

492
00:47:04,267 --> 00:47:05,347
Su...

493
00:47:07,707 --> 00:47:09,427
was mine.

494
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:29,707
I found out why you were
that worried about Uk.

495
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,906
Why you knelt to save him.

496
00:47:36,907 --> 00:47:38,067
Now I know.

497
00:47:42,387 --> 00:47:44,627
The bracelet you always had on...

498
00:47:45,307 --> 00:47:47,467
The secret meetings at the cave...

499
00:47:49,107 --> 00:47:50,707
Is it true?

500
00:47:52,187 --> 00:47:56,707
Did you really try to marry Uk?

501
00:47:59,987 --> 00:48:01,147
Yes.

502
00:48:03,587 --> 00:48:05,906
The one you said you loved...

503
00:48:07,787 --> 00:48:09,147
Was it Uk?

504
00:48:12,907 --> 00:48:14,587
Yes, it was.

505
00:48:20,867 --> 00:48:22,907
You won't hurt him, will you?

506
00:48:23,307 --> 00:48:26,707
Worried for Uk?
Because you're relatives?

507
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:29,906
- I have somebody else in my heart.
- Baeka?

508
00:48:30,627 --> 00:48:32,387
No, not Baeka...

509
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:33,707
I will bring her back.

510
00:48:33,787 --> 00:48:37,587
If others see you two returning,
they will start unwanted gossip.

511
00:48:37,906 --> 00:48:38,906
Su.

512
00:48:42,347 --> 00:48:45,787
There is nothing that's yours here.

513
00:48:46,267 --> 00:48:48,906
Yeonhwa, Haesu,
everyone...

514
00:48:49,987 --> 00:48:51,507
is under my wing.

515
00:48:52,427 --> 00:48:56,387
You promised
you wouldn't hurt your brothers.

516
00:48:59,067 --> 00:49:00,867
Tell me it's a lie.

517
00:49:01,427 --> 00:49:05,667
That it's all a misunderstanding.
That Uk is just playing us!

518
00:49:07,707 --> 00:49:09,707
Then we can go back.

519
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:12,027
We...

520
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:17,907
We promised not to lie to each other.

521
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:20,307
How can you do this to me?

522
00:49:21,627 --> 00:49:23,667
How can you hurt me like this?

523
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,587
And with Uk!

524
00:49:34,906 --> 00:49:37,307
You always loved Uk.

525
00:49:37,906 --> 00:49:38,987
Your highness...

526
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:41,906
Don't touch me.

527
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:45,987
From now on...

528
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,587
I will never see you again.

529
00:50:19,067 --> 00:50:24,467
Are you listening to my voice?

530
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:28,107
I'm saying I love you.

531
00:50:29,107 --> 00:50:31,587
Are you listening to me?

532
00:50:31,707 --> 00:50:35,547
Can you hear my heart?

533
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:41,507
Like the rain on the window.

534
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:47,987
You are soaking up my mind.

535
00:51:21,147 --> 00:51:23,787
You can't leave her again.

536
00:51:25,387 --> 00:51:28,906
I know you have to give up a lot
to be where you are.

537
00:51:29,267 --> 00:51:33,267
But if you let her go like this,
you will lose yourself.

538
00:51:36,907 --> 00:51:38,627
I didn't leave her.

539
00:51:41,906 --> 00:51:43,587
JEONGGWANJEONGYO

540
00:51:47,906 --> 00:51:48,907
Su...

541
00:51:50,947 --> 00:51:52,387
left me.

542
00:52:00,187 --> 00:52:01,747
Bring it.

543
00:52:07,067 --> 00:52:10,667
We first bonded with drinks.
So here's one for farewell.

544
00:52:11,387 --> 00:52:12,867
Only one?

545
00:52:14,906 --> 00:52:17,147
If I knew Jeong possessed the order,

546
00:52:17,547 --> 00:52:19,906
I wouldn't have
easily decided to help you.

547
00:52:20,227 --> 00:52:21,906
I didn't know either.

548
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,987
He just told me he had a way out.

549
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:28,387
I know you don't want to marry him.

550
00:52:29,427 --> 00:52:30,907
It isn't too late.

551
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:33,107
Yes, I don't want a marriage.

552
00:52:33,906 --> 00:52:36,307
But, if that's my only way out...

553
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:38,906
I'm okay with it.

554
00:52:41,267 --> 00:52:43,906
I was lucky to have you as a friend.

555
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:47,867
A precious relationship
our dear sister left us.

556
00:52:48,867 --> 00:52:50,427
Same here.

557
00:52:59,627 --> 00:53:01,307
Take care of yourself.

558
00:53:01,947 --> 00:53:04,027
I know you miss her.

559
00:53:06,906 --> 00:53:10,947
I really wished you two worked out.

560
00:53:11,227 --> 00:53:14,507
There's too much blood shed between us.

561
00:53:15,387 --> 00:53:17,747
I thought I could prevent it.

562
00:53:19,347 --> 00:53:20,587
I was wrong.

563
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:25,906
I'm not sure if I can take it any more.

564
00:53:25,987 --> 00:53:30,267
I guess I don't know the deep chasm
between you two.

565
00:53:44,147 --> 00:53:45,467
Go back.

566
00:53:46,906 --> 00:53:49,987
If you stay, I'll have to act.

567
00:53:50,906 --> 00:53:53,267
- Where were the guards?
- Baeka.

568
00:54:29,787 --> 00:54:30,947
Thank you.

569
00:54:33,347 --> 00:54:35,707
I wasn't that willing either.

570
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:38,507
If you didn't know my desire to leave,

571
00:54:38,906 --> 00:54:42,867
I know you wouldn't have ever said that.

572
00:54:44,747 --> 00:54:45,747
Jeong...

573
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:49,107
will treat you well.

574
00:54:51,907 --> 00:54:52,907
Please.

575
00:54:54,027 --> 00:54:55,906
Take care of yourself.

576
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,427
Now that you are leaving...

577
00:55:00,906 --> 00:55:02,707
sever all ties.

578
00:55:06,467 --> 00:55:08,267
Erase the past.

579
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:13,307
Focus on your...

580
00:55:15,906 --> 00:55:17,067
future.

581
00:55:39,787 --> 00:55:40,867
Su.

582
00:55:46,906 --> 00:55:50,387
I know you know how I feel.

583
00:55:52,587 --> 00:55:56,147
If you know, you can understand.
And if you understand...

584
00:55:58,906 --> 00:56:00,667
no need to be sad.

585
00:56:21,147 --> 00:56:22,387
Go now.

586
00:56:40,347 --> 00:56:41,827
Forget us.

587
00:56:44,906 --> 00:56:46,107
Forget everything.

588
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:51,267
This life...

589
00:56:56,627 --> 00:56:57,906
is over.

590
00:57:05,307 --> 00:57:11,667
Your eyes look at me

591
00:57:12,587 --> 00:57:16,467
Like it knows what's in my mind

592
00:57:18,307 --> 00:57:25,227
Though we want to part ways,
our memories connect us.

593
00:57:26,387 --> 00:57:30,947
Even when we are in different spaces.

594
00:57:32,947 --> 00:57:38,827
It hurts to love you.

595
00:57:39,187 --> 00:57:45,906
It's sad I can't empty my heart.

596
00:57:53,507 --> 00:57:58,507
If I didn't meet you,
I wouldn't miss you this much.

597
00:58:00,667 --> 00:58:05,867
If I didn't know you,
I wouldn't think about you this much.

598
00:58:06,347 --> 00:58:10,387
If we weren't together,
I wouldn't need to disappear.

599
00:58:10,547 --> 00:58:14,667
If I didn't care for you,
I wouldn't need to remember you.

600
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:18,787
If we didn't love each other...

601
00:58:20,027 --> 00:58:22,827
We wouldn't need to leave each other.

602
00:58:24,747 --> 00:58:26,906
If we didn't see each other...

603
00:58:28,747 --> 00:58:31,227
We wouldn't have to be with each other.

604
00:58:33,867 --> 00:58:34,907
Only if...

605
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:39,906
I'd never met you...

606
00:58:43,906 --> 00:58:50,267
I can love you.

607
00:58:55,787 --> 00:59:01,587
It hurts to love you.

608
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:08,707
It's sad I can't empty my heart.

609
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:17,107
Please do not forget

610
00:59:18,387 --> 00:59:22,906
My love never stops.
