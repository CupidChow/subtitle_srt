1
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,902
SCARLET HEART

2
00:00:11,102 --> 00:00:13,262
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS

3
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:22,702
Let Su go.

4
00:00:23,462 --> 00:00:24,622
Now!

5
00:00:24,862 --> 00:00:29,742
A wolf looks after only one female.

6
00:00:31,102 --> 00:00:33,142
You are a wolf.

7
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:35,382
Won!

8
00:00:42,422 --> 00:00:43,942
Choose.

9
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:47,062
Is it Haesu or...

10
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:49,302
the dead Emperor?

11
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,702
Greetings to the new Emperor.

12
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:55,302
Hurray.

13
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:57,942
Hurray.

14
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:01,782
Hurray.

15
00:02:24,182 --> 00:02:25,261
Jimong.

16
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:31,862
Empress Yu asked me how happy I was
because of Tae's death.

17
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:35,302
I only miss my brother, that's all.

18
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:37,782
CHOE JIMONG, YOUNG 4TH PRINCE,
JEONGYUN MU

19
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:39,542
Don't mind her words.

20
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:44,261
That dim star on the right of Cassiopeia.

21
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:48,502
That's Prince Tae's main star.

22
00:02:49,662 --> 00:02:52,502
A short life was Tae's fate.

23
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:57,261
Instead of myself
who has a weak maternal background,

24
00:02:57,902 --> 00:03:00,261
Tae would have been a better Jeongyun.

25
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:03,502
Better for the Emperor too.

26
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,662
I told you to stop that.

27
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:09,542
You have the Emperor's star Leo with you.

28
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:12,261
- Really?
- For sure.

29
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,622
But...

30
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:23,822
Keep talking.
What is it?

31
00:03:24,262 --> 00:03:25,982
You know...
Mu.

32
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:28,062
It's...

33
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:34,782
What if your days as Emperor are...

34
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:37,261
not that long?

35
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:42,302
Length doesn't matter.

36
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:47,062
What matters is
who stands by me to the end.

37
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:54,182
Brother.

38
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:58,261
I want to be Emperor, too.

39
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,662
Oh, you will.

40
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:04,261
Prince Wang So,
you have Leo with you as well.

41
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:05,982
Really, Jimong?

42
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:09,022
Does that mean
I'm going to be Emperor?

43
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:12,262
Yay!
I'm going to be Emperor.

44
00:04:13,142 --> 00:04:16,622
You.
Show respect.

45
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:20,662
Yes, Your Highness.
We are forever in your debt.

46
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:49,262
He's our Emperor.

47
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:53,261
He is...

48
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,422
Emperor of our great nation, Goryeo.

49
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:03,262
Are you going to leave him like this?

50
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:21,462
Brother.

51
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:25,822
Forget everything.

52
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:30,182
And rest in peace.

53
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:53,702
Because of me...

54
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,262
this happened...

55
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,822
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,662
So I...

57
00:06:19,582 --> 00:06:21,262
Where are you headed, brother?

58
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:24,502
Stand back.

59
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:27,462
Word from the new Emperor.

60
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:31,462
If Haesu tries to leave or
disappear from Damiwon,

61
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:35,982
he will issue a nationwide statement
that Haesu poisoned the Emperor.

62
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:39,822
Everyone will turn their back on her.

63
00:06:48,782 --> 00:06:51,182
10TH PRINCE EUN'S
PRIVATE RESIDENCE

64
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:08,342
MINISTER WANG GYU
EUN'S GRANDFATHER

65
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:09,702
You bastard!

66
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:14,622
We found Wang Gyu,
but 10th Prince and wife are gone.

67
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,261
MINISTER WANG SIKRYEOM

68
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:20,261
We need to find them.

69
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:23,942
- Search again. Now!
- Yes, sir.

70
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:34,261
Let go.
Let me go!

71
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:37,261
The Emperor is mistaken.

72
00:07:37,302 --> 00:07:39,742
Let me see the Emperor.

73
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:43,582
Your highness!
Your highness!

74
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:45,862
Your highness!

75
00:07:47,102 --> 00:07:49,662
Park Sulhui will be taken care of
on his way to exile.

76
00:07:50,022 --> 00:07:53,422
I will make it that Wang Gyu
kills him during the revolt.

77
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:55,142
Good work.

78
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:57,982
Taking care of Brother Mu...

79
00:07:58,261 --> 00:08:01,502
and your advice to use
Haesu to tame So.

80
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:04,422
I'm glad you're on my side.

81
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:10,902
Thank you, Uncle.
You helped Uk come under my wing.

82
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,502
Greet the Emperor.

83
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:36,982
Greetings to the Emperor.

84
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:39,822
Hurray. Hurray.
Hurray.

85
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:20,382
Eun and his wife escaped.

86
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:23,262
To make Wang Gyu's revolt look real

87
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:27,222
we need to find Eun and kill him.

88
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,261
Don't worry.

89
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:35,382
You have a dog
that is good at killing royals.

90
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:54,182
Please spare my grandson
Eun's life!

91
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:10,382
I knew this day would come.

92
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:15,382
You were perfect
from the day you were born.

93
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:18,342
I knew you would make me proud.

94
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:20,622
My Emperor.

95
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:22,261
3RD EMPEROR
JEONGJONG

96
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,261
Congratulations.
Empress Dowager.

97
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:28,982
Get rid of the other princes
as soon as you can.

98
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:32,142
To fortify your throne.
And...

99
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:34,462
Let me deal with the politics.

100
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:36,942
Goryeo is now ours.

101
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:41,462
Mother, you should enjoy
the pretty things in life.

102
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:45,022
Yo.

103
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:48,182
Welcome.

104
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:58,182
Show respect.

105
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:01,142
Don't be too harsh.

106
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:05,822
He's the reason I'm still alive.

107
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:11,261
You...

108
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:14,261
Your aim was off.

109
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:18,462
You deliberately loosened your grip.

110
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:32,262
If you have any regrets
I can finish it off...

111
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:34,662
You...

112
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:41,142
Minister Wang Gyu revolted
trying to make Eun the Emperor.

113
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:42,702
He was executed.

114
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:45,542
Find him.

115
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:50,422
Once you do,
kill him on the spot.

116
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:52,942
Was the former Emperor not enough?

117
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:56,982
I won't do it.

118
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:58,982
You won't?

119
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:03,862
You will.

120
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,702
If you want Baeka, Choe Jimong...

121
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:11,942
oh, and even Haesu...

122
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:15,702
I mean your people...

123
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,742
If you want them alive.

124
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:25,582
Weren't you the dog
that was good at killing your brothers?

125
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,261
I told you to stay away from him.

126
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:47,422
- Kill him.
- I like taming him.

127
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:54,862
Dare pity me?

128
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,782
Aim off?

129
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:00,582
Arrogant bastard.

130
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:08,622
What? You...

131
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:15,262
Minister Wang Gyu and the Empresses
were all executed.

132
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:24,261
The Emperor ordered me
to pursue Eun and his wife.

133
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:29,142
Of course...

134
00:13:30,222 --> 00:13:32,261
You won't kill them?

135
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:43,022
Listen to me carefully, Prince.

136
00:13:44,062 --> 00:13:50,502
Yes, I rode horses together
with the founding father.

137
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:55,542
Yes, we fought together, risked our lives.
I was his loyal servant.

138
00:13:58,422 --> 00:13:59,942
But this is wrong.

139
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:04,662
Don't touch my daughter.

140
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:09,542
This is your family battle.
If my daughter gets involved...

141
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:12,182
I won't just watch.

142
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:27,942
Only we served the Emperor.

143
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:31,422
From filling water to
soaking the herb pouches.

144
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:34,502
No one else is involved.

145
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:38,261
- But mercury?
- It wasn't me.

146
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:40,502
Really.

147
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:44,142
Why would I suspect you?

148
00:14:45,982 --> 00:14:47,582
You should be careful.

149
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:50,261
3rd Prince is a scary man.

150
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:53,261
10th Prince's family
was charged with treason.

151
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:56,261
Starting with the Empresses,
the whole family...

152
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,902
- ...was executed.
- What?

153
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:05,062
The prince...
What about 10th Prince?

154
00:15:08,261 --> 00:15:12,261
I'm taking off for a while.
I'm worried to leave you alone.

155
00:15:12,702 --> 00:15:14,662
Where to?

156
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:19,102
The Emperor wants me to chase
someone who committed treason.

157
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:23,261
Then 4th Prince is going after...

158
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:33,662
Miss.
Miss?

159
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:53,261
Su, it's me.

160
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,062
The new Emperor won't
suspect this place.

161
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:17,182
Our prince said we can trust you
but...

162
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:20,261
If you do anything fishy,

163
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,702
I'll kill you.

164
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:24,422
Stop it.

165
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:29,742
Anyway, don't worry too much, Su.

166
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,302
We have a boat ready.
We won't be here for long.

167
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,622
Where are you going?

168
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:37,622
- Uh...
- That's enough.

169
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:42,182
None of your business.
Just make sure we're safe.

170
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:44,142
Don't tell anyone.

171
00:16:44,662 --> 00:16:47,782
Okay.
I will be very careful.

172
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:52,982
Don't you think it'll be better
to get help from my brothers?

173
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:56,062
Like brother Uk.

174
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:57,902
Baeka or Jeong.

175
00:16:58,022 --> 00:17:00,502
I'm sure they'll help.

176
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:04,662
- I mean brother So would also...
- No!

177
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,822
Actually...

178
00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:13,942
4th Prince.

179
00:17:14,862 --> 00:17:16,742
He's looking for you two.

180
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:22,902
We're all by ourselves.
We can't risk leaking our whereabouts.

181
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:26,182
One mistake and we're dead.

182
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,142
Okay. Got it.

183
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:32,302
Oh, Su.

184
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:37,062
Do you know
how my mother and aunts are?

185
00:17:39,502 --> 00:17:41,062
Not really.

186
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:44,782
Outside news is cut off here.

187
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:49,942
Escaping by ourselves weighs on me.

188
00:17:50,662 --> 00:17:53,261
I hope they are safe.

189
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:09,261
Grant the rights to cultivate
the southern Gongju fields

190
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:12,382
for 3 years without taxing,
to the Hubaekje refugees.

191
00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:13,582
3RD EMPEROR
JEONGJONG

192
00:18:13,702 --> 00:18:17,062
Pardon the refugee slaves
and reinstate them as civilians.

193
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:20,261
And let them cultivate the fields.

194
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:25,062
I thought you were just a geisha
taking revenge for your parents.

195
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:28,622
But you were Hubaekje's representative.

196
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:32,142
Father-in-law.
Quite a secret you were hiding.

197
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:37,302
I didn't want to worry you,
Your Highness.

198
00:18:38,902 --> 00:18:41,502
You attempted the Emperor's assassination.

199
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:44,261
Why should I deal with you?

200
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:49,382
My people are starving.
I have no more need for revenge.

201
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:52,982
Grant us a way to live.

202
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:57,261
Then all of us Hubaekje refugees
will recognize you as our Emperor.

203
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:00,702
And show loyalty.

204
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:09,261
Fair enough.

205
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:11,261
But...

206
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:16,742
I keep thinking I'm getting
the short end of the stick.

207
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:22,502
I have a proposal.

208
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:36,261
I heard that dog, 4th Prince,
is going to kill his little brother.

209
00:19:37,662 --> 00:19:40,342
Shut up!
You'll get arrested.

210
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:45,261
10th Prince is just a playful kid.
He couldn't have committed treason.

211
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:49,942
4th Prince made it all up.
He's being the Emperor's dog.

212
00:19:50,142 --> 00:19:53,222
- Don't be naive.
- Shut up and drink.

213
00:19:57,102 --> 00:20:00,262
We found the boat.
They take off in 5 days.

214
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:03,502
- Destination?
- It's...

215
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:07,902
They prepared four boats
all heading somewhere else.

216
00:20:08,382 --> 00:20:10,342
We don't know which one they'll take.

217
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,822
You're not...

218
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:18,542
really going to bring Eun in, are you?

219
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:22,822
You don't trust me.

220
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:24,862
I don't trust 3rd brother.

221
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:28,822
He's a manipulator.
And now he's the Emperor.

222
00:20:29,742 --> 00:20:31,342
I'm worried about our future.

223
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:34,262
Find out if Eun
made contact with anyone.

224
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:36,662
Like Jeong.

225
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,622
Brother Uk is just being an observer.

226
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:42,022
Probably because of his history.

227
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:46,582
Who knew 3rd brother
would come back alive?

228
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,862
Uhui.

229
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,261
It's been a while.

230
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:02,702
Baeka told me you were back.

231
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,222
Haesu will be happy to see you.

232
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:07,261
I'll see her soon.

233
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:10,422
I'm reentering the geisha school.

234
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:12,662
What?

235
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:16,742
- You didn't tell me.
- I'm already too indebted to you.

236
00:21:16,982 --> 00:21:20,422
Not as a geisha.
I'm going to teach dancing.

237
00:21:20,742 --> 00:21:22,261
Don't worry too much.

238
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,342
Where are you heading this late?

239
00:21:40,261 --> 00:21:43,782
- None of your business.
- I'm guessing...

240
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:47,261
You're secretly helping the Emperor.

241
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:50,622
Are you going to see him?

242
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:55,261
What a wild guess.

243
00:21:55,422 --> 00:22:00,382
The dead Emperor was slowly poisoned
with mercury over two years.

244
00:22:00,982 --> 00:22:04,622
First, I thought it was 9th Prince Won.

245
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:07,942
But it was too elaborate and persistent.

246
00:22:08,622 --> 00:22:10,942
Doesn't fit his character.

247
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:14,182
But it fits yours.

248
00:22:18,022 --> 00:22:20,142
It's strange that you're left alone.

249
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:25,261
3rd brother has every reason
to cut you into pieces.

250
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:30,302
Planning to go down hard on 10th Prince
to gain control over Songak's nobles.

251
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:37,542
I'm pretty sure that plan came from
a smart person like you.

252
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:41,982
You've always suspected me.

253
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:52,261
You.

254
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:56,261
Did you really poison our brother?

255
00:22:57,262 --> 00:22:58,702
You.

256
00:22:59,902 --> 00:23:04,622
Are you really going to be a dog
and kill our brother Eun?

257
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:12,902
We are both trying to survive.

258
00:23:14,062 --> 00:23:18,822
That's the fate of a prince
who is not the Emperor.

259
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:24,662
To survive...
you should obey.

260
00:23:25,302 --> 00:23:28,142
I don't understand why you've changed.

261
00:23:30,261 --> 00:23:32,982
I did not...

262
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:35,742
poison our brother.

263
00:23:38,822 --> 00:23:40,702
Did it answer your question?

264
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:17,142
Why did you pour mercury
into the bathing water?

265
00:24:20,261 --> 00:24:21,622
I did not.

266
00:24:23,302 --> 00:24:25,622
I wonder if torture
will help you answer.

267
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:27,342
Then...

268
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:31,342
I will say you ordered me.

269
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:34,862
That you made me do it
so you can be Emperor.

270
00:24:36,782 --> 00:24:38,742
That's my answer.
Even if I die.

271
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:42,261
How daring.

272
00:24:42,942 --> 00:24:45,942
I guess you were always like this.

273
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:48,262
I like it.

274
00:24:50,261 --> 00:24:52,142
I'll leave you alone.

275
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:56,261
You're very useful for
making my brothers obey me.

276
00:24:57,302 --> 00:24:58,662
Then...

277
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:03,782
Tell me who really did it.

278
00:25:04,422 --> 00:25:07,622
What makes you think I know?

279
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:10,982
I can't do anything anyway.

280
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:15,742
Once you blame it on me
I have no way out.

281
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:19,102
I'm just curious.

282
00:25:22,902 --> 00:25:24,142
Who did it?

283
00:25:29,902 --> 00:25:33,142
Your highness!
8th Prince is here.

284
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:36,702
Look at this.
Just in time.

285
00:25:38,261 --> 00:25:39,382
Excuse me?

286
00:25:58,302 --> 00:25:59,982
Greetings to the Emperor.

287
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,261
We had a question for you.

288
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:07,462
Haesu is dying of curiosity.

289
00:26:08,261 --> 00:26:12,862
She wants to know who poured mercury
into our brother's bathing water.

290
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:26,582
I thought he died of illness.
Is that not so?

291
00:26:28,142 --> 00:26:29,462
Oh, that's right.

292
00:26:30,261 --> 00:26:32,342
Yes, he died of illness.

293
00:26:56,622 --> 00:26:59,542
I heard you were there
when he died.

294
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:02,622
Must have been hard.

295
00:27:02,902 --> 00:27:05,622
He was like a brother to me.

296
00:27:06,342 --> 00:27:10,261
He died in the worst possible way.
I wonder...

297
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:15,422
...who did it.

298
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:22,462
You...

299
00:27:24,862 --> 00:27:27,182
You're not involved, are you?

300
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:36,262
The only way to protect our family
was to become a traitor.

301
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:41,022
If you wanted a noble life
you shouldn't have burdened me!

302
00:27:41,622 --> 00:27:43,261
Is it because of Haesu?

303
00:27:44,502 --> 00:27:48,942
I'm asking if she was a factor
in your decision.

304
00:27:53,822 --> 00:27:54,822
Yes.

305
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:57,261
She was.

306
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:00,782
It was for her.

307
00:28:02,102 --> 00:28:05,261
My life has been burdened
by my family and its responsibilities.

308
00:28:06,462 --> 00:28:10,261
Haesu was the only desire
that I truly had.

309
00:28:12,662 --> 00:28:13,982
And I lost her.

310
00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:19,102
Where did it go wrong?

311
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:22,942
Su told me...

312
00:28:24,261 --> 00:28:27,942
I was wrong trying to have everything.

313
00:28:32,742 --> 00:28:35,662
What's wrong with protecting my family
and having her?

314
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:40,502
You taught me to live straight and I did.
But...

315
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:45,342
Why am I still lonely?

316
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:53,261
Uk, why didn't you tell me before?

317
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,742
It's not too late.

318
00:28:56,942 --> 00:28:59,261
- Stop the revolt.
- No.

319
00:28:59,702 --> 00:29:01,862
I already chose my path.

320
00:29:03,662 --> 00:29:06,142
This path will lead me to what I want.

321
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:10,502
This time I will have everything.

322
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:25,261
I have done nothing wrong.

323
00:29:41,262 --> 00:29:42,302
Su.

324
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:53,902
I heard the Emperor called you.
I was worried.

325
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:57,261
He didn't look like
he was planning to harm me.

326
00:29:59,862 --> 00:30:02,261
Probably said he's going to use you
to make me obey.

327
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,382
It's okay.

328
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:10,902
At least you'll be safe that way.

329
00:30:12,182 --> 00:30:13,261
What...

330
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:18,822
What happened to the person
you were looking for?

331
00:30:23,862 --> 00:30:24,902
Actually...

332
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:29,502
I'm looking for Eun.

333
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:34,902
The Emperor wants him dead, but...

334
00:30:35,622 --> 00:30:37,382
I'll find a way to keep him alive.

335
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:40,261
Of course.

336
00:30:41,782 --> 00:30:45,261
Don't worry.
I'll find him first.

337
00:31:07,902 --> 00:31:09,102
Lady Hae?

338
00:31:09,982 --> 00:31:11,782
I don't know, sir.

339
00:31:15,422 --> 00:31:16,542
Hey you.

340
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:20,422
Have you seen Lady Hae?

341
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:24,702
Stop there.

342
00:31:25,782 --> 00:31:28,502
Show respect to your superior.

343
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,702
I apologize.

344
00:31:39,622 --> 00:31:41,062
Sister-in-law?

345
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:45,462
Right?
Aren't you?

346
00:31:45,742 --> 00:31:47,622
Oh, hey, sister.

347
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:57,261
- We need to sneak out, but...
- Are you joking?

348
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,261
There no gates left.

349
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:01,942
Yeah, all four are heavily guarded.

350
00:32:02,502 --> 00:32:05,062
They've heightened security.

351
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:09,262
He took the throne by force.
He's worried of the opposition.

352
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:12,261
I'm ashamed he's my blood brother.

353
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:14,942
I wish we had those wings
Jimong made.

354
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:19,102
Or maybe an underground tunnel.

355
00:32:21,222 --> 00:32:23,542
A tunnel?
I know one.

356
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,102
There is a way.

357
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:48,222
Su.

358
00:32:52,582 --> 00:32:55,782
I need to say goodbye to my father.

359
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,261
Don't you think Choe Jimong
will help me meet him?

360
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:03,622
Too dangerous.
Jimong is close to 4th Prince.

361
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:09,542
I've noticed before, but...

362
00:33:09,982 --> 00:33:12,542
why don't you trust 4th Prince?

363
00:33:13,261 --> 00:33:15,261
I thought you were close.

364
00:33:16,422 --> 00:33:18,622
I have my reasons.

365
00:33:18,982 --> 00:33:22,702
If it is to help us, I am grateful but...

366
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:26,222
Something is still not right.

367
00:33:26,622 --> 00:33:29,182
4th Prince does have a bad reputation.

368
00:33:29,262 --> 00:33:31,942
But he wouldn't pursue us for no reason.

369
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:37,261
If you didn't witness it firsthand
shouldn't you trust the person you like?

370
00:33:40,782 --> 00:33:42,261
Yes.

371
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,902
You are right.

372
00:33:46,822 --> 00:33:50,342
I was a fool.
I didn't witness anything.

373
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:55,062
I will go meet the astrologer.

374
00:34:01,182 --> 00:34:07,502
Look into my mind, feel my heart

375
00:34:09,942 --> 00:34:11,302
Astrologer.

376
00:34:16,902 --> 00:34:23,862
I want to give you all I have

377
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:29,622
Please be with me...

378
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:34,342
Forever...

379
00:34:34,582 --> 00:34:36,062
Jimong!

380
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:45,261
10th Prince's main star
is above the palace.

381
00:34:46,182 --> 00:34:49,261
- Search again.
- I already have.

382
00:34:49,382 --> 00:34:51,782
Even searched Damiwon.
Eun wasn't there.

383
00:34:53,262 --> 00:34:55,222
That's strange.

384
00:34:58,261 --> 00:35:00,742
Can I even trust you?

385
00:35:01,622 --> 00:35:04,542
Did you know brother Mu
was going to die like that?

386
00:35:04,662 --> 00:35:07,502
Did you know 3rd brother
was taking the throne?

387
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:14,262
Do you know how it feels to foresee
but not being able to intervene?

388
00:35:14,942 --> 00:35:17,022
It is my divine punishment.

389
00:35:18,062 --> 00:35:21,542
Well, 3rd Prince's outcome
is surprising to me too.

390
00:35:21,822 --> 00:35:25,022
He was born with the traitor's star.

391
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:29,382
A new variable came into play.
Something changed.

392
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:35,102
The variable that made 3rd Prince,
Emperor. I wonder...

393
00:35:36,182 --> 00:35:37,542
What could it be?

394
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:50,782
Watch our for 4th Prince.

395
00:35:52,302 --> 00:35:57,022
Watch out for 4th Prince, Wang So.

396
00:35:59,261 --> 00:36:00,662
Brother.

397
00:36:05,302 --> 00:36:07,261
Haesu told me.

398
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:10,622
Watch out for 4th Prince.

399
00:36:12,062 --> 00:36:14,262
Don't ever get in his way.

400
00:36:16,622 --> 00:36:18,102
She's right.

401
00:36:20,462 --> 00:36:22,462
He takes everything.

402
00:36:24,422 --> 00:36:27,222
However hard I try...

403
00:36:29,261 --> 00:36:31,582
It all becomes So's.

404
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:36,422
Why?

405
00:36:38,422 --> 00:36:40,262
What should I do?

406
00:37:28,782 --> 00:37:31,302
What's with this hairpin?

407
00:37:32,022 --> 00:37:33,302
Nothing.

408
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:37,422
I do need it back.

409
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,261
It isn't brand new.

410
00:37:41,622 --> 00:37:44,261
Is it your lover's?

411
00:37:47,261 --> 00:37:50,261
Who charmed
a devoted martial artist like you?

412
00:37:51,261 --> 00:37:53,462
I'm really curious.

413
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:04,542
She risked her life to save me.

414
00:38:08,822 --> 00:38:11,261
She threw herself to save me.

415
00:38:13,142 --> 00:38:15,502
Move out!
All of you! Get away!

416
00:38:15,742 --> 00:38:18,261
Look away!
Come closer, I'll kill you!

417
00:38:18,582 --> 00:38:20,462
Look away!
I said don't look!

418
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:25,261
Even in the sharp wind.

419
00:38:25,782 --> 00:38:32,102
A small batch of sunlight
makes me smile.

420
00:38:34,742 --> 00:38:37,782
When I first saw her sing...

421
00:38:40,262 --> 00:38:41,702
That's when I knew.

422
00:38:43,102 --> 00:38:46,862
From that moment on,
I wanted her to sing...

423
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:49,022
Only for me.

424
00:38:50,422 --> 00:38:51,902
Does this mean...

425
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:57,102
I like her?

426
00:38:58,942 --> 00:39:00,582
For sure.

427
00:39:00,862 --> 00:39:04,422
I'm an expert in that.

428
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,622
You are?

429
00:39:18,702 --> 00:39:20,822
The day my sister married the Emperor

430
00:39:21,022 --> 00:39:24,222
all of the noble children
played in the palace.

431
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:28,582
Then and now,
I always like fighting more.

432
00:39:28,982 --> 00:39:32,342
I guess I was a peculiar kid
in others' eyes.

433
00:39:32,822 --> 00:39:35,502
I like the battlefield more.

434
00:39:42,342 --> 00:39:44,022
Don't cry.

435
00:39:45,622 --> 00:39:47,982
Don't you like flower rings?

436
00:39:54,902 --> 00:39:56,182
That's strange.

437
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:59,302
Pretty girls usually like flower rings.

438
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:03,462
I'm sure you like it.
Right?

439
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:14,502
Your feelings for someone
should be clear as day.

440
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:16,862
So move forward.

441
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:18,422
I'll cheer you on.

442
00:40:21,062 --> 00:40:23,542
My first love came true.

443
00:40:23,902 --> 00:40:28,182
I'll cheer you on.
I'm sure yours will pan out too.

444
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,261
Fighting!

445
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:43,782
Greeting to the Emperor.

446
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,261
I'm sorry for belatedly stopping by.

447
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,742
Congratulations.

448
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:06,742
I was about to call for you anyway.

449
00:41:07,102 --> 00:41:09,142
To discuss your wedding.

450
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:16,702
I want to send you away to Kitan.

451
00:41:18,261 --> 00:41:19,502
Excuse me?

452
00:41:20,302 --> 00:41:23,261
My dead brother promised
to send his daughter,

453
00:41:23,422 --> 00:41:25,542
but instead sent her to So.

454
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:31,102
I promised Kitan I'll send
another royal in her place.

455
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:37,782
Congratulations on your wedding,
Yeonhwa.

456
00:41:40,261 --> 00:41:44,742
I don't know why every Emperor
threatens me with marriage.

457
00:41:44,982 --> 00:41:48,582
My father who introduced me to this world,
my brother who grew up with me.

458
00:41:49,062 --> 00:41:50,422
You're all the same.

459
00:41:52,222 --> 00:41:55,902
I wonder if you think
marriage is the best way to handle a girl.

460
00:41:57,302 --> 00:41:59,382
- I'm disappointed.
- By any chance...

461
00:41:59,982 --> 00:42:02,702
did you think you'd become an Empress?

462
00:42:04,262 --> 00:42:08,022
Your brother betrayed me.
And you were on the same boat.

463
00:42:09,422 --> 00:42:11,261
Did you think...

464
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:14,742
I'd marry that family?

465
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:42,261
I have someone else in mind.

466
00:42:43,702 --> 00:42:45,342
If it wasn't for Su...

467
00:42:46,622 --> 00:42:48,462
I wouldn't have a future.

468
00:42:49,582 --> 00:42:51,062
I'm nothing...

469
00:42:52,022 --> 00:42:53,742
without her.

470
00:43:37,622 --> 00:43:39,261
I'm going crazy.

471
00:43:39,422 --> 00:43:41,982
The palace was my playground
since I was a boy.

472
00:43:42,142 --> 00:43:44,542
And now I'm stuck in this room.

473
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,222
At least you can go out.

474
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:49,982
I've been here for days!

475
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:55,261
Shall we bathe?

476
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:59,942
Court ladies aren't around at night.
It'll be okay.

477
00:44:45,702 --> 00:44:46,942
What do you think?

478
00:44:48,261 --> 00:44:50,742
Wow. It's great!

479
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,261
It looks so real.

480
00:44:54,261 --> 00:44:58,222
Do you really want to see
how good I am?

481
00:45:06,261 --> 00:45:07,582
Get set...

482
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:09,102
Go!

483
00:45:10,782 --> 00:45:16,222
The moon in the night,
don't know my mind

484
00:45:17,702 --> 00:45:22,582
Cry, cry, never cry,
I don't want you to be sad, baby

485
00:45:22,822 --> 00:45:26,702
Now I know what love is

486
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:32,062
Fly, fly, forever fly
with you every day for my whole life

487
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:40,142
Am I not in your heart?

488
00:45:40,262 --> 00:45:44,422
If only I could easily do it by myself

489
00:45:44,502 --> 00:45:47,902
I wouldn't be anxious,
I wouldn't worry

490
00:45:48,261 --> 00:45:51,862
All right! I won!
Did you see me? I won again!

491
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,742
Roll up.

492
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:09,261
Tonight I'll figure out whether to leave

493
00:46:09,422 --> 00:46:12,542
How to not confuse you

494
00:46:12,622 --> 00:46:16,022
I keep smiling thinking of you

495
00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:19,261
I won too much.
My fingers hurt.

496
00:46:21,502 --> 00:46:23,582
Anything else to play with?

497
00:46:25,102 --> 00:46:26,382
Oh, right.

498
00:46:28,462 --> 00:46:31,261
I forgot to give this to you.

499
00:46:33,382 --> 00:46:34,462
You.

500
00:46:36,142 --> 00:46:39,261
When did you have time to grab this?

501
00:46:39,342 --> 00:46:42,182
I knew it was your favorite.

502
00:46:43,062 --> 00:46:44,902
Your dead shot slingshot.

503
00:47:00,622 --> 00:47:02,582
Emperor?

504
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:10,942
My only dream was to open
the greatest toy store in all of Songak.

505
00:47:11,382 --> 00:47:13,261
It's not too late.

506
00:47:13,422 --> 00:47:17,502
Once we arrive in Jeju,
you can open up a toy store.

507
00:47:17,862 --> 00:47:19,782
I'll teach martial arts.

508
00:47:20,262 --> 00:47:21,542
Really?

509
00:47:41,702 --> 00:47:44,022
I grabbed this.

510
00:47:47,382 --> 00:47:48,662
Okay...

511
00:47:50,822 --> 00:47:52,942
I'm sure Haesu will like it.

512
00:47:53,222 --> 00:47:54,382
It's yours.

513
00:47:55,862 --> 00:48:00,342
I heard Yeonhwa saying
you don't have a proper scent bag.

514
00:48:02,222 --> 00:48:05,582
Don't embarrass me, okay?

515
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:14,902
Do you not like it?

516
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:18,261
That's strange.

517
00:48:18,702 --> 00:48:21,902
Pretty girls usually like it.

518
00:48:24,062 --> 00:48:25,182
That's strange.

519
00:48:25,261 --> 00:48:28,382
Pretty girls usually like flower rings.

520
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,942
I'm not saying that you're pretty...

521
00:48:35,102 --> 00:48:38,982
It's just that recently...
Yeah, recently...

522
00:48:39,302 --> 00:48:41,542
I mean...
you look...

523
00:48:41,982 --> 00:48:45,022
Or my eyesight is failing...

524
00:48:47,982 --> 00:48:53,182
I have a secret that no one knows

525
00:48:57,822 --> 00:49:00,261
I understood.

526
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:03,742
A pumpkin flower...

527
00:49:05,062 --> 00:49:07,182
...is still a flower.

528
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:16,502
I want two sons and two daughters.

529
00:49:16,902 --> 00:49:18,662
No compromises.

530
00:49:19,261 --> 00:49:23,582
Does kissing...
make me pregnant?

531
00:49:34,261 --> 00:49:37,182
I wish we were always like this.

532
00:49:42,742 --> 00:49:44,142
Let's go.

533
00:49:44,862 --> 00:49:47,982
The cold will kill us
before the Emperor does.

534
00:49:49,302 --> 00:49:53,022
Then, am I pregnant now?

535
00:49:55,422 --> 00:49:56,622
Let's go.

536
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:07,102
Don't think about it and just hug me

537
00:50:07,261 --> 00:50:13,462
If your heart pounds, then it is love

538
00:50:13,782 --> 00:50:18,742
Then will you confess your love?

539
00:50:20,102 --> 00:50:26,182
I'm confused if this is love or not

540
00:50:26,302 --> 00:50:32,102
Don't think about it and just hug me

541
00:50:32,261 --> 00:50:38,262
If your heart pounds, then it is love

542
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:44,062
Then will you confess your love?

543
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:52,261
That you love me too

544
00:51:02,462 --> 00:51:06,342
Miss!
This is really weird.

545
00:51:09,102 --> 00:51:11,982
I'm sure I cleaned everything up
before I went to bed.

546
00:51:14,261 --> 00:51:16,261
Was someone here?

547
00:51:16,982 --> 00:51:18,742
I made it.

548
00:51:19,422 --> 00:51:21,182
A new look for Damiwon.

549
00:51:24,142 --> 00:51:25,262
Okay...

550
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:29,062
How did he make this?

551
00:51:48,062 --> 00:51:51,261
Greetings.
We will be ready for you soon.

552
00:51:51,302 --> 00:51:53,261
I came to see you.

553
00:51:58,622 --> 00:51:59,822
Okay.

554
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:02,261
This way.

555
00:52:26,022 --> 00:52:28,182
Leave brother So alone.

556
00:52:29,342 --> 00:52:32,222
I know what happened
between you and brother Uk.

557
00:52:32,742 --> 00:52:35,982
And I know you hid that
and seduced brother So.

558
00:52:36,262 --> 00:52:39,102
I'm fed up with your obscenity.

559
00:52:39,261 --> 00:52:41,222
Leave So alone.

560
00:52:42,902 --> 00:52:45,142
Then I'll look the other way.

561
00:52:46,302 --> 00:52:49,062
I know you want marriage
as your ticket out of here.

562
00:52:49,382 --> 00:52:50,822
I'll help.

563
00:52:51,622 --> 00:52:55,182
I'll introduce you to a nice family.

564
00:52:56,662 --> 00:53:00,142
Maybe marriage is a means to your goal.
But not for me.

565
00:53:00,822 --> 00:53:03,062
He is happy because of me.

566
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:09,261
And I see my value through him.
That's why I want to marry him.

567
00:53:12,862 --> 00:53:15,222
If he doesn't change...

568
00:53:15,782 --> 00:53:18,022
I won't change first.

569
00:53:19,502 --> 00:53:21,422
I won't leave him.

570
00:53:22,261 --> 00:53:26,261
Now I finally understand
why I always hated you.

571
00:53:27,261 --> 00:53:29,742
For you,
feelings, marriage...

572
00:53:30,261 --> 00:53:32,261
they're all play.

573
00:53:33,222 --> 00:53:35,742
For me it's survival.

574
00:53:42,702 --> 00:53:45,342
Don't be so sure you won't change.

575
00:53:45,742 --> 00:53:49,422
You never know what will happen
inside the palace.

576
00:53:52,342 --> 00:53:54,062
You will regret this.

577
00:53:54,261 --> 00:53:58,261
I will make you regret.

578
00:54:33,422 --> 00:54:36,261
With general Park Sugyeong
and astrologer Choe Jimong,

579
00:54:36,382 --> 00:54:40,582
4th Prince has the army
and the heavens beside him.

580
00:54:41,822 --> 00:54:44,542
You need to get rid of him
as soon as possible.

581
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:48,822
We just plotted
Wang Gyu's revolt.

582
00:54:49,261 --> 00:54:51,422
Furthermore,
So is my blood brother.

583
00:54:52,261 --> 00:54:55,822
I do agree with you,
but timing is paramount.

584
00:54:57,662 --> 00:55:01,422
Then you at least need to split him
from the general and astrologer.

585
00:55:11,902 --> 00:55:13,261
What is it?

586
00:55:29,942 --> 00:55:32,902
I wanted to make your lives easier.

587
00:55:34,742 --> 00:55:36,302
- What?
- In exchange...

588
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:40,702
If my plan works,
I want you to not send me away.

589
00:55:49,582 --> 00:55:53,342
Once you are out of the cave,
Prince Jeong will be waiting for you.

590
00:55:54,382 --> 00:55:56,902
He will safely escort you to the docks.

591
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:00,782
Beef jerky.

592
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:02,982
Just in case...

593
00:56:06,261 --> 00:56:07,502
Thank you...

594
00:56:10,261 --> 00:56:11,622
very much.

595
00:56:15,062 --> 00:56:17,582
Su, I'll see you later.

596
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:20,261
Yes, I'll wait for you.

597
00:56:20,342 --> 00:56:22,902
What about my father?

598
00:56:22,982 --> 00:56:26,182
I left a message.
He could be waiting for you outside.

599
00:56:32,182 --> 00:56:33,622
Let's go now.

600
00:56:44,662 --> 00:56:47,262
You have to run.
The army found out about the cave!

601
00:56:47,382 --> 00:56:49,502
- Jeong...
- Go. I'll stall them.

602
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:51,022
You too!

603
00:57:06,822 --> 00:57:08,582
Find 10th Prince!

604
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:10,942
- Hurry! Now!
- Yes, sir.

605
00:57:23,261 --> 00:57:25,261
Take my Prince another way.

606
00:57:26,261 --> 00:57:27,462
What?

607
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:30,502
They can't kill me
because of my father.

608
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,262
You are their target.

609
00:57:32,942 --> 00:57:34,222
No...

610
00:57:35,142 --> 00:57:36,462
Come with me.

611
00:57:41,262 --> 00:57:42,742
I'll catch up.

612
00:57:47,022 --> 00:57:48,261
I promise.

613
00:57:51,062 --> 00:57:52,261
I trust you.

614
00:58:04,142 --> 00:58:07,261
Like she said...
we need to go now.

615
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:12,302
No.
I can't hide behind my wife.

616
00:58:13,142 --> 00:58:14,302
Prince.

617
00:58:19,422 --> 00:58:23,382
I have no choice.
I'm her betrothed now.

618
00:58:26,261 --> 00:58:29,502
She loves me.

619
00:58:51,742 --> 00:58:56,982
Like the winds scattering away

620
00:58:59,222 --> 00:59:00,902
SCARLET HEART

621
00:59:01,182 --> 00:59:05,022
Only a couple of slaves died.
Why stop the construction?

622
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:07,582
I've committed a grave sin,
Your Highness.

623
00:59:08,142 --> 00:59:09,542
I will kill him.

624
00:59:09,782 --> 00:59:14,142
I started this to stop
my brothers from killing each other.

625
00:59:16,102 --> 00:59:19,261
Does Jeong want the throne?

626
00:59:19,662 --> 00:59:21,102
It is time.

627
00:59:21,422 --> 00:59:22,702
Haesu is also there.

628
00:59:22,782 --> 00:59:26,222
I told you, you can't trust him
to be your dog.

629
00:59:26,422 --> 00:59:30,022
I will be the dog
that breaks off from his chains.

630
00:59:30,502 --> 00:59:32,982
I will become Emperor of Goryeo.
