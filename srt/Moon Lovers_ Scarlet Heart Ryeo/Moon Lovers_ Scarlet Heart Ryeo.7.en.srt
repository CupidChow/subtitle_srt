1
00:00:03,655 --> 00:00:05,215
SCARLET HEART

2
00:00:52,895 --> 00:00:55,255
Although you could have been
the Emperor's wife,

3
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,495
here, you're just a court lady.

4
00:00:57,855 --> 00:00:59,815
Yes, I understand.

5
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,775
I'll make sure I adapt.

6
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:08,215
Do you know how to make tea?
Use herbs, do make-up?

7
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,255
Of all things, that is my expertise.

8
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:15,535
I'm certified in skin care and make-up.
I can also make home made cosmetics.

9
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:19,815
The more I think about it,
I fit well here in Damiwon.

10
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:21,655
You do know how to read and write?

11
00:01:23,774 --> 00:01:24,895
No.

12
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:31,855
Really?

13
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:40,695
You're still here?

14
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:47,415
I wondered what kind of place this was,
but I think I can do well.

15
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:49,415
It fits my skills.

16
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:52,774
Did you know I was good at make-up?

17
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:58,135
Anyway, since I'm in the palace now,
visit often.

18
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:01,015
By the way...

19
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,775
Do I shock you a lot?

20
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:07,215
I even forgot to say thank you.

21
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:11,935
Fortunately my marriage
with the Emperor was called off...

22
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:22,455
You could have died.

23
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:26,335
A little deeper, you would have died.

24
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:29,535
But I didn't die.

25
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:35,455
Do you know how hard it is
to live with a scar?

26
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:38,655
Do you like being a court lady?

27
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:41,775
You might never
be able to leave this place.

28
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,575
Are you happy?

29
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:46,215
Why did you do this?

30
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:50,774
- You should have just married the...
- I don't know why!

31
00:02:53,135 --> 00:02:54,774
I said to myself...

32
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:59,495
Worst case, just suck it up
and go to bed with the Emperor, but...

33
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:03,655
I couldn't.

34
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:08,255
No one else...

35
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:11,774
No one else could save me
but me.

36
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:15,935
That's why.

37
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:20,775
When I came around...

38
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:24,095
this already happened.

39
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:28,255
You fool...

40
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:35,535
Don't ever do this again.

41
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:39,695
I won't forgive you.

42
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:48,975
Are you listening to my voice?

43
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:52,615
I'm saying I love you

44
00:03:53,695 --> 00:03:55,855
Where are we?

45
00:03:57,255 --> 00:03:59,015
A lake called "Dongji."

46
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:02,295
The sun shines here first.

47
00:04:03,774 --> 00:04:06,935
What is the Imperial Palace like?

48
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:11,774
Hard to enter,
but even harder to leave.

49
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:14,774
If you trust others, you die.

50
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:17,774
Suspect the closest to you
in order to live.

51
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:20,655
That's what I was taught.

52
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:25,375
I guess you don't know everything, either?

53
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:27,774
Everyone is alone here.

54
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:30,535
That's for sure.

55
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:40,495
Are you listening to me?
Can you hear my heart?

56
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:46,895
Like the rain on the window

57
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:52,775
I'm okay because I'm not alone.

58
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,774
Not alone?

59
00:04:57,615 --> 00:04:59,975
Why am I alone?
I have you.

60
00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:04,895
I'm worried you're getting too bold.

61
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:07,774
It's still a place where people live.

62
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:13,415
I'll make it through.

63
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:17,855
I don't doubt that.

64
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:23,175
Since we have a loud mouth here,
it won't be too boring.

65
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:33,455
You are soaking up my mind

66
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:38,774
I need you.
I need you.

67
00:05:39,015 --> 00:05:42,695
I miss you.

68
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,095
General!

69
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:59,015
At ease.

70
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:02,695
All doing well?
Good, good.

71
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:08,375
Wow!
Still shiny!

72
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,895
I wanted that bear...

73
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:19,095
Where did you hide the gall bladder?

74
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:20,735
It's for someone else.

75
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:25,015
You little brat. When you were young,
you used to treat me like a king.

76
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:43,774
Park Sugyeong reporting arrival,
your majesty.

77
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:45,375
Great General.

78
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:01,135
I should have cleaned up.

79
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:02,774
Apologies, your highness.

80
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:06,295
I sent you away for a long time
and asked to look after my boy.

81
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,975
I am grateful.

82
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:15,255
4th Prince is very talented.
I had fun teaching him.

83
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:22,774
If it wasn't for the scar,
he would have made a great Jeongyun.

84
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:28,735
Are you saying Jeongyun's
martial arts skill is lacking?

85
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:34,335
Wang Mu is a great warrior,
but he has a gentle soul.

86
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:39,455
I'm worried how he will make it through
the politics of the palace.

87
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:43,774
If it was me,
I would choose the battlefields.

88
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:57,455
Living in the palace
has its lessons and perks.

89
00:07:57,774 --> 00:08:00,015
What?
Like what?

90
00:08:00,215 --> 00:08:02,774
- Wits and sense.
- Then...

91
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:07,495
Is Wang So learning stuff like
wits and sense here too?

92
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:10,735
- So ignorant...
- Yeah, go.

93
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:21,335
Jeongyun, last time
you gave me a bamboo horse.

94
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:22,774
What's the prize this time?

95
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:25,455
Just win. I'll give you
any Wanhojimul you want!

96
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:26,735
WANHOJIMUL
TOY

97
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:27,855
Promise!

98
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,895
Jeong, try me!

99
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:35,855
I don't know about anyone else, but,
10th Brother, you are finished!

100
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:40,775
As for me, today I will prevail!

101
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:43,735
Yeah, Jeong.
We will win with our brains.

102
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,415
- Brothers, charge!
- Wait...

103
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:38,215
I heard you are studying books
rather than martial arts.

104
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:42,095
I've learned more than enough
thanks to you, general.

105
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:43,775
Now I need fill my head.

106
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:50,295
I also heard you killed dozens of men
and lit the bodies on fire.

107
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:57,015
They deserved to die.

108
00:09:57,335 --> 00:10:00,774
Maybe you've read too much.

109
00:10:01,055 --> 00:10:05,655
Did you learn how to distinguish
who deserves to die or not?

110
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:09,135
Killing someone...

111
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:11,855
No matter how many times
you reincarnate...

112
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:16,055
it sticks with you.
Karma...

113
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,774
You're the one who taught me to kill.

114
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:22,455
I taught to defend.

115
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:25,815
I protected the integrity of the palace.
Isn't that enough of a cause?

116
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:32,775
Why do want to live in Songak?

117
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:38,775
You are more than ready to
govern the Shinju Gangs now.

118
00:10:40,135 --> 00:10:44,175
As a prince, shouldn't I need to know
how things are in the palace?

119
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,695
I'm curious how grand the throne is.

120
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:49,095
What makes my mother and brothers fight.

121
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:53,055
Once you get your answers,
will you come back?

122
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:57,774
Do I have to?

123
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:03,775
At the end of the day,
only one prince will be able to live here.

124
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:05,935
Whoever takes the throne.

125
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:12,255
Think about it.

126
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:16,895
Why you really want to live in Songak.

127
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:43,015
How is the headache?

128
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:47,335
It gets a little better when I drink
the chrysanthemum tea you sent.

129
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,575
But soon returns.

130
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:53,215
I've had it for ten years.
My hopes aren't too high.

131
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,455
I'll put a scent bag in your pillow.

132
00:11:58,055 --> 00:12:02,015
- Good sleep is the best cure.
- Thank you.

133
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:06,774
Su, are you getting along okay?

134
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:11,774
Could be a difficult change for a noble.
How are you doing?

135
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:13,895
I'm doing pretty well.

136
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:18,375
If you liked the soap,
I can make you more.

137
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:20,815
I can also do make-up.

138
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:23,255
Oh, you smudged a bit.

139
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:25,774
You're just an intern.

140
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:28,575
Remember your place.
Leave now.

141
00:12:28,774 --> 00:12:29,935
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:39,535
Come to think of it,
she does fit well here in Damiwon.

143
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:42,495
The soap was really good.

144
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,495
I will look after her.

145
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:48,295
What about you?

146
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:51,774
Does Empress Yu
still give you a hard time?

147
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:55,774
I'm fine, don't worry.

148
00:12:56,295 --> 00:12:59,895
Your stomachache is as severe
as my headache.

149
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:03,895
Sick people should look after each other.

150
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:07,215
Seek out the royal doctor.

151
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:10,774
I know he only sees royals,
but for you, he might...

152
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:15,655
I'm forever grateful, ma'am.

153
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:27,855
Ice! I need ice!

154
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:30,295
It's like bugs crawling!

155
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:32,975
Do something!

156
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:37,335
Ice! Give me ice!

157
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:43,774
Call the royal doctor!

158
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:47,895
My skin is splitting up!
Bugs are crawling all over!

159
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,695
- Cold water!
- Atopic dermatitis?

160
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:54,774
- No!
- Give it to me!

161
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,495
- No!
- Go away!

162
00:13:57,335 --> 00:13:58,855
Not cold water!

163
00:13:59,895 --> 00:14:03,135
You wanna die?
What do you know?

164
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:07,415
When you eat beans or cold food,
doesn't it itch more?

165
00:14:08,774 --> 00:14:10,774
Also when you're tired or sweaty.

166
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:12,774
And fur makes you crazy.

167
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,695
How do you know?

168
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:22,935
Trust me and bathe in hot water.

169
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:25,055
Cold water will only make it itch more.

170
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:28,855
Any cold attribute tea?

171
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,255
Like aloe or green tea...
Oh, peppermint!

172
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,175
Let's get your body temperature down.

173
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:04,215
The peppermint leaf's coolness
will help with the itch.

174
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:14,415
What are you doing?

175
00:15:14,975 --> 00:15:16,455
All out!

176
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:19,495
Out!

177
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:22,535
I know because my mother had it too.

178
00:15:22,774 --> 00:15:24,615
Now if he takes a bath...

179
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:28,215
It's none of your business.

180
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:30,135
Court lady Oh.

181
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,295
Jeongyun, are you okay?

182
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:38,935
Catch your breath
and calm down.

183
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,535
Court lady Oh.

184
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:14,415
Don't scold her.

185
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,535
I'm better thanks to her.

186
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:23,095
I've changed my mind.

187
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:25,774
Let's head back.

188
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:32,774
The Classic of Tea,

189
00:16:32,895 --> 00:16:35,774
a book on tea by
Tang scholar Lu Yu.

190
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:39,975
Compendium of Herbal Medicine--

191
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:42,774
over one hundred remedies
are listed in the book.

192
00:16:43,655 --> 00:16:45,415
Herbal Supplements--

193
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,255
a medicine book by
Tang scholar Chen Zangqi.

194
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,774
Lists effects of tea, herbs, and plants.

195
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:56,495
If you had learned all this,
today's mistake could've been avoided.

196
00:16:56,735 --> 00:16:58,415
Why did you intervene?

197
00:16:58,535 --> 00:17:00,375
He was in pain.

198
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:03,895
I knew what to do.
I couldn't not help him.

199
00:17:05,655 --> 00:17:08,335
How did you know peppermint leaves
help with itching?

200
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:10,935
Since you can't read,
it wasn't the books.

201
00:17:11,055 --> 00:17:15,335
My mother had it too.
We tried all sorts of cures.

202
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:20,135
Don't tell anyone about
Jeongyun's problem.

203
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:23,255
If you do,
you will not live to see tomorrow.

204
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:27,175
Do you understand?

205
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:29,695
Yes.

206
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:35,775
- I want you to tend the Damiwon gardens.
- What?

207
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:38,455
I told you not to lose it.

208
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:41,695
You've blundered in front of
the Empress and Jeongyun.

209
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:43,175
Now take your punishment.

210
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:10,295
Drink.

211
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:17,495
Drink.

212
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:22,774
Drink some water.

213
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:27,055
Oops.

214
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:30,575
I give up.

215
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:34,335
I'm no gardener.

216
00:18:34,535 --> 00:18:38,774
Weren't nobles supposed to
have it better?

217
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,615
- Should I run away?
- Run?

218
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:46,774
This is Goryeo.
You can't run away from the Emperor.

219
00:18:47,135 --> 00:18:49,774
I wasn't really going to run.

220
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:52,615
Just saying. You know.

221
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:57,615
I thought you were a Damiwon court lady,
not a palace slave.

222
00:18:58,335 --> 00:18:59,815
I've never seen you use
your hands or head.

223
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:01,655
Always your body.

224
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:05,775
The more I think about it,
I don't fit in here.

225
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:09,774
No one recognizes my talents.
Maybe I'm too talented.

226
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:12,615
When did you use them?

227
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:16,495
I mean, the Jeongyun thing.
I was right, but...

228
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:20,255
Anyway...

229
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:23,895
To be recognized at work,
you need the right boss.

230
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,774
Not in this lifetime.

231
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:37,415
Do you know about Jeongyun's illness?

232
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:39,495
What?
Well...

233
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:41,935
Never heard of it.

234
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,095
Watch your mouth.

235
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:47,774
Your next punishment won't be as light.

236
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,095
So you know, too.

237
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:53,774
But the atopic...

238
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:56,255
I mean, itching.

239
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,375
It can't be cured
by treating it like a grave illness.

240
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:01,615
Just watch what you eat and...

241
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,295
Maybe court lady Oh is
keeping me in check.

242
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,055
Cause Jeongyun might like me.

243
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:11,855
What if he got worse
because of you?

244
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:14,015
You could have died.

245
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:16,375
Oh let you off easy.

246
00:20:18,535 --> 00:20:19,774
Maybe so.

247
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:22,695
By watching you water the plants,

248
00:20:22,774 --> 00:20:24,575
I can tell you're the opposite of
too talented.

249
00:20:24,774 --> 00:20:25,855
Like, really.

250
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:31,135
When you grow plants
you need to name them, be friends.

251
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:34,774
Name plants?
I'm confused with my name.

252
00:20:39,774 --> 00:20:42,895
The "pine" in "pine tree" means best.

253
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:45,175
So name it "Besty."

254
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:50,095
Mulberry fruits make you fart.

255
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,415
- Then "Farty"?
- Are you...

256
00:20:56,774 --> 00:20:58,615
playing around with me?

257
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:10,175
Back in Shinju, I named
a birch tree "Crackle."

258
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,215
It was so strong, it could bear
the weight of three grown men.

259
00:21:13,495 --> 00:21:18,455
That tree friend must have been famous.

260
00:21:20,855 --> 00:21:22,415
A couple of years back...

261
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:25,895
I lit it up in flames,
so it's no longer exists.

262
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:27,855
What?

263
00:21:28,735 --> 00:21:32,215
It was really cold.
And the wolves were closing in.

264
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:41,175
Why did it have to be there...?

265
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,215
Forget it.
No point in talking to you.

266
00:21:56,495 --> 00:22:01,695
Stop the "I want to run" crap
and be faithful to your duties.

267
00:22:02,774 --> 00:22:04,015
Understand?

268
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,655
Earn your keep.

269
00:22:14,055 --> 00:22:16,495
And I thought he changed.

270
00:22:17,655 --> 00:22:20,095
Don't know my mind

271
00:22:20,175 --> 00:22:22,774
Be with you

272
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:25,335
Cry, cry, never cry

273
00:22:25,415 --> 00:22:27,775
I don't want you to be sad, baby

274
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:31,774
Now I know what love is

275
00:22:32,055 --> 00:22:34,655
Fly, fly, forever fly

276
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:37,135
With you every day
my whole life

277
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:40,655
I want you,
I want your love

278
00:22:40,774 --> 00:22:45,215
Am I not in your heart?

279
00:22:45,335 --> 00:22:49,935
If only I could easily do it by myself

280
00:22:50,055 --> 00:22:53,975
I wouldn't be anxious,
I wouldn't worry

281
00:22:54,215 --> 00:22:58,215
I want to make you mine

282
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:01,774
An awkward distance to walk

283
00:23:01,774 --> 00:23:03,935
An adequate distance, our feet

284
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:06,695
How good would it feel?

285
00:23:06,774 --> 00:23:09,055
The moment we first look at each other

286
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:14,375
Tonight I'll figure out whether to leave

287
00:23:14,615 --> 00:23:17,575
How to not confuse you

288
00:23:17,655 --> 00:23:21,855
I keep smiling thinking of you

289
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:27,695
Is love like this?

290
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:31,255
Even the sun in the day,
the moon in the night

291
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:35,295
Doesn't know my mind

292
00:23:38,774 --> 00:23:43,575
Time with you alone

293
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:47,615
Maybe not right now

294
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:51,935
Your dream is in front of me

295
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:56,774
I want to feel you as mine

296
00:23:56,855 --> 00:24:01,335
I keep smiling because I'm with you

297
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:07,295
Even on the hard days
I don't feel like crying

298
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:14,175
If you'll wait with your eyes closed
can I go to you first?

299
00:24:23,815 --> 00:24:27,015
Su, how long do I have to stay like this?

300
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:28,774
A little longer.

301
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:35,774
My fingers tingle.
It's like a bug is inside.

302
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,015
Be patient.

303
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:42,774
If the balsam dye stays till first snow,
your first love will work out.

304
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:44,774
Really?

305
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:49,695
First love...

306
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:53,295
Sister!
Sister Su!

307
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:55,735
Don't run!
You'll trip.

308
00:24:57,774 --> 00:25:01,135
I came here to show you a skill
I just perfected.

309
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:02,695
A new skill?

310
00:25:09,055 --> 00:25:10,855
Isn't that a real sword?

311
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,774
You can't wield a real sword
inside the palace.

312
00:25:13,815 --> 00:25:16,455
Imagine me using this skill
in the battlefields.

313
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:18,295
Cool?

314
00:25:21,015 --> 00:25:22,135
Hey.

315
00:26:08,615 --> 00:26:11,015
Chun is spring, il is day.

316
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:13,335
Chun il...

317
00:26:16,615 --> 00:26:19,615
Chun il...
What was this one?

318
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:21,255
Bong, meaning peak.

319
00:26:23,175 --> 00:26:24,774
Chun il bong hwa.

320
00:26:24,895 --> 00:26:27,774
On a warm spring day,
a flower peaks.

321
00:26:30,495 --> 00:26:32,375
What is all this?

322
00:26:33,774 --> 00:26:35,055
Homework.

323
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:37,774
Since I couldn't read...

324
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:40,015
I used the wrong herbs.

325
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:42,215
Why can't you read?

326
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:45,535
Actually...

327
00:26:46,415 --> 00:26:51,135
I forgot how to read
after I hurt my head.

328
00:26:52,775 --> 00:26:55,895
Then how did you read my poem?

329
00:26:56,935 --> 00:26:58,774
Cousin read it to me.

330
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:03,535
"The willows are green, by the river."
That poem, right?

331
00:27:06,855 --> 00:27:09,774
I owe her way too much...

332
00:27:10,415 --> 00:27:11,655
What?

333
00:27:13,455 --> 00:27:16,215
Since I hardly see you,
I was thinking of writing letters.

334
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,575
But if you can't read...

335
00:27:19,775 --> 00:27:23,055
Don't worry.
I'll be able to read soon.

336
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:39,415
Su.

337
00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:01,774
You go down here.

338
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:04,255
Boksucho, the adonis.

339
00:28:04,575 --> 00:28:07,015
Use it well, it cures.
Use it wrong, it kills.

340
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:12,135
Oh... okay.

341
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:16,975
And...

342
00:28:42,255 --> 00:28:44,855
What's this letter?

343
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:47,015
My name.

344
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:50,415
Uk.

345
00:28:52,655 --> 00:28:55,015
It means "morning sun."

346
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:02,335
Morning sun...
Uk.

347
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:34,415
The red will keep harm away.

348
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:37,255
And...

349
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,735
It also means a strong tie.

350
00:29:45,815 --> 00:29:47,415
Promise me.

351
00:29:49,735 --> 00:29:51,495
You'll never take it off.

352
00:30:04,855 --> 00:30:07,855
I'll do everything in my power
to bring you back.

353
00:30:09,495 --> 00:30:10,774
So...

354
00:30:12,735 --> 00:30:14,175
Wait for me.

355
00:30:15,975 --> 00:30:18,615
I understand.

356
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:21,295
Don't rush it.

357
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:25,175
I'm doing okay.

358
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:33,255
I can smile because I am with you

359
00:30:33,775 --> 00:30:39,775
And I pray you are mine

360
00:30:41,255 --> 00:30:47,774
Look into my mind, feel my heart

361
00:30:48,575 --> 00:30:55,215
Look into my mind, find the road there

362
00:30:55,774 --> 00:30:57,135
Wang...

363
00:30:58,415 --> 00:30:59,735
Uk.

364
00:31:03,175 --> 00:31:05,295
Morning sun, Uk.

365
00:31:06,935 --> 00:31:10,575
Please be with me...

366
00:31:10,655 --> 00:31:15,774
Forever...

367
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:35,375
My last ounce of love,
I want to use it for you

368
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:43,055
I'd be happy if you are my final destiny

369
00:31:48,215 --> 00:31:51,774
I never knew "Wait for me"
could make me happy.

370
00:31:52,935 --> 00:31:54,774
I like him.

371
00:31:55,774 --> 00:31:57,774
With him...

372
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:02,774
I'm okay not being Go Hajin
and being Haesu.

373
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:14,215
You'll be fine.

374
00:32:15,774 --> 00:32:17,135
Haesu...

375
00:32:24,215 --> 00:32:26,495
Let's rest for a bit.

376
00:32:41,575 --> 00:32:42,774
Kids.

377
00:32:47,774 --> 00:32:48,775
Thank you.

378
00:32:48,855 --> 00:32:51,015
- Take your time.
- Okay.

379
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,774
- What are you doing?
- Do we look like pigs?

380
00:33:15,055 --> 00:33:16,975
- What?
- Yes, we lost to Goryeo.

381
00:33:17,055 --> 00:33:20,935
We suffered a horrible drought,
but we're still humans.

382
00:33:21,535 --> 00:33:23,774
Don't mock us with your strokes.

383
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:27,255
It's not like that.

384
00:33:27,455 --> 00:33:30,095
I just wanted to show
how the drought affected...

385
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,495
I heard that for Goryeo nobles,
luxuries aren't enough.

386
00:33:33,575 --> 00:33:35,975
You make art out of the hideous.

387
00:33:37,135 --> 00:33:41,695
Are you working for them?
Mocking poor people?

388
00:33:42,735 --> 00:33:45,255
Don't you have any self-respect
as an artist?

389
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:47,095
Loser.

390
00:33:49,575 --> 00:33:50,695
Loser?

391
00:33:51,775 --> 00:33:54,774
Hey!
Wait up!

392
00:34:09,335 --> 00:34:10,695
Princess.

393
00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:15,695
General.

394
00:34:17,735 --> 00:34:20,935
You look clean and tidy.

395
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:24,615
The minister is waiting for you.

396
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:30,215
That traitor Park Yeonggyu
is a minister now?

397
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:32,415
Life must be good.

398
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:35,695
Okay, let's go.

399
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,055
This way.

400
00:34:47,495 --> 00:34:50,535
You can't disappear after
blurting out like that.

401
00:34:53,255 --> 00:34:54,855
A Baekje refugee?

402
00:34:56,975 --> 00:35:00,735
- Let's all drink.
- Yes, brother.

403
00:35:15,575 --> 00:35:19,295
Eun, since it's your birthday,
let me pour you a drink.

404
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:21,455
I'm grateful.

405
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,535
- Brother, let us pour one too.
- All right.

406
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:35,774
What drink is this?

407
00:35:36,575 --> 00:35:37,774
Sister Yeonhwa.

408
00:35:37,775 --> 00:35:41,095
Thank you for setting up this party.

409
00:35:41,215 --> 00:35:42,774
It's my pleasure.

410
00:35:43,135 --> 00:35:46,535
Once I leave for marriage,
I can't, even if I want to.

411
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:50,615
Marriage?
What marriage?

412
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:55,774
Father is looking into a noble family
far away from Songak.

413
00:35:57,495 --> 00:35:59,774
A noble?
Not a royal?

414
00:35:59,935 --> 00:36:01,215
No way.

415
00:36:01,415 --> 00:36:04,774
I guess I'm not good enough for a royal.

416
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,375
After the party,
let's go talk to mother.

417
00:36:17,495 --> 00:36:19,855
Drink up!

418
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:25,215
The cup keeps moving around.

419
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:34,935
- No more.
- Just one more. Drink up.

420
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:37,775
What's this one?

421
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:41,855
What a good drinker!

422
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:47,055
Thank you all!
I'm taking off now.

423
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:50,935
- One more.
- Here you go.

424
00:36:51,895 --> 00:36:54,095
Now drink water.

425
00:36:54,455 --> 00:36:56,535
Drink up!

426
00:36:56,935 --> 00:36:59,774
I didn't know Eun was a great drinker!

427
00:37:00,774 --> 00:37:02,695
- He's awesome!
- One more!

428
00:37:02,975 --> 00:37:05,615
Drink up!

429
00:37:24,095 --> 00:37:26,774
Miss Oh,
I finished everything.

430
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:28,815
Go now.

431
00:37:29,095 --> 00:37:31,415
It's Jeongyun's special request.

432
00:37:31,535 --> 00:37:33,215
- Understand?
- Yes.

433
00:37:35,735 --> 00:37:40,775
In front of your eyes
I'm here for you

434
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:44,215
Please, with your lips...

435
00:37:46,695 --> 00:37:51,095
Before I know it
I'm running to you

436
00:37:51,415 --> 00:37:55,335
Send my heart with the wind

437
00:37:56,774 --> 00:38:01,375
Your eyes used to tickle me,
but now I smile, it comforts me

438
00:38:01,455 --> 00:38:06,774
I only need to walk to you,
my friends keep encouraging me

439
00:38:06,895 --> 00:38:11,855
But my shoes are still too heavy,
shed the night's end, I'm all ready.

440
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:17,335
Please lend me a hand,
so I can run to you on demand

441
00:38:17,535 --> 00:38:22,015
A complicated day,
I try to work around it with my smarts

442
00:38:22,535 --> 00:38:27,295
I just realized
everyone is gone except for you

443
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:31,855
I saw you last spring by chance,
I hope it's not by chance any more

444
00:38:32,415 --> 00:38:36,774
I want to hold your hand
and walk along this road together

445
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:38,895
I'm going home.

446
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:46,615
Prince!

447
00:38:49,055 --> 00:38:50,655
Haesu!

448
00:38:56,975 --> 00:38:59,335
You're so pretty today.

449
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:07,455
You're multiplied in two.
No three.

450
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:09,735
Yay!
So many Haesus!

451
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:14,375
- Come with me.
- Where to?

452
00:39:14,735 --> 00:39:16,015
Where is everyone?

453
00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:20,175
Brother.
Did they all go to party without us?

454
00:39:20,455 --> 00:39:23,774
A party would be fine.
I'm worried they might get into trouble.

455
00:39:24,774 --> 00:39:27,055
- Make way.
- What the...

456
00:39:29,615 --> 00:39:31,695
Sundeok.
Park Sundeok?

457
00:39:32,055 --> 00:39:33,455
Do you know this bear?

458
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:36,774
She's general Park Sugyeong's
daughter Sundeok.

459
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,015
Daughter?

460
00:39:51,935 --> 00:39:54,295
What's so important?

461
00:39:54,774 --> 00:39:57,295
You should marry me.

462
00:39:57,975 --> 00:40:00,495
- What?
- You're the best bride in Goryeo.

463
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:03,855
But marry a noble?
Over my dead body.

464
00:40:05,775 --> 00:40:09,215
Okay.
How big is your dream?

465
00:40:09,295 --> 00:40:10,455
My dream?

466
00:40:13,335 --> 00:40:16,375
Cornered, but still calculating.

467
00:40:18,135 --> 00:40:19,615
My dream is...

468
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:22,655
Goryeo.

469
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,855
Fearless, aren't you?

470
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:31,135
I know you want Uk on the throne.

471
00:40:31,615 --> 00:40:35,175
If your blood brother becomes emperor,
you're still a princess.

472
00:40:37,015 --> 00:40:39,615
But if your husband is emperor,
things change.

473
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:42,774
Only your first wife
will be a proper empress.

474
00:40:45,975 --> 00:40:50,455
Are you willing to take back
all your past weddings for me?

475
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:56,175
I would never sacrifice
to merely get a girl.

476
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:06,775
Let go.

477
00:41:08,774 --> 00:41:10,015
Do you have...

478
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:12,855
another choice?

479
00:41:19,295 --> 00:41:20,855
Aren't you tired?

480
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:27,215
Aren't you tired of...

481
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:29,575
living a cheap cowardly life?

482
00:41:30,774 --> 00:41:33,455
- You like it, don't you?
- Same with you.

483
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:36,375
Still don't know when to get involved.

484
00:41:38,255 --> 00:41:39,735
Talk later.

485
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,375
Thank you.

486
00:41:50,295 --> 00:41:53,335
Please don't tell Uk.

487
00:41:54,135 --> 00:41:57,655
Take Wang Yo down from your scale.

488
00:41:58,335 --> 00:42:00,575
He'll never give you what you want.

489
00:42:02,615 --> 00:42:04,095
Wrong calculation.

490
00:42:04,975 --> 00:42:08,735
If you want to give advice,
give me another option.

491
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:14,735
Would you want to step on...

492
00:42:15,135 --> 00:42:16,295
my scale?

493
00:42:28,055 --> 00:42:30,335
- Isn't this me?
- That's right.

494
00:42:34,295 --> 00:42:36,375
You made all this, Haesu?

495
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:41,975
Thank you for being my first friend
here in Goryeo.

496
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:48,455
You comforted me during hard times
after my cousin died. Thank you.

497
00:42:52,415 --> 00:42:56,774
That's why I wanted to give you
a very special present.

498
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:04,774
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you

499
00:43:04,935 --> 00:43:10,774
Happy birthday my friend 10th Prince,
happy birthday to you

500
00:43:12,774 --> 00:43:16,774
Why were you born?
Why were you born?

501
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:21,774
If you were to be this ugly,
why were you born?

502
00:43:22,335 --> 00:43:26,855
Why were you born?
Why were you born?

503
00:43:27,015 --> 00:43:29,455
Why were you born?

504
00:43:30,095 --> 00:43:32,255
Why were you born?

505
00:43:33,975 --> 00:43:38,615
If you were to be this ugly,
why were you born?

506
00:43:42,655 --> 00:43:45,774
Enjoying this great song by yourself?
I'm hurt.

507
00:43:45,774 --> 00:43:46,774
You!

508
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,095
Sis, will you sing on my birthday too?

509
00:43:49,175 --> 00:43:52,415
Baeka is right.
Enjoying all by yourself?

510
00:43:52,535 --> 00:43:53,975
Don't forget about me.

511
00:43:54,095 --> 00:43:56,415
I'm the one who asked Oh
to send Haesu.

512
00:43:56,535 --> 00:43:59,775
You're much better than the geishas.

513
00:44:04,135 --> 00:44:06,295
No, I mean she's a good...
singer.

514
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:09,895
Sis, can you sing for us?

515
00:44:09,975 --> 00:44:11,055
No way.

516
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,655
- Yeah, please sing.
- Sing for us.

517
00:44:13,774 --> 00:44:16,095
- Sing.
- No way.

518
00:44:16,215 --> 00:44:18,455
Don't mess up my present.

519
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:19,855
- Yes, sing, Su.
- Sing for us, Su.

520
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:23,015
- She's ready.
- No, don't!

521
00:44:23,295 --> 00:44:26,774
Guys, really!
It's my birthday present!

522
00:44:41,135 --> 00:44:46,015
Even in the sharp wind

523
00:44:46,774 --> 00:44:51,055
That scratches as it blows by

524
00:44:52,015 --> 00:44:58,735
A small patch of sunlight
makes me smile

525
00:45:00,935 --> 00:45:05,774
Even with all the cruel people

526
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:10,775
Who busily ignore and pass by

527
00:45:11,935 --> 00:45:18,774
A small group of friends
make me smile

528
00:45:20,774 --> 00:45:27,774
If you find a place
where loneliness doesn't exist

529
00:45:30,615 --> 00:45:36,335
Let's go there together...

530
00:45:37,415 --> 00:45:39,975
You and me

531
00:45:40,495 --> 00:45:45,775
My friend,
My friend

532
00:45:46,095 --> 00:45:50,774
Thank you...
for being yourself

533
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:56,015
I've awaited,
I've looked forward to.

534
00:45:56,535 --> 00:45:58,774
Please stay like this forever.

535
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:01,695
Who cares if you are emperor or not.

536
00:46:02,815 --> 00:46:08,095
Don't forget this moment.
Please.

537
00:46:13,095 --> 00:46:18,774
I'll shout out I love you every day

538
00:46:18,935 --> 00:46:24,774
I'll call out your name every day

539
00:46:24,855 --> 00:46:30,215
The moment you stand before me

540
00:46:32,575 --> 00:46:35,175
- Su, you're the best!
- Su, wonderful song.

541
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:41,615
Every day, I can't sleep
because I think of you

542
00:46:41,695 --> 00:46:46,455
Every day, only you

543
00:46:46,535 --> 00:46:52,775
Do you hear my heart pounding?

544
00:46:53,015 --> 00:46:58,375
I love you, I love you,
I love you

545
00:46:59,815 --> 00:47:01,815
I'm expecting a big present.

546
00:47:02,055 --> 00:47:04,415
Expect all you want, brother!

547
00:47:04,575 --> 00:47:07,815
- It's the thought that's important.
- Isn't he cute?

548
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,975
- You can go now.
- Excuse me?

549
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:20,255
10th Prince is happy with your song.
You've done well as a court lady.

550
00:47:20,495 --> 00:47:21,655
Good work.

551
00:47:21,815 --> 00:47:23,735
It wasn't as a court lady.

552
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,215
I was a friend before a...

553
00:47:26,295 --> 00:47:28,255
Do you think you're friends with Eun?

554
00:47:28,775 --> 00:47:33,335
A court lady and a prince being friends?
That would give Eun a bad reputation.

555
00:47:35,335 --> 00:47:38,774
I set this party up.
I will finish it off.

556
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:41,615
Your work is done.
Go now.

557
00:47:44,774 --> 00:47:46,055
I said go.

558
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:48,015
You don't change, do you?

559
00:47:48,935 --> 00:47:51,774
You only look at class.

560
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:55,215
That's why you hit Chaeryeong.

561
00:47:55,774 --> 00:47:57,775
Why should I change?

562
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:02,015
I'm being nice to you
because of your dead cousin.

563
00:48:03,535 --> 00:48:05,135
Know your place.

564
00:48:06,255 --> 00:48:07,855
I told her to come.

565
00:48:11,135 --> 00:48:12,255
Jeongyun.

566
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:16,095
Eun likes being with Haesu.
It was my present to him.

567
00:48:17,535 --> 00:48:21,255
It's my fault that I couldn't
think of another present.

568
00:48:21,455 --> 00:48:23,375
I hope you understand, Yeonhwa.

569
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:26,175
I understand.

570
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:32,375
Even Jeongyun is on her side.
She's one lucky girl.

571
00:48:42,815 --> 00:48:44,615
Thank you, Jeongyun.

572
00:48:44,774 --> 00:48:49,015
You've seen my flaws.
It's the least I can do.

573
00:48:49,095 --> 00:48:50,695
I kept quiet.

574
00:48:50,774 --> 00:48:52,815
I know.
I trust you.

575
00:48:53,455 --> 00:48:56,375
Will you come help out again
when things get tough?

576
00:48:56,774 --> 00:49:00,295
Of course.
I'll do whatever I can.

577
00:49:01,774 --> 00:49:04,095
- Do you like it?
- Wow. I really do.

578
00:49:05,295 --> 00:49:08,535
Is this jade?
So heavy.

579
00:49:08,615 --> 00:49:09,774
It's expensive.

580
00:49:13,135 --> 00:49:14,535
A slingshot.

581
00:49:16,735 --> 00:49:18,375
Here's mine, brother.

582
00:49:24,455 --> 00:49:27,774
Wow, a book!
A book...

583
00:49:28,735 --> 00:49:31,695
Do you think I read books?

584
00:49:31,774 --> 00:49:34,695
- I'll slingshot you.
- It's a rare edition...

585
00:49:34,774 --> 00:49:36,655
I like this the most.

586
00:49:48,975 --> 00:49:50,455
Prince.

587
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:55,175
Prince.

588
00:49:56,815 --> 00:49:58,495
Who are you?

589
00:49:58,774 --> 00:50:00,215
The grim reaper?

590
00:50:00,774 --> 00:50:04,575
General's daughter Sundeok.
Don't you know her?

591
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,375
Sundeok?

592
00:50:16,655 --> 00:50:18,295
Happy...

593
00:50:19,695 --> 00:50:21,575
birthday.

594
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:24,774
You're the one who scared me
with bearskin all those years.

595
00:50:24,935 --> 00:50:27,095
What grudge do you have
against me?

596
00:50:27,975 --> 00:50:31,575
Prince!
It's not like that...

597
00:50:32,774 --> 00:50:34,255
It's not...

598
00:50:36,935 --> 00:50:38,815
It's not what?

599
00:50:39,695 --> 00:50:42,615
I'll die from curiosity.

600
00:50:50,895 --> 00:50:52,855
What a frustrating girl.

601
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,735
You pressed her too hard.
She got scared.

602
00:50:57,895 --> 00:51:00,935
Scared?
She's like a man.

603
00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:05,175
Put it away!
Damn it.

604
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:07,815
What did you get from So?

605
00:51:07,935 --> 00:51:12,415
I'm good.
I'm just glad he showed up.

606
00:51:12,575 --> 00:51:13,774
A pity.

607
00:51:13,774 --> 00:51:17,775
There's a present in this world
that only So can give.

608
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,774
Too bad.

609
00:51:23,655 --> 00:51:25,495
Is there really?

610
00:51:33,535 --> 00:51:35,895
I doubt it.

611
00:52:14,295 --> 00:52:18,135
Why are you alone?
You should come enjoy with us.

612
00:52:19,495 --> 00:52:20,774
You enjoy.

613
00:52:21,015 --> 00:52:23,735
I don't like loud events.

614
00:52:24,455 --> 00:52:26,615
Hey, we're all brothers.

615
00:52:26,775 --> 00:52:29,815
Today is a day to celebrate.
Let's go.

616
00:52:30,775 --> 00:52:32,135
Come on.

617
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:36,215
- Come on.
- I'm good.

618
00:52:38,774 --> 00:52:40,175
- Brother.
- Hey...

619
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:42,055
Su.

620
00:52:44,935 --> 00:52:48,215
Since you're close with So,
will you help me with the present?

621
00:52:48,295 --> 00:52:50,495
How big could the present be?

622
00:52:50,655 --> 00:52:54,935
It's something very precious to him.
You'll need all the help you can get.

623
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:57,535
Su, please help.
Please.

624
00:52:57,735 --> 00:52:59,095
Okay, all right.

625
00:52:59,695 --> 00:53:02,695
Hurry up.
Come on in.

626
00:53:09,975 --> 00:53:11,495
Where were you?

627
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,135
Eun was opening up his presents.

628
00:53:15,215 --> 00:53:16,295
Oh...

629
00:53:16,935 --> 00:53:18,095
I...

630
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:21,215
didn't get one.

631
00:53:22,774 --> 00:53:25,095
Tell me what you want.
Anything.

632
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:28,895
Really?
Anything?

633
00:53:29,135 --> 00:53:33,015
Of course.
4th Prince is a man of his word.

634
00:53:33,175 --> 00:53:36,295
No matter how rare and precious
it might be, he'll get it for you.

635
00:53:36,495 --> 00:53:37,615
Right?

636
00:53:42,255 --> 00:53:43,415
Yeah.

637
00:53:43,774 --> 00:53:45,935
Rare and precious.

638
00:53:46,055 --> 00:53:47,695
I'll get it for you.

639
00:53:48,175 --> 00:53:50,774
- You promise?
- Of course.

640
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:52,415
Then...

641
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:54,774
I want to see your bare face.

642
00:54:02,735 --> 00:54:05,175
There are all these rumors.

643
00:54:05,295 --> 00:54:08,015
We're brothers.
We shouldn't hide from each other.

644
00:54:08,855 --> 00:54:12,575
How severe can the scar be?
I really want to see.

645
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:16,615
- Prince, listen to me...
- Stand down, court lady!

646
00:54:20,655 --> 00:54:21,895
Ignore him.

647
00:54:26,455 --> 00:54:27,575
Do you really...

648
00:54:28,575 --> 00:54:30,335
- ...want to see?
- Brother...

649
00:54:30,774 --> 00:54:31,815
Stop it.

650
00:54:32,774 --> 00:54:35,975
Eun, you shouldn't have asked.

651
00:54:36,255 --> 00:54:38,695
He said anything.

652
00:54:39,135 --> 00:54:40,815
You agreed, Haesu.

653
00:54:40,935 --> 00:54:43,695
That brother So would be
willing to give any present.

654
00:54:43,774 --> 00:54:46,775
What?
I didn't mean it like that.

655
00:54:46,895 --> 00:54:48,175
Okay.

656
00:56:21,335 --> 00:56:22,774
Brother.

657
00:56:41,095 --> 00:56:43,095
Go apologize to So.

658
00:56:43,295 --> 00:56:44,975
You made a big mistake.

659
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:48,415
You made me do it.
Look at this mess.

660
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,335
Isn't it true?

661
00:56:50,655 --> 00:56:52,735
A present you'll never forget.

662
00:56:53,495 --> 00:56:55,695
You might feel like this is nothing.

663
00:56:56,055 --> 00:56:58,015
But for So it's not.

664
00:56:59,855 --> 00:57:03,055
If he hated it so much,
he didn't need to bare his face.

665
00:57:03,774 --> 00:57:05,615
His pride got the best of him.

666
00:57:06,774 --> 00:57:09,495
Everyone has a weak spot.

667
00:57:09,815 --> 00:57:12,774
Why do you always have to poke it?

668
00:57:12,774 --> 00:57:13,895
Me?

669
00:57:14,135 --> 00:57:15,775
Oh, like when I said...

670
00:57:16,575 --> 00:57:18,735
...your mother's family is weak,

671
00:57:18,774 --> 00:57:22,295
so it's impressive
you're holding on to Jeongyun?

672
00:57:22,774 --> 00:57:24,455
Were you hurt, then?

673
00:57:27,655 --> 00:57:29,535
Do you want me to teach you

674
00:57:30,455 --> 00:57:32,455
why you shouldn't say things like that?

675
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,615
Prince!

676
00:57:42,895 --> 00:57:44,375
Prince!

677
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,215
Wait.
Wait up.

678
00:57:49,695 --> 00:57:51,655
Wasn't that enough?

679
00:57:51,774 --> 00:57:53,495
Do they want to shame me more?

680
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:56,135
No, it's a misunderstanding.

681
00:57:56,495 --> 00:57:58,335
Please don't go.

682
00:57:58,774 --> 00:58:01,774
If you go like this,
Eun will lose his chance to apologize.

683
00:58:02,415 --> 00:58:04,335
And you'll all grow apart.

684
00:58:06,175 --> 00:58:08,495
You're a prince.

685
00:58:11,975 --> 00:58:13,295
Prince...

686
00:58:20,775 --> 00:58:22,135
Look at me.

687
00:58:24,575 --> 00:58:26,215
Take a good look!

688
00:58:35,535 --> 00:58:36,774
Your eyes...

689
00:58:39,855 --> 00:58:41,335
The way you look at me...

690
00:58:49,575 --> 00:58:50,895
I can't stand it.

691
00:58:51,774 --> 00:58:57,215
Another space, another time,
but you are my love

692
00:58:58,095 --> 00:59:03,774
Even through the scent in the wind,
I can tell it is you

693
00:59:06,695 --> 00:59:08,215
SCARLET HEART

694
00:59:08,455 --> 00:59:10,774
This is all because a court lady
was close to a prince.

695
00:59:10,935 --> 00:59:12,135
Stay away.

696
00:59:12,335 --> 00:59:14,335
You can't live under a mask forever.

697
00:59:14,415 --> 00:59:17,495
It'll be easier to live with it shown,
whether you like it or not.

698
00:59:17,695 --> 00:59:19,295
What if it's a mental scar?

699
00:59:20,295 --> 00:59:21,774
Stop stepping over the line!

700
00:59:21,815 --> 00:59:23,815
What did I do wrong?

701
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:28,175
If we get rain after the ritual,
I'll ask the Emperor to let you go.

702
00:59:28,255 --> 00:59:30,215
I hope it rains.

703
00:59:30,495 --> 00:59:32,095
Don't ask me out again.

704
00:59:32,255 --> 00:59:33,774
Don't look for me!

705
00:59:33,855 --> 00:59:35,774
God's will? Damn it.

706
00:59:35,774 --> 00:59:37,335
If it rains, you become the emperor.

707
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,255
Keep your pride.

708
00:59:40,774 --> 00:59:42,774
I came to take my place.

709
00:59:50,175 --> 00:59:52,774
SCARLET HEART
