1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,210
SCARLET HEART

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,970
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,650
Is the tea room ready?

4
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:24,970
Miss!
I mean... Lady!

5
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,810
When did you come back?

6
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:35,130
All went well, thanks to you.
Thank you.

7
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,370
I was super nervous.

8
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,890
14th Prince left a message
before he took off.

9
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,130
Really?

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,330
He found a way out of the palace.
Let him know if you're interested.

11
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,690
You know Narye is coming up.

12
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,849
- I need everything to be perfect.
- Yes, Lady.

13
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,490
Prince Wang So is conspiring
with Songak nobles

14
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,849
in order to stall
the palace construction.

15
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,250
He mixed in rocks
so the walls can break.

16
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,849
And he laid off men.

17
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,170
Are you sure?

18
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,290
Minister Wang Sikryeom has fallen sick.

19
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:19,650
The supervision is not going too well.

20
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,010
Why, why, why!

21
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:26,730
What's his objective?

22
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,050
Not just to rebel against me...

23
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,849
The throne.

24
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,850
He's targeting the throne.
Right?

25
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,250
I have a question before I answer.

26
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,730
Why did you break your promise?

27
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,130
Promise?

28
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,610
People who can't pay taxes
are forced to do labor.

29
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,770
Our poor Hubaekje refugees
are dying on the site.

30
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,970
If it goes on like this,
I have no reason to continue being...

31
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,210
your eyes and ears.

32
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,690
So... are you going to stop?

33
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:11,849
If there's nothing to gain.

34
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,890
Princess Uhui.

35
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,610
Has it been a while
since someone called you this?

36
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,170
You know, Baeka...

37
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:39,970
He loves everything that's pure.

38
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,849
Typical for people
who are fascinated with beauty.

39
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,970
If he finds out you were my dog...

40
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,370
...I'm sure he'll love it.

41
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,170
Please take me out...
Yo...

42
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,330
Please take me out, Yo...

43
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,970
Fire... flint...

44
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,849
Why...

45
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,010
Brother!
Please let me go!

46
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,410
Is anyone around?
Anyone?

47
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,370
Think of our brotherhood.
Brother!

48
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,530
Brother!
Please let us go!

49
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,930
Spare us!

50
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,849
Yo.

51
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,370
Your Highness?

52
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:33,970
No...

53
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,450
- Don't come...
- Yo.

54
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,130
Don't come!
Go away!

55
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:16,210
We need to go.

56
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,930
Your Highness!

57
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,170
Your Highness...
Your Highness!

58
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:35,730
Call the royal doctor!
Now!

59
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,050
This is my chance.
I can be the next Emperor.

60
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,010
Get the horses ready.

61
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,250
We are heading to Seogyeong
to see Wang Sikryeom.

62
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,570
Why?
Don't you want me to be Emperor?

63
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,810
No.

64
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,010
But I don't want to break up.

65
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:11,010
Thank you.

66
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:15,730
You will be Emperor.

67
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,410
I know.

68
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,410
But still...

69
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,890
...never lay hands on your brothers.

70
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,410
Lady.

71
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,450
Lady?

72
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,770
What are you so absorbed in?

73
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:53,849
Chaeryeong.

74
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,290
Let everyone know
to not leave Damiwon today.

75
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,370
No need to tend the gardens either.

76
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,490
It might get loud outside.

77
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,050
But reassure them
it'll be okay in here.

78
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,730
Okay.

79
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,010
Lady, the Emperor
asks for medicinal tea.

80
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,849
Right now?

81
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,210
What are you hiding from me?

82
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,290
Did you poison the tea?

83
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,849
No, your highness.

84
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,050
Eunuch tested it.

85
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:58,890
Now I'm in this state...

86
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,970
It all started with you.

87
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:08,849
Excuse me?

88
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,730
Brother Mu and Eun...
Eun's wife...

89
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,330
Even my father...

90
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,010
The reason they are haunting me...

91
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,890
It's all because of you.

92
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,330
The reason I wanted to be Emperor,
even if I had to kill my brothers, was...

93
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,849
because you...

94
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:39,330
you cleaned up So's scar
and let him take my place.

95
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,410
He took my place...

96
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,570
Your Highness!

97
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,050
Yo!

98
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,849
It's So.
So is coming here!

99
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,330
Wang So started a revolt!

100
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,290
Yo, here...

101
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,849
Grab this.
Write down Jeong as your successor.

102
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,650
What?

103
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,849
We can't let them steal the throne.

104
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,849
Hurry.
Put down Jeong as the next Emperor.

105
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,090
Then we can get through this.
Hurry.

106
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:54,849
Then...

107
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,250
...what about me?

108
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,090
Am I even your son?

109
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,450
What am I to you?

110
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,890
Just someone to fill your vanity?

111
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:22,530
If I am no longer Emperor,
do you not need me any longer?

112
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,010
Yo.
Don't do this.

113
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,290
We'll lose everything.

114
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,330
Hand it over to Jeong.
Please.

115
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,810
Now I know...

116
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,970
...how So felt.

117
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,849
Drag the Empress Dowager out!

118
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,690
Yo...

119
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:55,170
Yo, don't do this.
Yo!

120
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:58,210
Yo!
Let me go!

121
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,330
Let go of me!
Yo!

122
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:05,130
Yo!
Let go!

123
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,890
- It's Prince Wang So!
- The rebels are coming!

124
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,650
Lock the gates!

125
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,490
I still can't get a hold of brother.

126
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:53,370
Park Sugyeong is with them.
The guards don't stand a chance...

127
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,650
Mother?

128
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,970
I will make up my mind
depending on your decision.

129
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,690
After seeing your brother change,
I realized what I didn't teach you.

130
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,050
If you want to own the palace...

131
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,650
you need to give something up.

132
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,330
- Mother...
- Make a decision now.

133
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,610
Seize the world
and lose your sane mind.

134
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:30,090
Or keep that sane mind,
but live in a small world.

135
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,610
I want... the world.

136
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,130
Okay.

137
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:47,530
I give up Uk.

138
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,330
I've come to siege the palace
I used to protect.

139
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,170
I knew he would take everything away.

140
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,250
What...

141
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:03,050
What did I do so wrong?

142
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,730
I was scared of being abandoned.

143
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,650
Just like So.

144
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,850
An afterthought...

145
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,410
Mother told me.

146
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,849
That I was perfect.

147
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:30,690
Flawless.

148
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,490
But...

149
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,010
It's because of you.

150
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,130
You messed it all up!

151
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,050
You choose.

152
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,849
Who should I give the throne to?

153
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,210
Jeong?

154
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,010
Uk?

155
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,849
Baeka?

156
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,530
Or So?

157
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,970
If you're so smart, choose one!

158
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,810
- Find the Emperor, now!
- Yes, sir!

159
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,849
I just...

160
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,410
...wanted to survive.

161
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,250
Did you read it?

162
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,930
Move away!
Get out of my way!

163
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,010
Yo...

164
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,849
Greetings to the new Emperor.

165
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:43,010
Hurray.
Hurray.

166
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,850
Hurray.

167
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,970
Emperor?

168
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,370
Emperor?

169
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,849
The Emperor left me the throne
before he passed.

170
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:11,130
He appointed me.

171
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,290
What?

172
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,650
Greetings to the Emperor!

173
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,570
Greetings to the Emperor!

174
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,010
Hurray! Hurray!
Hurray!

175
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,849
I will help you enter without bloodshed.

176
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,570
I will remember your loyalty.

177
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,250
Emperor!

178
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,890
Hurray! Hurray!
Hurray!

179
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,570
Emperor!

180
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:08,850
Hurray! Hurray!
Hurray!

181
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,770
Gwangjong.

182
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,730
Goryeo's 4th Emperor.

183
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,690
Gwangjong.

184
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:55,610
You won't be remembered
as the "Blood Emperor" now.

185
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,210
I will help you.

186
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,810
Did you really open the gate for him?

187
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,290
Yes, I did.

188
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,130
I told her to.

189
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,650
- You told her to?
- We had no other choice.

190
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,330
From now on,
we Hwangju Hwangbos

191
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,290
will try our best to make an Empress,
not an Emperor.

192
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,970
You finally dropped
your expectations of me.

193
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,690
The situation has changed.

194
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:45,170
I am your mother, Uk.
But I'm Yeonhwa's mother too.

195
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,849
Above all...

196
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,570
I felt bad you changed so much.

197
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,849
The more you wander off
the more you'll be in pain.

198
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,410
Might be better for you
to distance yourself from the palace.

199
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:10,850
Why didn't you come to the coronation?

200
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,810
What if they misapprehend it?

201
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,849
When I arrived at Seogyeong...

202
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,890
...Wang Sikryeom was already dead.

203
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,810
I was immediately detained by
So's men, and when I got out...

204
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,090
...the throne had a new owner.

205
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,849
A traitor who dethrones another traitor
becomes a hero.

206
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,890
Wang So took the position I craved.

207
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,690
To make me witness that...

208
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,570
...would be too harsh.

209
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:54,210
Help me.

210
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:59,410
Once I become Empress,
I will compensate all your losses.

211
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,730
I will share your burden
and responsibilities.

212
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,330
I need your support.

213
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,330
Please.

214
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,610
Denied.

215
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:19,849
I just want to go back home in peace.

216
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:25,370
I need your help the most right now.
Why do you want to leave?

217
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,330
To be honest...

218
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:35,330
I am sick and tired of this place.

219
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,810
Whenever I walk around...

220
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,170
my daughter...

221
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,849
My child...
I see her, I hear her.

222
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:54,210
No matter how hard I try,
the image of you...

223
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,770
thrusting that sword...
I keep recalling that moment.

224
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,770
It pains me.

225
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,370
Don't go.

226
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,290
- Don't go.
- Your highness.

227
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,650
For the country and the people...

228
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,849
...be a merciful ruler.

229
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,450
I urge you.

230
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,410
Your Highness.

231
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,890
That way, when I see...

232
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,410
our founding father when I die...

233
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,810
I can stand up straight.

234
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:39,090
I, Park Sugyeong.

235
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:42,250
Your Highness.

236
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:47,130
Bid farewell.

237
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,410
Park Sugyeong left.

238
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,010
He said he's sick and tired.

239
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,930
And scared...

240
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,570
...of me.

241
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,370
Aren't you curious whose name
was on the Emperor's will?

242
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,050
If I stole this spot or not?

243
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,290
I'm not curious.

244
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:45,690
I'm probably the least curious person.

245
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,849
It was empty.

246
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,170
There was no name.

247
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,850
So...

248
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:16,610
That's why I tore it up.
Worried it might cause more trouble.

249
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:22,050
We had occupied the palace anyway.

250
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,530
You have me.

251
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,370
I won't leave you.

252
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,890
Did So really become Emperor?

253
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,050
Yes.

254
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,849
Appointed?

255
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,890
When I recommended you as successor,
Yo didn't bat an eye.

256
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,849
He couldn't have appointed So.

257
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:17,450
Pull yourself together first.
You could get sick.

258
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,370
Jeong, look into it again.

259
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,849
There must be something they missed.

260
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,010
Oh, yes. Haesu.

261
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,130
I heard she's already
admitted to Cheondeokjeon.

262
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,330
They must be up to something.

263
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,690
Look into it.
Okay?

264
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:38,130
Jeong.

265
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,890
Announce that the transfer of the capital
has come to unconditional halt.

266
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,690
- Refugees mobilized for construction...
- The deceased during labor?

267
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:55,570
Comply with the family's requests.

268
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,490
Su.

269
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,650
Greetings.

270
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,130
Here, have this.

271
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:21,490
I'm in your debt, Your Highness.

272
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:27,730
I'm in your debt, Your Highness.

273
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:41,970
Su!

274
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:52,570
I think and think about it

275
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:58,530
Every day,
I can't sleep because I think of you

276
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:03,849
Every day, only you

277
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:09,490
Do you hear my heart pounding?

278
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,490
I love you, I love you,
I love you

279
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:20,850
I love you, I love you,
I love you

280
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,530
I'm not joking.

281
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,930
I'd rather be serving as a court lady.

282
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,450
They don't let me do anything.

283
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,370
I feel like a doll waiting for its master.

284
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,849
Be careful with what you say.

285
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:41,090
The Emperor has a first wife,
but she's not around.

286
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,610
The Empress spot is essentially empty.

287
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,970
You're now a target.
You have to be careful.

288
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,849
I wanted him to be Emperor
because I was tired of waiting.

289
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:57,090
But now I feel like
I have to wait even more.

290
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,810
Lady!

291
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,650
- Lady!
- Chaeryeong, I warned you.

292
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,570
Lady Hae.
Empress Dowager wants to see you.

293
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:34,650
Greetings to Empress Dowager.

294
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:36,890
I had a question.

295
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,849
Jeong.

296
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:45,690
I found this in the former Emperor's room.

297
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:49,370
It looks like his will.

298
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,810
It looks like it's about his successor.

299
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:59,690
It means there could be another name on it
other than So's.

300
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,970
Tell me.

301
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,570
Did Yo really appoint So as his successor?

302
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,290
If you're afraid to talk
we can protect you.

303
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,210
Please be honest.

304
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:23,530
Did the former Emperor
really appoint So as his successor?

305
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,410
Yes.

306
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,130
Liar.
That's a lie!

307
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:37,530
I know Yo.

308
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,730
I know him better than anyone else.

309
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,850
He never would have appointed So!

310
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,890
Tell me.
Tell the truth!

311
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,010
- Mother.
- Tell me! Now!

312
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,290
Stop it!

313
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,690
That's enough.

314
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,849
If you had a question,
you should have asked me.

315
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:12,890
Really?

316
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:16,170
Then tell me the truth.

317
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,210
Why did you tear up the will?

318
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,290
Who says I did?

319
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,849
I don't know why brother tore up his will.

320
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,650
But he verbally appointed me.

321
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,530
He has a son.
Why would he appoint you?

322
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:42,570
If you're that curious,
maybe you can go ask him in hell?

323
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:47,730
It's fortunate he appointed me.
What if I had forcefully taken it?

324
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:53,530
By now, the palace would be
full of the blood of...

325
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,849
my brothers like Jeong
and my nephews.

326
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:07,730
Empress Dowager, focus more on
remembering our former Emperors.

327
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,370
I'll try to visit you more.

328
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,970
Don't call me Empress Dowager.

329
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,849
Even if you sit on the throne,
I don't want to be called that.

330
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,130
I'm still your son.

331
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:26,050
If a son is Emperor,
you are the Empress Dowager.

332
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:29,450
You're just a thief
who stole my son's throne.

333
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,730
Let our Chungju family know
I'm coming for a visit.

334
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,090
If she calls you again,
you don't have to go.

335
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,170
Okay.

336
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:13,849
Whoever it is, they need my permission
to see you, got it?

337
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,730
Yes, Your Highness.

338
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:21,890
And...

339
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,290
Your Highness.

340
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,890
We're receiving complaints from all over.

341
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,330
About what?

342
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,410
They want the former Emperor's son
to be the lawful successor.

343
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,930
Minister Park Yeonggyu is
spreading rumors

344
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,450
that you fabricated the will.

345
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,849
Kill them.

346
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,090
Excuse me?

347
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,849
Execute the malcontents for treason.

348
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:08,849
Also kill all servants and soldiers
who were in Cheondeokjeon when Yo passed.

349
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:14,650
Anyone who doubts or makes excuses,
I want them all killed.

350
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,849
Kill them...

351
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,690
...all.

352
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:33,770
The Emperor is after me.

353
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:38,410
You were spreading malicious rumors.
Did you think you would remain unharmed?

354
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,530
Is that so?

355
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:45,730
Maybe I should reveal that
you were spying on 4th Prince and Baeka.

356
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,170
I won't go down alone.

357
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,450
You fool.

358
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,570
Boo!

359
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,250
Hey...
I remember this guy.

360
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,850
It's dirty.
You should change threads.

361
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,210
I don't want to lose it...

362
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,890
Was it from your parents?

363
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,730
I have to apologize
to your parents for something.

364
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,610
- What is it?
- Before we marry...

365
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,090
I need you to be adopted
into a noble family.

366
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:01,770
I guess my Hubaekje background
is a problem?

367
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:05,090
My mother and her family
have bad blood with your people.

368
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,730
They had family members slain
in front of their eyes.

369
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:12,130
If possible,
they want nothing to do with Hubaekje.

370
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:17,610
It was all before we were even born.
I know you're not directly involved.

371
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:22,090
I just don't want to make a fuss.

372
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,010
I'll visit your parent's grave
to apologize.

373
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:31,250
Wow.
So this is how Cheondeokjeon looks.

374
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,170
I...

375
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,290
I have a favor to ask.

376
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:55,730
I know there are court lady pardons
to celebrate the new Emperor.

377
00:40:56,849 --> 00:40:58,250
I was pardoned too.

378
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,810
I have to leave Damiwon.

379
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,849
Guess we won't see each other much.

380
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,250
Where are you headed?

381
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,490
Can't you help me stay here?

382
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,610
Can't you ask the Emperor?

383
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:27,849
What happened?

384
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,890
She said she'll ask the Emperor.

385
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,850
Good.
I need you to stay at Damiwon.

386
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,849
Can't I just...

387
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,410
...be with you?

388
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,530
I don't know when
my next pardon will be.

389
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:56,849
Chaeryeong.
I still need your help here.

390
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,930
When the time comes,
I will come get you.

391
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,250
Leave it in my room.

392
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:27,010
Yes, lady.

393
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,410
You ended up...

394
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,210
...with him.

395
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,330
You told me...

396
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,610
...it's greedy to ask for both.

397
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,410
But you went to him.

398
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,530
I don't understand.

399
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:05,130
He was honest with me.

400
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,730
He said he didn't want
to lose me or the throne.

401
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,210
He confessed his desires.

402
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,490
I had no choice but to understand.

403
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:27,810
I was always curious why you...

404
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,849
Why you never thought
I could become Emperor.

405
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:33,850
In your eyes...

406
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:37,610
...was I not worthy?

407
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,930
- It's not like that.
- Then what?

408
00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:52,090
Prince Wang So was
born with an Emperor's star.

409
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,849
Founding father knew that as well.

410
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,330
It's not your fault.

411
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,970
It's fate.
It's destiny.

412
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:08,130
Emperor's star?

413
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,210
Because of a star?

414
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,730
Fate?

415
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,730
Destiny?

416
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:31,530
My heart is towards you

417
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:39,130
It hurts to love you

418
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:41,450
Will you promise me?

419
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,050
That you'll never take it off.

420
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:55,130
Please do not forget

421
00:44:56,410 --> 00:45:00,849
My love never stops

422
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:10,570
If it's destiny,
it's okay if we have to wait

423
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:17,849
We will meet again

424
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,290
It's not your fault.

425
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,290
It's fate.
It's destiny.

426
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:35,849
A sad dream,
I turn around and cry

427
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:41,010
With all my heart, I hope one day

428
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:45,610
You will...
become Empress.

429
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:52,050
Are you going to help me?

430
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,530
He can't...

431
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,450
...have it all.

432
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,610
It's not fair.

433
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:15,970
Okay. Finished.

434
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,050
Why do you want this many?

435
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,330
I have my reasons.

436
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:34,730
Wasn't the food instead of paying rent?
I didn't know I had to pay it back.

437
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,490
You ate the whole thing, didn't you?

438
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:42,490
I was going to share it with
Baeka and astrologer.

439
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,850
Don't think of others.
Just me.

440
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:49,730
It's all mine.

441
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,810
Did something happen?

442
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:00,650
No.
Why do you ask?

443
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:07,010
It's just that...
you're laughing much more than usual.

444
00:47:14,849 --> 00:47:17,090
Don't meddle in
every single thing I do.

445
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,849
We're not even married yet.
Don't make me think otherwise.

446
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:26,010
I have nothing to do
but wait for you all day long.

447
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:30,650
Can't I work in Damiwon during the day?

448
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,330
I don't need to serve.
There's a lot of other work to do.

449
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,849
And...
about Chaeryeong.

450
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:46,490
I heard you are pardoning her.

451
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:49,570
Can't we let her stay?

452
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:54,650
She has nowhere to go
outside of the palace.

453
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:57,930
Chaeryeong?

454
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:00,610
Well...

455
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:04,010
I'll be lonely without her.
Please?

456
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,810
Please?

457
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,090
Okay. All right.

458
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:14,010
But...

459
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,210
You won't be lonely in a while.

460
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:22,210
When you raise our kids.

461
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:25,530
Kids?

462
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:31,490
Royal doctor will stop by.

463
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:34,370
If we want babies,
we need you healthy.

464
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:40,210
We're not even married yet.
It's too early to talk about babies.

465
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:41,890
Marriage?

466
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:45,090
All right.
When shall we do it?

467
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,410
You pick the date.

468
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:51,570
No.
I don't want to marry.

469
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:53,849
No?

470
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,970
I need a formal proposal.

471
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:02,849
Do you remember at the rock piles?
You had something to say.

472
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:07,170
I'm not stupid.

473
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,849
Weren't you about to propose?

474
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,970
Rock piles are out of reach now.

475
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:18,610
It's hard to leave the palace
with all this security.

476
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:21,930
Oh, well.

477
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,650
To marry you...

478
00:49:26,849 --> 00:49:29,849
do I need to think of
a satisfying proposal?

479
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:36,130
You are harder to deal with
than our state affairs.

480
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,850
Whatever it is,
I want you to be honest.

481
00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:02,050
I will choose what to tell
the Emperor myself.

482
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,770
Your knees are in bad shape.

483
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,650
After you were tortured...

484
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:12,130
you hadn't treated it properly.
It became a chronic problem.

485
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:16,090
You might not be able to
walk one day.

486
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:19,849
Okay.
I will be careful.

487
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:23,450
But the real problem is...

488
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,690
...your heart.

489
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:28,410
My heart?

490
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:31,050
When you are tired or in shock,

491
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:36,730
have you ever had a hard time breathing
or felt like you're about to faint?

492
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,130
Yeah, well...

493
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,410
You have suppressed anger.

494
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:44,410
Your mental stress
has eaten into your physical health.

495
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,210
At this rate...

496
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:50,849
I can't say for sure
that you'll live long.

497
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:55,130
What do you mean?

498
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:00,650
Am I dying soon?

499
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:09,450
It's okay.

500
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:13,690
Tell me how long I have left.

501
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:31,210
I will look after my health.

502
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:35,050
I'm still in my twenties.

503
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,770
Ten years is too short.

504
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,570
Let me live longer.

505
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:47,170
With him...

506
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,290
I want to be with him longer.

507
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,330
What are you praying so hard for?

508
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:11,970
Are you praying for brother So
to hold a long reign?

509
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:15,970
I want the manly 14th Prince
to be my friend again.

510
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,970
That's what I'm praying for.

511
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,010
You said you'd never take sides.

512
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:27,290
But you took 4th brother's side.
I feel betrayed.

513
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:32,410
Don't misdirect your anger.

514
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:36,849
It was the former Emperor who
murdered brother Mu and Eun.

515
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:40,849
The reason why brother So is Emperor...

516
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,450
It's fate.

517
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:48,370
Yeah, you might be right.

518
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:54,010
But I still think all this misfortune
started when brother So first got here.

519
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:56,810
Fighting over the throne
is nothing new.

520
00:52:56,849 --> 00:53:00,170
But once So got involved,
it became complicated and bloody.

521
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,330
I mean, he did steal the throne.

522
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,450
I'm worried you might get hurt.

523
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,010
Do you think
you can become an Empress?

524
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:15,290
Empress?

525
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:19,849
I don't know.

526
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,370
Never really thought about it.

527
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,849
An Empress...
with the help of her family and nobles

528
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:28,849
needs to support the Emperor.

529
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:32,850
That's why my father
married that many times.

530
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:38,849
If it goes on like this,
you will only become one of many wives.

531
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:41,170
Is that what you wanted?

532
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:45,330
Didn't you want to ride a camel
and explore the far oceans?

533
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:46,930
Didn't you mean it?

534
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:50,849
Remember what I said?

535
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:53,810
My message through Chaeryeong.

536
00:53:54,849 --> 00:53:57,370
That you know a way out of the palace?

537
00:53:57,849 --> 00:54:00,210
Let me know
when you get tired of this place.

538
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:03,210
If you want to leave...

539
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:05,890
I do know a way.

540
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:09,849
I will keep in mind.

541
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:33,850
8th Prince is here to see you.

542
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:45,930
Welcome.

543
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:50,410
I came to speak
as representative of your lieges.

544
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,930
- Representative?
- First...

545
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:01,810
As for the commanding officer
of the 300 thousand reserves,

546
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:04,450
let us lieges vote to decide.

547
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:07,090
Second...

548
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,810
Let local nobles manage 'po's.

549
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:11,410
PO
HARBORS STORING TAXED CROPS

550
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:14,650
For the rest,
once they pay their taxes

551
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:17,970
let them manage
their lands independently.

552
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,450
Then, you will soon have loyal lieges
fill up this place.

553
00:55:24,849 --> 00:55:27,130
Let go of control over
arms and funds?

554
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:31,010
Want me to clip off my wings?

555
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:35,850
If you thought lobbying would work...

556
00:55:36,849 --> 00:55:38,210
you're mistaken.

557
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:41,330
If not your wings...

558
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,050
...what about your heart?

559
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:50,970
Hwangju Hwangbo family
requests a marriage.

560
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,849
What a nice room.
Good taste.

561
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:06,370
Say what you need and leave.

562
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,970
I won't listen after today.

563
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:12,370
I didn't come to fight.

564
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:17,849
I just wanted to clear up
what we each want.

565
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:21,530
I didn't know we had
anything left to clear up.

566
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:26,690
Princess.
I don't need anything from you.

567
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:30,250
I will let you stay here...
if you want.

568
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:33,370
I mean, I'll accept you
as the Emperor's lover.

569
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:36,570
You can't be an Empress anyway...

570
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:40,849
I won't interrupt
you serving him from close by.

571
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,450
I don't understand...

572
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:46,849
what you're saying.

573
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:49,570
I only want honor and recognition.

574
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:53,849
And my son to be the next Emperor.

575
00:56:55,849 --> 00:56:58,410
I am about to marry the Emperor.

576
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:01,370
I will be his wife.

577
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:08,970
I...
will be Empress.

578
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:19,570
Once you marry Yeonhwa,
the nobles will come under your wing.

579
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,849
Hwangju Hwangbo family has your back.

580
00:57:22,849 --> 00:57:25,010
Don't try to manipulate me.

581
00:57:25,849 --> 00:57:27,490
Although I'm Emperor...

582
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:31,050
I still have a dog wolf's temper.

583
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:33,690
The throne...

584
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,930
Hard to obtain,
but harder to protect.

585
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:41,450
Now that you're up there,
you probably see clearly

586
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:44,890
that the nobles are
like a double-edged sword.

587
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:50,849
If you want to lengthen your stay,
you need the nobles on your side.

588
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:00,849
I already have another marriage in mind.

589
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,330
You mean Haesu?

590
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,730
She...

591
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:10,610
...can never be Empress.

592
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:16,330
If I say so...

593
00:58:17,849 --> 00:58:18,849
...she can.

594
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,490
Did you forget?

595
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:25,250
Haesu, in order to avoid
marrying our founding father...

596
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,450
she slit her wrist.

597
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,849
A women with a scar...

598
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:36,849
cannot marry the Emperor.

599
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,090
SCARLET HEART

600
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:00,770
You can protect your throne.

601
00:59:00,849 --> 00:59:04,290
I want our son to be
the next Emperor.

602
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:08,810
Dare manipulate me
by using the throne as leverage?

603
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:10,849
You can't leave.

604
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:13,730
You are my only Empress.

605
00:59:13,849 --> 00:59:15,490
Give up the marriage.

606
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:16,770
Let go first.

607
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:18,530
What should I do?

608
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:21,610
How could you do that?

609
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:23,330
Su.

610
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:25,410
You beat her to death.

611
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,930
I became a monster to her.

612
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,330
I will make them pay.
