1
00:00:02,417 --> 00:00:05,337
SCARLET HEART

2
00:00:10,297 --> 00:00:13,097
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS.

3
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:54,856
Leave it there.

4
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:27,457
Why wasn't I able to say it?

5
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:35,697
She wanted to hear it so much.

6
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:41,097
I couldn't say I love her.

7
00:03:45,577 --> 00:03:47,177
Because I thought I didn't.

8
00:03:53,257 --> 00:03:54,257
But, Su...

9
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:02,537
That heart was love, too.

10
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:09,777
I thought it was gratitude.

11
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:13,097
But it was love.

12
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,897
I just thought it was comfortableness.

13
00:04:26,777 --> 00:04:28,097
But that was love.

14
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,737
What should I do?

15
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:49,657
What should I do now?

16
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:57,737
I should've said so.
She waited for me.

17
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:05,617
I'm sure she knew it, too.

18
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:08,777
She would know...

19
00:05:10,297 --> 00:05:11,856
so stop crying.

20
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,417
Why...

21
00:05:20,897 --> 00:05:22,856
Why now?

22
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:28,937
After all she went through...

23
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:31,897
why am I feeling this now?

24
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,657
What would I be now, then?

25
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,537
What should I do from now on?

26
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:41,137
I can't think of anything.

27
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:06,057
Who is it?

28
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:09,297
Who...

29
00:07:18,017 --> 00:07:21,856
Oh, my! That naked guys
are the prince's!

30
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:28,337
How dare you!
You're in trouble, woman!

31
00:07:29,297 --> 00:07:31,857
What are you doing?
Stop being childish.

32
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:35,457
You're the one in trouble!
You should be punished, Prince.

33
00:07:38,097 --> 00:07:40,137
Let me go!

34
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:41,817
You let me go first!

35
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:50,097
- How dare you!
- Dare my foot!

36
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:51,737
How can you speak like that
to the Prince?

37
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:53,297
Prince my foot!

38
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:56,737
How dare you hit a woman?

39
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:58,057
You little...

40
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,777
My back.

41
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,217
What are you doing?

42
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:18,937
Mr. Prince.

43
00:08:19,017 --> 00:08:21,377
How dare did you just drop me?
You'll all be...

44
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:27,417
But...

45
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:32,457
I'll be merciful,
so you're forgiven.

46
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:34,137
Off you go, now!

47
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:36,257
Thank you, Your Highness.

48
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:42,777
How...

49
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,217
did you think of this puppet show?

50
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:47,337
I'm a bit impressed.

51
00:08:48,377 --> 00:08:49,417
You're the best.

52
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:52,257
I'm relieved to hear that.

53
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:55,577
I was worried that
you'll be discouraged after the funeral.

54
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:59,057
By the way, what is this?

55
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:05,856
Best! It means you're the best.
Out of 5 fingers, the thumb is the top.

56
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:09,777
No way! We have our Emperor alive yet.

57
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:14,017
Maybe, this will do good.

58
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:18,257
I like this, too.

59
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:22,057
Tenth Prince, you're the best.

60
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:24,417
I laughed, thanks to you.

61
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:30,017
I'm sure your best is only me.

62
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:33,417
Prince, you're the best today!

63
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:34,856
Of course.

64
00:09:34,897 --> 00:09:37,257
- Stop it.
- Prince. You were the best!

65
00:09:37,337 --> 00:09:38,457
Is that so?

66
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,217
- Stop, please.
- You're the most handsome one, Prince.

67
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:42,856
- Is that so?
- Please stop.

68
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:44,177
Who do you like the most?

69
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:45,897
- The Tenth Prince!
- I said stop.

70
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:57,657
The time goes by so fast.

71
00:09:57,737 --> 00:10:01,017
Well, it has been awhile
since I was here.

72
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:05,257
I was worried whether I could
live here at first.

73
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,817
But it's not too bad here.

74
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:10,817
But...

75
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:15,377
until when do I have to live as Haesu?

76
00:10:18,777 --> 00:10:23,856
I've always wanted to
tell you this, Hae Sister.

77
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:28,577
I'm sorry for everything.

78
00:10:30,537 --> 00:10:31,897
And thank you.

79
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:37,257
Haesu.

80
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:41,457
Sis! Haesu Sister!

81
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:43,737
Don't fall.

82
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,057
You go!

83
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:48,617
You go!

84
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:49,977
Sister!

85
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:51,857
Sister.

86
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,617
Have you been well?

87
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,137
Where have you all been?

88
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:58,217
Just around Lady Hae's burial ground.

89
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:00,097
She must be happy.

90
00:11:01,817 --> 00:11:06,177
If we acted faster, you'd tell
this to Lady Hae in person.

91
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:09,377
I have good news for you.

92
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,737
You'll get married.

93
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:16,657
Married...me?

94
00:11:21,457 --> 00:11:24,537
Having Su get married?

95
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:28,537
This is too sudden.

96
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:32,817
Come on, she's at the age already.

97
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:36,856
dogFortunately we have a
great family for her.

98
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:43,617
This must be really good
for her in her position.

99
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:50,457
I think it's too soon to talk about it
when her cousin just passed away.

100
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:54,097
We need to give her some time.

101
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:56,097
I think it's better for her.

102
00:11:56,177 --> 00:12:01,857
Staying in her dead cousin's house
too long won't help with her marriage.

103
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:05,937
I hope you can understand.
This is a great opportunity for her.

104
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,057
Getting married? Too sudden!

105
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:17,577
She's already reached the age though.

106
00:12:17,657 --> 00:12:19,977
Since you're here,
we should oppose this together.

107
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:22,377
It's Hae family's business.
It's not our position.

108
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,817
Brother!

109
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,617
Is it true that Haesu is getting married?

110
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,617
Is that right?

111
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:36,617
Eun said the husband is over 60,
and he has many sons already.

112
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:40,057
I'm so concerned
if Su even knows about this.

113
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:43,377
If that's true, it's not marriage,
it's selling her off!

114
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:45,857
That's right, she's been sold.

115
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:47,257
What did you say?

116
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:52,697
Say that again.
What family she's going into?

117
00:12:52,777 --> 00:12:56,857
Brother, you're too cruel!
How can you be so harsh to Su?

118
00:12:57,297 --> 00:13:01,537
That husband side must have
paid a fortune to Hae Family.

119
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:04,417
It's a shame to send her away like this!

120
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,017
I know you wouldn't do this.

121
00:13:12,377 --> 00:13:14,577
You guys need to
help me with something.

122
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:33,337
Chaeryeong, I'm going to leave.

123
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:34,417
What?

124
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:36,897
How can I live with a man
I've never seen before?

125
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:39,856
Lady Hae wouldn't want me
to get married this way either.

126
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:43,417
Give me that.
I'm going to run away. Hurry!

127
00:13:45,177 --> 00:13:46,577
OK.

128
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:47,817
Go.

129
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:51,337
Please go.
Even if I die beaten...

130
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:54,257
I won't tell where you went.

131
00:13:56,297 --> 00:13:58,537
Chaeryeong...

132
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:07,577
Su! Come on out!
Hurry!

133
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:22,017
Here!

134
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,297
Here.

135
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:04,057
OK.

136
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:07,617
Wait.

137
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:12,217
Go away now.

138
00:15:29,497 --> 00:15:31,457
Would it be OK?

139
00:15:37,856 --> 00:15:39,377
I can't let you go like this.

140
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:51,137
That's what she did.

141
00:15:56,377 --> 00:15:57,457
Brother?

142
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:02,537
Go after them!

143
00:16:14,856 --> 00:16:17,337
Stop there!
Stop!

144
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:19,177
Brother! Stop there!

145
00:16:24,257 --> 00:16:29,177
Stop! Stop there!

146
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:31,657
Stop!

147
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:43,177
Stop!

148
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:44,897
Brother, stop!

149
00:16:53,697 --> 00:16:56,377
How dare you block the way of the Prince!

150
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:58,057
Brother.

151
00:16:58,137 --> 00:17:01,856
Hi, Yeonhwa.
Is something going on back home?

152
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:04,737
I'm sorry, my niece has been

153
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:07,377
great trouble for you.

154
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:18,857
Are you looking for me?

155
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:23,137
Are you referring to
my brother as your niece?

156
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:28,137
Go the other way, now!

157
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:03,856
I didn't know you'd help me, too.

158
00:18:04,856 --> 00:18:06,657
I'm not doing this because
you're well behaved.

159
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:10,777
I just don't like to see
your life controlled by other people.

160
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,737
You wouldn't like it.

161
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:45,856
Go!

162
00:18:59,856 --> 00:19:01,537
Hello, Princes.

163
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:05,856
Why are you here?
What's all these soldiers?

164
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:09,856
Is she Su from the Eighth Prince's house?

165
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:13,617
She needs to come with me.

166
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:14,697
Why?

167
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:20,297
Did her husband-to-be
pay you or something?

168
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:21,377
Jimong.

169
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:23,737
Just let her go this time.

170
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:27,257
Don't you feel pity sending
her to that kind of man?

171
00:19:27,337 --> 00:19:29,657
You've been ordered to enter the palace.

172
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:36,617
What are you talking about? Why?

173
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:42,856
Don't tell me...

174
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:47,777
The lady and the King's marriage has been
decided, so I'm here to escort her.

175
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,337
No way...

176
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:59,737
- You must be mistaken.
- It's sudden, but I'm sure it's...

177
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:02,737
Inkyu's only daughter from
Hae family who'll get married to the King.

178
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:04,097
Did you hear anything about it?

179
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:05,737
No, not at all.

180
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:08,777
No way, why me?

181
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:12,097
Then you're good.
Don't get off, just wait.

182
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,297
Fourth Prince.

183
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:20,737
Hello.

184
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:22,856
You were here.

185
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:31,737
What happened?
She's getting married to the King?

186
00:20:33,337 --> 00:20:35,217
You heard it finally.

187
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:42,337
The King has recognized our Hae family's
loyalty, so he'll make us in-laws.

188
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:46,177
How come you didn't say
it was the King for Su?

189
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:52,937
She's no longer related to you
since Lady Hae has died.

190
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:56,457
If Su gives birth to the King's baby...

191
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:02,856
you'll have to compete later.

192
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:07,697
Were you afraid that we'll block it
if we knew about it?

193
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:11,817
I don't want to say another word.
Just go back.

194
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:16,897
Stay away.

195
00:21:18,217 --> 00:21:19,537
I said stay away.

196
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:25,057
You know what happens
if you refuse the King's order.

197
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:27,897
Let her go, Brother.
You can't stop them.

198
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:30,937
We'll all die because of this girl.

199
00:21:48,017 --> 00:21:49,297
I said don't move.

200
00:21:49,377 --> 00:21:51,737
I think I have to.

201
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:55,057
If you go now, you won't be
able to leave the palace.

202
00:22:01,777 --> 00:22:02,856
I have to go.

203
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,337
Or everyone will get hurt.

204
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:36,856
Are you sure you won't regret it?

205
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:42,057
Don't worry.
I'll try to talk to them.

206
00:22:46,737 --> 00:22:48,337
Please go inside the palanquin.

207
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:48,297
We're going back to the palace!

208
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,057
Stupid girl.

209
00:24:10,297 --> 00:24:13,217
The man over 60
with many sons was...

210
00:24:13,297 --> 00:24:16,537
Of course it's the Emperor!
How can you not notice it?

211
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:18,617
Jung.

212
00:24:19,537 --> 00:24:21,856
Then Su will be like my mother?

213
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:01,697
I can't just get married to
King Taejo like this, right?

214
00:25:03,457 --> 00:25:06,697
Wait, but living in Goryeo isn't
normal to begin with.

215
00:25:06,777 --> 00:25:08,856
Who knows how it will turn out?

216
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:17,856
You must gather your mind.

217
00:25:18,737 --> 00:25:20,537
Don't let your guard down.

218
00:25:21,097 --> 00:25:24,137
Hang in there.
You have to survive.

219
00:25:36,257 --> 00:25:39,217
IMPERIAL PALACE
DAMIWON

220
00:25:45,457 --> 00:25:47,856
Change the herb bag after 15 minutes.

221
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:02,856
The Empress has a severe headache
and she'd like to get some tea.

222
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:08,057
Send the mint tea immediately and add
Chrysanthemum tea and leave it longer.

223
00:26:08,537 --> 00:26:10,856
Court Lady!

224
00:26:12,617 --> 00:26:16,057
The astrologer has given
a notice for the Emperor's wedding.

225
00:26:16,856 --> 00:26:18,856
When and what family's lady?

226
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,457
This Damiwon was built to take care of
Emperor

227
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:31,297
and the loyal family's mind
and body.

228
00:26:31,377 --> 00:26:33,856
You'll get prepared for your wedding here.

229
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,977
Wait...

230
00:26:35,856 --> 00:26:39,737
I've never heard about
this marriage before.

231
00:26:40,217 --> 00:26:45,257
Can you ask the Emperor that with all
due respect, he must have misunderstood.

232
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,657
You'll nullify the marriage
with the Emperor?

233
00:26:47,737 --> 00:26:52,657
No, it's not the Emperor.
I just can't get marry a man I don't know.

234
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,137
Court Lady.

235
00:26:56,537 --> 00:27:01,257
My eyes have been looking for you
so desperately that they are bigger now.

236
00:27:01,737 --> 00:27:03,257
Is it her?

237
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,377
Lady Su from Hae's family.

238
00:27:07,337 --> 00:27:10,856
Since you're here,
I should go then.

239
00:27:14,457 --> 00:27:16,897
Just obey your destiny.

240
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:20,856
Jimong.

241
00:27:22,817 --> 00:27:26,737
You do not have to use
honorific language to a mere court lady.

242
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:29,537
Right.

243
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:30,857
Bring the lady in.

244
00:27:34,577 --> 00:27:35,737
Please come in.

245
00:27:44,777 --> 00:27:47,457
She's so hard.
So challenging.

246
00:27:47,856 --> 00:27:50,177
Why did the Emperor choose...

247
00:28:00,856 --> 00:28:04,137
Before the bath,
we'll examine your body.

248
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:05,856
Why?

249
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:08,697
If you have a scar,
you can't be an Empress.

250
00:28:08,777 --> 00:28:11,057
So you must go through this.

251
00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:12,657
No.

252
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:15,856
I don't have a scar.

253
00:28:15,856 --> 00:28:19,817
And I don't like people looking at
my body, I don't even go to public bath.

254
00:28:19,856 --> 00:28:21,777
And you're asking me
to take off my clothes?

255
00:28:21,856 --> 00:28:23,777
What are you doing?
What is it?

256
00:28:23,856 --> 00:28:24,856
Wait!

257
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:26,856
You have to spend your
first night with the Emperor.

258
00:28:26,856 --> 00:28:29,217
We don't have much time.
Please excuse us.

259
00:28:29,297 --> 00:28:32,377
Spending the night with him?
Wait! No!

260
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:34,657
I said stop!

261
00:28:34,737 --> 00:28:36,577
Wait!
Let me go!

262
00:28:37,856 --> 00:28:38,856
No!

263
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:41,377
Wait...

264
00:28:51,337 --> 00:28:52,337
Well...

265
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:56,856
it looks like a humble temple
rather than an Empress' room.

266
00:28:57,856 --> 00:29:02,697
That mirror looks so old.
Is it from your youth?

267
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:07,217
I must be the example
for people by living humbly.

268
00:29:10,856 --> 00:29:15,856
You must have heard about the wedding.
You're not going to stop it?

269
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:20,856
I shouldn't fuss about it
since he does it for the nation's sake.

270
00:29:20,856 --> 00:29:24,377
You prayed every day,
and you must became a Buddha now.

271
00:29:24,457 --> 00:29:26,777
He already has 29 wives.

272
00:29:26,856 --> 00:29:29,817
He must take care of
his family before the nation.

273
00:29:29,856 --> 00:29:34,057
Is he going to split the nation into 25
or something when he dies?

274
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:36,856
Please don't say such harsh words.

275
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:39,177
The Fourteenth Prince is here.

276
00:29:40,097 --> 00:29:41,577
Let him in.

277
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,057
I greet you, Your Highness.

278
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:48,856
Hello.

279
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:51,097
Mother, please help.

280
00:29:51,177 --> 00:29:55,257
Su from Eighth Brother's
house is getting married to the Emperor.

281
00:29:58,856 --> 00:30:01,377
So it was her all along?

282
00:30:02,856 --> 00:30:07,097
Now I see why you're relaxed.
You're relatives to Hae's family.

283
00:30:09,537 --> 00:30:13,537
Who can stop Emperor's wedding?
It's not within your control.

284
00:30:14,577 --> 00:30:17,697
This is a forced marriage.
Sister Su doesn't want this.

285
00:30:18,497 --> 00:30:19,737
Mother.

286
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,017
The Eighth Prince is here.

287
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,137
I greet you, Emperor Yu.

288
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:44,977
You're here without any notice.

289
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:48,497
- Well...
- You're here for Su, too, right?

290
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:53,777
See? This is a critical matter.
Please help with this, Mother.

291
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:55,977
I know you can.

292
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:58,537
OK.

293
00:30:59,577 --> 00:31:02,217
Do you really feel
uncomfortable about this marriage?

294
00:31:02,297 --> 00:31:03,697
Why?

295
00:31:06,697 --> 00:31:10,497
Because she's like my younger sister.

296
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,217
And it's too sudden.

297
00:31:13,297 --> 00:31:17,497
She's also the cousin
of his wife, of course he's concerned.

298
00:31:20,856 --> 00:31:22,897
It's the marriage with the Emperor.

299
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:26,097
Not sure what concern he'd have.

300
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:32,257
Princess!

301
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,617
Hurry.

302
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,777
We need to find a way to save Su!

303
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:52,337
She came here willingly.
Let her solve it on her own.

304
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:55,777
Then we'd all have been killed
if she insisted.

305
00:31:55,856 --> 00:31:59,097
Anyway, she shouldn't come here.

306
00:32:00,617 --> 00:32:01,737
No one can stop it now.

307
00:32:01,817 --> 00:32:03,297
Brother.

308
00:32:06,737 --> 00:32:11,737
By any chance, do you like her?
Is that why?

309
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:13,817
It's not for me...

310
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:19,856
Anyway, she's special to me.

311
00:32:21,777 --> 00:32:25,856
We drank together every day
since Lady Hae passed away.

312
00:32:26,497 --> 00:32:31,497
How come you never confessed
why you like her that much?

313
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:39,897
Because my mother is...

314
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:43,137
loyal family of collapsed Silla Dynasty.

315
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:47,817
Even we're the same loyal family,
the level is totally different.

316
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:51,737
Up until then your family
was too powerful.

317
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,057
I couldn't ask for Lady Hae at that time.

318
00:32:55,137 --> 00:32:57,057
Come on, not again!

319
00:32:57,137 --> 00:33:00,337
Please don't say that you "ask for"
a human.

320
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:03,856
A human isn't a thing.

321
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:09,737
After 1,000 years,
no human is above another human.

322
00:33:09,817 --> 00:33:13,817
Or no human below human.
Emperor? Funny.

323
00:33:13,856 --> 00:33:15,377
You'll get in trouble!

324
00:33:15,457 --> 00:33:17,697
It's not like you'll live forever!

325
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:23,977
Every time you people are so concerned
with the hierarchy and Emperor...

326
00:33:24,057 --> 00:33:25,617
Oh, well.

327
00:33:26,697 --> 00:33:29,617
Hey, Prince. Look.

328
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:35,217
Even if you live well,
you can die overnight. That's life.

329
00:33:35,856 --> 00:33:41,577
Or you can fall from heaven
and live like this here.

330
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:47,177
So just let it go, follow your heart.

331
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:51,217
Do whatever you want.
Live the way you want.

332
00:33:53,737 --> 00:33:55,097
OK?

333
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:01,457
OK?

334
00:34:01,537 --> 00:34:02,737
OK.

335
00:34:03,377 --> 00:34:06,377
She said that without fear?
And you just listened to her?

336
00:34:06,457 --> 00:34:08,017
Because she's not wrong.

337
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:10,856
Look at Goryeo now.
Corruption is everywhere.

338
00:34:10,856 --> 00:34:15,817
You have to have a good family
and good marriage to be recognized.

339
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:19,737
And you and I are out of
luck in that case.

340
00:34:20,856 --> 00:34:23,057
Even Princes are treated like this.

341
00:34:23,137 --> 00:34:25,217
I can't imagine what
it's like for regular people.

342
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:28,697
So? You'll take over
the loyal family or something?

343
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,137
Will you change this nation?

344
00:34:31,217 --> 00:34:34,297
I just want to be free.

345
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:37,457
Same for you, too.
Not to mention Haesu.

346
00:34:37,537 --> 00:34:40,697
She has no parents, no siblings.
She can't survive at the palace.

347
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:46,057
After tonight, she won't even be
able to see the Emperor again.

348
00:34:48,097 --> 00:34:51,817
She'll be suffocated like this.

349
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:11,337
We've finished the examination.
Please start the bath.

350
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:12,497
I want to be alone.

351
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:17,337
The wedding will start after sunset.
The Emperor is waiting...

352
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:20,697
- so we have to hurry.
- I said leave me alone!

353
00:35:23,377 --> 00:35:26,697
I didn't know I'd end up
like this until this morning.

354
00:35:26,777 --> 00:35:29,777
At least give me some time
to think about what's going on.

355
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:34,856
You can be yourself for awhile.
I'll go check with the bath's preparation.

356
00:35:45,217 --> 00:35:46,777
Marriage?

357
00:35:46,856 --> 00:35:48,377
Spend the night with the Emperor?

358
00:35:49,777 --> 00:35:52,737
No way.
Where should I go?

359
00:35:58,737 --> 00:36:02,217
That secret passage.
There must be a way to it.

360
00:36:50,856 --> 00:36:56,297
Your Majesty, Hae Family's Lady
Haesu is ready for the wedding now.

361
00:36:58,057 --> 00:36:59,856
Did you just say Su?

362
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:05,177
Is she the sister of the
Eighth Prince's wife?

363
00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:07,617
Yes, Your Majesty.

364
00:37:11,097 --> 00:37:14,856
Why her?
Hae Family is really greedy.

365
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:19,337
Would you like to cancel this now?

366
00:37:23,856 --> 00:37:28,817
Where else can we find a girl that
doesn't need a big wedding ceremony?

367
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:31,937
Let's just go.

368
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:01,856
Uk?

369
00:38:08,737 --> 00:38:13,337
The Eighth Prince dares to ask you
a favor, Your Majesty.

370
00:38:16,856 --> 00:38:21,177
A clever man like you
is blocking my way now?

371
00:38:23,856 --> 00:38:24,857
Already...

372
00:38:25,856 --> 00:38:30,537
there are too many families in the palace
and the tension among them is escalating.

373
00:38:32,457 --> 00:38:35,297
Why would you make
another family now?

374
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:37,217
I humbly ask.

375
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:41,417
I have a solid reason.
In order to stop the war with the Kitan,

376
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:44,097
we absolutely need Hae Family's support.

377
00:38:45,137 --> 00:38:49,497
Then what is your reason
for blocking this marriage?

378
00:38:56,177 --> 00:38:57,377
That's...

379
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:03,857
What if you have another option?

380
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:11,217
What are you all doing?

381
00:39:11,297 --> 00:39:15,937
Please listen to us
and reconsider this marriage.

382
00:39:18,337 --> 00:39:20,856
You're not afraid to die?

383
00:39:21,457 --> 00:39:26,337
I've found Hong from Hae Family
traded with the Kitan for horses.

384
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:32,497
We can punish them and
let another family guard the border.

385
00:39:33,097 --> 00:39:37,537
Or we can let Hae family, who's in need
manage horses to persuade them.

386
00:39:39,737 --> 00:39:44,417
There are many ways
to tame Hae Family other than marriage.

387
00:39:44,497 --> 00:39:47,097
Why should we give them
more power by marrying the family?

388
00:39:48,057 --> 00:39:49,537
Eunuch Lee.

389
00:39:49,617 --> 00:39:50,977
Yes, Your Majesty.

390
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:52,777
We'll expedite this marriage.

391
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:54,377
Yes, Your Majesty.

392
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:59,137
If we punish Hae Family
with the trading you mentioned,

393
00:39:59,217 --> 00:40:02,297
it'll only take half a day
for our enemy to break into our border.

394
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:06,457
If we let Hae Family
monopolize horse tradings,

395
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:10,137
do you think other families
will just sit and watch?

396
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:17,457
A reason in the palace isn't to find
a reason to make it work.

397
00:40:17,537 --> 00:40:20,737
It's to find an excuse to block the work.

398
00:40:22,137 --> 00:40:23,297
Do you understand?

399
00:40:24,697 --> 00:40:26,177
Your methods are all...

400
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:29,417
useless.

401
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:49,337
Su...

402
00:41:10,817 --> 00:41:12,137
That excuse...

403
00:41:16,657 --> 00:41:18,537
I'll find for you.

404
00:41:21,737 --> 00:41:22,737
What?

405
00:41:24,257 --> 00:41:25,297
I have a scar...

406
00:41:26,537 --> 00:41:32,057
on my body.
I can't be Empress then.

407
00:41:35,257 --> 00:41:36,857
So, please.

408
00:41:37,657 --> 00:41:42,097
Please let me go, Your Majesty.

409
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:07,177
You have more nerve
than a man.

410
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:13,297
Call in Hong from Hae Family.

411
00:42:13,377 --> 00:42:15,137
Yes, Your Majesty.

412
00:42:18,856 --> 00:42:20,097
Su!

413
00:42:24,217 --> 00:42:25,457
Su.

414
00:42:31,856 --> 00:42:32,856
Su.

415
00:42:37,457 --> 00:42:39,777
So the marriage went on?

416
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:43,337
I thought you'd ask the
Empress Yoo to stop!

417
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:47,537
What about you?
Have you asked Empress Kwangjong?

418
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,217
Don't even mention it.

419
00:42:50,297 --> 00:42:54,337
My grandfather caught me
begging Mother and Aunt, I got yelled at.

420
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:56,537
The punishment will be
at least a flogging.

421
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:59,177
I'm getting out of the palace.

422
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:01,737
Brother, but...

423
00:43:01,817 --> 00:43:02,856
Su.

424
00:43:05,577 --> 00:43:06,577
Su!

425
00:43:06,657 --> 00:43:07,657
Eunuch Lee.

426
00:43:07,737 --> 00:43:10,017
- Su!
- Sis!

427
00:43:12,617 --> 00:43:16,297
- Get a doctor, now!
- Su! Wake up!

428
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,097
Where am I?

429
00:43:37,217 --> 00:43:41,577
Right, I died, but didn't die.

430
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:45,337
Goryeo, King Taejo...

431
00:43:46,177 --> 00:43:47,617
Kwangjong?

432
00:43:48,457 --> 00:43:51,697
Why do I feel comfortable
about Kwangjong?

433
00:43:51,777 --> 00:43:54,097
There's something I'm missing.

434
00:43:56,657 --> 00:43:59,497
The Fourth King of Goryeo, Kwangjong...

435
00:43:59,577 --> 00:44:02,457
Right, Kwangjong is the Fourth King.

436
00:44:03,097 --> 00:44:06,777
He's the one who killed
other princes and subjects endlessly.

437
00:44:06,856 --> 00:44:10,177
The Fourth King of Goryeo, Kwangjong...

438
00:44:10,257 --> 00:44:12,057
Who is he?

439
00:44:12,137 --> 00:44:14,297
Which prince?

440
00:44:14,377 --> 00:44:15,657
Wait...

441
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:27,897
It's not.

442
00:44:29,856 --> 00:44:33,537
Right, you're still alive.

443
00:44:35,377 --> 00:44:40,097
You're still not a married woman, so I'll
take care of you instead of a doctor.

444
00:44:44,856 --> 00:44:47,577
I'm still in the palace, right?

445
00:44:49,737 --> 00:44:53,217
Yes, since you're still alive.

446
00:44:55,657 --> 00:45:00,177
Are you saying I can't go out
of the palace until I die?

447
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:07,097
The doctor said you'll have a scar.

448
00:45:10,137 --> 00:45:11,457
I knew that.

449
00:45:14,057 --> 00:45:17,217
You don't want to be
the Emperor's wife that badly?

450
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,737
You'll be rich and famous.

451
00:45:21,377 --> 00:45:26,257
I decide how I'll live my life.

452
00:45:27,856 --> 00:45:30,737
Everyone when they're young
thinks so once.

453
00:45:34,457 --> 00:45:39,417
You'll be greatly punished soon.
You should be ready for it.

454
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,177
I don't regret it.

455
00:45:44,377 --> 00:45:46,377
I protected what I needed to.

456
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:49,497
I can take the consequences.

457
00:45:57,057 --> 00:45:58,417
Rest, then.

458
00:47:16,577 --> 00:47:18,137
Everything is OK now.

459
00:47:20,777 --> 00:47:22,177
It's all over.

460
00:47:25,377 --> 00:47:26,737
The Emperor...

461
00:47:29,856 --> 00:47:30,897
has...

462
00:47:38,057 --> 00:47:41,257
cancelled the marriage,
with this scar as the reason.

463
00:47:44,657 --> 00:47:45,737
Instead...

464
00:47:46,817 --> 00:47:51,177
he gave fertile land to your Hae Family.

465
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:54,856
So you won't get any more pressure
from your family.

466
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,577
Just like the other night...

467
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:12,777
I feel pathetic...

468
00:48:15,817 --> 00:48:17,177
pathetic...

469
00:48:21,337 --> 00:48:24,297
and pathetic myself.

470
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:30,697
Even though I felt like
I'm the worst person...

471
00:48:33,856 --> 00:48:35,856
I still prayed to my dead wife...

472
00:48:38,856 --> 00:48:40,817
that if she made you return...

473
00:48:45,537 --> 00:48:48,856
I'd do everything for her
that I couldn't for my wife.

474
00:48:51,177 --> 00:48:53,617
I prayed her to forgive me
and give you back to me.

475
00:48:55,856 --> 00:48:56,977
I prayed.

476
00:49:03,177 --> 00:49:07,217
If you'd become
the Emperor's wife...

477
00:49:08,777 --> 00:49:10,897
I'd never forgive myself.

478
00:49:13,856 --> 00:49:15,217
I thought...

479
00:49:17,657 --> 00:49:19,497
I'd never see you again.

480
00:49:24,377 --> 00:49:26,857
I couldn't even say farewell.

481
00:49:28,817 --> 00:49:33,137
I didn't want to be apart that way.

482
00:49:34,856 --> 00:49:35,856
So...

483
00:49:47,856 --> 00:49:52,257
It won't happen again.
I've let you go once...

484
00:49:54,297 --> 00:49:57,137
but I won't ever do that again.

485
00:50:00,657 --> 00:50:01,856
So it's OK.

486
00:50:05,537 --> 00:50:06,856
It will be all right.

487
00:50:36,577 --> 00:50:37,577
Your Majesty.

488
00:50:38,137 --> 00:50:44,097
The stars are gone and the sun is back.
You should sleep for your health.

489
00:50:44,177 --> 00:50:45,697
I see.

490
00:50:49,057 --> 00:50:50,537
Your Majesty.

491
00:50:50,617 --> 00:50:53,377
Have you chosen a residence for Haesu?

492
00:50:58,417 --> 00:51:00,097
Even though I feel pity for her,

493
00:51:00,177 --> 00:51:01,856
she still can't be forgiven
for rejecting the marriage.

494
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:05,617
Send her as a slave.

495
00:51:07,817 --> 00:51:12,777
What about make her a court lady?
Choongju and Hwangju...

496
00:51:12,856 --> 00:51:17,417
And Kwangju Lady all asked for her.

497
00:51:17,497 --> 00:51:19,856
I bet you asked them all to do that.

498
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:24,257
What kind of relationship
does she have with all princes?

499
00:51:24,337 --> 00:51:27,177
Even the Eighth and the Fourth!

500
00:51:29,856 --> 00:51:32,377
I don't want any more trouble.

501
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:33,977
However...

502
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,017
Court Lady Oh also requested her.

503
00:51:41,817 --> 00:51:42,897
From Damiwon?

504
00:51:42,977 --> 00:51:46,697
I heard she's interested in medicine.

505
00:51:46,777 --> 00:51:51,697
She knows a lot, too.
She'll be a great asset under Lady Oh.

506
00:51:57,856 --> 00:51:59,297
Where is she now?

507
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:48,377
I want to go greet Lady Hae.

508
00:52:49,697 --> 00:52:54,377
Sure, let's go together.
I've asked help from her for you.

509
00:52:54,457 --> 00:52:58,257
She must like to see us together.

510
00:53:31,577 --> 00:53:35,137
Cancellation is cancellation. Why does
he have to make her a court lady?

511
00:53:35,217 --> 00:53:36,856
Right?

512
00:53:36,856 --> 00:53:41,137
But it's better than being a slave.

513
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:46,137
Right. I didn't have anywhere to go.
And I heard you get salary, too.

514
00:53:46,217 --> 00:53:47,856
It's better now that
I can take care of myself.

515
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:53,537
Of course. If you're from a noble family,
they treat you differently.

516
00:53:53,617 --> 00:53:57,297
If you work hard,
Emperor will get you married

517
00:53:57,377 --> 00:53:59,537
and you can also leave the palace.
So good luck.

518
00:53:59,617 --> 00:54:03,377
- Leave the palace? Really?
- Yes.

519
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:06,417
Lady Su, let's hurry.

520
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:16,856
I guess we'll have to go to
Sister Hae later.

521
00:54:20,777 --> 00:54:24,217
Let's think it's fortune
to avoid heavier punishment as he said.

522
00:54:26,257 --> 00:54:28,217
Don't worry too much.

523
00:54:29,217 --> 00:54:30,777
I don't.

524
00:54:31,137 --> 00:54:34,617
I can do anything.
And I'm smart.

525
00:54:34,697 --> 00:54:36,257
So I learn fast.

526
00:54:37,537 --> 00:54:40,017
I'll be a great asset.

527
00:54:41,017 --> 00:54:42,657
You know it better.

528
00:55:19,537 --> 00:55:22,817
I'll visit you every day.

529
00:55:31,097 --> 00:55:32,257
Su!

530
00:55:32,856 --> 00:55:35,257
- Sister!
- Su!

531
00:55:39,617 --> 00:55:40,617
Sis!

532
00:55:41,057 --> 00:55:43,577
- Sister
- Come my way.

533
00:55:43,657 --> 00:55:46,457
Su, I thought you were dead.

534
00:55:46,537 --> 00:55:48,856
I don't die that easily.

535
00:55:49,697 --> 00:55:52,457
I tried to save you but...

536
00:55:52,537 --> 00:55:54,897
I couldn't do "you go, man".

537
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:57,617
Right, thanks for your concern.

538
00:55:57,697 --> 00:56:01,817
Stop surprising people.
You have too much time.

539
00:56:03,377 --> 00:56:08,057
Enough of that.
It's her first day of work.

540
00:56:08,137 --> 00:56:09,577
Right, Court Lady Oh is strict.

541
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,817
She's a scary one.

542
00:56:10,856 --> 00:56:13,297
I'll come by often, don't worry.

543
00:56:13,856 --> 00:56:18,057
Among these, there's the next King.

544
00:56:18,856 --> 00:56:20,297
Who is it?

545
00:56:20,856 --> 00:56:24,177
Who'll become Kwangjong and
kill all the brothers?

546
00:56:24,856 --> 00:56:27,777
No way. It shouldn't happen.

547
00:56:34,377 --> 00:56:35,537
No...

548
00:56:36,657 --> 00:56:39,417
I think your life isn't easy.

549
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:41,457
How many times have you
come close to death already?

550
00:56:41,537 --> 00:56:44,097
Right, next time you'll certainly die...

551
00:56:44,177 --> 00:56:45,737
- Stop it!
- Stop!

552
00:56:46,577 --> 00:56:48,057
Stop!

553
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:52,217
Lady Su. Hurry up.
From this point, you're on your own.

554
00:56:52,297 --> 00:56:54,057
Court Lady Oh is waiting for you.

555
00:57:15,777 --> 00:57:18,337
You'll be just fine.
You go.

556
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:27,856
Sister.

557
00:59:04,856 --> 00:59:07,337
I'll do anything to make it as before.

558
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:09,417
I know you want to.

559
00:59:09,497 --> 00:59:11,657
- So don't worry.
- Wait for me.

560
00:59:11,737 --> 00:59:14,177
I didn't know I could be happy
from hearing "wait for me".

561
00:59:14,257 --> 00:59:15,856
You, just come to me.

562
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:18,737
Can you cancel all of
your previous marriages?

563
00:59:18,817 --> 00:59:21,417
Why do you want to live in Songak?

564
00:59:21,497 --> 00:59:24,856
Well, I'm a prince, too.
I should see how it's like in the palace.

565
00:59:24,897 --> 00:59:28,617
Think it through,
the real reason for it.

566
00:59:28,697 --> 00:59:30,856
Thanks for being my first friend.

567
00:59:30,856 --> 00:59:34,856
She's always lucky. Now she's
getting help from the Crown Prince.

568
00:59:36,057 --> 00:59:39,817
You could've died. Don't
ever do it again. I won't forgive you.
