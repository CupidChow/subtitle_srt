00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:05,976
SCARLET HEART

2
00:00:10,816 --> 00:00:13,216
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS.

3
00:01:10,976 --> 00:01:15,696
I mean, you have a grand room
in the Prince's quarters.

4
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:18,175
Why do you want to stay here?

5
00:01:22,136 --> 00:01:25,016
This is my space.
Only mine!

6
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:30,696
Are you arguing that you solely own
a part of the imperial palace?

7
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:34,496
- Not exactly.
- Enough said.

8
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:39,776
Trespassing is one thing,
but, really? Because you're a prince?

9
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:43,296
I can't see the sky from my room
in the Prince's quarters.

10
00:01:48,696 --> 00:01:50,736
I can't see the stars
that only shine on Goryeo.

11
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:53,056
Stars that only shine on Goryeo?

12
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:55,536
No such thing.

13
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:13,776
Mung bean, angelica root, rhizome,
aconite root, snake gourd, spikenard.

14
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:16,056
Aroma ginger, sweetgrass, loosestrife.

15
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:18,056
And even aroma parsley powder!

16
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:21,176
Our Prince sent them.

17
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:22,976
Our Prince?

18
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:25,616
I was looking for
an indoor hobby for you.

19
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:27,896
He said you like herbs.

20
00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:35,096
What are you planning to do
with all these herbs?

21
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:38,216
Bath soap.
I'll make soap for you.

22
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:46,376
In front of your eyes
I'm here for you

23
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:51,896
Please, with your lips...

24
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:56,736
Before I knew it,
I'm running to you

25
00:02:56,856 --> 00:03:00,816
Send my heart with the wind...

26
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:06,216
Like my cousin sister said,

27
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,736
do you think the Empress would like it
if I made soap for her?

28
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:13,896
Of course. No one in Goryeo
would refuse a nice soap.

29
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:27,336
A complicated day,
I try to work around it with my smarts

30
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:32,336
I just realized
everyone is gone except for you

31
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:37,456
I saw you last spring by chance,
I hope it's not by chance any more

32
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:42,336
I want to hold your hand
and walk along this road together

33
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:46,856
In front of your eyes,
I'm here for you

34
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:50,176
Please, with your lips...

35
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:57,175
Before I knew it,
I'm running to you

36
00:03:57,536 --> 00:04:01,175
Send my heart with the wind...

37
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:08,816
'I need you'.

38
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:17,216
Baby, what I want to say to you
what I couldn't say to you

39
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:24,496
'Baby, baby, baby boy
love is true'.

40
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,896
I've never seen her so happy.

41
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:41,175
She's excited it's for the Empress.

42
00:04:43,696 --> 00:04:45,175
Though she doesn't say so,

43
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:47,176
she's probably oppressed
from losing her memory.

44
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:51,175
Well, she remembered something...

45
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:54,016
I'm glad.

46
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:59,616
She has acted mature after the incident.

47
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,016
Sometimes she's even
more mature than I am.

48
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:06,176
While other times,
she's cute, fit for her age.

49
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,896
Once I contemplated on
sending her back home,

50
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:16,016
but now I'm glad I didn't.

51
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:23,616
I want to find a good man
for her here.

52
00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:35,056
I want her beside us for a long time.

53
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,736
I want to keep seeing her smile.

54
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,016
Yeah.

55
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:47,136
I...

56
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:49,296
agree.

57
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:31,616
I want to send a letter back home.
Will you help grind the ink stick?

58
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:34,376
Come to the study after dinner.

59
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:47,175
Cousin, I'm here.

60
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,896
Cousin wanted me to
help grind the ink stick.

61
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,136
She was coughing badly.
She went to bed.

62
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:15,976
She asked me to
write the letter for her.

63
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,136
Oh, okay.

64
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,616
The ink stick...

65
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:41,136
- ...is over here.
- Oh, okay.

66
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:41,416
Come Away Home,
a poem by Tao Yuanming.

67
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:44,776
- I assume you know it?
- Oh, yes.

68
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:53,336
When she sends letters,
she always includes a poem.

69
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:08,616
- What about you?
- Yes?

70
00:09:10,856 --> 00:09:13,736
I'm asking if you like Tang poetry
or folk songs.

71
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:17,376
Between Tang poetry...
and folk songs?

72
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:19,576
Folk songs, of course.

73
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,096
Really?

74
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,016
What a surprise.

75
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:28,056
A noble lady attracted to
songs sung by commoners...

76
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:30,976
What?
Are songs different here?

77
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:34,175
Oh, songs in Goryeo
were only for the lower class.

78
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:38,175
Actually I like poetry
better than folk songs.

79
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:56,576
Then...

80
00:09:57,816 --> 00:09:59,336
...this poem is for you.

81
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:09,856
For some reason,
I want to give it to you.

82
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:19,936
Happy reading.

83
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:22,336
Thank you.

84
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:54,776
- Chaeryeong.
- Yes, miss.

85
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:56,176
Come here.

86
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,296
I got this as a present.

87
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:05,856
You know...

88
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:10,456
after I hit my head,
I forgot how to read.

89
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:11,656
What?

90
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:15,376
I was wondering
if you could read it for me.

91
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:18,175
I don't know how to read.

92
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,175
I only know my name...

93
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,175
I'm sorry.

94
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:45,736
Yang, Ryu, Chung, Chung,
Gang, Soo, Pyeong!

95
00:11:47,175 --> 00:11:50,175
I can read it one by one, but...

96
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:52,976
as a sentence,
it's like an alien language.

97
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:59,016
I'm illiterate in this time period.
I'm doomed.

98
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:12,296
Handsome writing,
just like his handsome looks.

99
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:16,256
I wish I knew the meaning.

100
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:20,256
Oh, I want to read...

101
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:26,256
Wanna read, wanna read,
wanna read, wanna read!

102
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:29,056
Should have paid attention
in Chinese class.

103
00:12:29,175 --> 00:12:30,216
What's up?

104
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:33,576
- Oh my god.
- Are you illiterate?

105
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:38,216
I...

106
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:42,175
I know how to, but...

107
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:45,576
I forgot after I hurt my head.

108
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:49,256
- Let me see.
- I'm good.

109
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:51,136
I'll read it for you.

110
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:52,936
Let's see.

111
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:57,696
The willows are green,
the river is serene.

112
00:12:57,936 --> 00:12:59,376
By the river...

113
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:05,175
You...

114
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:08,576
In the east, the sun rises,
in the west, rain falls.

115
00:13:09,776 --> 00:13:12,016
Though they say the sun is naught,

116
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:14,936
to me the sun is aglow.

117
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:18,176
A good poem.

118
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:22,175
Tang poet Liu Yuxi's
Song of Bamboo Twigs.

119
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:26,175
Do you know what it means?

120
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:31,175
So, there are willows by the river.

121
00:13:32,175 --> 00:13:36,016
Probably admiring the beautiful landscape?

122
00:13:37,056 --> 00:13:40,056
Since you're illiterate,
you probably didn't write it yourself.

123
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,856
Who gave this to you?

124
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:45,376
8th Prince gave it to me to study.

125
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:55,216
You really don't know how to read?

126
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:58,456
- Are you pretending?
- No.

127
00:13:58,736 --> 00:14:01,056
Why would I pretend that?

128
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:07,016
What a nice poem by our Prince.
You should repay him with your own.

129
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:12,175
Tomorrow we're visiting the Empress,
so prepare to enter the Imperial Palace.

130
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:13,376
The palace?

131
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:15,816
- I'm going to the palace?
- Yes.

132
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,175
To present the soap you made.

133
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:22,336
Okay, I'll make sure I'm ready.

134
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:31,296
Is brother insane?

135
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:34,656
It's just a scenery poem.

136
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,816
Song of Bamboo Twigs
is a love poem.

137
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:41,456
Switch "sun" with "love" in the last line
and it's about a wavering heart.

138
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:43,136
You know that!

139
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:45,376
When you got married, I...

140
00:14:58,175 --> 00:14:59,256
No...

141
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:05,175
You knew.

142
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:09,176
You already knew...

143
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:12,296
...about my brother's change of heart.

144
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:14,976
Right?

145
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:16,896
Baeka...

146
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:27,256
Please finish the painting
before the day ends.

147
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:29,136
Sis...

148
00:15:38,175 --> 00:15:41,656
The willows are green,
the river is serene.

149
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:44,616
The man sings
of what happiness brings.

150
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:51,816
Though they say the sun is naught...

151
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:54,496
but it was aglow?

152
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:04,175
No way.

153
00:16:06,936 --> 00:16:08,976
No other meaning.

154
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:21,016
No!

155
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:26,056
Stop interpreting.
The Prince is just...

156
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:28,536
He's just my landlord.

157
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,175
Think of him as my landlord.

158
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:38,936
If I put my mind to it,
then it is what it is.

159
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:42,296
My mind...

160
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:50,776
Only a landlord...

161
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:39,056
What's gotten into you?
You rarely visit me here in Damiwon.

162
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:43,536
I heard my son Uk wanted to visit
with his wife and her cousin.

163
00:17:43,616 --> 00:17:45,576
My daughter-in-law is sick.

164
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:48,175
I was planning to get some
herb tea from court lady Oh.

165
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:51,736
Why does everyone trust Oh so much?

166
00:17:52,256 --> 00:17:54,376
She's just a court lady,
not a doctor.

167
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:59,136
By the way,
Jeong has really grown up.

168
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:02,175
I heard he was planning
to receive private tutoring.

169
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:05,096
The royal teacher is 70.

170
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:08,175
He needs someone who has
more to teach than just wisdom.

171
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:13,256
Who does Uk learn from?

172
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:16,616
He tends to read books
over and over again.

173
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:20,216
If a question arises,
he discusses it with the royal teacher.

174
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:24,175
He didn't want a private tutor.

175
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,096
Is there a tutor I don't know about?

176
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:30,376
My boy is much too young
to put up your guard for.

177
00:18:33,056 --> 00:18:34,896
8th Prince is here.

178
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,216
Greetings to both Empresses.

179
00:18:56,456 --> 00:18:59,496
Glad to see you.
So, you're Haesu?

180
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:02,416
I've never seen you up close.

181
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:04,816
How pretty.

182
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:07,816
Greetings to the Empress.

183
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:11,696
She's my daughter-in-law's
cousin sister Su.

184
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:13,096
Yes.

185
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,175
Is she the one Jeong mentioned?

186
00:19:20,696 --> 00:19:22,736
The girl who hit 10th Prince?

187
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,175
I've heard much about you.

188
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:30,656
Getting along well with my boys.

189
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:36,136
Greetings to Empress Yu.

190
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:41,456
Su made a present for the Empress.

191
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:58,296
Oh my.

192
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,856
How lovely.
I've never seen anything like it.

193
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:08,776
Use it to cleanse, and your skin
will glow, ma... ma'am.

194
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:21,696
Thank you, dear.
I will cherish it.

195
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:27,976
We have another for you too,
Empress Yu.

196
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:30,256
For me?

197
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:39,416
I heard you like aroma.
Please.

198
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:49,016
You must be happy to have a
fine daughter-in-law.

199
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:53,336
It's a pity she has no luck
in having babies.

200
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,776
Great fortune doesn't come easy,
they say.

201
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:03,376
Thanks for your concern.

202
00:21:06,136 --> 00:21:07,856
The Emperor is here.

203
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:15,576
Taejo Wang Geon!
The man who founded Goryeo!

204
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,576
I've only seen him in TV shows.

205
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,176
Now in real life.

206
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:21,016
Awesome!

207
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:24,416
Greetings.

208
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:26,896
Looks like you're having a good time.

209
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:32,416
I heard you were ill.

210
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:36,136
I'm better now.
Thanks to you, your majesty.

211
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:46,175
Is this perhaps the girl
who had a fight with Eun?

212
00:21:50,696 --> 00:21:52,336
They were just playing.

213
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:54,656
Leaving a mark on a Prince's face.

214
00:21:55,175 --> 00:21:56,856
That is not playing.

215
00:21:58,536 --> 00:22:02,536
She's just a poor little girl.
I'm sure they were just playing.

216
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,416
A terrible mistake, your highness.

217
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:12,656
Are you scared of me?

218
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:17,256
Stay calm.

219
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,816
A tyrant ruler imposes fear,
a merciful ruler imposes virtue.

220
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:26,816
You are merciful...

221
00:22:27,656 --> 00:22:29,416
so I'm not scared.

222
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:33,736
Merciful...

223
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,336
Why do you think I'm merciful?

224
00:22:50,776 --> 00:22:53,816
Trying to avoid the moment
by flattering me?

225
00:22:55,936 --> 00:23:00,016
No, please, please, please,
think of something.

226
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,376
Three...

227
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:09,376
You united the Three Kingdoms
and founded this country.

228
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:16,496
And you treated the conquered people
equally with important positions.

229
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,776
And...
And...

230
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:21,175
And...

231
00:23:22,696 --> 00:23:24,175
Balhae!

232
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:26,496
Although Balhae perished,
you were loyal to them.

233
00:23:26,616 --> 00:23:28,496
That's why you're merciful.

234
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:50,136
She's quite clever.

235
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:53,136
Middle school history teacher...

236
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:55,616
I'm sorry I hated you
when you made me memorize all this.

237
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:57,656
Thank you, you're awesome!

238
00:23:57,816 --> 00:24:00,776
So, you're not only good at fighting.

239
00:24:02,896 --> 00:24:06,456
Present this child with
Pasa Land's Mojeon.

240
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:07,696
Yes, your highness.

241
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:09,976
PASA LAND - PERSIA
MOJEON - CARPET

242
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:12,576
A precious carpet?
She's forever in debt.

243
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:21,175
Su.

244
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:23,216
Thank him.

245
00:24:26,496 --> 00:24:29,496
I'm forever in your debt, your majesty!

246
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,096
Where's the bathroom?

247
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:49,336
I was nervous as hell in there.
Oh, my belly.

248
00:24:49,776 --> 00:24:51,576
Where's the bathroom?

249
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:56,576
Where is it?

250
00:25:21,175 --> 00:25:23,136
Wow.

251
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:30,576
Why are you here?
You don't belong here.

252
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:33,376
You look different.

253
00:25:35,216 --> 00:25:37,175
Now you look like a prince.

254
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:39,736
I was born a prince.

255
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:42,256
And you?

256
00:25:44,296 --> 00:25:46,536
Trying to spy on us bathing again?

257
00:25:47,175 --> 00:25:49,976
8th Prince brought me.
We had a present for the Empress.

258
00:25:50,056 --> 00:25:51,736
Tour of the palace is a plus.

259
00:25:55,175 --> 00:25:58,616
- Getting comfy here?
- Of course.

260
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:02,256
Like you said,
it's where my parents and brothers live.

261
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:06,776
Still, it's quite huge for a house.

262
00:26:07,296 --> 00:26:09,656
Must be hard to
even spot your parents.

263
00:26:29,976 --> 00:26:32,936
You got to stay as you wanted.
Enjoying your success?

264
00:26:35,175 --> 00:26:39,176
I put you in Shinju to ease tension.
But you had to mess it up.

265
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:41,656
Useless.

266
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:44,256
Same age as Uk,
but so different.

267
00:26:47,576 --> 00:26:51,376
Only good at killing, and no smarts.

268
00:26:51,616 --> 00:26:53,376
You don't belong here.

269
00:26:56,176 --> 00:26:58,175
Thanks for your concern.

270
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,496
I promise you, mother...

271
00:27:02,175 --> 00:27:05,175
...I will try with my life
to never be a burden to you.

272
00:27:36,175 --> 00:27:38,016
Is she really his mom?

273
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:42,336
Even I feel bad.

274
00:27:45,376 --> 00:27:47,576
Maybe I should have said goodbye.

275
00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:57,976
Is what you want to say?
More important than your health?

276
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:07,336
Anyone here?
Call the royal doctor!

277
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,576
I need to speak to my Empress.

278
00:28:12,175 --> 00:28:13,496
Dear...

279
00:28:13,656 --> 00:28:15,256
You told me on my wedding day that

280
00:28:15,616 --> 00:28:17,936
since I was a great support to Prince,

281
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:21,816
you would grant me any wish I want.

282
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:26,936
However difficult it might seem...

283
00:28:27,696 --> 00:28:29,175
you said you'd grant it.

284
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:36,496
Dear, what do you want?

285
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:43,976
Let Haesu...

286
00:28:46,816 --> 00:28:48,816
...be the Prince's new wife.

287
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:55,736
I don't have...

288
00:28:59,056 --> 00:29:02,175
My days are limited.
You know that.

289
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:24,016
Greetings to the Prince.

290
00:29:25,656 --> 00:29:27,856
Jimong, we're on our way back
from meeting mother.

291
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,936
Hey, you know me, right?

292
00:29:31,096 --> 00:29:32,175
What?

293
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:35,936
You've met me before.
Even had a drink.

294
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:39,576
That is quite absurd.

295
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:46,576
Su, have you met
astrologer Choe Jimong before?

296
00:29:46,656 --> 00:29:48,175
Of course!

297
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:55,175
Are you sure you don't know me?

298
00:29:56,376 --> 00:29:58,936
I've been looking all over for you.

299
00:29:59,656 --> 00:30:02,456
I said I don't know you, miss.

300
00:30:02,856 --> 00:30:06,056
I just found out you're the cousin of
8th Prince's wife.

301
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:09,136
We were different then.
It wasn't in Goryeo.

302
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:12,096
Like...
One thousand years...

303
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:14,376
One thousand years from now
at the lake park.

304
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:15,896
Be careful.

305
00:30:16,175 --> 00:30:17,175
Yes?

306
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:19,856
Inside the palace...

307
00:30:22,816 --> 00:30:25,856
Be careful of what you say.

308
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:29,175
You can't just blurt out
everything on your mind.

309
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:31,536
Especially if it's about the throne
or the royal family.

310
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,496
When in Goryeo,
do as the Goryeo people do.

311
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:40,336
Of course you can't change your life
even if you wanted to.

312
00:30:40,976 --> 00:30:44,096
You can't change your life
even if you wanted to.

313
00:32:10,256 --> 00:32:14,456
So, have you really met
Choe Jimong before?

314
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:19,856
I thought so, but I guess I was wrong.

315
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:22,696
Okay.

316
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:25,175
Excuse me.

317
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:46,656
When making soap for the Empress,
I made one for you too.

318
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:51,456
You've been so good to me.

319
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:54,496
Even teaching me poems.

320
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,456
Thank you.

321
00:33:13,136 --> 00:33:17,136
So, do you know
the meaning of the poem?

322
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,776
Of course.

323
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:24,175
The willow are green by the river.

324
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:26,576
The man sings
of what happiness brings.

325
00:33:27,496 --> 00:33:30,175
A beautiful poem.

326
00:33:33,976 --> 00:33:35,175
Okay.

327
00:33:36,136 --> 00:33:38,016
So will you reply
with your own poem?

328
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,136
What?

329
00:33:40,736 --> 00:33:43,175
When gifted a poem,
it's courteous to reply with your own.

330
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:47,536
Write one that you like for me.

331
00:33:52,176 --> 00:33:53,536
Okay.

332
00:34:17,175 --> 00:34:19,056
Another mistake!

333
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,856
The paper is white,
the letters are black.

334
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:33,896
I can't just copy letters
without knowing what they mean.

335
00:34:35,176 --> 00:34:40,416
My mind is going insane,
all effort in vain.

336
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,656
I don't know what to write in poems.

337
00:34:47,176 --> 00:34:49,896
What should I do?

338
00:34:50,736 --> 00:34:53,136
Shouldn't have said yes.

339
00:34:54,536 --> 00:34:56,096
I give up!

340
00:35:57,496 --> 00:36:00,175
- Jeong!
- Come on, give it back!

341
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,936
Su!

342
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:10,896
What are you doing here?
Came to see me?

343
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:14,176
No, not really.
Had to drop something off.

344
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:15,816
Food?

345
00:36:20,175 --> 00:36:21,176
This?

346
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:24,175
Yeah, it's nothing.

347
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,936
Oh...

348
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:35,736
I taught her a poem.
So I asked for a reply.

349
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:37,175
- You can go now.
- Yes, sir.

350
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:51,816
Brother.

351
00:36:53,856 --> 00:36:56,776
Let's see what she wrote.

352
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:58,216
Hey...

353
00:37:10,056 --> 00:37:13,416
What is this?
A poem? A drawing?

354
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:16,816
Stupids.
Let me see.

355
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:26,816
You can...
you can read this?

356
00:37:36,816 --> 00:37:38,496
You know, it's...

357
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:46,175
Hmm, is this a letter or...

358
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:48,376
a drawing?

359
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:51,016
I really can't tell.

360
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:55,616
What about you?

361
00:38:00,175 --> 00:38:01,175
Raise your hands.

362
00:38:07,776 --> 00:38:09,136
Straight up.

363
00:38:11,696 --> 00:38:13,096
Open your mouth.

364
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,536
Round shape.

365
00:38:20,936 --> 00:38:22,856
Yeah, you got it.

366
00:38:23,016 --> 00:38:25,416
Brother, stop joking around.

367
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:28,896
Oh, it really is!

368
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:30,936
- It is this!
- Let me see.

369
00:38:35,096 --> 00:38:37,336
Brothers, look at this.

370
00:38:38,576 --> 00:38:39,976
It's a happy face.

371
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:41,896
Yeah, a happy face.

372
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:44,336
She must have liked your poem a lot.

373
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:49,016
You try.

374
00:38:50,456 --> 00:38:52,816
Brother, you too.

375
00:38:55,336 --> 00:38:56,736
Hey, you!

376
00:39:00,376 --> 00:39:01,616
Stop.

377
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:10,096
What are you doing?

378
00:39:10,175 --> 00:39:11,296
Yes?

379
00:39:12,376 --> 00:39:14,176
How can you do this
to your cousin?

380
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:17,136
To a wonderful woman.

381
00:39:19,175 --> 00:39:22,936
Don't you know how much she loves him?
Who do you think you are?

382
00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:25,176
What did I do?

383
00:39:28,216 --> 00:39:29,896
"What did I do?"

384
00:39:31,696 --> 00:39:35,096
Secretly watching each other,
and with each accidental touch...

385
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:37,216
thinking about it for days.

386
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,976
What does he like to eat?

387
00:39:43,216 --> 00:39:44,976
What does he like to laugh at?

388
00:39:45,656 --> 00:39:47,456
In your head all day long.

389
00:39:50,336 --> 00:39:52,456
Whatever you see,
you think of him.

390
00:39:53,496 --> 00:39:56,056
You two, in pain,
thinking of each other!

391
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,376
Did you think no one would know?

392
00:40:02,216 --> 00:40:03,576
I know...

393
00:40:04,776 --> 00:40:05,976
and your cousin knows.

394
00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:10,776
She knows everything.

395
00:40:11,936 --> 00:40:13,256
She does?

396
00:40:14,096 --> 00:40:15,176
Listen carefully.

397
00:40:17,175 --> 00:40:19,136
He's her everything.

398
00:40:19,576 --> 00:40:23,256
She knows only him...
But you!

399
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:26,256
If you hurt her...

400
00:40:29,856 --> 00:40:31,976
...I will make you pay.

401
00:41:12,256 --> 00:41:14,216
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

402
00:41:14,696 --> 00:41:16,256
It's my fault.

403
00:41:18,216 --> 00:41:20,096
I said I wouldn't be a burden...

404
00:41:21,776 --> 00:41:23,896
...but I became the heaviest one.

405
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:26,896
It's not your fault, Su.

406
00:41:30,175 --> 00:41:32,096
Who gave you the poem,

407
00:41:33,175 --> 00:41:34,576
who received the poem,

408
00:41:36,175 --> 00:41:39,096
who wanted to make you laugh...
It was all me.

409
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,175
It's all my fault...

410
00:41:46,736 --> 00:41:49,616
Don't blame yourself.
Please don't.

411
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:54,576
I knew how fickle our minds are...

412
00:41:56,376 --> 00:42:00,096
but I let it be.
Thought it would take care of itself.

413
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:05,296
Holding your hand...

414
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:11,175
...on the way out of the room.
It's all my fault.

415
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:19,736
Please...

416
00:42:21,696 --> 00:42:23,175
...don't say that.

417
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:31,216
I didn't want to cry...

418
00:42:32,936 --> 00:42:34,256
...in front of you.

419
00:42:47,136 --> 00:42:48,856
I'm sorry.

420
00:42:56,776 --> 00:43:03,776
Though we want to part ways,
our memories connect us

421
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:09,296
Even when we are in different spaces

422
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:17,175
It hurts to love you

423
00:43:17,176 --> 00:43:24,175
It's sad I can't empty my heart

424
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:32,856
With all my heart,
I hope one day

425
00:43:34,175 --> 00:43:41,136
I can love you

426
00:44:04,256 --> 00:44:07,136
Thought it was time to
change your pillow sheet.

427
00:44:07,376 --> 00:44:10,336
Even the Great Jade Emperor
would be happy to see this.

428
00:44:10,936 --> 00:44:12,616
I'm still honing my skill.

429
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:17,175
They say fathers grow to
love their daughters more.

430
00:44:17,216 --> 00:44:18,696
I'm becoming one.

431
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:24,175
I wonder which lucky lad
will get to marry you.

432
00:44:24,936 --> 00:44:27,536
I trust whoever you choose.

433
00:44:29,175 --> 00:44:32,936
I want you to live a easy life
like my elder daughter Sukui.

434
00:44:33,175 --> 00:44:35,136
It's a pity I can't see her often.

435
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:38,175
But she says she's happy
living as Madam Nakrang.

436
00:44:41,896 --> 00:44:46,816
Do you want me to live
far away like her?

437
00:44:48,696 --> 00:44:50,896
Why?
Does it bother you?

438
00:44:52,976 --> 00:44:56,776
Wherever you choose, father,
I will be happy.

439
00:44:57,175 --> 00:45:00,256
I'm sure you'll find the right man for me.

440
00:45:01,816 --> 00:45:05,175
Every word out of your mouth
is like a song to me.

441
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:10,136
You are the sunshine
to this old man.

442
00:45:10,576 --> 00:45:12,175
Thank you, father.

443
00:45:31,056 --> 00:45:32,296
Brother.

444
00:45:35,175 --> 00:45:36,175
Yes.

445
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:42,976
I'm still getting used to
seeing you here.

446
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,175
I'm not comfortable yet, either.

447
00:45:48,175 --> 00:45:50,936
- Did you come to see father?
- Yes.

448
00:45:52,175 --> 00:45:55,976
I think father is planning to
send me away to marry.

449
00:45:56,976 --> 00:46:00,175
Is that so?
Do you know with whom?

450
00:46:02,056 --> 00:46:05,696
- It's...
- Why? Do you think it could be you?

451
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,856
Let go of your false hope.

452
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:18,296
I'm surprised father
let you inside the palace.

453
00:46:19,216 --> 00:46:22,175
Don't even dream about
him letting you marry her.

454
00:46:23,376 --> 00:46:27,175
Why, do you want to bet?

455
00:46:27,776 --> 00:46:30,016
Why would you bet on a
losing proposition?

456
00:46:30,256 --> 00:46:31,976
Ask Yeonhwa...

457
00:46:32,175 --> 00:46:37,816
if she'd want to live
with that ugly face forever.

458
00:46:42,536 --> 00:46:47,096
I don't want someone pretty.
I want someone who loves me.

459
00:46:48,175 --> 00:46:50,296
Someone who will cherish me.

460
00:46:50,856 --> 00:46:54,136
That someone needs to know
how valuable you are.

461
00:46:54,256 --> 00:46:58,296
I regard you, Yeonhwa,
as the best bride in this land.

462
00:46:58,696 --> 00:47:01,296
You're always generous to me.

463
00:47:03,256 --> 00:47:05,176
What about you?

464
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:11,175
Do you want me to evaluate you?

465
00:47:12,175 --> 00:47:15,656
I don't want a valuable woman.
I want a woman who loves me.

466
00:47:18,296 --> 00:47:21,416
A woman who doesn't care about
my ugly looks.

467
00:47:31,096 --> 00:47:32,256
It's all wordplay.

468
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:37,896
He pretends he is noble,
but inside he is just a beast.

469
00:47:40,175 --> 00:47:43,216
How would it feel to
change a beast into a man?

470
00:47:44,776 --> 00:47:46,656
I'm sometimes curious.

471
00:48:54,175 --> 00:48:55,376
Cousin!

472
00:48:57,376 --> 00:49:00,175
Sister, are you okay?

473
00:49:08,256 --> 00:49:11,256
Chaeryeong!
Chaeryeong!

474
00:49:11,776 --> 00:49:13,896
Anyone?
Chaeryeong!

475
00:49:13,976 --> 00:49:15,016
Su...

476
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:17,175
Where...

477
00:49:18,175 --> 00:49:21,656
Where does your heart lie
towards the Prince?

478
00:49:33,656 --> 00:49:35,175
You fool...

479
00:49:37,376 --> 00:49:38,696
Both of you...

480
00:49:40,176 --> 00:49:41,496
Fools.

481
00:49:47,576 --> 00:49:48,776
Can you...

482
00:49:52,016 --> 00:49:53,696
Can you make me pretty?

483
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:56,576
What?

484
00:49:58,296 --> 00:49:59,936
I want...

485
00:50:02,976 --> 00:50:06,696
I want his last memory of me
to be beautiful.

486
00:50:10,536 --> 00:50:12,175
Sister...

487
00:51:00,136 --> 00:51:01,296
Su.

488
00:51:02,856 --> 00:51:05,696
You have a fire body type,
so you will easily catch the cold.

489
00:51:07,016 --> 00:51:09,736
Always have honey-soaked ginger handy.

490
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:14,536
You'll always be around royals.

491
00:51:16,175 --> 00:51:19,016
Be careful of what you say,
what you do.

492
00:51:21,576 --> 00:51:25,175
Also, I'm worried about your temper.

493
00:51:28,616 --> 00:51:30,216
And my Prince...

494
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:38,496
Make sure his pillow sheets
are always clean.

495
00:51:40,936 --> 00:51:43,016
He has too many concerns.

496
00:51:43,576 --> 00:51:47,016
I want him to at least sleep well.

497
00:51:51,936 --> 00:51:53,175
Please...

498
00:51:55,576 --> 00:51:57,336
Take good care of him.

499
00:52:41,296 --> 00:52:43,616
Prince!
Sir!

500
00:52:47,496 --> 00:52:49,216
- Su.
- My sister...

501
00:52:50,175 --> 00:52:53,896
She's looking for you.
Hurry, let's go.

502
00:53:10,736 --> 00:53:14,816
We better go inside, dear.

503
00:53:17,176 --> 00:53:18,696
I wanted to...

504
00:53:20,175 --> 00:53:25,096
I wanted to walk in the snow with you.

505
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:29,096
Do you remember?

506
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:35,336
When we first met?

507
00:53:43,216 --> 00:53:49,896
I am happy to be with you

508
00:53:51,016 --> 00:53:57,336
I can dream because I am with you

509
00:53:59,175 --> 00:54:04,456
You weren't totally comfortable,
but I insisted we marry.

510
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,296
Temporarily banned from the palace...

511
00:54:09,175 --> 00:54:11,736
With your wings clipped...

512
00:54:12,936 --> 00:54:16,736
I wanted to help you stand up again.

513
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:25,216
Honey.

514
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:32,856
I thank you for everything you did.

515
00:54:34,175 --> 00:54:37,176
I want to give you all I have

516
00:54:37,496 --> 00:54:42,696
Please be with me...

517
00:54:43,016 --> 00:54:48,175
Forever

518
00:55:01,776 --> 00:55:08,175
My last ounce of love,
I want to use it for you

519
00:55:11,616 --> 00:55:13,136
Now...

520
00:55:14,536 --> 00:55:16,736
I want you...

521
00:55:18,256 --> 00:55:20,816
...to take care of Su.

522
00:55:23,776 --> 00:55:25,175
Think of...

523
00:55:26,776 --> 00:55:28,336
...all I gave you...

524
00:55:29,896 --> 00:55:31,496
...and give it back...

525
00:55:32,976 --> 00:55:34,216
...to Su.

526
00:55:38,656 --> 00:55:41,376
Honey.
Dear!

527
00:56:03,496 --> 00:56:05,175
I keep...

528
00:56:07,296 --> 00:56:09,256
...thinking of...

529
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:13,296
...what you said before.

530
00:56:16,136 --> 00:56:17,176
That I...

531
00:56:20,336 --> 00:56:22,936
...do not love you.

532
00:56:27,736 --> 00:56:28,856
Honey...

533
00:56:29,936 --> 00:56:32,496
- I do love...
- I know...

534
00:56:34,736 --> 00:56:37,016
No need to say it.

535
00:56:41,336 --> 00:56:42,576
But...

536
00:56:44,856 --> 00:56:47,175
...it's okay that...

537
00:56:49,456 --> 00:56:51,175
...I love you...

538
00:56:54,376 --> 00:56:55,976
...more.

539
00:57:18,016 --> 00:57:19,175
Sis...

540
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:26,816
Blown away by the seasons

541
00:57:27,696 --> 00:57:33,776
Fallen flower petal

542
00:57:34,736 --> 00:57:40,456
Alone by itself

543
00:57:41,696 --> 00:57:43,136
Shh...

544
00:57:46,056 --> 00:57:48,416
Don't wake her up.
She's just asleep.

545
00:57:48,936 --> 00:57:54,976
The stars have left

546
00:57:55,536 --> 00:58:01,175
The sky in sorrow

547
00:58:02,696 --> 00:58:08,696
Like the raindrops falling

548
00:58:09,336 --> 00:58:14,696
I can only shed tears

549
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:23,536
My heart wrenches

550
00:58:25,016 --> 00:58:29,576
Do you know?

551
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:37,096
I will come back

552
00:58:53,056 --> 00:58:54,256
SCARLET HEART

553
00:58:54,816 --> 00:58:56,656
What should I do, Su?

554
00:58:56,736 --> 00:59:00,096
I should have told her.
She must have been waiting.

555
00:59:01,336 --> 00:59:05,816
What now?
I can't think straight.

556
00:59:06,816 --> 00:59:08,416
You're awesome.
You're the best.

557
00:59:08,536 --> 00:59:11,736
It's a pity you only have me.
The best of the best.

558
00:59:11,936 --> 00:59:13,936
Do you love her?

559
00:59:14,096 --> 00:59:15,496
I'm getting married.

560
00:59:15,616 --> 00:59:17,496
How do you marry
someone you've never met?

561
00:59:17,616 --> 00:59:19,216
This isn't marriage.
This is a trade.

562
00:59:19,376 --> 00:59:21,216
Why do you treat Su so harshly?

563
00:59:21,336 --> 00:59:24,696
- It's Hae family business.
- She'll suffocate to death.

564
00:59:24,856 --> 00:59:27,616
You must know how to
revoke this marriage.

565
00:59:27,976 --> 00:59:30,096
Does this marriage bother you?

566
00:59:30,536 --> 00:59:33,175
I thought I'd never see you again.

567
00:59:33,976 --> 00:59:35,216
I can't send you off like this.

568
00:59:46,936 --> 00:59:49,175
SCARLET HEART
