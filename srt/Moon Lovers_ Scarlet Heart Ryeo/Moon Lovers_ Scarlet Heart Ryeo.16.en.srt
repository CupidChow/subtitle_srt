1
00:00:02,077 --> 00:00:05,277
MOON LOVERS:
SCARLET HEART RYEO

2
00:00:10,237 --> 00:00:12,997
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS.

3
00:00:16,957 --> 00:00:18,477
The order is to capture
the Tenth Prince!

4
00:00:18,557 --> 00:00:19,757
-Hurry!
-Yes, sir!

5
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:34,796
Please take the Prince
with you.

6
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:36,917
What?

7
00:00:37,757 --> 00:00:39,917
They're not going to kill me
because of my father,

8
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:42,437
you're their target.

9
00:00:42,517 --> 00:00:45,677
No, I want to go with you.

10
00:00:51,037 --> 00:00:52,637
I'll be right with you.

11
00:00:56,637 --> 00:00:57,796
I promise.

12
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:02,237
I trust you.

13
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:16,397
As she said, you have to hide.

14
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:22,277
No, I can't hide behind
my wife, it's embarrassing.

15
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:24,517
Prince!

16
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:33,117
What else can I do?
I'm her everything.

17
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:39,077
She only has me.

18
00:01:58,317 --> 00:02:00,917
EPISODE 16

19
00:02:03,597 --> 00:02:07,237
I heard you know where Eun is.
Where is he?

20
00:02:08,477 --> 00:02:12,117
Haesu hid them in Damiwon.

21
00:02:12,197 --> 00:02:14,837
How do you know?
Did you see them yourself?

22
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:19,117
Eun used to love to make things
out of towels

23
00:02:19,197 --> 00:02:21,797
like dogs or birds.

24
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:24,397
With paper he made boats.

25
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:30,077
In Damiwon, there were many
things that he made, I'm sure.

26
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:42,837
What's going on?

27
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:43,997
What are you all doing?

28
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:49,796
General, the royal military and
the Tenth Prince

29
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,757
are having a confrontation
at Damiwon.

30
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:54,037
My daughter.

31
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:44,877
You should leave now.

32
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,997
Shut up.
I will protect you.

33
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:53,237
Brother! Let us go!

34
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:56,796
Please! If you let us go,

35
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:58,917
we'll never come back
to Goryeo.

36
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,517
Please remember our childhood
together.

37
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:24,477
Dear.

38
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:42,357
It's OK, it's alright.

39
00:04:46,117 --> 00:04:49,157
It's fine, let's go together.

40
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:59,277
Sunduk. Sunduk!

41
00:04:59,357 --> 00:05:02,437
No, not so soon.

42
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,796
Sunduk.

43
00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:01,477
Get out of the way.

44
00:06:01,557 --> 00:06:03,557
Do you have to do this?

45
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:07,796
You need to exterminate
any possible treason for peace.

46
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:09,757
Get out.

47
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:14,796
Stop!

48
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:09,237
Eun!

49
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:27,796
On my birthday...

50
00:07:30,197 --> 00:07:34,277
you promised that you'll give
everything I want, remember?

51
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:44,277
You said it was the gift
only you can give to me.

52
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:53,957
That woman...

53
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:58,317
I couldn't leave her alone.

54
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:24,877
Brother.

55
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:27,997
Can you please kill me...

56
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:34,117
That's the gift only
you can give.

57
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:00,597
No.

58
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:34,157
Brother!

59
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:36,637
Brother.

60
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,597
Brother Eun.

61
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:45,997
Wake up.
Please open your eyes.

62
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:06,237
Oh no, were you waiting for me?

63
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:09,557
You're the first girl who ever
treated me,

64
00:13:09,637 --> 00:13:12,077
the prince, like that.

65
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:13,637
What the...

66
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:15,837
What?

67
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:20,117
You're the best.

68
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:22,796
There is the Emperor,
how can I dare be the best?

69
00:13:23,796 --> 00:13:25,757
Maybe I can handle this.

70
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:28,796
Let me go!
Come on!

71
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:31,237
Happy birthday to you.

72
00:13:32,237 --> 00:13:33,796
First love...?

73
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:53,517
I told her so.

74
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:58,437
The Thirteenth Prince
is good-looking...

75
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:03,796
and the Fourteenth Prince
has great fighting skill.

76
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:08,277
So I told her to get married
to one of them.

77
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:11,237
But this little one insisted...

78
00:15:12,237 --> 00:15:14,077
to get married to
the Tenth Prince.

79
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:18,717
Saying that he's
her first love.

80
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:27,597
I'd have stopped her
if I knew this would happen.

81
00:15:29,197 --> 00:15:31,517
No, she'd still have gone
even if she knew this happened.

82
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:36,796
Sunduk is that kind of girl.

83
00:15:39,157 --> 00:15:41,957
She's naive and arrogant.

84
00:15:46,357 --> 00:15:48,317
Let me ask you one thing.

85
00:15:51,997 --> 00:15:53,717
My Sunduk...

86
00:15:56,477 --> 00:16:01,437
was she loved by
the Prince a lot?

87
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,197
A lot...

88
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:09,077
He loved her very much.

89
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:13,717
They loved each other.

90
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:20,796
Then it's good.

91
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:24,677
Then everything is good.

92
00:16:27,197 --> 00:16:30,517
Then there's nothing else...

93
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,757
Nothing else I can do for you.

94
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:54,796
I'll kill him.
I will kill So for sure.

95
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:03,796
No, please.

96
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:08,157
I will kill him
before he kills everyone!

97
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:13,357
He wanted it.
Prince Eun asked for it.

98
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:18,477
It's not his fault.

99
00:17:20,477 --> 00:17:21,957
He's in great agony, too.

100
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,037
Jimong.

101
00:17:55,796 --> 00:17:57,037
I think...

102
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:01,157
I have to be a dog
that unleashes its own leash.

103
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,517
The dog that bites its master
to death...

104
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:09,397
and takes the master's house.

105
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,597
I'll be an insane dog.

106
00:18:41,796 --> 00:18:46,796
I, Wang So, will be
the Emperor of Goryeo.

107
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:55,957
Eun is dead.

108
00:18:57,796 --> 00:18:59,157
The couple is gone together.

109
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:03,796
Now the Wanggyu's rebellion has
become real,

110
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:06,117
not a made-up story.

111
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:09,277
Congratulations.

112
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:12,317
Now the nobles will stay low.

113
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:15,197
Let's announce the move
of the capital soon.

114
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:18,757
Uncle Wang Sikryum will be
satisfied as well.

115
00:19:27,796 --> 00:19:30,837
Since he's a rebel,
we cannot give him a funeral...

116
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,717
nor wear a cloth of mourning.

117
00:19:36,237 --> 00:19:38,357
He can't be buried
in the loyal tomb.

118
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:44,277
He was thrown out in the field
for birds to feed themselves.

119
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:46,357
We have collected the bodies
secretively and buried them.

120
00:19:49,796 --> 00:19:55,277
The arrows in his body
wouldn't be pulled out

121
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:56,957
so Jung had to break them all.

122
00:19:58,117 --> 00:19:59,237
Eun has...

123
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:03,557
remembered that birthday.

124
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:08,796
Even I forgot about it.

125
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:14,437
He said it was the gift
only I could give to him.

126
00:20:20,557 --> 00:20:21,757
Eun will appreciate...

127
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,397
what you did to him today.

128
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:30,957
Prince.

129
00:20:36,197 --> 00:20:39,557
Now I have just found the
letter that Lady Haesu left.

130
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:43,997
She said that the
Tenth Prince was at Damiwon.

131
00:21:42,237 --> 00:21:45,557
Now you look at me
like a monster, too?

132
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:48,317
I killed Eun.

133
00:21:49,197 --> 00:21:51,117
I know it was...

134
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,437
a hard decision.

135
00:21:54,117 --> 00:21:55,957
Why did you hide
that he was in Damiwon?

136
00:22:01,677 --> 00:22:03,237
You didn't trust me.

137
00:22:04,117 --> 00:22:06,477
You didn't tell me because
you thought I'd kill Eun.

138
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:09,437
Yes...

139
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:12,597
you're right.

140
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:18,796
I was worried about
the Tenth Prince, but...

141
00:22:20,796 --> 00:22:24,597
I was also afraid that you'll
have a hard time as well.

142
00:22:27,437 --> 00:22:30,157
I thought covering it up
would resolve the issue.

143
00:22:34,157 --> 00:22:36,197
I learned it too late that...

144
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,796
it can hurt both sides.

145
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,477
That's why I left the letter.

146
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:46,796
I trusted you.

147
00:22:47,796 --> 00:22:50,757
It took some time,
but I trusted you.

148
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:54,997
I found out I'd trust you
no matter what...

149
00:22:57,997 --> 00:23:00,237
because I like you that much.

150
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:05,796
But not anymore for me.

151
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:13,277
When I see you,

152
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:16,037
it will only remind me
what happened because of you.

153
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,117
Eun died because of you.

154
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:23,157
And I killed him
because of you.

155
00:23:25,757 --> 00:23:26,877
My heart didn't change

156
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:30,437
when I became the Emperor's dog
to save you.

157
00:23:32,197 --> 00:23:33,197
But it's now changed.

158
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:43,677
Let's end here.

159
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:49,117
You're lying.

160
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,037
You're lying now.

161
00:23:59,717 --> 00:24:03,517
We promised not to lie.

162
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:06,157
The Fourth Prince Wang So.

163
00:25:07,397 --> 00:25:11,477
My trusted brother has shown
his loyalty

164
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:14,277
by killing the Tenth Prince
and Sunduk.

165
00:25:14,357 --> 00:25:15,757
So

166
00:25:15,796 --> 00:25:19,796
I grant the land for his house
and the land around the Songak.

167
00:25:20,557 --> 00:25:25,357
Also as we move our capital
to Seokyung...

168
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:28,117
he'll be in charge in building

169
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:29,837
the palace to show
my trust in him.

170
00:25:30,637 --> 00:25:32,117
I will do my best...

171
00:25:33,677 --> 00:25:35,717
to repay your trust.

172
00:25:42,677 --> 00:25:44,437
Even after
all that bloodshed...

173
00:25:46,157 --> 00:25:47,677
you're not even afraid?

174
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:51,677
Bloodshed is inevitable if you
want to sit in this chair.

175
00:25:53,796 --> 00:25:55,317
You be careful, too.

176
00:25:55,397 --> 00:25:56,597
I won't go easy on you forever

177
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:58,077
because we have
the same mother.

178
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:00,117
I'll be around the borders,

179
00:26:00,197 --> 00:26:02,796
and I won't be back here
for awhile.

180
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:03,796
Suit yourself.

181
00:26:05,437 --> 00:26:07,717
But avoid the front line
for Mother.

182
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:09,557
Go to the procurement group.

183
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:13,597
Since I have a history of being
a coward I can't do that again.

184
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:17,357
I can test how lucky
I am and...

185
00:26:18,597 --> 00:26:21,197
I must pay for your sin
as much as I can.

186
00:26:26,796 --> 00:26:29,037
I got these from Eun.

187
00:26:47,957 --> 00:26:49,317
Brother!

188
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:52,197
Please let us go!

189
00:26:55,517 --> 00:26:58,277
Please! Brother!

190
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:11,197
I must to go the temple
to pray.

191
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:23,637
Now you're the director for
construction

192
00:27:23,717 --> 00:27:25,877
and have a fortune as a prize.

193
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,477
Live the long life as that's

194
00:27:29,557 --> 00:27:32,437
the price of my daughter
and son-in-law.

195
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:41,117
How can he be human?
He killed his own brother.

196
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:21,837
I heard you'll
become the Emperor.

197
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:26,997
I will.

198
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:33,796
That charlatan astrologer
always said that.

199
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:37,157
He sees the star of Emperor
on the Fourth Prince.

200
00:28:38,796 --> 00:28:44,677
That's what the previous
Emperor said so, too.

201
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,597
So he sent me to you to teach
martial arts.

202
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:51,157
It's all because
of the astrology.

203
00:28:51,237 --> 00:28:52,357
Star of the Emperor?

204
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:54,597
I don't buy that.

205
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,796
But I'll still become one.

206
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:03,157
If people kill each other
for the seat,

207
00:29:03,796 --> 00:29:06,796
I'll become the owner of that
seat, and prevent it.

208
00:29:09,717 --> 00:29:11,717
I won't give up until I die.

209
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:16,796
You decide now
if you'll go with me.

210
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:26,796
I'm your younger brother.
It's destined, I'm in.

211
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,796
I need to be responsible for
what I said,

212
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:34,317
the star of the Emperor.

213
00:29:41,677 --> 00:29:45,637
Do you remember what
the late Emperor said?

214
00:29:47,796 --> 00:29:52,157
"The Emperor should be able
to abandon anyone...

215
00:29:53,477 --> 00:29:58,557
for the sake of the country
and the loyal family."

216
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:00,477
I do remember.

217
00:30:01,796 --> 00:30:02,796
Then...

218
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:06,677
who would you abandon?

219
00:30:08,796 --> 00:30:09,796
I will...

220
00:30:10,796 --> 00:30:16,317
decide after seeing that first.

221
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:35,157
So left for Seokyung already.
He won't be back for awhile.

222
00:30:58,677 --> 00:31:00,317
I will wait.

223
00:31:41,717 --> 00:31:44,357
THIRD YEAR OF EMPEROR
JEONGJONG (YEAR OF 948)

224
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:47,077
Court Lady Haesu!

225
00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:49,677
I told you not to run.

226
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:51,677
You're not promoted,
please act calm.

227
00:31:51,757 --> 00:31:55,317
Let's go, you have to see
who's here!

228
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:59,077
-Who?
-He's here after 2 years!

229
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:08,037
You said not to run.

230
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,197
It's been a long time.

231
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:42,837
Long time no see.

232
00:32:54,757 --> 00:32:55,796
Please sit.

233
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:11,277
I came 2 days earlier
just to drink this tea.

234
00:33:13,517 --> 00:33:17,157
But then I've seen Eun's tomb.
I had to stop by there.

235
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:20,997
Good job.

236
00:33:21,077 --> 00:33:23,197
I've also bragged to the
sister-in-law.

237
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:25,796
I told her I've accomplished
more than her now.

238
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:30,517
You're the great general now.
What is that childish comment?

239
00:33:31,557 --> 00:33:35,077
I've worried that you might
have left the palace already.

240
00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:37,037
Where would I go?

241
00:33:37,117 --> 00:33:39,677
You're not getting married?

242
00:33:39,757 --> 00:33:42,277
A noble child can leave the
palace after the marriage.

243
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:46,957
I have to take care of someone
else because of the marriage.

244
00:33:47,037 --> 00:33:51,717
After I retire of old age,
I'll travel around.

245
00:33:52,437 --> 00:33:56,237
I'd ride camels in deserts and
I'll go to sea oceans too.

246
00:33:58,317 --> 00:34:03,677
I've saved up a lot so far.

247
00:34:14,597 --> 00:34:15,757
It's been awhile.

248
00:34:15,796 --> 00:34:19,637
You've won the big time
with the Kitans.

249
00:34:19,717 --> 00:34:20,796
Yeah...

250
00:34:26,277 --> 00:34:27,717
I'm Woohee.

251
00:34:27,796 --> 00:34:29,397
She's the head Court Lady of
entertainment.

252
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:32,677
She's here to prep
the service meetings.

253
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:34,477
Court Lady of entertainment?

254
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:38,237
Oh, that gisaeng?

255
00:34:39,557 --> 00:34:40,957
You still have no barrier of
relationship.

256
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,757
After a murderer,
now a gisaeng.

257
00:34:45,796 --> 00:34:46,957
Watch your mouth.

258
00:34:47,037 --> 00:34:48,796
You be careful of him.

259
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:51,477
You never know if he'll
kill you too.

260
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:55,877
Oh, and stop sending that spy
disguising as a pipe player.

261
00:34:55,957 --> 00:34:57,877
What kind of spy plays a pipe?

262
00:34:57,957 --> 00:34:58,957
What should we do with you?

263
00:34:59,037 --> 00:35:01,757
You've become doubtful
after the hardship.

264
00:35:08,597 --> 00:35:12,796
How did he know?
He's so good!

265
00:35:14,157 --> 00:35:16,877
I think he's cute
for a great general.

266
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:18,677
Right? Isn't he cute?

267
00:35:19,796 --> 00:35:21,796
You really sent a spy?

268
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:23,317
I just wanted to know
if he's well.

269
00:35:24,796 --> 00:35:27,557
By the way, where's So?

270
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:33,877
The Fourth Prince is here, too?

271
00:35:35,197 --> 00:35:37,197
I'm sorry, I thought
he came here.

272
00:36:29,997 --> 00:36:30,997
Yo.

273
00:36:33,796 --> 00:36:34,796
Your Majesty.

274
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:38,997
Jung is here now.
Let's make a decision.

275
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:44,437
The mother of Kyungchoon
is from Late Baekje.

276
00:36:44,517 --> 00:36:47,796
We can't let Baekje people
rule our Goryeo.

277
00:36:57,117 --> 00:36:59,796
Please make Jung
the Crown Prince

278
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:02,757
so he'll crown after you.

279
00:37:02,796 --> 00:37:07,277
Mother, what do you
think of me?

280
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:12,477
Am I a person or a pig?

281
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:15,796
I feel like you're treating me

282
00:37:15,796 --> 00:37:18,997
like a pig to get the crown
for you, not as your son.

283
00:37:26,757 --> 00:37:29,397
It's not like I'm going
to die now.

284
00:37:29,477 --> 00:37:31,796
And you've been asking for that
for years already.

285
00:37:40,037 --> 00:37:41,197
Does Jung...

286
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,677
want to be the Emperor?

287
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:53,437
The Fourth Prince is here
to greet you.

288
00:38:07,277 --> 00:38:08,597
If you feel insecure so much,

289
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:10,796
let's make So
the Crown Prince.

290
00:38:11,397 --> 00:38:13,637
Jung and So both are your sons.

291
00:38:13,717 --> 00:38:15,117
What are you...

292
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:19,397
Let's discuss this later.

293
00:38:28,837 --> 00:38:33,117
You know that you're very
useful in many ways.

294
00:39:17,317 --> 00:39:18,317
It's just a few servants died.

295
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,796
Why would you stop
the construction?

296
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:24,796
Because this land's energy
is weak,

297
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:26,997
they all prophesied that

298
00:39:27,077 --> 00:39:30,077
my loyal position will be
in danger.

299
00:39:37,717 --> 00:39:38,796
We don't have much labor,

300
00:39:38,797 --> 00:39:42,717
and the resources aren't
enough, we wait most of time.

301
00:39:54,637 --> 00:39:57,517
If the labor isn't enough,
don't let them sleep.

302
00:39:57,597 --> 00:39:59,796
If you're short of resources,
steal from somewhere.

303
00:40:01,157 --> 00:40:04,157
Squeeze and squeeze more!

304
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:07,796
And make the deadline.

305
00:40:22,997 --> 00:40:25,277
It's my great sin,
Your Majesty.

306
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:32,077
Your Majesty, why don't we have
a private conversation on this?

307
00:41:11,796 --> 00:41:14,597
You're still not asleep?

308
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:16,557
I haven't seen you sleeping
well

309
00:41:16,637 --> 00:41:19,277
since I got here to Damiwon.

310
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:20,796
I'll sleep soon.

311
00:41:24,957 --> 00:41:29,077
Why do you write that sentence
over and over?

312
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,197
You can recognize this
even if you can't read?

313
00:41:32,277 --> 00:41:35,717
Well, I can't read,
but I can still see.

314
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:37,117
They all look the same
every time.

315
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:45,477
I like its meaning.

316
00:41:46,557 --> 00:41:51,157
"Sit by the end of water
I see clouds."

317
00:41:51,237 --> 00:41:54,796
What a stupid guy to walk all
the way to the end of water.

318
00:42:20,677 --> 00:42:22,837
It's OK, I'm not alone.

319
00:42:24,796 --> 00:42:27,077
Why am I alone
when I have you here?

320
00:42:34,437 --> 00:42:35,877
You said you'd ask first.

321
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,557
-Can I?
-No.

322
00:42:46,796 --> 00:42:50,637
Don't forget next time.

323
00:43:38,557 --> 00:43:40,757
There's So.

324
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:43,237
He's with Haesu.

325
00:43:44,437 --> 00:43:46,077
I told you.

326
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:49,197
I said you can't trust him
saying that he'd be your dog.

327
00:43:51,717 --> 00:43:56,077
He's useful as long
as I have the leash.

328
00:43:56,957 --> 00:44:01,437
Do you believe those two aren't
as intimate as before?

329
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:04,197
I've checked that they didn't
exchange any letters.

330
00:44:04,277 --> 00:44:06,477
But you might need
to double check.

331
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:10,797
Servants only work hard
when you continue to whip.

332
00:44:19,677 --> 00:44:21,117
Stop.

333
00:44:23,437 --> 00:44:24,997
It'd have been better
not seeing you at all.

334
00:45:06,157 --> 00:45:07,717
Are you OK?

335
00:45:22,317 --> 00:45:25,717
Sorry, I was testing with my
weakened arm.

336
00:45:27,037 --> 00:45:28,117
Not hurt?

337
00:45:28,197 --> 00:45:29,477
Just minor, Your Majesty.

338
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:35,317
I see, I guess you two are
still close.

339
00:45:37,157 --> 00:45:39,757
It's not good that people think
you killed a court lady

340
00:45:39,796 --> 00:45:41,077
for fun.

341
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:44,037
Right, that can't happen.

342
00:45:46,117 --> 00:45:47,397
My mistake.

343
00:45:52,197 --> 00:45:53,237
You better be careful.

344
00:45:54,957 --> 00:45:57,197
What did I do?

345
00:46:43,557 --> 00:46:45,117
You wanted to see me?

346
00:46:45,197 --> 00:46:47,997
Can you contact Baeka?

347
00:46:50,237 --> 00:46:51,757
Can you tell him...

348
00:46:52,517 --> 00:46:56,796
that I must see
the Fourth Prince, please?

349
00:46:56,796 --> 00:46:57,796
It'd be dangerous.

350
00:46:58,997 --> 00:47:00,397
I am ready.

351
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:05,237
The borders are quiet
thanks to you.

352
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,357
I'll give you anything

353
00:47:07,437 --> 00:47:08,796
before you go back out
in the battlefield.

354
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:11,597
Anything?

355
00:47:11,677 --> 00:47:15,277
Anything as long as
it's not my seat.

356
00:47:15,357 --> 00:47:16,477
Then...

357
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,517
there's something
I wanted for a long time.

358
00:47:33,677 --> 00:47:35,796
Your Highness.

359
00:47:35,796 --> 00:47:37,637
Where's Haesu?

360
00:47:37,717 --> 00:47:41,197
She's ill,
she can't see anyone.

361
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:43,796
I have to see her
even if she's ill.

362
00:47:45,477 --> 00:47:46,477
No.

363
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:53,197
If you get the disease, you
will spread to the entire army.

364
00:47:54,477 --> 00:47:57,357
You have a great stake to take.

365
00:47:58,477 --> 00:48:03,157
You're right.
Tell her this then.

366
00:48:03,237 --> 00:48:04,637
Promise.

367
00:48:09,796 --> 00:48:14,277
He's on his way to Seokyung
and stopped to treat his arm.

368
00:48:15,677 --> 00:48:18,837
Everyone else has left.
So you don't have to worry.

369
00:50:55,117 --> 00:50:56,637
Why are you here?

370
00:50:57,796 --> 00:50:59,437
I have something to ask.

371
00:51:01,077 --> 00:51:03,437
So I asked Baeka
about your whereabouts.

372
00:51:04,477 --> 00:51:06,037
Ask and leave.

373
00:51:09,517 --> 00:51:10,796
You have not...

374
00:51:12,437 --> 00:51:13,796
forgotten about me, right?

375
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:18,077
What?

376
00:51:18,157 --> 00:51:20,317
You said you don't
like me anymore.

377
00:51:22,796 --> 00:51:24,517
That was a lie, right?

378
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:27,277
Go back.

379
00:51:32,197 --> 00:51:35,517
It's not the palace, and
there's no Emperor seeing us.

380
00:51:35,597 --> 00:51:40,677
I've left the palace to ask
this, risking my life.

381
00:51:41,717 --> 00:51:44,317
I've waited for you every day
for 2 years.

382
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:47,117
I've wished...

383
00:51:48,637 --> 00:51:52,157
to go back to the time
desperately.

384
00:51:53,157 --> 00:51:54,237
So...

385
00:51:56,437 --> 00:51:57,597
I wanted to tell you that...

386
00:52:01,277 --> 00:52:02,796
I believe in you.

387
00:52:08,037 --> 00:52:13,197
I want to ask you again.
Please don't lie to me.

388
00:52:14,557 --> 00:52:15,757
Just answer me.

389
00:52:20,477 --> 00:52:21,557
Do you...

390
00:52:23,796 --> 00:52:24,997
still...

391
00:52:28,796 --> 00:52:30,077
love me?

392
00:54:40,796 --> 00:54:42,797
Isn't it cute? Like this.

393
00:54:42,877 --> 00:54:45,796
Come here, closer.

394
00:54:46,957 --> 00:54:47,957
And...

395
00:55:23,277 --> 00:55:27,796
Those square ones are Pegasus.

396
00:55:29,357 --> 00:55:31,277
Pes...

397
00:55:31,357 --> 00:55:33,037
Pegasus.

398
00:55:33,117 --> 00:55:35,997
Pegasus.

399
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,037
The Emperor's condition is bad.

400
00:55:53,796 --> 00:55:56,597
The envoys from East Yuhjin
brought gifts.

401
00:55:56,677 --> 00:55:57,997
So I thought I'd scare the
Emperor a bit

402
00:55:58,077 --> 00:56:00,557
so I chose the
day with lightening.

403
00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:01,796
But I didn't know

404
00:56:01,796 --> 00:56:04,197
that envoys would burned
to death by the lightening.

405
00:56:05,317 --> 00:56:07,317
After he seeing those burned
bodies

406
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:11,677
he fainted and
has been ill since then.

407
00:56:11,757 --> 00:56:13,437
Heart attack...

408
00:56:19,157 --> 00:56:22,197
He's a sensitive person
but it's too much.

409
00:56:23,157 --> 00:56:27,796
Maybe he was guilty about
the big brother and Eun.

410
00:56:29,796 --> 00:56:31,197
That's possible.

411
00:56:31,277 --> 00:56:34,597
He'd not attend the services
and calls shamans often.

412
00:56:36,757 --> 00:56:38,277
I think it's time.

413
00:57:02,317 --> 00:57:04,796
Do you want to be the Emperor?

414
00:57:11,877 --> 00:57:12,877
I do.

415
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,277
Did you leave me...

416
00:57:22,237 --> 00:57:23,796
to be the Emperor?

417
00:57:24,757 --> 00:57:29,037
Otherwise he'd use you to shake
me and he'd use me

418
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:31,317
to torment you.

419
00:57:35,317 --> 00:57:37,157
What if I tell you to give up?

420
00:57:43,357 --> 00:57:46,157
I'll persuade you
until you say OK.

421
00:57:50,796 --> 00:57:52,557
Now you don't say that anymore

422
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:55,077
that you don't have
to be the Emperor...

423
00:57:57,796 --> 00:57:59,197
as long as we're together.

424
00:58:01,677 --> 00:58:03,397
We promised not to lie.

425
00:58:06,477 --> 00:58:10,677
I've started it to end
the bloodshed among brothers.

426
00:58:12,597 --> 00:58:13,637
But...

427
00:58:15,237 --> 00:58:16,796
as I build the palace...

428
00:58:18,597 --> 00:58:22,517
I realized that change of the
leader will change the world.

429
00:58:28,117 --> 00:58:30,757
If being Emperor is to end any
unfairness

430
00:58:30,796 --> 00:58:33,237
without being controlled

431
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,037
I must...

432
00:58:37,796 --> 00:58:39,477
become one.

433
00:58:56,077 --> 00:58:59,877
It's all because of you, witch.
You've interrupted all!

434
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:03,197
You must give up something to
become the owner of the palace.

435
00:59:03,277 --> 00:59:04,796
Just write that Jung is the
Emperor from now.

436
00:59:04,796 --> 00:59:06,437
What am I to you?

437
00:59:06,757 --> 00:59:09,796
-Don't come! No!
-Your Majesty!

438
00:59:11,637 --> 00:59:16,477
Long live Your Majesty!

439
00:59:17,796 --> 00:59:20,117
You're just a thief
who took my son's seat.

440
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:23,197
You told me I'm greedy

441
00:59:23,277 --> 00:59:25,517
wanting to be the
Emperor and have your heart.

442
00:59:25,597 --> 00:59:27,077
And now you're
the Emperor's woman.

443
00:59:27,157 --> 00:59:28,637
What should I think of this?
