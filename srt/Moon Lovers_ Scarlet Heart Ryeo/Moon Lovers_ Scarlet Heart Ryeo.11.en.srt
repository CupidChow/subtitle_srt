1
00:00:03,197 --> 00:00:05,237
SCARLET HEART

2
00:00:10,757 --> 00:00:12,997
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS

3
00:00:39,277 --> 00:00:42,317
I thank you, 4th brother,
for your cordiality.

4
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:47,557
Your highness.
Did you see my brother's loyalty?

5
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,877
How can I separate from him?

6
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:55,757
Please reconsider sending him
away to Shinju.

7
00:01:04,957 --> 00:01:07,597
Tea pot is almost empty.
I will go get more.

8
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:29,877
Can you...

9
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:33,037
...excuse me for a moment?

10
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:26,677
- Monster...
- So, Yeonhwa.

11
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:28,877
What was it you wanted to say?

12
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:33,957
Oh, it's...

13
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:47,277
I have a favor to ask of you.

14
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:51,437
It's about my blood brother...

15
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:53,916
Uk.

16
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:51,957
Prince!

17
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:55,877
Prince...
Prince!

18
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,637
What's going on?
Hey!

19
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:03,437
Help!
Is anyone here? Help!

20
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:05,916
- Prince!
- Quiet...

21
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:08,157
- Be quiet.
- What?

22
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:11,916
You shouldn't be here.
Leave...

23
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:15,237
Prince...
Prince!

24
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:19,117
Anyone...
Help!

25
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:23,997
Like 4th brother,
I wish to drink three times

26
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:27,077
and ask a favor of you,
Your Highness.

27
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:30,916
What could it be?

28
00:04:31,957 --> 00:04:33,916
I'm almost scared.

29
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:38,997
I don't have any idea neither,

30
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:41,797
but the two are very close.

31
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,916
It must be about her brother.

32
00:05:00,797 --> 00:05:02,077
Your Highness.

33
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:06,117
It has been a while since
8th Prince Uk has been single.

34
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:11,517
Permit his remarriage,
so our family can produce offspring.

35
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:13,397
Yeonhwa!

36
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:17,077
Uk, what do you think?

37
00:05:28,837 --> 00:05:30,997
If you permit...

38
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:33,757
...I do have someone in mind.

39
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:37,397
No reason to object.
I approve.

40
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:39,357
I am forever in your debt.

41
00:05:49,637 --> 00:05:52,917
Your Highness,
my next favor to ask is...

42
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:57,957
My next...

43
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:00,557
favor...

44
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:03,557
Yeonhwa!

45
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:07,117
- Yeonhwa!
- Sister!

46
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,397
Sister!

47
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:11,837
Yeonhwa!

48
00:06:15,397 --> 00:06:16,677
It's poison.

49
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,957
It must be poison.
Bring the doctor! Now!

50
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:24,677
Brother So...
It was his cup...

51
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:29,357
Yeonhwa!

52
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,077
Yeonhwa!

53
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:34,237
Carry the princess out.
Now!

54
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:36,437
Yeonhwa...
Yeonhwa!

55
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:39,717
Why isn't anyone here?

56
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,357
Where is everybody!

57
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:46,237
Brother!

58
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:49,597
He coughed up blood.
He's unconscious.

59
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:50,916
What's happening?

60
00:06:50,997 --> 00:06:52,237
It's poison.

61
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:54,277
- Poison?
- Help me!

62
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:55,397
Okay.

63
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:06,957
He still has a pulse.

64
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:09,557
Take 4th Prince to the clinic.

65
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:11,037
- Now!
- Yes, sir.

66
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:20,397
Brother...
Brother!

67
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:26,917
She brought the poisoned tea.

68
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,037
Brother...

69
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:32,837
Jimong, it can't be her.
You know that!

70
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:33,916
Arrest her!

71
00:07:37,517 --> 00:07:40,997
Damiwon lady Haesu,
you are charged with murder.

72
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:50,957
Where is Nan?

73
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:53,877
Find out why Haesu
carried out the tea instead of her.

74
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:57,477
I looked all over the palace,
but couldn't find her.

75
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:16,957
Minister, we found the poison.

76
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:18,916
Of course.

77
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:21,957
Look at this precious necklace.

78
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:24,277
Of course the poison is here.

79
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:33,197
Doctor, how is she?
Why aren't you saying anything?

80
00:08:34,717 --> 00:08:35,916
Not to worry.

81
00:08:36,077 --> 00:08:40,677
Unlike 4th Prince, our princess
only took a minuscule amount.

82
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:43,917
Once the antidote takes effect,
she'll wake up.

83
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:47,916
You should rest.

84
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:51,957
Stay and look after her.
Just in case.

85
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:53,197
Yes, Prince.

86
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:55,797
Let's go, Mother.

87
00:09:08,237 --> 00:09:09,877
Why so surprised?

88
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,877
I... I'm just happy that...

89
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,317
...you... you are awake.

90
00:09:16,277 --> 00:09:19,237
Your face says otherwise.

91
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:25,037
Like you saw me bite my lips
to pretend I was poisoned.

92
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:28,637
- No... no way.
- Of course.

93
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:33,597
No one will suspect a princess
would poison herself.

94
00:09:34,677 --> 00:09:37,397
Doctor, make up your mind.

95
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:42,037
Anyone can live or die
by their word here...

96
00:09:42,437 --> 00:09:43,877
in the Imperial Palace.

97
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:19,916
A poisonous mushroom
that avoided the test.

98
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:23,037
One cup should have been lethal.

99
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:27,757
Thankfully the general
trained him in poison resistance.

100
00:10:29,757 --> 00:10:32,397
Why do these things
only happen to So?

101
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:37,277
I was always worried,
but this time I thought he was gone.

102
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:39,637
I was the target.

103
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:43,677
Always making him take the hit...
What kind of brother am I?

104
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:46,757
I am terribly ashamed.

105
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,477
He knew it was poisoned
from the first cup.

106
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:52,637
Why did he drink three?

107
00:10:53,517 --> 00:10:55,677
Did he want to die?

108
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,397
Many unusual behaviors.

109
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,317
Asking Jeongyun for three drinks

110
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:04,517
and leaving the banquet alone
knowing he was poisoned.

111
00:11:05,757 --> 00:11:08,277
I think he knew
who was behind this.

112
00:11:13,197 --> 00:11:16,237
Who were you trying to protect
with your life?

113
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:18,916
Who was it?

114
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:16,917
Prince...
What about 4th Prince?

115
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:28,317
He's okay... right?

116
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:31,517
No, he's too strong
to go like that!

117
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:33,077
So is...

118
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:34,997
alive.

119
00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:41,557
He's resistant to poison,
and the antidote was promptly applied.

120
00:12:43,357 --> 00:12:44,916
He's safe.

121
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,557
Think only of yourself.

122
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,637
You are being accused of
poisoning the tea.

123
00:12:54,717 --> 00:12:56,877
- No! It's wasn't me!
- I know.

124
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:59,317
But we don't have proof to counter.

125
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:05,677
They...

126
00:13:06,557 --> 00:13:08,916
They'll ask who gave the order.

127
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,397
They might torture you.

128
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:16,677
But...

129
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:19,637
But, Su...

130
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:21,717
...you have to be strong.

131
00:13:23,077 --> 00:13:25,357
I promise I'll get you out.

132
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:27,916
Don't give up.

133
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:34,877
I won't let them use me
to frame someone.

134
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,877
I will be strong.
Don't worry.

135
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:49,916
Are you saying Jeongyun
attempted to poison 4th Prince?

136
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,917
We found poison and a donated necklace
in court lady Haesu's room.

137
00:13:54,197 --> 00:13:57,277
Also we have testimony
that the lady and Jeongyun

138
00:13:57,517 --> 00:14:00,517
met several times in
Damiwon and Jeongyun's quarters.

139
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,916
The proof is concrete.

140
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:07,397
Once word got out that
4th Prince was the next Jeongyun,

141
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:10,037
- Jeongyun retaliated.
- Me?

142
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,037
Do I look like someone
who would poison my brother?

143
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:19,916
All that you could come up with
is this conspiracy?

144
00:14:21,437 --> 00:14:22,916
Dare say it again.

145
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:26,397
I, Wang Mu,
in order to preserve my place,

146
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:28,197
attempted to poison my brother!

147
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,916
Then why did you gift Haesu
the donated necklace?

148
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:33,597
Disclose your secrets first!

149
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,916
This is inappropriate.
The Emperor is watching.

150
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:42,877
Agitation will bring out your symptoms.

151
00:14:43,157 --> 00:14:44,277
Please.

152
00:14:52,437 --> 00:14:56,797
A poisoning attempt at a banquet,
where everyone is watching.

153
00:14:57,877 --> 00:15:01,916
Furthermore, using an acquaintance
to procure the poison.

154
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:05,437
It's almost too easy.
Don't you think?

155
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:12,877
I think the target was Jeongyun.
And 4th Prince was collateral damage.

156
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:16,597
Princess Yeonhwa got poisoned too.
I'm sure of it.

157
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:20,916
Are you saying lady Haesu
tried to poison Jeongyun?

158
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:29,197
Nothing is certain.
Don't make any accusations yet.

159
00:15:34,837 --> 00:15:35,997
Haesu...

160
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:40,397
I sentence her to execution by hanging
for attempted murder.

161
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,157
She is innocent.

162
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:46,797
She will not survive torture.

163
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:50,477
If she gives a false confession,
you will be in trouble.

164
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:53,797
They seem to know about your disease.

165
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:54,917
But still...

166
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:58,357
I can't lose another life
because of me.

167
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:01,357
Instead...

168
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:05,197
- Let me take the fall.
- Shut up!

169
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:08,916
Another Jeongyun will help settle
the family and country.

170
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:15,917
Think about my karma.

171
00:16:17,157 --> 00:16:18,637
Why...

172
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:22,437
- Why does it have to be me?
- Mu.

173
00:16:23,477 --> 00:16:25,157
You are my first child.

174
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:30,757
Others are the Emperor's children,
but you're my... Wang Geon's son.

175
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,957
I went to battle with you.

176
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:38,197
We saved each other's lives.

177
00:16:38,357 --> 00:16:39,917
You are my son and comrade.

178
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,357
That's why...

179
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:47,917
...I want to give my everything to you.

180
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,557
Don't you see that, my son?

181
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,237
Brother...

182
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:12,677
You'll hurt yourself.

183
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:15,917
She's...

184
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:17,957
alone.

185
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,277
Brother...

186
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,797
Minister Park Yeonggyu claims

187
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:29,157
Jeongyun used Haesu
to poison you.

188
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,157
Nonsense.

189
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:34,916
- Ignore him.
- I know it's nonsense.

190
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,157
Everyone knows.

191
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:39,677
But there's no way out.

192
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,677
I should have never let
Haesu around you.

193
00:17:47,437 --> 00:17:49,117
Look at what's happened.

194
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:55,317
I need to talk to Uk alone.

195
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,837
- What?
- Leave!

196
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,637
It was Empress Yu.

197
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:11,916
My mother.

198
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:17,477
She said so herself.

199
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:21,037
She sent the poisoned tea
to Jeongyun.

200
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:25,837
Did you poison yourself
to protect your mother?

201
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:28,837
Like when you killed the assassins?

202
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:33,197
It was to save Haesu.

203
00:18:33,517 --> 00:18:34,917
To save Jeongyun.

204
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,397
To save...

205
00:18:41,397 --> 00:18:42,597
...Haesu?

206
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:44,957
I wanted to hide my poisoning.

207
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:48,557
But Yeonhwa getting involved
complicated things.

208
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:54,197
I can't just testify.

209
00:18:55,197 --> 00:18:57,477
Mother is too well prepared.

210
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,877
I need you, Uk...

211
00:19:02,957 --> 00:19:04,916
...to unveil Empress Yu's involvement.

212
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:08,037
You'll do anything for Haesu.

213
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,597
And for Jeongyun.

214
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,397
I will...

215
00:19:13,677 --> 00:19:15,757
...find proof at any cost.

216
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:19,917
I will get Haesu out.

217
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:53,677
Always watched you from afar

218
00:19:56,597 --> 00:20:02,637
Because I thought you were my love

219
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:08,197
I thought you were the same

220
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:11,357
I knew it.

221
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,917
I knew you wouldn't die.

222
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:18,557
Of course.

223
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,557
It was nothing.

224
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:24,917
You knew it was poisoned.

225
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:28,917
But did you drink it because...

226
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,717
it could lead to me?

227
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:32,957
Nonsense.

228
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:39,397
I'm not foolish enough
to die for a girl.

229
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:45,037
Why did you do it?

230
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:48,677
Did you think your actions...

231
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:53,237
...would change my mind?

232
00:20:59,197 --> 00:21:02,317
Why did you risk your life for me?

233
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:03,997
Now...

234
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:08,357
...it'll be hard for me
to distance myself from you.

235
00:21:11,957 --> 00:21:13,717
Don't run away.

236
00:21:15,037 --> 00:21:18,157
You really are a nuisance.

237
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,157
We're both still alive.

238
00:21:24,557 --> 00:21:26,277
We'll soon meet again.

239
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,237
You...

240
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:33,397
You really don't listen.

241
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:36,837
You too.

242
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:45,877
Listen to the doctor
and get good treatment.

243
00:21:46,077 --> 00:21:48,277
Don't wander around like this.

244
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:53,277
You don't have to come here.
Okay?

245
00:21:54,157 --> 00:21:55,637
You nag too much.

246
00:21:57,397 --> 00:22:03,397
Only answer to me

247
00:22:04,877 --> 00:22:10,916
Hold me, I'm shaking

248
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:14,757
My love

249
00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:21,357
My love

250
00:22:44,837 --> 00:22:47,437
Thank you.
I will leave now.

251
00:22:53,477 --> 00:22:55,877
Don't... don't kill me.

252
00:22:56,717 --> 00:22:59,157
If you testify,
I will let you live.

253
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,717
Come out.

254
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:07,637
Will you let an innocent lady die,
Empress?

255
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,117
I've got my witness.

256
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:16,557
You are doomed anyway.

257
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,916
Should I call the guards?

258
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:43,797
Yes, it's me.

259
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:46,037
Why...

260
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,837
Why are you...

261
00:23:49,197 --> 00:23:51,957
- ...here?
- Doesn't matter.

262
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:56,957
You have to bring me in
if you want to save Haesu.

263
00:24:03,157 --> 00:24:05,117
If you are charged...

264
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:08,717
- ...our whole family becomes traitors.
- Yes.

265
00:24:09,237 --> 00:24:12,237
I'll be hacked to pieces
and mother, exiled.

266
00:24:12,557 --> 00:24:15,277
- Our homeland will be destroyed.
- Why!

267
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:18,916
- Why did you do it?
- To wake you up.

268
00:24:19,477 --> 00:24:23,077
You're throwing away the chance
to be Emperor because of that girl.

269
00:24:23,237 --> 00:24:25,437
- I don't want to be Emperor!
- No!

270
00:24:25,837 --> 00:24:27,317
You do want it.

271
00:24:31,357 --> 00:24:35,877
Listen to your inner voice.
What does it say?

272
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:40,557
What came to mind when you saw
4th Prince at the ritual?

273
00:24:41,517 --> 00:24:45,677
"That was my spot.
Those cheers are mine."

274
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,916
I saw it in your eyes.

275
00:24:50,597 --> 00:24:52,837
You do want to be Emperor.

276
00:24:54,197 --> 00:24:57,677
If I'm mistaken,
then abandon me and Mother.

277
00:24:58,437 --> 00:25:02,477
I won't resent you.
I'm prepared to die.

278
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:23,917
You knew...

279
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,717
...that I could never abandon
you and Mother.

280
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,916
From now on...

281
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:37,997
Yeonhwa...

282
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,916
...you are not my sister
but a...

283
00:25:47,237 --> 00:25:48,557
...debtor.

284
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:54,317
You owe me
and I owe you...

285
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,597
...a huge debt.

286
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:05,677
A debt...

287
00:26:06,517 --> 00:26:09,237
...so huge, I can't repay it
in this lifetime...

288
00:26:10,717 --> 00:26:13,077
I will make you Emperor.

289
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:22,237
Eventually...

290
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:26,837
...you did have it...

291
00:26:29,277 --> 00:26:30,757
...your way...

292
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:16,597
Hide the tears in your heart

293
00:27:17,357 --> 00:27:22,877
Erase the memories

294
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:30,237
If we aren't meant to be,
let's stop here

295
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:37,677
Even if we are in tears
for the rest of our lives

296
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:44,637
Like the winds scattering away

297
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:51,437
Like the roads
we will never find

298
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:59,916
I can't hold onto our fate drifting apart

299
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:05,837
I send you away

300
00:28:09,157 --> 00:28:12,077
If you don't care,
who will save sister Haesu?

301
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:14,437
Let's all go to Father.

302
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:17,397
If you plead with our lives,
maybe he'll listen.

303
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,916
Stop hiding and come out.

304
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:34,877
He said come out.

305
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:38,237
Eavesdropping on us princes?

306
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,317
Is it true Miss Su is going to die?

307
00:28:43,477 --> 00:28:45,117
Why our miss?

308
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,757
Why does our miss have to die?

309
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,237
Listen to her.

310
00:28:49,557 --> 00:28:51,757
It's none of your business.

311
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,437
Leave.
You heard me.

312
00:28:56,916 --> 00:29:00,397
I know you'll do something.
Right?

313
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:03,157
Please, Prince.

314
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,277
Save her.

315
00:29:07,517 --> 00:29:11,916
Save her.
Save her, Prince.

316
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:15,437
Prince, save her.

317
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:17,357
Please.

318
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:20,077
Please save her.

319
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,317
Save her, Prince.

320
00:29:36,197 --> 00:29:39,117
It's useless.
I won't stop it.

321
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,717
Her crime is grave.

322
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:44,117
You are always just.

323
00:29:44,237 --> 00:29:46,517
Why not investigate deeper?

324
00:29:47,597 --> 00:29:49,477
She's wrongly accused.

325
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:59,077
Are you making her take the fall
to save Jeongyun?

326
00:30:00,517 --> 00:30:02,397
To save the country.

327
00:30:03,477 --> 00:30:06,757
To save a big life
by sacrificing a small life.

328
00:30:08,477 --> 00:30:12,916
I didn't know the Emperor's role was to
sacrifice lives just to beg for your own.

329
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:14,797
You brat!

330
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:17,917
Do you want to die?

331
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:23,477
I thought you were
a nicely sharpened blade.

332
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:26,837
I was wrong.

333
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:29,916
If you want to use the blade,
show me justice.

334
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,877
One more word,
you'll lose your head.

335
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:34,916
Anyone asking for Haesu's release
will have the same fate.

336
00:30:34,997 --> 00:30:36,157
Your Highness.

337
00:30:37,677 --> 00:30:38,957
Your Highness!

338
00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:24,916
You aren't here for tea.

339
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:32,357
I need a favor.

340
00:31:33,397 --> 00:31:35,757
You are my last resort.

341
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,597
It's about Haesu.

342
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:45,477
You can change the Emperor's mind.

343
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:48,477
Just because we were once close

344
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:50,916
doesn't mean
I can ask for an impossible favor.

345
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:55,916
Are you just going to look away?

346
00:31:56,437 --> 00:31:58,597
Let Haesu die?

347
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:03,077
I know...

348
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:04,997
that you...

349
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,917
think of her as your child.

350
00:32:11,317 --> 00:32:14,916
That's why you hate
seeing her with me.

351
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:19,637
Why don't you do something?

352
00:32:20,957 --> 00:32:22,916
If you say you love her...

353
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:25,757
If you say she means everything to you...

354
00:32:26,437 --> 00:32:28,557
...it'll work better than my words.

355
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,757
Is it because of
your family or mother?

356
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,037
Or maybe because
you want to be Emperor.

357
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:46,157
The reason royals are cowards
are all the same.

358
00:32:47,237 --> 00:32:49,837
- Lady Oh.
- One day...

359
00:32:50,437 --> 00:32:53,117
...you will regret you acted cowardly.

360
00:32:54,277 --> 00:32:56,757
The memory of abandoning her

361
00:32:57,157 --> 00:32:59,437
will haunt you
for the rest of your life.

362
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:04,997
The only reason why
I'll talk to the Emperor...

363
00:33:05,837 --> 00:33:08,357
is because I cherish Haesu.

364
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,517
On the other hand...

365
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,117
...you have done nothing.

366
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:24,277
Ask anything.

367
00:34:24,677 --> 00:34:26,916
Except for Haesu.

368
00:34:27,117 --> 00:34:28,237
It was me.

369
00:34:29,597 --> 00:34:31,797
I tried to poison Jeongyun.

370
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:37,957
I lost my child.

371
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:42,557
I was jealous of the lively
but shameless princes.

372
00:34:43,557 --> 00:34:45,317
That's why I did it.

373
00:34:45,597 --> 00:34:47,997
She cannot be saved.

374
00:34:48,437 --> 00:34:50,877
Why do want an innocent child dead?

375
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:54,117
I will confess.

376
00:34:54,357 --> 00:34:56,797
- Let Haesu...
- That's enough.

377
00:35:22,717 --> 00:35:24,357
10 years ago...

378
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:29,237
...a royal sent quince tea.

379
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:33,997
She said it was good for morning sickness.

380
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:36,957
I drank it every day.

381
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,757
I woke up at night to drink.

382
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:47,037
Before a week had passed...

383
00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:50,677
...I lost your child.

384
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:58,677
The same person sent the tea.

385
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:01,357
I will not lose another child.

386
00:36:03,557 --> 00:36:05,916
Haesu is not your baby.

387
00:36:06,677 --> 00:36:09,837
There is no proof that
the Empress is behind this.

388
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:13,877
Are you...

389
00:36:15,117 --> 00:36:17,557
...looking the other way,
again?

390
00:36:27,997 --> 00:36:30,157
I don't have much time left.

391
00:36:31,877 --> 00:36:33,437
Suyeon...

392
00:36:33,557 --> 00:36:36,477
Severe indigestion
started two years ago.

393
00:36:36,757 --> 00:36:38,357
I kept throwing up.

394
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:42,117
I had the doctor examine me.

395
00:36:44,957 --> 00:36:46,917
It was Banwi.

396
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:48,916
BANWI
STOMACH CANCER

397
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:54,157
I know you're letting Haesu die
to save Jeongyun.

398
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,917
I know you can't save both.

399
00:37:00,477 --> 00:37:02,677
But this time...

400
00:37:03,717 --> 00:37:06,277
...I can't let Empress Yu
take my child again.

401
00:37:07,437 --> 00:37:09,117
Please help.

402
00:37:14,797 --> 00:37:17,357
This is my last request.

403
00:37:21,677 --> 00:37:23,077
Are you...

404
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:27,437
...leaving me?

405
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:47,916
Am I going to die?

406
00:38:54,197 --> 00:38:55,957
8th Prince...

407
00:38:56,797 --> 00:39:00,477
Where are you?
Why aren't you here to see me?

408
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:06,237
Su.

409
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:12,357
Step aside.

410
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:29,117
She's coming with me.

411
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:38,557
Do you really want to die?

412
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:44,797
Emperor's order!
Emperor's order!

413
00:39:48,037 --> 00:39:51,357
The execution is canceled.
We have the real murderer.

414
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:55,277
Su.

415
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:01,837
Miss.

416
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:35,637
Damiwon upper court lady
Oh Suyeon.

417
00:40:35,717 --> 00:40:38,237
You are under arrest for murder
per Emperor's orders.

418
00:40:41,477 --> 00:40:42,757
I will...

419
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:44,997
obey.

420
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:46,157
Miss!

421
00:40:48,037 --> 00:40:49,157
Su.

422
00:40:53,957 --> 00:40:55,877
What's going on?

423
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,957
Attempted murder?

424
00:40:58,797 --> 00:41:02,317
I poisoned Jeongyun's tea.

425
00:41:07,357 --> 00:41:08,797
Liar...

426
00:41:10,877 --> 00:41:13,397
I'm sorry I framed you.

427
00:41:24,437 --> 00:41:25,917
Let them go.

428
00:41:27,957 --> 00:41:29,637
It'll only be a minute.

429
00:41:47,317 --> 00:41:49,357
There is no way out.

430
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:51,837
It's already blocked.

431
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:54,997
We can reopen it.

432
00:41:58,157 --> 00:41:59,916
You wanted to go back home.

433
00:42:01,277 --> 00:42:02,637
Let's go now.

434
00:42:05,037 --> 00:42:09,517
Wherever you want to go,
I will follow.

435
00:42:10,517 --> 00:42:15,277
I can't live like this anymore.

436
00:42:20,837 --> 00:42:22,157
Stop it.

437
00:42:22,517 --> 00:42:24,837
You're taking the fall.

438
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,557
You're dying instead of me!

439
00:42:27,877 --> 00:42:30,797
Then... what about me?

440
00:42:31,237 --> 00:42:32,916
How can I live with this?

441
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:37,997
No.
Not like this.

442
00:42:38,197 --> 00:42:39,677
We can escape!

443
00:42:47,517 --> 00:42:49,037
It's not your fault.

444
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:53,437
I'm not doing this for you.

445
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:57,077
I'm doing this for the Emperor.

446
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:02,916
I don't have much longer anyway.

447
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,117
Don't pity me.

448
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,637
Don't feel sorry for me.

449
00:43:16,717 --> 00:43:18,157
Please.

450
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,877
Please...

451
00:43:22,717 --> 00:43:25,757
I'm fine.

452
00:43:33,717 --> 00:43:37,677
I was given the chance
to protect what I wanted.

453
00:43:37,997 --> 00:43:39,916
I need to pay the price.

454
00:43:45,277 --> 00:43:46,916
I have no regrets.

455
00:43:49,717 --> 00:43:51,477
Be careful.

456
00:43:52,437 --> 00:43:54,917
Do not trust anyone.

457
00:43:55,637 --> 00:43:59,837
Every moment,
every step you take,

458
00:44:00,077 --> 00:44:03,037
be cautious,
like walking on thin ice.

459
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:08,197
I hope...

460
00:44:09,077 --> 00:44:11,077
...you don't live like me.

461
00:44:12,117 --> 00:44:13,637
Okay?

462
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,437
Your Highness.

463
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:16,157
Let Lady Oh live.

464
00:45:17,837 --> 00:45:19,957
She's been framed.

465
00:45:21,837 --> 00:45:23,477
Your Highness.

466
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:26,557
Please reconsider.

467
00:45:27,757 --> 00:45:30,077
She didn't commit the crime.

468
00:45:31,277 --> 00:45:32,957
Your Highness.

469
00:45:33,837 --> 00:45:36,237
Please spare Lady Oh.

470
00:45:36,957 --> 00:45:38,197
Go back.

471
00:45:38,357 --> 00:45:40,837
You can't help her or yourself.

472
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:44,916
I can't leave her like that.

473
00:45:46,917 --> 00:45:49,557
I've always let you do
whatever you wanted.

474
00:45:49,677 --> 00:45:51,357
But not this time.

475
00:45:52,597 --> 00:45:55,237
You can go if you want.
But it'll be over my dead body.

476
00:45:55,357 --> 00:45:57,797
- Mother.
- I'm trying to protect you.

477
00:45:57,916 --> 00:46:01,157
You don't know why the Emperor
has no choice but to let Oh die.

478
00:46:01,677 --> 00:46:05,677
If you interfere,
you will most certainly die.

479
00:46:05,877 --> 00:46:08,397
You've already abandoned her once.

480
00:46:09,077 --> 00:46:11,437
It won't be as hard this time.

481
00:46:14,717 --> 00:46:15,916
Yeonhwa.

482
00:46:16,797 --> 00:46:19,597
How much more do you want to
be indebted to me?

483
00:46:22,397 --> 00:46:24,757
What's happening?

484
00:46:26,877 --> 00:46:30,916
Oh, right.
That girl is pleading to the Emperor.

485
00:46:32,837 --> 00:46:34,997
Uk, you must be devastated.

486
00:46:35,237 --> 00:46:36,916
You liked her, right?

487
00:46:37,117 --> 00:46:38,916
You must have heard wrong.

488
00:46:39,117 --> 00:46:41,677
She's just his cousin-in-law.

489
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:44,197
What she's saying is right.

490
00:46:45,357 --> 00:46:48,517
Seems like you believe in
Lady Oh's innocence, too.

491
00:46:49,957 --> 00:46:51,916
Who could be the real murderer?

492
00:46:52,317 --> 00:46:54,757
Jeongyun?
A local noble?

493
00:46:55,557 --> 00:46:56,916
Or maybe...

494
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,916
- You think it's me?
- Empress!

495
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:02,757
- Empress.
- Mother!

496
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:07,237
Wasn't I enough?

497
00:47:07,317 --> 00:47:10,077
Please spare Uk and Yeonhwa.

498
00:47:10,157 --> 00:47:12,677
I can't see them suffer.

499
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:17,517
Look at me.
I beg you.

500
00:47:17,837 --> 00:47:20,677
Please...
Please!

501
00:47:23,917 --> 00:47:27,717
This is why home discipline is important.

502
00:47:29,037 --> 00:47:31,717
Yes, a prince is born as a golden spoon.

503
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:34,957
But the spoon needs to know
who owns the table.

504
00:47:39,277 --> 00:47:42,397
If she keeps going on like that,
she'll die.

505
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,916
Should have taken the chance she had.

506
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:48,997
Now another dies with her.

507
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:54,517
Stand up.
The servants are watching.

508
00:48:10,197 --> 00:48:11,717
Your Highness...

509
00:48:13,477 --> 00:48:16,237
...please spare Lady Oh.

510
00:48:17,917 --> 00:48:20,837
She's been framed, Your Highness.

511
00:48:23,837 --> 00:48:25,197
Your Highness.

512
00:48:27,277 --> 00:48:28,917
Your Highness...

513
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:32,477
Lady Oh has been framed...

514
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:39,277
Your Highness...
please spare Lady Oh.

515
00:48:59,277 --> 00:49:00,916
You fool.

516
00:49:04,717 --> 00:49:06,277
Baeka.

517
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:12,877
Do you think you doing this
will change his mind?

518
00:49:14,677 --> 00:49:17,397
Let's go now.
You're in bad enough shape.

519
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:19,797
Lady Oh...

520
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:25,916
She took the fall for me.

521
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,916
We all know.

522
00:49:28,477 --> 00:49:31,437
But we all fear the wrath of the Emperor.

523
00:49:31,717 --> 00:49:33,397
That's why we can't help.

524
00:49:34,957 --> 00:49:36,477
Give up.

525
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:38,157
I can't...

526
00:49:39,597 --> 00:49:42,237
I can't abandon Lady Oh.

527
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:44,916
You are so stubborn.

528
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,637
She did it to save you.

529
00:49:48,677 --> 00:49:50,317
Let it mean something.

530
00:49:51,317 --> 00:49:53,237
Better than doing...

531
00:49:55,797 --> 00:49:57,517
...nothing.

532
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:03,916
I guess I can't change your mind.

533
00:50:06,197 --> 00:50:07,916
Stay strong.

534
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:12,037
I will have good medicine ready.

535
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,677
Baeka.

536
00:50:16,916 --> 00:50:20,077
About 8th Prince...
Have you...

537
00:50:26,237 --> 00:50:27,637
It's nothing.

538
00:50:39,677 --> 00:50:40,917
Your Highness.

539
00:50:41,837 --> 00:50:44,077
Please revoke the execution.

540
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,997
If you let Oh go like this,
you'll forever regret it.

541
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:52,797
I know it's important to save
Jeongyun and this country.

542
00:50:53,077 --> 00:50:55,037
But if you let all your loved ones go,

543
00:50:55,397 --> 00:50:57,916
you'll be lonely later on.

544
00:50:58,717 --> 00:51:01,197
It's an Emperor's duty...

545
00:51:01,757 --> 00:51:03,916
to let go when you have to.

546
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:07,557
Your Highness.

547
00:51:07,877 --> 00:51:11,397
Damiwon lady Haesu has been
pleading for two days.

548
00:51:12,037 --> 00:51:15,357
Ignore her.
She'll give up soon enough.

549
00:51:15,997 --> 00:51:19,277
I will punish anyone
who takes her side.

550
00:53:17,477 --> 00:53:23,916
I hold my breath and look at you

551
00:53:24,837 --> 00:53:28,757
Like the world has stopped

552
00:53:30,757 --> 00:53:37,597
Like the wind passing by,
even if you hadn't seen me

553
00:53:38,837 --> 00:53:43,317
My heart is towards you

554
00:53:43,677 --> 00:53:44,917
Why...

555
00:53:45,477 --> 00:53:50,717
It hurts to love you

556
00:53:51,557 --> 00:53:58,157
It's sad I can't empty my heart

557
00:53:59,797 --> 00:54:06,717
Please do not forget

558
00:54:07,997 --> 00:54:13,157
My love never stops

559
00:54:14,757 --> 00:54:20,597
It hurts to love you

560
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:27,757
It's sad I can't empty my heart

561
00:54:29,477 --> 00:54:36,277
With all my heart, I hope one day

562
00:54:37,717 --> 00:54:43,916
I can love you

563
00:54:58,477 --> 00:54:59,797
Halt.

564
00:55:08,437 --> 00:55:11,517
I wanted to see you go
before you died.

565
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:13,916
Wish granted.

566
00:55:15,237 --> 00:55:17,237
You lost to me.

567
00:55:17,997 --> 00:55:20,317
Dying first is losing.

568
00:55:24,517 --> 00:55:27,237
Empress, you should know by now...

569
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:31,237
You've never won.

570
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:37,477
Your pride.
Sad to see it go along with your head.

571
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:43,197
I hope you live a long life, Empress.

572
00:55:44,277 --> 00:55:46,197
You will be lonely.

573
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,877
I'll watch from the other side.

574
00:55:52,597 --> 00:55:53,916
Whatever.

575
00:55:56,477 --> 00:55:57,997
I'm the Empress.

576
00:55:58,557 --> 00:56:02,717
You're a court lady with no name
that no one will remember.

577
00:56:14,277 --> 00:56:16,317
I only need...

578
00:56:16,757 --> 00:56:18,797
one person to remember me.

579
00:56:44,437 --> 00:56:45,916
Miss...

580
00:56:46,597 --> 00:56:52,837
Fallen flower petal

581
00:56:53,157 --> 00:56:59,237
Alone by itself

582
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:05,237
Sad

583
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:13,037
The stars have left

584
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:20,037
The sky in sorrow

585
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:24,677
Like the raindrops falling

586
00:57:25,277 --> 00:57:26,916
Your highness.

587
00:57:27,637 --> 00:57:33,916
I can only shed tears

588
00:57:34,916 --> 00:57:41,916
Like the flowers bloom and wilt

589
00:57:42,357 --> 00:57:43,916
Miss...

590
00:57:45,077 --> 00:57:48,157
- Miss! Miss!
- Su!

591
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:51,157
Miss! Miss!

592
00:57:52,077 --> 00:57:54,077
Miss! No!

593
00:57:54,916 --> 00:57:56,077
Miss...

594
00:58:12,797 --> 00:58:15,957
If I knew someone would die
because of me...

595
00:58:17,437 --> 00:58:20,877
...I wouldn't have tried to live.

596
00:58:26,557 --> 00:58:28,837
I wish this was a dream.

597
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:31,997
And when I wake up...

598
00:58:33,197 --> 00:58:35,916
I wish to not remember anything.

599
00:58:39,277 --> 00:58:45,397
I believe you

600
00:58:45,677 --> 00:58:49,277
Earnest wish

601
00:58:50,637 --> 00:58:51,917
SCARLET HEART

602
00:58:52,397 --> 00:58:55,477
Forget me.
It's all my fault.

603
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:57,917
Are you going to leave her like that?

604
00:58:58,037 --> 00:59:01,157
I can't go down with her.
It's the Emperor's will.

605
00:59:04,357 --> 00:59:06,916
Are you still attached to her?

606
00:59:07,117 --> 00:59:08,477
I missed you.

607
00:59:08,557 --> 00:59:10,477
Let's get married.
You're mine.

608
00:59:10,916 --> 00:59:12,797
A prince marrying a maid?

609
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:14,797
If I say it's marriage,
it's marriage.

610
00:59:15,397 --> 00:59:17,437
You should cancel the meeting.

611
00:59:17,557 --> 00:59:19,477
I think you should go.

612
00:59:23,077 --> 00:59:25,557
- Your highness!
- Your highness!
