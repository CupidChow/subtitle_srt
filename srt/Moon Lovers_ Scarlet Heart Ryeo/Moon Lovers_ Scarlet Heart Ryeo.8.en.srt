1
00:00:02,426 --> 00:00:05,346
MOON LOVERS:
SCARLET HEART RYEO

2
00:00:10,306 --> 00:00:13,106
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS.

3
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:15,426
Prince.

4
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:22,346
Look at me.

5
00:00:24,826 --> 00:00:26,146
Look me in the eyes!

6
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:39,786
Those eyes...

7
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,106
that look in your eyes...

8
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:51,106
I hate them so much.

9
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:55,426
So don't ever look
at me like that.

10
00:00:58,066 --> 00:00:59,865
How did I look at you?

11
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,506
I've never looked
at you differently.

12
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:04,346
You feel pity for me.

13
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:05,426
You do!

14
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:11,306
Did you think I'd
appreciate that?

15
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:13,986
Do you know what it feels like
to be treated that way from you?

16
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:30,626
Don't appear in front of me.

17
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:34,026
I'm not sure...

18
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:38,066
what I'm going to do
next time I see you.

19
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,546
I didn't mean it like that.

20
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:33,226
I'm sorry, I couldn't stop.

21
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:37,786
Yun is also regretting.
So please forgive him.

22
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:40,906
You wouldn't look at me.

23
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:41,986
What?

24
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:47,186
How come you didn't
see me directly?

25
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:53,426
I thought you wouldn't like it.
Are you mad about that?

26
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,146
The heart of a human
is the most difficult one.

27
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:05,865
Some are sad to see,
some are sad not to see.

28
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,865
I don't even know myself.

29
00:03:15,186 --> 00:03:18,946
You can see me anytime.

30
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:21,426
I want you to.

31
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:22,786
OK.

32
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:27,865
Haesu...

33
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:30,386
I think the Third Prince was...

34
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:34,226
Let's not talk about it.
I don't want to hear.

35
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:41,346
EPISODE 8

36
00:03:51,826 --> 00:03:54,506
You've become well fitted
for Damiwon already.

37
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:56,986
Thank you, Your Majesty.

38
00:03:58,186 --> 00:04:01,386
I bet you're still hanging
around with the princes.

39
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:06,586
I can't see them as much
as before.

40
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,666
You're clever,
knowing your position.

41
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:15,826
Now, we have to comb your hair.

42
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:56,186
Empress Yu is here.

43
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,865
I'll do it.

44
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:18,666
We're sticking this humble
wooden one in for the Emperor?

45
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:21,865
I've asked to minimize all,
as we're in a severe drought.

46
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:40,066
What are you doing here?

47
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:44,946
Since you're not visiting me,
what else could I do?

48
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:46,865
The one who misses
more should come see.

49
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:51,066
You can't divide a married
couple with anything.

50
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:57,386
Let's go.

51
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:13,626
Here's mugwort tea.

52
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,746
Thank you.

53
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:24,666
Here's white tea.

54
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:25,906
Thank you.

55
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:28,386
This is pear juice.

56
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:30,666
It's my favorite, Su!

57
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:32,706
Mine is baby-leaf tea.

58
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:36,346
I think she prepared the tea
for each one's favorite.

59
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:39,426
I'd be happy if you'd like it.

60
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:48,586
This is pressed-grain tea.

61
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,865
Take it away.
It's not the time to enjoy tea.

62
00:06:52,865 --> 00:06:53,865
What?

63
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:56,066
It's going to be a long drought.
We shouldn't drink tea.

64
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:00,066
The Fourth Prince is right.

65
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:03,466
The whole nation's suffering
from droughts since last winter.

66
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:05,746
People's agony is enormous.

67
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,946
So please be humble
in your appearance.

68
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:14,146
Are you sure you got
the right information I asked?

69
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,426
I said yes.

70
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:17,266
Fourth Prince's favorite tea
is pressed-grain

71
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:19,146
and the snack, right?

72
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:20,865
I'm sure.

73
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:22,546
Since you said not to be
obvious,

74
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:24,546
I got the other
brothers' favorite, too.

75
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:28,226
Then how come
he didn't even sip?

76
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:31,026
It took me so much energy
to study and make that.

77
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:33,186
You ask him yourself.

78
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,865
What would make him
forgive you?

79
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,306
I can't even see him
to ask that.

80
00:07:39,386 --> 00:07:42,626
He seems to get along
fine with other people.

81
00:07:43,026 --> 00:07:44,306
Why just me?

82
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:48,986
Right, he even accepted
Tenth Prince's apology at once.

83
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:51,946
Wait, So is...

84
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:54,266
Thank you, Your Highness.

85
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:58,426
What? Why so suddenly?

86
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,066
What are you doing,
Your Highness?

87
00:08:03,146 --> 00:08:06,546
Why do you look so pretty today?

88
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:08,226
Are you crazy?

89
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,186
It's a punishment
for not being able

90
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:14,026
to make Fourth Prince
feel better.

91
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:17,866
I'll see you again, Su.

92
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:19,346
Oops.

93
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,466
Go now.

94
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:25,865
Sure, I should kill myself.

95
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:29,865
The Prince likes to tease.

96
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:34,546
Oops, I'm sorry.

97
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:37,386
What are you doing?

98
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:53,746
It's not my fault this time.

99
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:59,865
Dakyung is a book about
teas from Dang Dynasty.

100
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:07,226
Sinsuboncho is a medical book
for herbal mixing treatments.

101
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:10,826
Bonchoseubyuk.

102
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:12,186
It's written by Jin Changki,

103
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:15,026
it teaches the effectiveness of
various herbs and teas.

104
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:17,346
I've already read them all.

105
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:22,146
Yes? Then I'll add more books.

106
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:26,546
Think through what you've
done wrong for four hours.

107
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:36,666
It's all your fault.

108
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:37,786
What?

109
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:42,786
Because of your humble position
being too close to the princes.

110
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:46,106
Do not ever talk to
or look at the princes.

111
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:49,186
Then you won't go through this.

112
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:53,106
I've known them
before I got here in the palace.

113
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:57,066
It's not like I've tried to
flirt with them.

114
00:09:57,146 --> 00:10:00,506
It's your misunderstanding that
it's not easy to end relationships.

115
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:04,826
Look at your scar. You've cut it
with the Emperor that easily.

116
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:09,666
I can't let Damiwon fall into
drama because of you.

117
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:12,466
Don't get close to the princes.

118
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:15,946
Yes, ma'am.

119
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:26,786
By the way, why do you
always only eat porridge?

120
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:31,186
I've never seen you
eating a normal meal.

121
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:35,586
If I eat regular food,
it's hard to taste teas.

122
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:41,266
Stay straight.

123
00:11:05,146 --> 00:11:07,306
There's no food
because of the drought.

124
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:09,466
They won't let me play either!

125
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,865
Oh, my!

126
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:19,226
You, the bear skin?

127
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:21,666
Why are you here again?

128
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,506
Because...

129
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:28,466
I...

130
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:32,226
I mean...

131
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:34,186
What? You, what?

132
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:37,146
Do you even know some
fun things to do or not?

133
00:11:57,706 --> 00:11:59,506
When does a bird come?

134
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:07,146
When is it coming?

135
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:11,226
Never mind!

136
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:12,666
It's taking forever.

137
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:41,946
I got it!

138
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,626
Did you see?
I got this myself.

139
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:54,146
So we have to eat this?

140
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:08,346
More?

141
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,986
You, killer.

142
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:14,266
How can you just kill it?

143
00:13:14,346 --> 00:13:15,865
Are you even a human being?

144
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:20,946
I'm not playing
with you anymore.

145
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:22,746
Don't call me!

146
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:32,306
He wanted to eat this alive?

147
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,026
Hey.

148
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:50,266
It's burning.

149
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,186
I said it's burning.

150
00:13:55,586 --> 00:14:01,346
What would we do with a man
who can't even kill a bird?

151
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:04,106
I can do it for him.

152
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:07,266
How can he protect
his wife and children?

153
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,706
I can protect.

154
00:14:09,786 --> 00:14:10,786
Come on.

155
00:14:13,106 --> 00:14:17,906
Hey, the Fourth Prince is
great at fighting.

156
00:14:17,986 --> 00:14:20,626
And he's handsome and smart.

157
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:23,546
Why out of all...

158
00:14:26,146 --> 00:14:29,986
Don't you want to give up now?

159
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,026
I only have one heart.

160
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:42,146
Did I teach you how to fight so
you can beat your father for a man?

161
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:47,226
Do whatever you like.

162
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:54,786
It's all burnt.

163
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:16,026
I'll focus on the ritual
for rain.

164
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:20,186
Princes should refrain themselves
from going to Damiwon.

165
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:57,426
'yoke hyul'?

166
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:03,865
'Yoke' is bath.
'Hyul' is a hole...

167
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:25,546
Prince.

168
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:28,226
Su.

169
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:31,426
Why didn't I think of here?

170
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:34,865
Chaeryeong showed me.
I said I wanted to see you.

171
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:38,226
How is this place even built
like this?

172
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,865
Well, lucky for me.

173
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,186
Right next to this place is
the outside of the palace.

174
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:52,746
Don't you want to go out?

175
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:57,266
I know.

176
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:00,026
It's just a few steps away.

177
00:17:01,826 --> 00:17:06,186
I miss Chaeryeong, and
I want to see the markets.

178
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:08,826
I want to visit Ms. Hae.

179
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:15,146
But when I first got in the palace,
the Fourth Prince told me.

180
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:20,106
"No matter how hard you try to run,
you're still on the palm of the Emperor."

181
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:23,546
There's no place in Goryeo
you can hide from him.

182
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:29,106
Right.

183
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:33,026
There's no place that
his power isn't presence.

184
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,146
I like Damiwon, it fits me well.

185
00:17:41,865 --> 00:17:45,865
Until I can be officially
released from the palace,

186
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,865
I'll live here well,
trying my best.

187
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:52,506
Until then...

188
00:17:54,346 --> 00:17:56,106
please don't forget about me.

189
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:06,666
We'll have a big ritual
for rain soon.

190
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:13,306
If it rains after the ritual,
Emperor grants presents to celebrate.

191
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:18,266
It could be releasing one criminal
or a royal family wedding.

192
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:20,865
Or he gives a festival
for the elders,

193
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:21,906
or...

194
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:27,386
he sends a court lady home.

195
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:28,506
I see.

196
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:32,266
What?

197
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:34,865
Going home?

198
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:41,146
When it rains, I'll ask the Emperor
to release you to go home.

199
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:45,626
It means I can go back to your
residence?

200
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:51,226
Then,

201
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:56,746
I'll search throughout Songak
and get all the herbs and ingredients.

202
00:18:56,826 --> 00:18:58,306
I'll fill up the house.

203
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:04,546
I'm sure Chaeryeong and Princess
Yeonhwa will complain so much.

204
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:10,865
I hope it rains.

205
00:19:14,226 --> 00:19:15,586
Desperately.

206
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:20,666
Yes.

207
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:22,906
It will.

208
00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:07,506
Please do not scratch
and don't wash with cold water.

209
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:11,586
I'm going out to get
bad guys during droughts.

210
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,666
I'm sure no water is there
to wash.

211
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:14,865
Lady Su, as you know...

212
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:18,346
You have to be quiet about it.

213
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:22,146
Sure, I will.
I made sure no one see me here.

214
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:26,746
I left a necklace in your room
as a reward.

215
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,026
For taking care of me.

216
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:31,106
Thank you.

217
00:20:38,386 --> 00:20:39,626
We're ready to depart.

218
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,346
OK, let's go.

219
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,586
What are you doing?

220
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,186
Let me go!
Where are we going?

221
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,226
Empress Yu.

222
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:25,226
Where did you go?

223
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:29,146
I ran an errand.

224
00:21:29,226 --> 00:21:31,306
The Crown Prince?

225
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:35,666
I've sent him away.

226
00:21:35,746 --> 00:21:39,865
Why do you need
so many stuff to send him away?

227
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:40,986
That's...

228
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:45,546
They're all valuable ones,
not allowed to bring out.

229
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:51,386
Did Prince ask for them?

230
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:52,546
No...

231
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:56,746
I've stopped by there
while running other errands.

232
00:21:56,826 --> 00:22:00,186
Then where did you use
these valuable herbs?

233
00:22:05,506 --> 00:22:08,826
By any chance,
is Prince Crown ill?

234
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,865
Where?

235
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:16,586
I don't know anything.

236
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:19,586
You don't?

237
00:22:23,865 --> 00:22:26,226
How dare you test me?

238
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:27,706
Let her go please.

239
00:22:33,546 --> 00:22:36,865
She ran an errand for me.

240
00:22:37,865 --> 00:22:39,346
For you?

241
00:22:41,706 --> 00:22:45,106
You're making a fool out of me.

242
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,666
Because the Emperor's knees
were hurt from the rituals.

243
00:22:48,746 --> 00:22:50,865
I asked her to put some
medicine.

244
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:57,346
It's a rule not to mention about his
condition, but you're misunderstanding.

245
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,226
So I dare to speak of it.

246
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,746
Then why this girl?

247
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:07,786
She's new, but you let her treat
the Emperor?

248
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,865
Would I be me, then?

249
00:23:14,865 --> 00:23:16,106
What?

250
00:23:17,346 --> 00:23:20,226
I've asked if you'd want me
to go to the Emperor.

251
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:25,386
Would you not be
suspicious then?

252
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:36,186
Empress.

253
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:40,506
Damiwon is under my control.

254
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:44,266
I'll punish my girl in my way.

255
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:00,786
Court Lady.

256
00:24:02,865 --> 00:24:05,666
Thank you. Actually...

257
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,826
I said not to be close to the
Crown Prince.

258
00:24:11,865 --> 00:24:13,706
You're too arrogant.

259
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:19,306
I shouldn't have taken you.
I regret it now.

260
00:24:22,706 --> 00:24:23,865
Court Lady.

261
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:27,746
I...

262
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:31,266
I didn't do anything wrong.

263
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:34,666
What's the difference if you
make medicine for Emperor,

264
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:37,746
and I make it
for the Crown Prince?

265
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:41,306
I know how to help, but why do
you keep saying I shouldn't help?

266
00:24:41,386 --> 00:24:44,586
I don't know why you're only
punishing me, not other girls.

267
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,865
I really don't get it.

268
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:49,106
You don't understand the palace.

269
00:24:49,186 --> 00:24:50,186
You're too ignorant about here.

270
00:24:50,266 --> 00:24:53,946
Right, I don't.
So I'm asking you to teach me.

271
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,826
I...

272
00:24:55,865 --> 00:24:57,666
I'm always innocent.

273
00:24:59,226 --> 00:25:03,626
I tried my best to hang on,
but why do you hate me so much?

274
00:25:03,706 --> 00:25:06,266
It's so sad and frustrating!

275
00:25:06,346 --> 00:25:08,306
Because you're just like me!

276
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:15,386
You trust people, help them out
and are not afraid.

277
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:18,146
You shouldn't be in the palace.

278
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,865
You'll get killed easily.

279
00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:22,586
It makes me nervous.

280
00:25:28,346 --> 00:25:30,346
Court Lady!

281
00:25:30,426 --> 00:25:31,706
Are you OK?

282
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:34,546
Court Lady!
Wake up!

283
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:36,946
Court Lady!

284
00:25:57,865 --> 00:25:59,466
Are you OK?

285
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:02,826
What happened?

286
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:06,466
You fainted from
a stomachache.

287
00:26:06,546 --> 00:26:09,786
Doctor Tae came in during his loyal visit,
no one knows about it.

288
00:26:09,865 --> 00:26:10,865
I see.

289
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:15,706
So no one else knows?

290
00:26:15,786 --> 00:26:17,266
Don't worry.

291
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:22,706
I'll keep the secret that you have no
energy from only eating porridge.

292
00:26:24,786 --> 00:26:29,226
This is pine nut porridge.
The doctor said it's OK to eat.

293
00:26:29,306 --> 00:26:31,026
I'm good, so leave the room.

294
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:33,346
I'll leave after I see you
finishing the food.

295
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,186
Don't you try to tease me.
Get out.

296
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:38,386
Speaking harshly won't work
anymore.

297
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:40,266
What?

298
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:44,226
I now know why you've
been so mean to me.

299
00:26:46,826 --> 00:26:51,026
You worried about me getting
killed by doing something nice.

300
00:26:52,106 --> 00:26:54,865
As you've seen me hurting
myself before.

301
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:02,865
You said I'm like you.

302
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:07,106
Then I'll be extra careful
like you.

303
00:27:07,186 --> 00:27:09,106
Then I'll survive well here.

304
00:27:10,346 --> 00:27:15,106
You should also depend on someone
when you're weak like today.

305
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,865
You can do that.

306
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:26,106
Please.

307
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,066
My arms were numb making these.

308
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:41,586
This is so bad.

309
00:28:27,746 --> 00:28:31,186
What about one of the princes,
Your Majesty?

310
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:33,106
People will feel more secure if

311
00:28:33,186 --> 00:28:36,226
we tell them a prince with water
will do the ritual.

312
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:38,306
Prince Wang Won,

313
00:28:38,386 --> 00:28:42,066
the 23rd year of the sexagenary cycle,
the Year of the Dog

314
00:28:42,146 --> 00:28:44,346
Right, right.

315
00:28:44,426 --> 00:28:46,106
Why do we have to do all these?

316
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:54,865
- Jimong, can I not do this?
- What?

317
00:28:54,865 --> 00:28:57,706
I don't like putting my name
in for this.

318
00:28:57,786 --> 00:29:01,546
What if I get picked
and get all the blames?

319
00:29:02,865 --> 00:29:04,346
It's scary.

320
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:07,865
The life isn't that easy.

321
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:10,946
The rain is first, no matter who
gets picked.

322
00:29:13,306 --> 00:29:18,226
Right, as a prince, a small
talk can bring a big action.

323
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:20,386
You should be exemplary.

324
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:25,346
Jung, you haven't seen
the ritual.

325
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:29,546
Once it starts, you have to go
days with no food and water.

326
00:29:30,626 --> 00:29:33,626
If it rains, that's good.

327
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:36,666
But if it doesn't,
what would you do?

328
00:29:36,746 --> 00:29:41,106
Right. What happens
if it doesn't rain?

329
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:43,466
Die.

330
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:45,466
Die?

331
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:49,546
In the history, people have
killed their own king

332
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:52,666
and splashed the blood for rain.

333
00:29:53,466 --> 00:29:55,626
Jimong! Please take mine out.

334
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:01,146
They won't easily kill you
like that.

335
00:30:01,226 --> 00:30:02,746
As you say...

336
00:30:03,506 --> 00:30:06,865
the whole nation will blame me if it
doesn't rain, how can you live like that?

337
00:30:11,865 --> 00:30:14,746
It's not that it rains
because of the ritual,

338
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:17,226
it's that you do ritual
until it rains.

339
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:24,865
Men's will can't change
the heaven's will.

340
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,546
You just have to make it look
like it.

341
00:30:39,346 --> 00:30:42,346
Fourth Prince, Wang so.

342
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:51,865
Jimong.

343
00:30:53,746 --> 00:30:56,586
Taejo Wang Gun dares to ask

344
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:59,386
our ancestors and gods.

345
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:02,666
As I'm not good enough,

346
00:31:03,506 --> 00:31:07,266
it caused the droughts
to this land.

347
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:10,346
People are innocent,
they shouldn't suffer.

348
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:17,666
So, we'd like to present
a ritual ceremony to reach you.

349
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:22,506
Please help us select the person who'll
present the ceremony for you.

350
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:46,906
Fourth Prince, Wang So.

351
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:50,346
What?

352
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:59,865
It's the heaven's will.
Please lead the ritual.

353
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:04,786
Yes, Your Majesty.

354
00:32:29,226 --> 00:32:32,266
You've been here? You should get
ready for the ritual.

355
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:34,506
Does it make sense that I'm
selected?

356
00:32:36,506 --> 00:32:38,226
I guess heaven wanted you.

357
00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:41,826
Don't worry.
The heaven has chosen you.

358
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,146
Being suspicious won't help.

359
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:48,426
Right.

360
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:50,026
I'm chosen.

361
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:49,626
Please give us rain.
Please make it rain.

362
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:55,346
What is it?

363
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:56,546
It's the Fourth Prince!

364
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:58,226
What is going on?

365
00:34:17,865 --> 00:34:19,746
He'll make it rain?

366
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,306
How can a masked man
do such a thing?

367
00:34:24,386 --> 00:34:27,066
The heaven will only get
more upset.

368
00:34:27,146 --> 00:34:29,586
It's a monster, not a human!

369
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:31,786
We're doomed!

370
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:35,746
You have to make it rain!

371
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:37,066
You jerk...

372
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:41,026
Give us the right person!

373
00:35:16,186 --> 00:35:18,386
Why do you abandon us?

374
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:48,026
Get out!

375
00:35:57,506 --> 00:35:59,266
Why do you abandon us?

376
00:37:32,826 --> 00:37:35,865
I told you our chance will come
if we wait.

377
00:37:36,865 --> 00:37:42,226
This is our chance to change
the Crown Prince, don't lost it.

378
00:37:42,306 --> 00:37:47,826
I've put men on his way home.
He won't make it here soon.

379
00:37:49,346 --> 00:37:53,106
So kills people very easily.

380
00:37:53,186 --> 00:37:55,865
But he gets so vulnerable
when it's about his face.

381
00:37:58,106 --> 00:38:02,186
I think it's right that
heaven has abandoned him.

382
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:05,466
He got picked when I wished.

383
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:10,186
I wonder why Jimong and
the Emperor picked him.

384
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:11,746
Picked?

385
00:38:11,826 --> 00:38:14,666
How do they know?

386
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:17,826
Do you think the heaven's will
would change humans' will?

387
00:38:19,586 --> 00:38:23,666
It's all nonsense. It's humans
that changes heaven's will.

388
00:38:23,746 --> 00:38:28,746
It's same for the ritual. Whoever it is,
you just do it until it rains.

389
00:38:30,346 --> 00:38:32,865
It's not that it rains because
of the ritual.

390
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:35,226
It's that you do the
ritual until it rains.

391
00:38:39,226 --> 00:38:41,865
I've heard something similar.

392
00:38:43,626 --> 00:38:45,506
This time...

393
00:38:45,586 --> 00:38:48,186
you should see
what this Goryeo is like.

394
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,106
Can you do it?

395
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:27,546
Prince.

396
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:30,906
Prince?

397
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:40,226
When did he bring this?

398
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:48,826
Are you sleeping?

399
00:39:52,386 --> 00:39:53,626
Is he dead?

400
00:40:20,106 --> 00:40:22,306
Why are you hiding here?

401
00:40:23,706 --> 00:40:27,346
You should go now.
Everyone is worried about you.

402
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:29,865
Nope.

403
00:40:30,865 --> 00:40:33,586
Don't mind too much.

404
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,946
People will forget about it
soon.

405
00:40:37,026 --> 00:40:39,346
I said I don't want your pity.

406
00:40:42,586 --> 00:40:46,586
Do you know why you're born?

407
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:47,666
What?

408
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:53,546
Have you asked yourself how long you
have to live the world like here?

409
00:40:53,626 --> 00:40:54,786
I have.

410
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:58,266
I sometimes do these days.

411
00:41:03,706 --> 00:41:04,746
You have?

412
00:41:06,426 --> 00:41:10,506
But, there's no answer.

413
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:14,146
It's not I can choose to be born
like this.

414
00:41:14,226 --> 00:41:16,586
But I can choose how I live.

415
00:41:18,626 --> 00:41:21,306
I can have a great life or a
miserable one.

416
00:41:21,386 --> 00:41:23,865
But I won't live
a life that's swayed.

417
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,346
I've decided to live like that.

418
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:33,706
There's no one living
an easy life.

419
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:38,706
It's just that you can't see it.
Everyone is hard.

420
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:49,106
They will open the ritual soon.

421
00:41:49,186 --> 00:41:52,226
Everything you went through
will pass, too.

422
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:56,306
You pretend to know everything.

423
00:41:57,546 --> 00:41:58,586
I don't like it.

424
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:23,186
Why would he say it like that...

425
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:25,586
I keep thinking about it.

426
00:42:29,586 --> 00:42:30,706
Right.

427
00:42:31,546 --> 00:42:34,066
Who know it might rain
if you do a good deed.

428
00:42:35,346 --> 00:42:39,106
I'll go one more time,
for the day I'm out of here.

429
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:44,586
Today is the ritual day, but the
Crown Prince is not here yet.

430
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:46,786
Something bad must have
happened.

431
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,346
Let's wait a bit more.

432
00:42:50,826 --> 00:42:54,426
People will rise up
if we delay the ritual.

433
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:57,066
I'll go see if the Crown Prince
is coming.

434
00:42:57,146 --> 00:43:00,026
Please try to talk to people
meanwhile.

435
00:43:00,106 --> 00:43:01,546
I'm not going.

436
00:43:03,746 --> 00:43:06,826
That was enough to be
in front of people.

437
00:43:06,865 --> 00:43:10,186
So the Crown Prince is doing it
instead of you.

438
00:43:10,266 --> 00:43:12,746
You kill people without blinking
your eyes.

439
00:43:12,826 --> 00:43:15,226
How can you belittle yourself
for that?

440
00:43:16,826 --> 00:43:18,306
For what?

441
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:23,266
You're too obsessed
about your scar.

442
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:26,426
If you don't overcome it, you can't
support the Crown Prince.

443
00:43:26,506 --> 00:43:29,226
No, you can ease
your anger towards the Empress.

444
00:43:32,186 --> 00:43:33,186
So?

445
00:43:33,865 --> 00:43:36,506
You picked me on purpose
to embarrass me like that?

446
00:43:36,586 --> 00:43:37,865
Why?

447
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,786
If I hit the bottom,
I should overcome it?

448
00:43:40,865 --> 00:43:42,586
Is that why?

449
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:44,266
You knew it all.

450
00:43:51,826 --> 00:43:54,106
Please be confident.

451
00:43:54,186 --> 00:43:56,746
Then the number of rocks
thrown at you will reduce.

452
00:43:57,746 --> 00:43:59,626
Have you ever be hit by them?

453
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:03,626
Heaven's will? My foot.

454
00:44:03,706 --> 00:44:07,786
You think my brain isn't working
either because of the scar?

455
00:44:07,865 --> 00:44:12,506
When other princes were praised,
I was treated like a servant.

456
00:44:12,586 --> 00:44:14,666
And I became the host
of the ritual.

457
00:44:15,666 --> 00:44:17,106
There must be no reason to pick

458
00:44:17,186 --> 00:44:19,386
me unless you need a servant to
sacrifice.

459
00:44:19,466 --> 00:44:22,106
If it rains, that servant
will become the Emperor.

460
00:44:23,865 --> 00:44:26,026
From heaven's will...

461
00:44:26,106 --> 00:44:29,826
it's telling me clearly that
you'll stand out among people.

462
00:44:29,865 --> 00:44:32,306
That way the Crown Prince will
become the Emperor,

463
00:44:32,386 --> 00:44:34,066
and you'll be the powerful Prince.

464
00:44:35,865 --> 00:44:40,386
I'm only the planner,
I can't make things happen.

465
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,666
I get it.

466
00:44:44,786 --> 00:44:46,066
I understand.

467
00:44:47,746 --> 00:44:50,466
This is your limit.

468
00:45:40,826 --> 00:45:42,386
Come with me. Hurry.

469
00:45:42,466 --> 00:45:46,226
I'm going to the ritual.
I don't have time.

470
00:45:46,306 --> 00:45:49,666
I'll take that mask off.

471
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:52,306
What?

472
00:47:00,506 --> 00:47:01,746
You...

473
00:47:03,706 --> 00:47:06,266
you're okay with
this terrible face?

474
00:47:08,865 --> 00:47:10,226
Or you feel pity?

475
00:47:11,306 --> 00:47:14,186
How can I feel pity
for such an arrogant man?

476
00:47:27,346 --> 00:47:28,865
It's not that big.

477
00:47:30,506 --> 00:47:35,746
It's not fair to make your life
depressing for this small scar.

478
00:47:44,786 --> 00:47:46,746
Can I trust you?

479
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:52,706
I've always wondered
and been suspicious.

480
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,786
If you trust me,
I won't change first.

481
00:47:59,865 --> 00:48:01,865
I promise.

482
00:48:05,706 --> 00:48:09,906
I can ask for your hand
since it's you.

483
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:16,426
Do it yourself.

484
00:48:19,626 --> 00:48:20,826
I'm now...

485
00:48:22,865 --> 00:48:23,865
all yours.

486
00:49:05,865 --> 00:49:07,106
The Crown Prince
is not here yet?

487
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:12,865
Why don't we wait a bit more,
Your Majesty?

488
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,865
What if something happened?

489
00:49:14,906 --> 00:49:17,626
Then we should release the
soldiers!

490
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:18,865
Never.

491
00:49:19,266 --> 00:49:23,666
His star is still up there.
Don't say such things easily.

492
00:49:24,865 --> 00:49:27,266
We can't wait forever.

493
00:49:27,346 --> 00:49:31,586
What if we miss the time
for the ritual?

494
00:49:32,865 --> 00:49:36,426
Your Majesty, please have the
Third Prince as the host for the ritual.

495
00:49:37,586 --> 00:49:42,666
He's the oldest after the Crown
Prince. People won't complain.

496
00:49:51,626 --> 00:49:55,626
Oh, my, my stomach urgently...

497
00:50:17,426 --> 00:50:20,386
The Crown Prince won't come
even if you try so hard.

498
00:50:22,226 --> 00:50:24,066
What are you talking about?

499
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:27,786
I'm saying my brother is
talented, missing his time.

500
00:50:46,546 --> 00:50:47,786
What?

501
00:50:47,865 --> 00:50:49,786
I'm here to take my seat.

502
00:50:53,546 --> 00:50:57,786
I thought only I can sit here
if it's not the Crown Prince.

503
00:50:59,586 --> 00:51:02,865
How dare an animal talk to me
like this?

504
00:51:21,346 --> 00:51:22,346
You...

505
00:51:25,506 --> 00:51:27,346
Please come up.

506
00:51:27,426 --> 00:51:28,466
Jimong!

507
00:51:28,546 --> 00:51:31,546
The heaven picked
the Fourth Prince.

508
00:51:35,066 --> 00:51:36,066
Let's go.

509
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:57,266
Please make it rain.

510
00:51:57,346 --> 00:51:59,306
Give us rain.

511
00:51:59,386 --> 00:52:00,546
Please.

512
00:52:05,426 --> 00:52:07,826
Please give us rain.

513
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,506
It's the Fourth Prince!

514
00:52:24,586 --> 00:52:26,346
Again?

515
00:52:26,426 --> 00:52:28,506
Why are you here again?

516
00:52:28,586 --> 00:52:31,466
Stop making fun of us!

517
00:52:31,546 --> 00:52:34,666
Wait! Look at him!

518
00:52:34,746 --> 00:52:37,146
He looks different.

519
00:52:37,226 --> 00:52:38,786
There's no scar!

520
00:52:41,146 --> 00:52:43,066
He's not wearing the mask!

521
00:52:43,146 --> 00:52:46,186
They said he'd have worms
on his face.

522
00:52:47,186 --> 00:52:48,186
But...

523
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:50,066
The son of dragon!

524
00:52:50,146 --> 00:52:52,346
Please give us rain!

525
00:54:22,865 --> 00:54:24,626
What happened?

526
00:54:25,506 --> 00:54:27,346
Where's Yong?

527
00:54:27,426 --> 00:54:28,865
Calm down.

528
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:33,186
The ritual should come first.

529
00:57:22,346 --> 00:57:24,865
It's raining!

530
00:57:25,786 --> 00:57:28,546
Raining! Thank you!

531
00:57:28,626 --> 00:57:30,865
Finally, it's raining!

532
00:57:32,865 --> 00:57:34,786
It's raining!

533
00:57:40,266 --> 00:57:41,786
Raining!

534
00:58:28,746 --> 00:58:31,466
Gwangjong?

535
00:59:06,865 --> 00:59:09,626
Now be confident
with your bare face.

536
00:59:09,706 --> 00:59:11,546
That was your chance of life!

537
00:59:11,626 --> 00:59:13,865
You should've grabbed it
even if you had to tear him off!

538
00:59:13,865 --> 00:59:15,466
Be careful of Wang So.

539
00:59:15,546 --> 00:59:18,146
You have to make it clear
if you can't be there for him.

540
00:59:18,226 --> 00:59:21,186
There must be a place
that needs me.

541
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,866
You cannot interfere.

542
00:59:22,946 --> 00:59:24,106
If I can change...

543
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:25,666
You've already touched

544
00:59:25,746 --> 00:59:26,746
Wang So's face.

545
00:59:26,826 --> 00:59:28,865
I don't want to get married.

546
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,266
Do you really want to die
for humiliating your father?

547
00:59:31,346 --> 00:59:33,266
If you wait for me...

548
00:59:33,346 --> 00:59:34,506
I can wait too.

549
00:59:34,586 --> 00:59:36,066
I love you.

550
00:59:36,146 --> 00:59:38,386
Please give me Haesu
as my person.
