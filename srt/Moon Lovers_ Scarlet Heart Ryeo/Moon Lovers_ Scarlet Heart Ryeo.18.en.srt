1
00:00:03,593 --> 00:00:05,353
SCARLET HEART

2
00:00:10,873 --> 00:00:13,193
THIS SHOW IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED ON HISTORIC EVENTS

3
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:16,193
I am about to marry the Emperor.

4
00:00:17,513 --> 00:00:19,433
I will be his wife.

5
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:25,032
I...
will be Empress.

6
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:35,513
I need to hear it directly from him
before I believe you.

7
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:38,273
There are things he can't say.

8
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:44,032
All the nobles of Goryeo are trying to
take him down from the throne.

9
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:49,032
He halted transferring the capitol,
the locals are displeased.

10
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:54,433
Chungju Yus are afraid that the mistreated
4th Prince became Emperor.

11
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:57,153
And the Songak nobles...

12
00:00:59,753 --> 00:01:00,913
See?

13
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:05,032
Has the Emperor ever talked to you
about these things?

14
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:11,433
I'm sure you're content with
this small room, waiting for him.

15
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:15,993
Making a woman with small ambitions
the Empress

16
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,873
puts this country in jeopardy.

17
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:23,433
It will drag him down from the throne.

18
00:01:23,873 --> 00:01:25,313
And you...

19
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:28,713
You are different?

20
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:30,033
Also...

21
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:35,033
the Emperor's wife can't have
a scar on her body.

22
00:01:40,153 --> 00:01:42,873
I proposed a way to coexist.

23
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:46,032
If you choose to be unhappy,
that's on you.

24
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:56,273
I come from Hwangju Hwangbo family.

25
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:59,593
I am the daughter
of our founding father.

26
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,433
I am the only one

27
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:05,873
who can protect the Emperor.

28
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:26,873
She...

29
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:29,793
can never be Empress.

30
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:31,513
If I say so...

31
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,032
she can.

32
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,953
Did you forget?

33
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:40,593
Haesu, in order to avoid
marrying our founding father...

34
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:43,633
she slit her wrist.

35
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:48,273
A woman with a scar...

36
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:52,153
cannot marry the Emperor.

37
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:56,953
There is only one way to marry her.

38
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,433
Take off the throne.

39
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:04,273
Which one will you let go?

40
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:06,233
The throne?

41
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,032
Or Haesu?

42
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:20,793
I won't let go of either.

43
00:03:22,113 --> 00:03:25,032
Maybe others had to let go.

44
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:28,473
But I became Emperor to have everything.

45
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:30,433
And...

46
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:35,993
do you think I'll let go of Haesu
because of a scar?

47
00:03:38,313 --> 00:03:39,473
Look at me.

48
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:48,353
I became Emperor with a scar on my face.

49
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:33,433
I had my reasons to come here.

50
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:36,032
Yu family wants independence.

51
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,633
Your lieges want control over
budget and arms.

52
00:04:38,793 --> 00:04:41,032
After transferring the capitol
was canceled,

53
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:43,273
it's only the locals filing complaints.

54
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:45,873
Chungju Yu and Hwangju Hwangbo,

55
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:48,313
those two families are against you.

56
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:50,713
It won't be easy to deal with them.

57
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:53,313
Skip the intro.

58
00:04:54,073 --> 00:04:56,313
Get right to the point.

59
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:01,553
If that is the case,
here is my proposal.

60
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:05,273
Marry the Hwangbo family.

61
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:11,233
If you marry Princess Yeonhwa,
most of the problems will be solved.

62
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,113
It is our collective opinion.

63
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:21,032
My marriage is my business.

64
00:05:21,993 --> 00:05:23,233
As the rumor goes...

65
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:27,153
You aren't going to marry that
Damiwon court lady, are you?

66
00:05:27,713 --> 00:05:31,073
Do you not want to keep the throne?

67
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:33,313
Watch your manners!

68
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:37,433
Chungju Yu family
or any strong noble family

69
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:40,193
will tear this country apart.

70
00:05:40,313 --> 00:05:44,393
Do you want to be
the last Emperor of Goryeo?

71
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:47,032
Your worry is excessive.

72
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:50,073
Remember our founding father.

73
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:55,073
He gave up many things
in order to protect this country.

74
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:57,032
Yes, because I am worried...

75
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:00,793
I'm letting go of my son.

76
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:04,553
And giving my daughter to you.

77
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:18,032
Haesu wrote this.

78
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:27,033
She writes in a foreign language.

79
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:30,953
And the work she did in Damiwon.
She's different.

80
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:36,673
She has no background.
Only many weaknesses.

81
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:50,993
I don't care.

82
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:56,032
The throne isn't that important.

83
00:06:56,633 --> 00:07:00,393
The only way to get rid of it
is by death.

84
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:07,153
Chaeryeong.

85
00:07:09,193 --> 00:07:10,593
Welcome.

86
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:12,793
Were you scolded?

87
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:17,033
I have good news.
Smile.

88
00:07:18,073 --> 00:07:20,273
What do you mean, good news?

89
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,993
The Emperor approved your stay.

90
00:07:24,113 --> 00:07:25,633
Really?

91
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:31,353
But...

92
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:35,873
I heard the princess Yeonhwa
was going to be Empress.

93
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:39,633
Shouldn't it be you?
Why Princess Yeonhwa?

94
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,553
Princess told us to prepare
for a royal wedding.

95
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,113
It's a mistake, isn't it?

96
00:07:53,032 --> 00:07:54,113
Lady Hae.

97
00:07:59,953 --> 00:08:02,593
There was time when it was crowded.

98
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:07,032
10th Prince loved these wings.

99
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:10,913
Wow! Look at this!
What is this?

100
00:08:12,713 --> 00:08:16,553
3rd and 8th Prince
loved to read those books.

101
00:08:22,273 --> 00:08:24,233
And the constellation drawing.

102
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,153
14th Prince had fun with it.

103
00:08:27,513 --> 00:08:31,032
- That's my star.
- What about mine?

104
00:08:31,073 --> 00:08:34,032
- You don't have one. Only darkness.
- Yes, thank you.

105
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:37,433
9th Prince wanted me to
teach him alchemy.

106
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:40,793
And Baeka was always drawing.

107
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:50,753
It all passed by too quick.

108
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,113
I know you really love the princes.

109
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:57,993
Yes, very much.

110
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:04,032
That's why I'm saying this.

111
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,393
Give up on the marriage.

112
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:11,753
I know he'll be stubborn.

113
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:15,233
That's why you have to let go.

114
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:20,433
I refuse.

115
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:23,353
I...

116
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:27,032
I endured a lot,
waited a long time.

117
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:31,032
I could because
I had hope for us being happy.

118
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:34,313
I wouldn't have come this far,

119
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,793
if I wanted to give up.

120
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:44,153
If he wants to be with me,
I will comply.

121
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,033
I'll see it through.

122
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,553
The princes who crowded this place...

123
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:53,393
Where are they now?

124
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:06,313
If the Emperor isn't strong,
there will be more bloodshed.

125
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,032
He might even get hurt.

126
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:13,233
If someone else dies
because of your stubbornness,

127
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:16,273
how could you live with that?

128
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:21,032
We watched many go down.

129
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:24,793
To prevent further tragedy,
we need to strengthen the throne.

130
00:10:25,673 --> 00:10:29,473
You can comfort him,
but you can't strengthen him.

131
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,032
You aren't fit as his wife.

132
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:06,753
Who said you can barge in here?

133
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:11,193
People found out
that you love me dearly.

134
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:15,313
Because of you,
they might think I'm soft.

135
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:19,393
Before that happens,
want to go out on a date?

136
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:21,153
Did you forget?

137
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:24,713
Tonight is Narye.

138
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:29,713
It's not New Year's Eve yet.
We can't celebrate already.

139
00:11:30,153 --> 00:11:32,553
Not in the palace.
I mean Namdae Street.

140
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:36,032
- Let's go out to Namdae Street.
- Leave the palace?

141
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:39,593
It's a bit sudden.

142
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:43,353
To get the guards ready
and you know...

143
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,513
No one will know.

144
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:52,353
If you change clothes
no one will know you're the Emperor.

145
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:21,713
I was talking to Chaeryeong
when you ran by.

146
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:27,633
Don't you remember?

147
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:37,713
What was I dreaming?

148
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:41,113
Did I want it?
Did you know?

149
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:44,513
Maybe not.

150
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:49,032
I wished for you.

151
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:55,313
I confess
I awaited...

152
00:12:55,553 --> 00:13:01,032
I'll shout out I love you every day.

153
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:06,593
I'll call out your name every day.

154
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:12,153
The moment you stand before me.

155
00:13:12,553 --> 00:13:17,793
I think and think about it.

156
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:24,433
I love you. I love you.
I love you.

157
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:27,233
Huh? This is...

158
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:33,953
Not as good as the original,
but still looks pretty nice.

159
00:13:34,593 --> 00:13:37,033
Looks like it'll grant our wishes.

160
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,553
Did you build this
to make me propose?

161
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:43,473
Yes, I did.

162
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:48,032
You asked for a rock pile
so the desperate one made it.

163
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:54,353
I should have just ran away
when I first met you.

164
00:13:55,153 --> 00:13:57,873
I did run away.
But you captured me.

165
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:01,713
I don't remember what attracted me.

166
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:04,273
But now I have too many reasons.

167
00:14:07,753 --> 00:14:09,233
I want to live with you.

168
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:19,513
Let's be together.

169
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:22,393
Will you...

170
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:24,993
marry me?

171
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:41,753
I can't.

172
00:14:47,032 --> 00:14:48,193
I...

173
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:52,393
I can only comfort you.

174
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:56,353
I'm not worthy enough.

175
00:14:57,032 --> 00:14:59,113
Who talked to you?

176
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:05,793
I won't give up because of your scar.

177
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:10,273
No one can come between us.

178
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:13,593
I won't give up either.

179
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:16,513
I'll always be beside you.

180
00:15:18,032 --> 00:15:20,833
If I do become an Empress...

181
00:15:21,513 --> 00:15:25,953
The rules of the palace will forbid me
from seeing you whenever I want.

182
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:28,393
And I don't like formalities.

183
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:34,833
You know I'm not that kind of person.

184
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:38,032
Don't you?

185
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:48,033
I'll be fine.

186
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:51,633
I...

187
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:55,593
I really will be fine.

188
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:11,233
Even if I can't marry you...

189
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:13,313
Still...

190
00:16:15,913 --> 00:16:17,553
You can't leave me.

191
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:19,913
I won't let you go.

192
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:24,673
You are mine.

193
00:16:27,032 --> 00:16:28,633
You can't leave.

194
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:32,353
I won't let you.

195
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:46,273
My only Empress...

196
00:16:48,913 --> 00:16:50,032
is you.

197
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:40,833
To proclaim the Hwangju family's
Hwangbo Yeonhwa as Empress,

198
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:46,073
we show all lieges,
the royal seal for the ceremony.

199
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:51,673
Congratulations, Empress.

200
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:55,433
Long live the Empress!

201
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:59,313
Long live the Empress!

202
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:09,193
Even if we are in tears,
for the rest of our lives.

203
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:16,233
Like the winds scattering away.

204
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:23,713
Like the roads that we will never find.

205
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:31,433
When the day we meet again comes

206
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:34,593
My only Empress...

207
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:38,553
is you.

208
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:05,073
I wasn't invited either.

209
00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:09,313
Although Yeonhwa told me to come.

210
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,913
Do you still want to stay
after being treated like this?

211
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:22,032
Don't worry.

212
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,673
I'm not unhappy.

213
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:30,553
Founding father told me...

214
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:34,873
Don't look too far into the future.
Cherish the present.

215
00:19:35,953 --> 00:19:37,233
Just like he said.

216
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:43,353
Why don't you come with me?
I'll treat you well.

217
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:46,113
I'm tired of this place.

218
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:54,113
Let's go far away.
Like a bird.

219
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:59,713
Let's see places, be free.
Like a butterfly.

220
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:04,393
You'll take me to battlefields.
Show off your skills.

221
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:06,032
Just let me know.

222
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,032
I will take you.

223
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:12,032
If I say, "I want it,"
will you do it for me?

224
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:14,032
Yes, I will.

225
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,193
Just say, "I want it."

226
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:18,753
Remember.

227
00:20:19,673 --> 00:20:21,073
I want it.

228
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:48,353
Are you listening to my voice?

229
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:51,993
I'm saying I love you.

230
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:55,433
Are you listening to me?

231
00:20:55,713 --> 00:21:00,032
Can you hear my heart?

232
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:05,873
Like the rain on the window.

233
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:12,032
You are soaking up my mind.

234
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,873
People will keep using Haesu
to get to you.

235
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:44,753
- You should get rid of...
- You.

236
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:48,073
Just play your role, Empress.

237
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,113
Don't cross the line, ever again.

238
00:22:04,513 --> 00:22:09,993
Are you listening to my voice?

239
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:13,753
I'm saying I love you.

240
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:17,032
Are you listening to me?

241
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:22,833
Can you hear my heart?

242
00:22:23,032 --> 00:22:27,593
Like the rain on the window.

243
00:22:31,313 --> 00:22:32,553
Miss.

244
00:22:36,673 --> 00:22:38,233
Are you okay?

245
00:22:45,353 --> 00:22:47,273
If your heart aches...

246
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:49,993
your body will hurt, too.

247
00:22:54,793 --> 00:22:55,913
Thank you.

248
00:22:58,953 --> 00:23:03,393
I remember Madam Hae's rock piles
back at 8th Prince's house.

249
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:05,433
Yeah.

250
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:09,273
She made many.

251
00:23:14,032 --> 00:23:15,073
I miss her.

252
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:26,873
What's your wish?

253
00:23:27,313 --> 00:23:29,233
It's not a wish.

254
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:34,433
Just thought of my late mother.

255
00:23:36,593 --> 00:23:38,673
I'm doing well.

256
00:23:39,032 --> 00:23:40,753
My brothers are well, too.

257
00:23:43,153 --> 00:23:46,113
Are you fully cured now?

258
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:49,032
I wanted to help.

259
00:23:50,032 --> 00:23:51,433
But still...

260
00:23:52,753 --> 00:23:55,032
I sometimes think that I'm glad...

261
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:57,113
your pain is over.

262
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,113
I'm doing well.

263
00:24:19,393 --> 00:24:20,553
I'm...

264
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:23,913
doing well.

265
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:32,553
Doing well...

266
00:25:36,153 --> 00:25:39,553
I am extremely happy
to see you all here.

267
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:43,513
In order to celebrate my ascension,

268
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:45,273
I want to name my era.

269
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:48,913
He wants to name it Gwangdeok.

270
00:25:49,032 --> 00:25:50,633
GWANGDEOK
NAME OF GWANGJONG ERA

271
00:25:50,793 --> 00:25:52,273
A nice name, isn't it?

272
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,793
We all agree, your highness.

273
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:02,233
And as you ordered,

274
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:06,032
we are planning to provide
rice to labor-participating commoners.

275
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:09,273
One thing.

276
00:26:09,753 --> 00:26:13,513
Let us take care of
financing the supply.

277
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:18,233
Approved.

278
00:26:26,873 --> 00:26:28,953
With all you reliable lieges

279
00:26:29,032 --> 00:26:32,953
I would like to enjoy
some hunting and reading.

280
00:26:33,753 --> 00:26:37,313
Astrologer suggested I read
Jeonggwanjeongyo.

281
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:40,633
The best book to increase wisdom.

282
00:26:42,593 --> 00:26:46,353
Oh, and 14th Prince Wang Jeong.

283
00:26:46,993 --> 00:26:50,313
For his crime equivalent to treason,
I sentence him to exile.

284
00:26:50,393 --> 00:26:51,393
Your highness!

285
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:55,273
EXILE
DEPRIVE RANK, BAN TO HOMELAND

286
00:26:55,353 --> 00:26:58,753
You need a strong reason
in order to gain support.

287
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:02,873
By questioning former Emperor's will,
he suspected my succession.

288
00:27:02,953 --> 00:27:04,873
And organized a resistance.

289
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:08,313
Considering he's my blood brother,

290
00:27:08,553 --> 00:27:11,032
I'm only taking away his rank
instead of executing him.

291
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:13,513
He will be sent home to Chungju.

292
00:27:14,673 --> 00:27:18,873
If he sets foot in Songak ever again,

293
00:27:20,032 --> 00:27:21,913
he will be executed.

294
00:27:33,393 --> 00:27:34,713
Exile?

295
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,393
My Jeong is...

296
00:27:39,513 --> 00:27:40,713
exiled?

297
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:51,833
Empress Dowager!
Call the doctor!

298
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:55,313
Exile?

299
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,593
Banned to his homeland.

300
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:02,593
Next big punishment to execution.

301
00:28:04,313 --> 00:28:07,473
He lost his general rank
and authority over his troops.

302
00:28:08,793 --> 00:28:11,873
He will never be allowed back into Songak.

303
00:28:12,753 --> 00:28:15,032
He is confined to his Chungju home.

304
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:18,353
He led 300 thousand troops.

305
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:21,033
He used to get itchy
and jumped the palace walls.

306
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:23,953
We won't survive confinement.

307
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,433
We need to talk to the Emperor.

308
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:29,153
- Jeong won't survive.
- You have to hold back.

309
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:31,513
You don't have authority.

310
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:34,553
If you interfere,
you might get into trouble.

311
00:28:34,873 --> 00:28:35,913
Now...

312
00:28:36,953 --> 00:28:39,993
- It's more than a family feud.
- Uhui is right.

313
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:44,913
Let's wait till his anger subsides,
then we can talk.

314
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:57,713
How's her condition?

315
00:28:57,793 --> 00:29:03,473
The doctor says the Emperor and Empress
should not leave her side.

316
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:16,793
Jeong.

317
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:19,553
Call Jeong.

318
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,513
I'll bring the Emperor.

319
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:23,873
Jeong.

320
00:29:25,393 --> 00:29:27,473
Bring Jeong.

321
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,553
Jeong...

322
00:29:36,713 --> 00:29:37,873
Your Highness.

323
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:44,313
I will take care of her from now on.

324
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:48,153
No one will enter this room
without my permission.

325
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:12,993
You need to get well.

326
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:16,033
Mother.

327
00:30:31,273 --> 00:30:33,193
I need to see my mother.
Move away.

328
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:37,513
Move away!

329
00:30:38,032 --> 00:30:40,473
I won't move till I see my mother.

330
00:30:40,793 --> 00:30:41,993
Stand back.

331
00:30:44,473 --> 00:30:46,673
Please let Jeong in.

332
00:30:48,753 --> 00:30:52,593
If Empress Dowager does pass away,
he'll have a grudge for life.

333
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:57,153
Did you tell Jeong?

334
00:30:58,032 --> 00:31:00,433
My orders were to have no communication.

335
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:03,033
Only you could have ignored that.

336
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:05,913
Yes.

337
00:31:07,513 --> 00:31:09,032
I told him.

338
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:14,153
He had no contact with his mother.
He should be there when she passes.

339
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:16,032
Do you want Jeong to die?

340
00:31:17,273 --> 00:31:18,273
What?

341
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:20,513
Violating curfew can lead to execution.

342
00:31:21,073 --> 00:31:22,233
Your highness!

343
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:27,032
Let him in?
He should be happy he's still alive.

344
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:39,113
You will be punished if you let Jeong in.
No exceptions.

345
00:33:22,073 --> 00:33:25,953
For over five days, you haven't even
drank the water I gave you.

346
00:33:28,032 --> 00:33:29,993
Do you want to die like this?

347
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:48,473
Jeong.

348
00:33:49,673 --> 00:33:50,833
Jeong.

349
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:53,193
Jeong...

350
00:33:58,913 --> 00:33:59,993
Look.

351
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:04,473
Which son is by your side right now?

352
00:34:06,032 --> 00:34:08,032
Your perfect Yo...

353
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,513
He's no longer here.

354
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,713
Your beloved Jeong...

355
00:34:15,032 --> 00:34:16,953
He can't even be here.

356
00:34:19,113 --> 00:34:20,953
I'm the only one left.

357
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:26,513
I became Emperor to be by your side.

358
00:34:38,713 --> 00:34:41,032
You will remember today.

359
00:34:43,273 --> 00:34:45,553
You threw me away.

360
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:49,153
But I will not leave.

361
00:34:51,793 --> 00:34:53,032
From now on...

362
00:34:54,953 --> 00:34:56,993
I will make you look at me.

363
00:35:05,513 --> 00:35:07,953
I will build a temple for you.

364
00:35:09,032 --> 00:35:15,193
The largest temple in Goryeo.
The most glamorous, just like you.

365
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:17,913
And...

366
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:22,032
I will spread made-up stories about us.

367
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,273
About how much you loved me.

368
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:29,993
About how much I loved you back.

369
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:33,473
About how much we missed each other.

370
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,032
I will let the whole world know.

371
00:35:36,993 --> 00:35:38,593
So I can...

372
00:35:40,593 --> 00:35:44,873
So I can be your one and only son.

373
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:51,273
This...

374
00:35:54,273 --> 00:35:56,313
is my revenge...

375
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,593
for being abandoned by you.

376
00:36:42,593 --> 00:36:48,593
Blown away by the seasons

377
00:36:49,513 --> 00:36:56,032
Fallen flower petal.

378
00:36:56,873 --> 00:37:03,032
Alone by itself.

379
00:37:03,273 --> 00:37:09,553
Sad.

380
00:37:10,513 --> 00:37:17,032
The stars have left.

381
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:24,032
The sky in sorrow.

382
00:37:24,273 --> 00:37:30,753
Like the raindrops falling.

383
00:37:31,273 --> 00:37:37,593
I can only shed tears.

384
00:37:38,393 --> 00:37:45,353
Like the flowers bloom and wilt.

385
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:51,713
My mind does, too.

386
00:37:52,153 --> 00:37:59,113
Send it with...

387
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:07,793
the wind.

388
00:38:16,953 --> 00:38:18,113
Go back home.

389
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:20,873
I'll take care of mother.

390
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:24,673
You will be penalized later
for breaking curfew.

391
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:36,233
My heart wrenches

392
00:38:37,513 --> 00:38:42,032
Do you know?

393
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:50,193
I will come back.

394
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:57,033
Why did you take Jeong's side?

395
00:38:57,313 --> 00:39:00,633
- You should have been on my side.
- I'm not taking any side.

396
00:39:01,032 --> 00:39:04,032
Your ego blocked Jeong from
being by his mother's side.

397
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:05,913
He doesn't need sympathy.

398
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:08,313
I'm the one
who was always abandoned.

399
00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:10,953
Your Highness.

400
00:39:11,673 --> 00:39:15,873
Only with her last breath
did she touch my face.

401
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:21,793
I've never had mother to myself
for over 25 years.

402
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:25,593
Is it that bad I saw her off?

403
00:39:43,513 --> 00:39:44,673
You...

404
00:39:46,473 --> 00:39:48,713
should have tried to understand me.

405
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:15,032
The one who poisoned our big brother
with mercury was...

406
00:40:16,193 --> 00:40:17,273
Uk.

407
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:19,553
Right?

408
00:40:22,032 --> 00:40:23,593
I don't know.

409
00:40:24,553 --> 00:40:28,032
Back at Uk's residence,
Haesu's servant Chaeryeong.

410
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:30,433
Didn't she work for you before?

411
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,793
The one who put her in Damiwon was...

412
00:40:34,553 --> 00:40:36,153
also Uk and you.

413
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:40,032
Poisoning our big brother...

414
00:40:40,193 --> 00:40:42,473
Fabricating Wang Gyu's revolt...

415
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:45,073
It was all Uk's plan.

416
00:40:48,032 --> 00:40:50,153
If Uk denies his part,

417
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,073
I will personally make you responsible.

418
00:40:54,673 --> 00:40:56,073
It really wasn't me.

419
00:40:56,193 --> 00:40:58,793
I don't have the capacity for that.

420
00:40:59,153 --> 00:41:00,913
If you keep refuting,

421
00:41:01,113 --> 00:41:04,673
Emperor will include that with
you profiteering off the silver clocks

422
00:41:05,073 --> 00:41:06,873
and sentence Paenghyeong.

423
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:09,032
PAENGHYEONG
DEATH BY BOILING

424
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:17,032
I just moved around a bit
per orders.

425
00:41:22,473 --> 00:41:23,633
It was all...

426
00:41:24,913 --> 00:41:26,153
brother Uk.

427
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:29,032
Along with former Emperor.

428
00:41:51,113 --> 00:41:52,233
Okay.

429
00:41:54,032 --> 00:41:56,153
One last question.

430
00:42:21,353 --> 00:42:23,353
- Uhui.
- Hey.

431
00:42:24,393 --> 00:42:25,913
Is something wrong?

432
00:42:27,273 --> 00:42:29,393
Where is Chaeryeong?

433
00:42:44,913 --> 00:42:47,193
What's going on?
Why is everyone gathered?

434
00:42:47,353 --> 00:42:49,913
The Emperor ordered us to watch.

435
00:42:51,073 --> 00:42:52,273
The Emperor?

436
00:42:53,032 --> 00:42:55,833
He told us not to run our mouths
or else...

437
00:43:06,673 --> 00:43:09,273
What's going on?
What's with the Emperor?

438
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,153
This is horrifying.

439
00:43:13,032 --> 00:43:17,032
A Damiwon court lady committed a crime
and was sentenced Nanjanghyeong.

440
00:43:17,033 --> 00:43:19,153
NANJANGHYEONG
INDISCRIMINATE BEATING

441
00:43:19,273 --> 00:43:21,032
A Damiwon court lady?

442
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:29,032
Who?

443
00:43:33,593 --> 00:43:35,153
Who is it?

444
00:43:37,513 --> 00:43:39,032
It's Chaeryeong.

445
00:44:14,273 --> 00:44:15,433
Su.

446
00:44:16,473 --> 00:44:18,113
Su...
Su.

447
00:44:21,273 --> 00:44:23,233
My name is Haesu.

448
00:44:23,753 --> 00:44:28,513
And you're my handmaid
Miss Chaeryeong, right?

449
00:44:31,032 --> 00:44:32,593
Honey!
All right!

450
00:44:41,032 --> 00:44:42,033
What's this?

451
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:45,073
Why didn't you tell me
about her condition?

452
00:44:45,593 --> 00:44:46,873
I apologize.

453
00:44:50,873 --> 00:44:52,032
You can go.

454
00:44:55,553 --> 00:44:56,793
Chaeryeong...

455
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,193
Chaeryeong.

456
00:45:17,873 --> 00:45:19,033
Not yet.

457
00:45:21,032 --> 00:45:23,153
- Su...
- Go away!

458
00:45:26,032 --> 00:45:28,713
- Su.
- How could you?

459
00:45:31,033 --> 00:45:32,713
How could you do that?

460
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:36,473
How could you do that to her?

461
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:41,153
You beat her to death.

462
00:45:46,153 --> 00:45:47,353
Chaeryeong.

463
00:45:49,073 --> 00:45:51,153
She was spying on you.

464
00:45:53,032 --> 00:45:56,032
- What?
- She reported to 9th Prince.

465
00:45:56,032 --> 00:45:58,353
I still need your help here.

466
00:45:59,273 --> 00:46:01,193
That led to the Empress.

467
00:46:02,033 --> 00:46:03,593
Haesu wrote it.

468
00:46:04,193 --> 00:46:06,433
She stole your notebook.

469
00:46:07,313 --> 00:46:10,032
And made it look like
you could be a foreign spy.

470
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:15,553
- Are those letters?
- Yes, they are.

471
00:46:16,153 --> 00:46:18,313
You should learn to read and write.

472
00:46:19,073 --> 00:46:21,113
I'm too old to learn.

473
00:46:21,593 --> 00:46:26,032
She was also responsible for
stopping our marriage.

474
00:46:28,793 --> 00:46:31,032
The one who poured mercury in the water...

475
00:46:31,393 --> 00:46:32,753
was Chaeryeong.

476
00:46:33,953 --> 00:46:37,073
We were the only ones to have
access to the water.

477
00:46:38,353 --> 00:46:39,513
But mercury?

478
00:46:39,793 --> 00:46:40,993
I didn't do it.

479
00:46:41,793 --> 00:46:43,033
Believe me.

480
00:46:47,032 --> 00:46:49,033
Remember when you first got here?

481
00:46:51,273 --> 00:46:53,633
The passageway from
Damiwon to the bath house.

482
00:46:55,193 --> 00:46:57,153
I bet Chaeryeong told you about it.

483
00:46:57,473 --> 00:47:01,433
Miss! We need to go.
Hurry up!

484
00:47:03,032 --> 00:47:04,033
Come on!

485
00:47:06,513 --> 00:47:08,713
She learned of the path from 9th Prince.

486
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:12,473
The reason Eun couldn't escape was...

487
00:47:13,032 --> 00:47:17,833
because Uk and 9th Prince knew
and sent guards to block him off.

488
00:47:23,033 --> 00:47:24,113
Su.

489
00:47:25,032 --> 00:47:28,833
- Why did I forget about this place?
- Chaeryeong told me.

490
00:47:29,032 --> 00:47:30,993
I told her,
I had a hard time seeing you.

491
00:47:32,593 --> 00:47:34,793
The reason Uk knew was...

492
00:47:37,673 --> 00:47:38,873
It was...

493
00:47:47,553 --> 00:47:49,433
She stuck around you.

494
00:47:49,673 --> 00:47:51,513
She split us apart.

495
00:47:52,033 --> 00:47:54,273
She looked for the chance to hurt you.

496
00:47:57,032 --> 00:48:00,833
I had no want or need to forgive her.

497
00:48:04,032 --> 00:48:05,033
She...

498
00:48:08,032 --> 00:48:09,313
Her...

499
00:48:11,793 --> 00:48:14,753
Her only fault was that
she was born a slave.

500
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:20,513
She was my little sister.

501
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:37,633
Rest.

502
00:48:38,913 --> 00:48:40,313
Rest some more.

503
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:43,593
And forget it all.

504
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:38,953
It was Uk.

505
00:49:40,393 --> 00:49:43,032
He was the mastermind.

506
00:49:44,032 --> 00:49:46,273
He was the start of all this.

507
00:49:48,032 --> 00:49:53,032
Dare manipulate me
by using the throne as leverage?

508
00:49:53,313 --> 00:49:54,393
Your Highness.

509
00:49:55,473 --> 00:49:57,433
Let's investigate more before...

510
00:49:59,273 --> 00:50:01,673
Who else do I have left?

511
00:50:01,953 --> 00:50:04,953
I only had you and Haesu.

512
00:50:09,113 --> 00:50:10,873
Because of Uk...

513
00:50:12,393 --> 00:50:14,913
I became a monster to Su.

514
00:50:16,473 --> 00:50:19,153
I will make him pay.

515
00:50:33,993 --> 00:50:35,353
Dear Miss Haesu,

516
00:50:39,993 --> 00:50:42,593
I got this as a gift.

517
00:50:42,753 --> 00:50:45,153
I don't know how to read.

518
00:50:46,032 --> 00:50:48,113
I can barely read my name.

519
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:55,193
How far do your lies go?

520
00:51:09,273 --> 00:51:10,513
Miss.

521
00:51:11,073 --> 00:51:12,953
Please take care of my family.

522
00:51:13,993 --> 00:51:17,113
I know the end is near.

523
00:51:18,113 --> 00:51:20,393
I wanted to confess.

524
00:51:21,633 --> 00:51:23,793
But I might not have a chance.

525
00:51:26,953 --> 00:51:28,273
I'm just...

526
00:51:29,032 --> 00:51:31,032
a foolish girl...

527
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:34,032
who couldn't let go of her love.

528
00:51:36,032 --> 00:51:37,753
Please help me.

529
00:51:40,713 --> 00:51:42,833
- Please help.
- Go away.

530
00:51:44,032 --> 00:51:47,873
Help, please.
I'll do anything you want.

531
00:51:48,553 --> 00:51:50,353
Please help me, just once.

532
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:55,193
I like how feisty you are.

533
00:51:56,153 --> 00:51:58,913
Thank you!
Thank you, sir!

534
00:52:28,193 --> 00:52:30,993
I know you'll understand me.

535
00:52:32,513 --> 00:52:34,793
I have no regrets.

536
00:52:35,553 --> 00:52:37,273
I don't blame anyone.

537
00:52:38,993 --> 00:52:42,313
The value of my actions...

538
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:45,033
Only I can know.

539
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:25,032
Su.

540
00:53:27,473 --> 00:53:29,393
Are you not mad now?

541
00:54:09,473 --> 00:54:11,593
I told you not to get greedy.

542
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:16,032
You're the one who was swayed
by a petty mask.

543
00:54:20,993 --> 00:54:22,032
Leave.

544
00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:25,353
You told me to only focus
on being an Empress.

545
00:54:26,032 --> 00:54:28,313
You need to offer the right deal.

546
00:54:30,673 --> 00:54:34,833
You and I are partners
for the Goryeo Dynasty.

547
00:54:36,433 --> 00:54:39,553
You can have your throne.
And I...

548
00:54:40,993 --> 00:54:42,473
I want a son.

549
00:54:44,513 --> 00:54:49,233
I want our son to be
the next Emperor.

550
00:55:03,353 --> 00:55:04,393
Okay.

551
00:55:05,473 --> 00:55:09,553
Will you be willing to abandon
Uk and your family?

552
00:55:14,313 --> 00:55:16,993
If you abandon
your brother and family,

553
00:55:18,233 --> 00:55:20,993
devote yourself as my Empress...

554
00:55:21,593 --> 00:55:22,593
then...

555
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:28,032
I will appoint our child
as the next Jeongyun.

556
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:33,032
You are the Empress.

557
00:55:34,032 --> 00:55:36,032
And soon Empress Dowager.

558
00:56:11,273 --> 00:56:14,273
Your room was empty.
I assumed you were here.

559
00:56:15,073 --> 00:56:17,273
What should I do?

560
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:21,032
My lover...

561
00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:24,953
He killed my sister.

562
00:56:25,113 --> 00:56:29,673
He knew what she was doing
for a long while.

563
00:56:30,032 --> 00:56:32,633
That's why he tried to
separate her from you.

564
00:56:32,993 --> 00:56:34,433
But she clung on to you.

565
00:56:36,473 --> 00:56:40,233
Only if she didn't play you
to remain in the palace...

566
00:56:41,313 --> 00:56:44,553
- He wouldn't have done that.
- Even so...

567
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:48,233
How could he order
such a horrible punishment?

568
00:56:53,633 --> 00:56:56,753
I don't know how to get away
from all this pain.

569
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,233
Chaeryeong's only fault...

570
00:57:02,153 --> 00:57:04,353
was that she loved someone.

571
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:10,353
Don't.

572
00:57:11,193 --> 00:57:15,633
Even I am scared and worried
to see you like this.

573
00:57:17,032 --> 00:57:18,793
It would be harder for my brother.

574
00:57:21,513 --> 00:57:23,032
He worries about you.

575
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:25,513
He truly does.

576
00:57:37,713 --> 00:57:39,553
I have favor to ask.

577
00:57:44,313 --> 00:57:46,073
Give this to Jeong.

578
00:57:50,873 --> 00:57:52,073
And my message.

579
00:57:53,073 --> 00:57:55,032
Please deliver it for me.

580
00:57:59,473 --> 00:58:00,673
Message?

581
00:58:08,313 --> 00:58:09,793
"I want it."

582
00:58:16,753 --> 00:58:17,953
If I do...

583
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:21,233
Will you stop suffering?

584
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:24,073
Yes.

585
00:58:25,873 --> 00:58:27,032
"I want it"?

586
00:58:33,633 --> 00:58:34,793
Haesu...

587
00:58:37,032 --> 00:58:38,393
desperately...

588
00:58:43,113 --> 00:58:44,553
wants it.

589
00:58:55,873 --> 00:58:57,593
SCARLET HEART

590
00:58:57,953 --> 00:58:59,393
I have something to confess.

591
00:58:59,513 --> 00:59:02,033
Did you really try to marry Uk?

592
00:59:02,153 --> 00:59:03,393
Yes, I did.

593
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:07,273
I will never see you again.

594
00:59:07,393 --> 00:59:10,633
Goryeo must become my son's.

595
00:59:11,032 --> 00:59:14,032
Let's get married.
You're my companion for life.

596
00:59:14,113 --> 00:59:15,353
It's a dead hawk.

597
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:17,032
He put a curse on you!

598
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:19,073
- I guess it's treason.
- It's a mistake!

599
00:59:19,193 --> 00:59:21,032
I'm being framed!

600
00:59:21,032 --> 00:59:24,873
The punishment for treason
is death.
