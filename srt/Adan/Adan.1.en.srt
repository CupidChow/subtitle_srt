1
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,970
Mom!

2
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,056
Mom!

3
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,769
Mom!

4
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,523
Mom!

5
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,150
Mom!

6
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,738
Mom!

7
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,239
Don't leave me!

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,699
I'm scared!

9
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:16,910
Mom!

10
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,873
Mom!

11
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,628
Mom!

12
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,047
Stop crying, Ellen.

13
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,010
Your mom left us.

14
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,262
It’s just the two of us now.

15
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,692
Eat...

16
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,111
Lazy ass!

17
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,947
If you don't,

18
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,657
You'll end up as my meal!

19
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,792
Ellen, it might rain!

20
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,544
Get the laundry.

21
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,381
Yes, dad.

22
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,027
Damn!

23
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,906
Even this bread is too dry.

24
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,227
Ellen...

25
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,731
Len Len...

26
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,108
Wake up, Len Len!

27
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,912
Yan!

28
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,957
Did you stay up all night?

29
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,085
I can't sleep.

30
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,754
Let's go out!

31
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,009
Sure!

32
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,074
Let’s go!

33
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,536
How are you?

34
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,496
I got this new job.

35
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,456
A cashier in a hardware store.

36
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,835
But I’m so pissed with my boss.

37
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,629
She’s accusing me of filching!

38
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:02,839
Me?

39
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,758
How about you?

40
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,343
Here, you want some?

41
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,103
Yan! Look!

42
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,480
Look at that!

43
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,442
It’s so high!

44
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,070
Hey! Give it back!

45
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,783
Got you!

46
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,454
So, what’s in the bag?

47
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,204
Give it back.

48
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,040
I got something for you.

49
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,625
What is it?

50
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,585
Secret!

51
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,174
For your radio.

52
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,473
Alright, that's enough.

53
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,932
Thank you, Yan!

54
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,392
I’ll be leaving now.

55
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,145
I’ll visit you next month.

56
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,564
Really?

57
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,858
Yes! I’ll see you next month.

58
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:07,945
Uncle.

59
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,324
I have to go.

60
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,622
Take care!

61
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,398
I’ll pay you by next month, Allan.

62
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,441
The farm has no produce yet.

63
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,277
The field is too dry.

64
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,904
Damn it, Lucas!

65
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,490
You haven't paid in six months!

66
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,492
How about...

67
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,286
I take your goat?

68
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,248
Damn.

69
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,500
And I got nothing, but a goat.

70
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,710
I shouldn't have come here.

71
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,172
Next time, be ready!

72
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,216
Good thing, you have a goat.

73
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,387
It'd be a shame, if you had nothing.

74
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,389
All I get is a goat.

75
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,434
I travelled far for this.

76
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,645
Shit...

77
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,109
Hey! Can you ride a motorcycle? Let’s go.

78
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,987
Are you lost?

79
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,406
My name is Marian.

80
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,241
Do you want to eat?

81
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,035
You can have this.

82
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,877
What is that?

83
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,295
It's nothing!

84
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,922
I got it from working in our farm.

85
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,091
I’m the only one helping my dad.

86
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,303
Isn’t it beautiful?

87
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,430
Look at that.

88
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,185
I don't mean to brag, Lucas.

89
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,772
But my eldest daughter...

90
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,150
She's already a call center manager.

91
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:57,615
She worked in Manila,
after her graduation.

92
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,283
Then she got lucky.

93
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,786
Now she has her own condo unit.

94
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,204
A car.

95
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,832
Next month, she’ll take us
to Hong Kong.

96
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,751
Her treat.

97
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,295
For my birthday!

98
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,257
Well my daughter, Ellen.

99
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,700
She’s young, she's only 16.

100
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,014
But you’re keeping her here
in the mountain.

101
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,770
With your ducks and chicken.
I pity her.

102
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,149
Here she comes.

103
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,194
Alright.

104
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,404
By the way,

105
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,699
You can drop by my house anytime.

106
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,742
If you need someone to talk to…

107
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,745
And if you have something
to boast about again.

108
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,329
Alright?

109
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,373
Shut up, Lucas!

110
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,041
I’m not boasting anything!

111
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,961
It’s the truth!

112
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,838
Okay, we’ll go home now.

113
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,673
Be careful!

114
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,385
What's there to see in Manila?

115
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,763
Don't bother asking.

116
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:10,020
How far is it from here?

117
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,816
I told you to stop asking.

118
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,574
I hope I could go there someday.

119
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,950
Damn it!

120
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,870
Haven't you ran away before?

121
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,747
And what have you acheived?

122
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,364
Ellen!

123
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,032
Ellen!

124
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,948
Len!

125
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,660
What are you doing?

126
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,622
Nothing.

127
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,867
It’s empty.

128
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,900
You can cook outside.

129
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,600
Use the firewood.

130
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,360
Eat!

131
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:36,990
Ouch!

132
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,747
Come here!

133
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,835
Why did you peck me?

134
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,503
That hurt!

135
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,504
You know?

136
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,714
After taking care of you!

137
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,341
Don’t fight back.

138
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,928
You're still hurting me.

139
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,638
After all I did to you…

140
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:01,849
There!

141
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,867
<i>You’re bad!</i>

142
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,826
<i>Bad!</i>

143
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,953
<i>You're bad!</i>

144
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:23,912
<i>Let it go.</i>

145
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:24,872
<i>Stop it!</i>

146
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,373
<i>Didn’t I tell you
to let it go?</i>

147
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,291
<i>Right?</i>

148
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,250
<i>Right?</i>

149
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,251
<i>You!</i>

150
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,962
<i>Go back inside!</i>

151
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,023
Len.

152
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:38,982
Len.

153
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,443
Why is there no...

154
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,420
Here.

155
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,922
Use this for the mean time.

156
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,425
You don’t have to cook.

157
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,845
I’ll just go home early.

158
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:31,952
How are you?

159
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,414
The signal just came back.

160
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,291
Yes.

161
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:46,758
How about you? How are you?

162
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,432
Can I make a call?

163
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,434
Over there, she’s almost done.

164
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,102
Hello, Yan.

165
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,022
My supply is out.

166
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,153
Len…

167
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,365
Len Len.

168
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:15,912
Yan.

169
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,424
Here...

170
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,967
It’s good for three months.

171
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:34,723
Thanks!

172
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:37,976
Let’s go?

173
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,354
Alright.

174
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,092
<i>You didn’t pee blood.</i>

175
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:12,385
<i>Len...</i>

176
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,095
<i>It's called menstruation.</i>

177
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,097
<i>And that only means...</i>

178
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,682
<i>You're a woman now.</i>

179
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:18,892
<i>Don’t be scared.</i>

180
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,810
<i>It’s normal for us girls.</i>

181
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,772
<i>And it happens every month.</i>

182
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,190
<i>It will be a cycle,
from now on.</i>

183
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,149
<i>Wait.</i>

184
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,195
<i>Here, take this.</i>

185
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,865
<i>Use this, so your underwear
won't be stained.</i>

186
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,327
<i>From now on, I’ll save some
for you every month.</i>

187
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:39,746
Thanks again, Yan.

188
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,373
Come on.

189
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,457
Don't mind it.

190
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:43,750
And besides,

191
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,085
That's what friends do, right?

192
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,714
So, anything new around here?

193
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,134
Not much.

194
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,011
Aside from...

195
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,764
My dad keeping me locked here.

196
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,725
Nothing has ever changed.

197
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,979
Your dad is only protecting you.

198
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,149
I want to get out of here.

199
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:11,653
Just like you.

200
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,323
But...

201
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,118
I have to look after my dad.

202
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,037
He’s worried for you.

203
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,914
Facing the outside world alone.

204
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,209
And that one day...

205
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,087
You might leave him too.

206
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,298
Just like your mother.

207
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,217
Do you really have
to remind me?

208
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,262
Just always remember...

209
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:38,930
I'm just a call away, okay?

210
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,767
Even a text will do.

211
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,728
Text?

212
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,229
I'd rather call, of course!

213
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:49,232
I have to walk all the way
to the store.

214
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,778
I'll call, just to hear your voice.

215
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,199
Alright! Alright!

216
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,242
It’s getting late.

217
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,410
I might not get a ride.

218
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,036
Okay.

219
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,121
Be careful.

220
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,300
Take care.

221
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,053
Uncle.

222
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,012
I’ll go ahead.

223
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,671
Son of a bitch!

224
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,090
You know, I’m coming back, right?

225
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,176
Not even a dime?

226
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,929
Come on! Pay up!

227
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,431
Please Allan, can't you see?

228
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,475
The drought is really a burden.

229
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,145
I already spent a lot
for the seeds.

230
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,065
And I just started
tilling the soil.

231
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,316
Screw you, Lucas!

232
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,735
You owe me a lot!

233
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,654
We’ve been like this
for the past three years!

234
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,364
Right?

235
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,782
It’s so hard collecting from you!

236
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,077
You give empty promises!

237
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,163
What do you really do with the money?

238
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,207
How do you intend to pay?

239
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,377
Your last payment's gone!

240
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,840
The cooperative will help
with the water irrigation.

241
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:40,510
We'll have a good harvest very soon.

242
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,930
Give me three more months!

243
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,348
And I will be able pay.

244
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,392
Tell me, aside from farming...

245
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,061
What else do you have?

246
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,813
Well...

247
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,606
I have...

248
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,359
Some chickens and ducks.

249
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,360
That’s no good!

250
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,779
I sold your goat
for a cheap price.

251
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,906
But I got nothing else.

252
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,665
You know what?

253
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,542
You still have one.

254
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,963
I’ll take your daughter as a payment.

255
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,799
Well...

256
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,842
She’s still young.

257
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,343
She's no longer a kid!

258
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,473
Come on! I'll take her home.

259
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,850
I live alone, you know.

260
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,769
It's lonely.

261
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,106
Thing is...

262
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,735
If you really want
to settle your debt.

263
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:40,904
You can just give her to me.

264
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,824
Think about it…

265
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,035
Dad.

266
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,790
You want her to be your wife?

267
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,211
Yes.

268
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,175
Rather than letting her rot
in the mountain.

269
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,134
It’s a pity.

270
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,387
She might blossom,
if she's with me.

271
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,267
So?

272
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,312
Let’s talk again, when I return.

273
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,650
I'll take her with me.

274
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,820
Think about it.

275
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,975
Yan? Hello?

276
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,351
Yan, let’s meet!

277
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,479
Tonight.

278
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,043
Where are you going?

279
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,628
Hey!

280
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,130
Where?

281
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,298
Let me go.

282
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,299
Come here!

283
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,427
Let me go!

284
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,179
You're running away?

285
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,644
Let me go!

286
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,108
Ouch!

287
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,475
Len...

288
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,644
Len...

289
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,276
He wants to sell me
for our debts.

290
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,115
You?

291
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,411
To whom?

292
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,205
Allan.

293
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,874
To Allan?

294
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,044
Fuck!

295
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,214
I’m going to kill that jerk!

296
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,766
Ouch!

297
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:39,767
Yan!

298
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,394
Let go of her! Let go of her!

299
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,187
Let go of her! Let go of her!

300
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,605
Yan!

301
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,094
Yan! Yan!

302
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,314
We are short-changed again!

303
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,483
My God! There’s only three of us here!

304
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,320
And only you and I have access...

305
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,071
To the cashbox.

306
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,489
How come we're short?

307
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,326
Don’t just stand there, come here!

308
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,378
How much is missing, ma’am?

309
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,213
Five hundred.

310
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,548
Just deduct it to my salary
for next month.

311
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:58,966
I’ll take the blame.

312
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,636
Even if I didn't take it.

313
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,720
There you go again.

314
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,765
I don’t know who to trust anymore.

315
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,266
You all just keep denying.

316
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,809
All I just want,

317
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,187
is that one of you tell the truth.

318
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,146
That's just it!

319
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,149
- Ma'am...
- We can always talk things over.

320
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,109
But it's really not me!

321
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,196
Alright then.

322
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,531
I will believe you.

323
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:27,411
Maybe, it's time to have a CCTV here!

324
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,665
So we'll see.

325
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,000
If it's a ghost, or a rat,

326
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,794
that's been stealing!

327
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,295
It's becoming a habit!

328
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,298
Mark!

329
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:39,840
Yes?

330
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:40,675
Let’s go.

331
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,657
Who’s there?

332
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,784
Your grandma.

333
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,222
You’re early?

334
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,515
I had a bad day.

335
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,017
My boss is accusing me again.

336
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,477
What are you cooking?

337
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,562
The mussels that you brought.

338
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:17,813
But, there's no ginger.

339
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,774
Have you checked the backyard?

340
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,650
Grandpa might've planted some.

341
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,902
Yes, but there’s none.

342
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,862
I found chili though.

343
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,405
That’s fine.

344
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,907
Much better than you going out.

345
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,242
Someone might see you.

346
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,244
I’m almost done.

347
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,166
Let’s eat.

348
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,594
Remember when we were young?

349
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,346
We used to play "house"?

350
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:51,597
Isn’t it funny?

351
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,683
Our game has become a reality.

352
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:01,816
It's delicious!

353
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,653
You’re ready to be a wife.

354
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,639
We're criminals...

355
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,476
We're criminals...

356
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,498
Ellen.

357
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,660
Ellen.

358
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,411
It’s your grandma.

359
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:27,748
Len Len.

360
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,273
What happened?

361
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,234
It stinks in here!

362
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,237
I’ve been gone for a day.

363
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,781
I accompanied my boss.

364
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,450
To our hollow block supplier.

365
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,494
They have a swimming pool.

366
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,788
The hag enjoyed so much.

367
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,249
And wanted me to stay longer.

368
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,084
But I said no.

369
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,263
Len?

370
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:25,848
What happened to you?

371
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,183
What's wrong?

372
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:32,771
Len.

373
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,111
Len Len.

374
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,458
It's dad.

375
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,461
I saw my dad.

376
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,263
Your dad is gone.

377
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,099
He’s dead.

378
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,099
Like that?

379
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:14,600
Yes!

380
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,102
Here as well.

381
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:18,937
There!

382
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,568
You don't like it?

383
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,615
It will grow back.

384
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,533
Besides,

385
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,703
You still look beautiful to me.

386
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,581
You're very pretty!

387
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,590
It’s nice here.

388
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:48,592
Very peaceful.

389
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,721
Among with those who rest in peace.

390
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:55,849
Careful!

391
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,059
Someone might show up!

392
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:58,977
It’s better here, right?

393
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,272
Better than Allan seeing you...

394
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,441
Screw him!

395
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,152
I’ll bury him alive here!

396
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,071
Hey, relax!

397
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,448
Let the zombies kill him for you!

398
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,243
Go on.

399
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,522
Why?

400
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,609
Why hasn't my period come?

401
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:37,034
You’re just delayed, that’s normal.

402
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,121
But what if...

403
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,208
I’m pregnant.

404
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,009
Why?

405
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,473
What if I'm pregnant?

406
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,562
Len, you can’t be pregnant.

407
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,938
We’re both women.

408
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,025
Only a man can impregnate you.

409
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,735
Those who have balls!

410
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,657
That's empty!

411
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,787
I feel like something is kicking.

412
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,452
He's been missing for a month.

413
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,123
We thought he was hiding from his debts.

414
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,545
Nevermind, I will call you.

415
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,259
What’s that smell?

416
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:18,927
Yeah, it stinks.

417
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,784
So that explains the smell.

418
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,953
But who could have done this?

419
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,997
Someone who hates him, chief.

420
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,795
Is there really no signal here?

421
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,547
None, chief.

422
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:09,311
It's been weeks since Lucas died.

423
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,938
Aren't there any updates?

424
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:20,322
There’s still no witness.

425
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,158
That’s why we still don’t have a suspect.

426
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,576
Except for his daughter.

427
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:32,083
That farmer has a large sum
of money in his house.

428
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,379
One hundred thousand.

429
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,716
Money he borrowed from me.

430
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,509
Still unpaid.

431
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,804
So, it’s still my money.

432
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,432
There's no money.

433
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,227
I went inside.

434
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,729
Lucas was murdered.

435
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:56,316
His daughter is missing.

436
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,151
So...

437
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,904
She definitely killed him.

438
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,792
Ma’am, this isn't enough.

439
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,712
- It’s only two thousand.
- You are always late, and absent.

440
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,883
I also deducted the missing cash.

441
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,885
If no one wants to admit.

442
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,554
So I'll deduct it from your salaries.

443
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,723
Just close the hardware, okay?

444
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,809
Make sure to lock everything.

445
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:35,021
I have to go now, I’ll be late
for my Zumba class.

446
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,330
- Pick.
- That one.

447
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:34,664
There.

448
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:38,001
This one has a front,
and back camera.

449
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,712
- This has a camera?
- Yes! There's the other one too.

450
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,297
- Wow! This is great!
- Nice, isn't it?

451
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,465
There's a camera.

452
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,383
- How much?
- Three thousand.

453
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,135
- Three thousand?
- Yes, ma’am.

454
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,095
Three thousand?

455
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,349
We’ll take it.

456
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,070
- Thank you, ma’am.
- Thank you, miss.

457
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,531
I finally have a cellphone!

458
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,575
It has a camera too!

459
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,453
Now I can take pictures.

460
00:56:36,452 --> 00:56:37,453
Excuse me, sir!

461
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,904
Thanks again for this, Yan.

462
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,699
A replacement for your radio.

463
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,536
So you will not get bored.

464
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,179
Here’s our fare.

465
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:57,682
Thank you!

466
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,559
Bye!

467
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,654
Careful now.

468
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,365
Come on!

469
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,336
Come here!

470
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,840
You asked me to come here,
but you won't take a dip.

471
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,259
Are you going to join me?

472
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,553
Or will we just go home?

473
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,138
Smile!

474
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,768
- Come on!
- Okay. I’m coming.

475
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,561
Hurry!

476
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,403
The one with the short hair.

477
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,072
That's his daughter!

478
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,576
I don’t know the other one.

479
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,202
But she looks familiar.

480
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,413
Might be her accomplice.

481
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,208
They should be arrested soon!

482
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,336
Justice must be served
for that poor farmer.

483
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,505
And I can have my money back.

484
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:56,634
Chief.

485
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,803
What’s your plan?

486
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,933
- I will handle this alone.
- I’ll go with you.

487
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:08,062
That’s my money.
I want it back.

488
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,149
I got you.

489
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,361
You don’t need to say that.

490
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,658
I have to tell you something.

491
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,995
I had a relationship
with a girl before.

492
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,916
We lived together for months.

493
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,005
What happened to her?

494
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:41,346
She got pregnant…

495
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:45,725
And married the guy.

496
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,812
I never imagined…

497
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,734
That we’ll end up like this.

498
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,279
That we’ll be more
than just friends.

499
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,663
Why do you have to feel so sad?

500
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,248
Marry me instead.

501
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,049
When?

502
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:20,802
Now?

503
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,264
Hold on...

504
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,649
Here.

505
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,235
Here.

506
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,420
I pledge…

507
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:03,553
As the stars and the moon bear witness.

508
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,431
The fire, rocks and the falls, as well.

509
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,558
You will be my only one.

510
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:11,728
Ellen…

511
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,986
The last woman I will ever love...

512
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,201
Do you accept me as your better half?

513
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,287
Yes.

514
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:37,420
And I also promise to the moon and the stars,

515
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:42,884
And even to those trees.

516
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:46,679
And to the plane we seldom see,

517
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:51,684
That I will love you forever, Marian.

518
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:44,565
Hey, grandma.

519
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:45,983
Can I ask something?

520
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,152
- What is it?
- Do you recognize them?

521
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,071
This short girl.

522
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:54,241
And the taller one with the long hair.

523
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,953
The taller one looks familiar.

524
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,621
She buys load here.

525
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:05,753
- But I don’t recognize the other one.
- Really? The tall girl comes here?

526
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,755
Yes. She buys prepaid load here.

527
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,006
Thank you!

528
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:45,835
Chief...

529
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:53,551
The taller one frequents here.

530
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,761
What now?

531
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,221
Tomorrow.

532
01:06:58,764 --> 01:06:59,682
I can handle this by myself.

533
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:01,017
Why don’t you try in the city?

534
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:02,685
Let's keep in touch.

535
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:06,147
Okay.

536
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:09,692
This is for you, chief.

537
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,411
I'll be at Eden's Garden tonight,
would you like to come?

538
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:21,620
Maybe next time...

539
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,129
Pull over.

540
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,054
I'll wait here.

541
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,932
Until she takes that off!

542
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:27,603
And why won't you get drunk?

543
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:32,608
You know, the man running for mayor?

544
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,569
He’s a good friend of mine.

545
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:37,655
And...

546
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:42,409
His wife, was my ex.

547
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,518
You’re cheating on me?

548
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:08,352
Hey!

549
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,896
Fix yourself when
you come back here!

550
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:11,772
Hey!

551
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:13,065
Hey!

552
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:20,531
Get out of here!

553
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:35,337
Damn! New girl!

554
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,924
I know you.

555
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,305
Damn it!

556
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:02,865
Len.

557
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:28,474
This is the first time
you came home late.

558
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,517
And why do you smell like beer?

559
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:32,353
Did you drink with someone?

560
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:34,063
Who was with you?

561
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:35,898
Is it a boy? Or a girl?

562
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,983
Did you bring someone new to the cliff?

563
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,527
The cemetery?

564
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,239
Did you get married again?

565
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:12,226
I stayed at the hardware.

566
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:19,275
I helped set up the new supplies.

567
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:24,989
Our boss treated us for a drink.

568
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:30,244
Since it's her birthday,
I went along with it.

569
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:32,621
That's why I'm late.

570
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,848
Is my better half exhausted from work?

571
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:03,861
Thanks.

572
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:15,039
Hey!

573
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:16,915
You're spacing out again?

574
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,376
You know what?

575
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:22,171
You just need to get laid.

576
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,966
Do you want to sneak
quickly at the back?

577
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,762
Screw you!

578
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,182
You want me to report you to ma'am?

579
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:36,060
So you'll get fired, stupid!

580
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:54,596
Hey!

581
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,725
We're the only ones
with access to the cashbox.

582
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:02,354
Every week, money goes missing.

583
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:05,274
Last time, it's missing 3,500.

584
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:08,735
It means someone is stealing the money.

585
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:10,654
There's a thief.

586
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:16,076
What I want, is someone I can trust.

587
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:19,705
And I lost my trust on you.

588
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,039
You're a liar.

589
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:22,833
And you can't fool me anymore.

590
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:25,210
So today will be your last day!

591
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:47,149
Here’s our fare... For three.

592
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,544
Anybody here?

593
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:13,091
Anybody here?

594
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,094
- Just a minute.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

595
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:20,682
- How can I help you, sir?
- Do you recognize them?

596
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,731
- I know the tall one. Why?
- Does she live here?

597
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:31,068
She's my cashier.
May I know why?

598
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:35,614
May I talk to her?

599
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,783
I’m working on a case.

600
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:02,140
- I'd like to buy a pad.
- A  napkin?

601
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:10,232
This is it!

602
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,150
Here.

603
01:16:13,026 --> 01:16:14,027
Marian!

604
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,239
Police is looking for you.

605
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:20,284
He’s asking about one of your cases.

606
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:22,911
I'm pretty sure,
it's related to theft!

607
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:26,331
Come up with a good lie this time!
This is the police!

608
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:30,502
If he invites you
to the station, just go.

609
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,671
It's your last day here anyway.

610
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:40,554
That Mark is the one,
stealing from you.

611
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:44,391
It’s his payment every time you fuck him.

612
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:45,475
He said...

613
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:48,645
Your pussy stinks.

614
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,565
Like a dead rat.

615
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,005
What is it?

616
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:16,840
Do you know...

617
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:19,259
Ellen Sta. Cruz?

618
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:20,135
No.

619
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:23,180
I don't know any Ellen.

620
01:17:42,532 --> 01:17:44,493
Let's talk at the police station.

621
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,415
Sir, how much is that?

622
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:51,583
20 pesos.

623
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:55,587
Thank you.

624
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:58,442
Have a seat.

625
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:12,330
So, you don't know Lucas.

626
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,167
You deny that...

627
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,002
You know Ellen.

628
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,004
How about...

629
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,131
Allan Josef?

630
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,383
The loan shark, who's now dead.

631
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:25,594
Or maybe,

632
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:28,305
You are going to deny that also?

633
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:30,056
No.

634
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:33,477
I don't know any of them.

635
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:35,395
You got the wrong person.

636
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:38,398
Relax, I'm not accusing you.

637
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:41,693
Are you new here in Rosales?

638
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,238
There's no one in this town,

639
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:50,160
who doesn't know who Allan Josef is.

640
01:19:54,664 --> 01:19:56,708
Even those from the other town know him.

641
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:03,632
An innocent farmer was murdered...

642
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:07,594
A large sum went missing...

643
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:15,936
That’s called a crime.

644
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:19,564
Why won't you speak up?

645
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:22,317
So we can end this.

646
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:29,825
You can stay quiet.

647
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:32,410
And keep your mouth shut.

648
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,248
I can even get you out of this.

649
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:43,338
Scot-free…

650
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:47,092
Just tell me.

651
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:50,470
Who can answer…

652
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:54,182
All the questions
regarding this case.

653
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:57,394
Where is...

654
01:20:58,478 --> 01:21:00,397
Your friend, Ellen?

655
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:14,786
There’s another way around this.

656
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:24,462
I'm easy to deal with.

657
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:20,685
I love you so much, Len.

658
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:25,231
You are my only one.

659
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,360
You are my forever.

660
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:32,197
I love you.

661
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:38,328
Len!

662
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:46,086
<i>Yan, come here.</i>

663
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:47,796
<i>I love you.</i>

664
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:42,017
Do you still want more?

665
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:43,727
One more.

666
01:23:49,315 --> 01:23:50,650
I told you…

667
01:23:52,902 --> 01:23:54,696
I’m easy to deal with.

668
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:02,162
But I'm already tired.

669
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:39,783
Son of a bitch!

670
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:46,456
Screw you!

671
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:35,964
Len?

672
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:37,590
Len...

673
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:38,883
Len Len...

674
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:41,219
Len, open the door!

675
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:42,637
Len!

676
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:45,431
Len Len...

677
01:25:52,188 --> 01:25:54,566
Did your boss offer to drink again?

678
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:04,576
They already know where we live.

679
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:06,911
We leave at dawn!

680
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:09,247
And go to Manila.

681
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,314
<i>An innocent farmer was murdered...</i>

682
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,816
<i>A large sum went missing...</i>

683
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,110
<i>That's called a crime.</i>

684
01:27:16,856 --> 01:27:21,694
<i>Where is your friend Ellen?</i>

685
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:49,764
Leave it.

686
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:53,226
We'll just buy a new one.

687
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:34,558
Pasay! Pasay!

688
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:36,185
Pasay!

689
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:41,733
Pasay Bound!

690
01:28:52,243 --> 01:28:54,370
Pasay! Yes, this will pass the rotunda.

691
01:28:55,913 --> 01:29:01,377
Hop in! There's more seats!

692
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:28,529
Hop in.

693
01:29:29,739 --> 01:29:30,823
There's still room at the back.

694
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:32,367
Go inside.

695
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:36,037
Give some space for the others.

696
01:29:36,662 --> 01:29:37,413
Alright, let's go.

697
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,598
Where is your cellphone?

698
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:59,644
Why aren't you holding it?

699
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:07,902
You know what?

700
01:30:09,362 --> 01:30:11,072
You are full of surprises.

701
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:17,829
Sometimes, I feel like,
I don't know you anymore.

702
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,749
All I'm asking is…

703
01:30:23,459 --> 01:30:25,920
Where is your cellphone?

704
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:30,591
Why can’t you answer?

705
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:40,059
What else are you hiding from me?

706
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,485
What's in your bag?

707
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:56,325
Why is there money
in the biscuit can?

708
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:02,623
Why ask when you already know?

709
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:13,718
You planned this all along.

710
01:31:22,518 --> 01:31:23,519
<i>Tell me the truth...</i>

711
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:24,896
<i>Damn it, Lucas!</i>

712
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:26,230
<i>You owe me a lot of money.</i>

713
01:31:26,522 --> 01:31:29,025
<i>Where do you take the money?</i>

714
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:30,485
<i>How about this?</i>

715
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:34,238
<i>I'll take your daughter
to work for me.</i>

716
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,615
<i>Let me think about it.</i>

717
01:31:36,407 --> 01:31:40,203
<i>Ellen helps me here too.</i>

718
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:42,788
<i>Ever since Mara left you.</i>

719
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,540
<i>You imprisoned your daughter here.</i>

720
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,250
<i>She barely had the right education.</i>

721
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:48,002
<i>Such a waste of time.</i>

722
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,505
<i>My money was wasted.</i>

723
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:51,964
<i>Where are you going?</i>

724
01:31:52,131 --> 01:31:53,424
<i>I don't want to rot in here.</i>

725
01:31:54,133 --> 01:31:54,800
<i>What?</i>

726
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:56,636
<i>You’ll offer me as payment.</i>

727
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:58,638
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

728
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:00,806
<i>My child...</i>

729
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:08,439
<i>I love you, my child.</i>

730
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:22,870
<i>You killed your dad...</i>

731
01:32:23,454 --> 01:32:25,748
<i>Because you wanted to run away.</i>

732
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:29,418
<i>You want to be free.</i>

733
01:32:31,003 --> 01:32:33,839
I was not even part of your plan.

734
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:41,013
You planned to rob your father.

735
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:43,808
So, you can run off to the city.

736
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:48,604
<i>What's in Manila?
When do you think I can get there?</i>

737
01:32:48,771 --> 01:32:50,273
You made up a story.

738
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:52,567
<i>Give me your daughter as payment.</i>

739
01:32:53,192 --> 01:32:54,777
<i>Len…</i>

740
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:58,239
<i>He wanted to sell me
for our debts.</i>

741
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:01,158
And you dragged me into this.

742
01:33:06,205 --> 01:33:08,666
Don't turn the blame on me, Marian.

743
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:11,627
Where have you been last night?

744
01:33:11,877 --> 01:33:14,797
What are you going to do in Manila?

745
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:21,220
Find a guy?

746
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:23,389
Get married?

747
01:33:23,973 --> 01:33:25,725
And leave me as well?

748
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:30,521
You may look like an angel.

749
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:34,609
But you're worse than a demon.

750
01:33:35,818 --> 01:33:37,403
Who's the police?

751
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:39,905
Your boyfriend?

752
01:33:41,073 --> 01:33:42,700
Are you going to let him arrest me?

753
01:33:44,243 --> 01:33:46,203
You traitor!

754
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:51,417
He was supposed to arrest you…

755
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:53,002
Us.

756
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:59,717
I offered my body to him, just for you.

757
01:34:00,843 --> 01:34:04,263
- So he'll stop chasing us.
- Us?

758
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:07,266
We made a promise that,
it's just you and me.

759
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:09,018
And now, there's someone else?

760
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:11,395
Fuck you!

761
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:13,773
You even went along
with that police.

762
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:15,983
What a whore! Bitch!

763
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:19,945
I didn't go willingly, stupid!

764
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,531
You even embraced him.

765
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:24,867
Crazy bitch!

766
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:39,840
Fuck you!

767
01:34:48,557 --> 01:34:49,850
They're stabbing!

768
01:34:50,059 --> 01:34:51,018
They're stabbing each other!

769
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:18,295
Hurry! Get out! Get out!

770
01:35:45,322 --> 01:35:46,824
Where are you going?

771
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:48,617
