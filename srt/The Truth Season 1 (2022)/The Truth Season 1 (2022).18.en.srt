1
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,440
On June 23,

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,760
the day before the incident,

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,120
He died in the Foot Washing City.

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,600
Did I kill you?

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,240
I killed you.

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,600
Do you know Ms. Cai?

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,120
Sister Cai has been missing for a month,

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,040
and she is a very good friend of mine.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,720
When I see you with real tea and fruit pomelo,

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,320
I remember the promise of "pomelo sees you",

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,000
What were you thinking

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,360
when the six of us jumped?

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,520
He died in this place

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,960
the day he fell from here,

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,400
There's

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,000
another doll.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,320
Don't go to work.

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,640
If you don't listen to me, you'll die.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,960
This season will tell the story of the 11th apartment in Tuishi

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,000
through an 11-week program.

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,920
Six players will be new residents,

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,440
staying in Apartment 11.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,840
They will be involved in bizarre cases.

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,680
By setting up an "apartment reasoning group",

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,760
going to different floors,

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,600
Make friends with different old residents,

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,480
solve the mystery of their origins,

28
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,560
Explore the secret behind the case.

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,440
In the first six cases,

30
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,280
the story of a new resident will be unlocked every week.

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,120
The intricate relationships between the old and new residents

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,680
will also be revealed.

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,160
Starting from the seventh case,

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,160
all the story lines are intertwined,

35
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,520
As the truth is revealed,

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,440
every choice made by the new residents,

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,920
will affect the direction

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,240
and final outcome of the story.

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,280
In each case,

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,200
the reasoning team needs to find the identity of the victim

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,720
at the crime scene,

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,039
And according to the clues,

43
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,680
find the relevant suspects.

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,240
Attention,

45
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,760
the suspect is not limited to

46
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,680
the insiders and visitors of Apartment 11,

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,040
In the reasoning team,

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,200
there may be suspects,

49
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,760
After the suspects are summoned,

50
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,560
the reasoning team will question them,

51
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,160
And reasoned again based on the testimony,

52
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,680
and finally voted to lock in the "real murderer. "

53
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,040
Only the "real murderer" of the case can lie,

54
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,840
only to find the real "murderer",

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,520
Only the player wins.

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,560
Players who vote correctly

57
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,480
will get a golden key.

58
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,920
If the player is the "murderer",

59
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,160
he will get a golden key if he escapes smoothly.

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
Let's get started.

61
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,040
Start what?

62
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,680
Today we're going to teach you how to make chocolate.

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,320
So we're dressed so cool today

64
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,480
to make chocolate, right?

65
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,240
You should wear chef's clothes,

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,760
Yes,

67
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,840
You did, didn't you?

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,520
Come on.

69
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,800
Do you want to protect your clothes?

70
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,880
I don't want it.

71
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't touch my head.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,320
I can't move my head now.

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
It's heavy, isn't it?

74
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,920
No,

75
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,880
I have a stiff neck.

76
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,840
It really hurts.

77
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,640
No,

78
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,920
you seem heartless.

79
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,000
Ke Wuku didn't show up today,

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,560
and you didn't react at all.

81
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,960
Why?

82
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,440
Yes.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,320
Ke Wuku was arrested.

84
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm sorry.

85
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,120
I was blinded by hatred.

86
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,880
He retaliated in extreme ways.

87
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,560
You used the wrong way to cover me up

88
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,920
and hurt the people I love even harder.

89
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,040
I can't face you anymore.

90
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,080
Facing myself,

91
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,120
I'm going to accept the punishment I deserve.

92
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
I heard he turned himself in.

93
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,640
deserve it

94
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
You lied to our relationship.

95
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,480
It melts so quickly.

96
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,560
Who is this person?

97
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,560
Hello,

98
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,560
everyone. Who is this?

99
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,480
You escaped from prison.

100
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,560
I want to report you.

101
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,480
You ran out.

102
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,800
Yes, I am.

103
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,480
Ke Wuku's relative,

104
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,840
can you guess my name?

105
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,560
You still have to guess.

106
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,920
Eat lotus root ugliness.

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,240
Who are you?

108
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,840
My surname

109
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,920
is Ke,

110
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,600
Ming Wu

111
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,920
Ke Wuku,

112
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,840
do you have a purpose today?

113
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,400
I got lost 15 years ago.

114
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,600
It's a man named Boss Fei.

115
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,280
She called me.

116
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,960
She called me.

117
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,760
Your sister-in-law,

118
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,280
Yes.

119
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,840
Ke Wuku is my younger brother,

120
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,560
Crying is the biggest

121
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,040
and I'm the second,

122
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,840
Crying Brother

123
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Crying … (Bitter

124
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,920
… Cool! ) Where is Ke Wu? (Where

125
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
is he? ).

126
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,320
Where's K?

127
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,800
How many people are there in your family?

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,680
Tell me, how many more times can you commit crimes?

129
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,240
It's gone.

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,920
It's the last one.

131
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,120
It's the last one.

132
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,200
What are you doing here today?

133
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,440
I'm here to hand out

134
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,720
flyers. Here's the thing,

135
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,880
In this apartment today,

136
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,760
from 6: 00 p. m. to 6: 10 p. m.,

137
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,520
Will there be a power outage?

138
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,040
Where did you come from?

139
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,600
How do you know

140
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,240
if there's a power outage in our apartment?

141
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,840
This was notified to me by the property management.

142
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,080
You want to send this to the owner?

143
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,600
Okay.

144
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,120
Thank you.

145
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,680
Power went out on July 2nd.

146
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,840
The power went out for ten minutes.

147
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,080
What are your names?

148
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,360
Let me introduce my name to Liu Xialai.

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,000
Liu Xialai

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,920
can call me Brother Liu.

151
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,680
Brother Liu,

152
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,840
Brother Liu,

153
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,680
This is called Bai San Wan.

154
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,640
It's Bai Sanwan

155
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,280
who runs a noodle shop,

156
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,680
Yes.

157
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,560
Just call me three bowls.

158
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,200
Okay, three bowls.

159
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,280
Three bowls can't pass the post.

160
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,840
Have you heard of it?

161
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,520
Yes,

162
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,160
this is Song Meili.

163
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,960
Song Meili.

164
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,360
Yes. Handmade,

165
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,840
You praised her for being pretty,

166
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,400
so you gave her to you.

167
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,400
And this is Guo Baoyou.

168
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
And then he's Kwak Bo Woo,

169
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,480
he's a novelist,

170
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,640
What kind of novel are you writing?

171
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,800
Writing romance.

172
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,560
And I'm Zhou Keke who taught you

173
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,200
how to make chocolate,

174
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,520
Come here.

175
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,480
I've melted the white one

176
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,240
for you. Here it comes.

177
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,200
Attention, citizens of Tui City.

178
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,960
It's 4: 00 p. m. on July 2nd. It's 4:

179
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,680
00 p. m.,

180
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,120
I have an urgent news.

181
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,520
In 1988,

182
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,320
the "murderer" of the arson case

183
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:19,960
of "killing" people in Chuyang Lane,

184
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Li Mou

185
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
He showed up for the first time after 34 years on the run.

186
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,840
According to witnesses,

187
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,000
witnesses,

188
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,560
Recently, he appeared in Apartment 11.

189
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,480
He's acting suspiciously.

190
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,800
Behind you.

191
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,280
Yes.

192
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,200
It's been 34 years since this case happened.

193
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,520
Chuyang Lane has also been dismantled for many years

194
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,680
and the appearance of fugitive Li,

195
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,280
Is it to commit another crime?

196
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,920
Attention, residents of Apartment 11.

197
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,680
Call the police immediately if you see this person.

198
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,720
Uncle Li is my dad.

199
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,520
Really?

200
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,560
After my mom passed away,

201
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,480
he left

202
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:05,920
and I left one.

203
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,120
I can't raise you.

204
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
A note,

205
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,760
I grew up in an orphanage,

206
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,680
I hate him so much.

207
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,840
Are you also an orphanage?

208
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,200
We were both in an orphanage,

209
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,320
and I grew up in an orphanage,

210
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,880
I'm an orphanage too.

211
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,040
We're orphans, aren't we?

212
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,360
What about you?

213
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,600
I am.

214
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,480
We're orphans. We're all gathered here,

215
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,880
Do you know anything about your dad?

216
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,280
Yes.

217
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,680
I don't know him well,

218
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,400
and I don't know why

219
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,840
he suddenly showed up here today.

220
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,680
And I followed you.

221
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,200
Didn't you notice?

222
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,880
He's behind you.

223
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,360
It's not me. Don't sit at the door.

224
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll sit at the door.

225
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,080
Lock the door first.

226
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,120
Uncle Li will come in soon.

227
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,400
What's wrong?

228
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,480
You must be Bai Song 1 Guo Zhou Liu 1 Cool

229
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,280
Reasoning Group

230
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,120
in the apartment.

231
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,760
What I want to tell you is,

232
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,400
two people will die today.

233
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,840
In 1988,

234
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,240
the "murder and corpse burning case" in Chuyang Lane

235
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,080
It will happen again.

236
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,120
Can you find the truth

237
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,200
and catch the murderer?

238
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,240
In the box outside,

239
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,200
there's a hint I gave you.

240
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,799
Hurry up!

241
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,640
Don't look,

242
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,039
don't look,

243
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,520
There won't be any follow-up.

244
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,559
That makes sense.

245
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,200
Yes.

246
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,320
We'll make chocolate.

247
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,280
We have to do it.

248
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,240
Just make chocolate

249
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,960
and mess it up, right?

250
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,320
-Go. -Xiao He, bring

251
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,800
me the box. Let's see what

252
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,680
it is.

253
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:54,960
What is it?

254
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,480
Newspapers,

255
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:56,640
newspaper

256
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,240
Push the market daily,

257
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,240
make a fool of yourself,

258
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,360
I won't make a fool of myself this time.

259
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,880
Someone is dead.

260
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,840
July 2, 1988,

261
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,560
what's the date today?

262
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,800
July 2,

263
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,480
1988-Today,

264
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,040
Yes.

265
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
On the evening of July 2, 1988,

266
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,760
a fire suddenly broke out

267
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,840
near Chuyang Lane Dance Hall.

268
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,880
Two charred bodies were found at the scene.

269
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,760
They were Uncle Cang and Uncle Ku,

270
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,880
who "died"

271
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,600
after being hit hard on the head.

272
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
After he died, he was burned by the murderer,

273
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,760
who locked the time of the crime,

274
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,520
The only person who can enter the crime scene,

275
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,560
and has conflicts with the two of them,

276
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,320
And the murderer has absconded.

277
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,400
The relevant departments will do their best to arrest him.

278
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,320
Your dad killed someone and ran away.

279
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,560
Your dad put the warehouse (uncle)

280
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,200
Mr. Ku was killed.

281
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,280
But Uncle Cang and Uncle Ku

282
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,600
are my grandfathers.

283
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,800
Mr. Cang is my grandfather,

284
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,560
and Mr. Ku is my brother.

285
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,360
Because before I was born,

286
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,000
I had never met my grandfather.

287
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,120
Because your dad killed him.

288
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,600
He killed my grandfather.

289
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,280
Then you abandoned me.

290
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,520
And I didn't care about my mom,

291
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,520
so do you want to recognize him?

292
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,120
Wait a minute. What is this?

293
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,240
Youth photo studio,

294
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
caring for the elderly,

295
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,640
Youth Studio is on the move,

296
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,200
right here,

297
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,800
Freeze the best moment of youth,

298
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,240
it has an address,

299
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,720
The big open eye street on the first floor of the apartment,

300
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,520
the mysterious corner illuminated by red lanterns.

301
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,360
Youth Photo Studio,

302
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,920
it's on

303
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,640
the negative floor,

304
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,520
If we don't go, both of us will die.

305
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,120
We have to save them

306
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,120
and "die" them.

307
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,520
That was a "death" warning,

308
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,800
The "death" was announced,

309
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,960
which means that this "murder case",

310
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,000
It will be repeated,

311
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,240
Yes.

312
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,440
Saving people is more important.

313
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,240
Let's go then.

314
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Guys,

315
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,600
Come on,

316
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Now that the "death" notice has appeared,

317
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,320
how can it remain stagnant?

318
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,640
Please look for it,

319
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,600
and I'll look into

320
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,080
that case too,

321
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,960
I'll tell you if there's anything else.

322
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,760
Let's go.

323
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,080
Sanwan Noodle Shop, No. 11 Apartment

324
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,800
Branch,

325
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,120
I didn't see you go to work.

326
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,880
Look at my shop,

327
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,120
It opens next week

328
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,760
for manicurists,

329
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,200
What?

330
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,240
Handmade shop?

331
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,400
What is this place?

332
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,800
This is where the red lantern shines,

333
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,360
right?

334
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,120
What's the name of this word again?

335
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,240
This is called "Jade Case Yuan Xi",

336
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,800
so this is a "dead end"?

337
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,360
Or is it a secret door?

338
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,440
No, it must be a secret door.

339
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,160
In the easterly night flowers bloom and thousands of trees

340
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,880
blow down,

341
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,720
Stars are like rain.

342
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,920
The road is filled with BMW carvings,

343
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,640
the sound of the phoenix flute is moving,

344
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,120
Isn't it

345
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,600
Lantern Festival?

346
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,520
That night,

347
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,160
this is the story

348
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,400
about visiting lanterns on the 15th day of the first month.

349
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,280
No.

350
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,160
This place,

351
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,440
Youth Photo Studio,

352
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,880
Come on, guys.

353
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,760
As far as I know,

354
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,880
it should be dark inside,

355
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,560
It should be dark inside.

356
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,600
No, no, no.

357
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,120
I'm telling you,

358
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,720
this will be hacked right away I'm telling you,

359
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,680
It'll be dark as soon as we come in.

360
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,760
Why do I feel like,

361
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,080
We're going to close the door and take photos.

362
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,280
Time will go away and images will last forever.

363
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,600
There will always be a lot of moments

364
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
to tell you,

365
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,240
Life is gentle and romantic.

366
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,360
Let's take a picture together.

367
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,480
Shout "Eggplant" in unison before the photo shoot.

368
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
Come on,

369
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,400
Three, two, one,

370
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,280
eggplant!

371
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,600
What's wrong?

372
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,760
Is it really spinning?

373
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,360
It's spinning.

374
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,760
I'm a little dizzy,

375
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,560
guys. Where's the seat belt?

376
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,480
Tie it for me.

377
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,440
Throw it out!

378
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
Time will go away and images will last forever.

379
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,200
In 1988,

380
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,920
the murder and corpse burning case in Chuyang Lane

381
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,520
will happen again. Thirty-four years

382
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,400
have passed

383
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,840
since this case happened.

384
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,280
Chuyang Lane has been demolished for many years.

385
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,880
It turns us back to 1988.

386
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,320
What you said makes sense.

387
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,240
Did you really "cross"?

388
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,160
It's possible,

389
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,000
right?

390
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,000
So cool!

391
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,040
This is nice.

392
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,680
Take a look.

393
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:40,920
Amazing.

394
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,480
Let's go

395
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,720
Where the red lanterns shine.

396
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,640
I'm really wearing it.

397
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,800
Please don't cry.

398
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,000
Here we go.

399
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,680
This is cool.

400
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,880
Amazing.

401
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,080
This is cool.

402
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,280
Amazing.

403
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,400
Come to Ocean Lane

404
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,280
to play for a while.

405
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,000
What a big circle,

406
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,920
insole,

407
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,040
How much is it?

408
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,680
50 taels,

409
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,360
Fifty cents

410
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,520
I don't have any money in my pocket.

411
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,760
Can you scan the code?

412
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,120
You can't scan the code.

413
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,080
What is scanning the code?

414
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,040
I don't understand.

415
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,240
How much is this one?

416
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,920
Ten yuan.

417
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,680
Ten yuan.

418
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,200
It's so expensive.

419
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,840
Delicious.

420
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
Is it good?

421
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,200
It's so delicious.

422
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,560
Chuyang Lane Dance Hall.

423
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,520
It's written in the newspaper,

424
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,680
Chuyang Lane Dance Hall.

425
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,760
On the evening of July 2, 1988,

426
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,480
a fire suddenly broke out

427
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,600
near Chuyang Lane Dance Hall.

428
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,720
Two charred bodies were found at the scene,

429
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,960
34 years have passed since this case happened.

430
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,680
Chuyang Lane has been demolished for many years.

431
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,400
Hello What year is it this year?

432
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:34,960
This Year

433
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,040
In 1988,

434
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,600
1988,

435
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,480
We really went back to 1988.

436
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,200
"Through" time and space,

437
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,320
and then to stop

438
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,160
Uncle Li,

439
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,600
Our mission is to save people. It's now

440
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,400
4: 40 p. m. on July 2,

441
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,160

442
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,320
At 4: 40 p. m. on July 2,

443
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,280
1988,

444
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,520
The song just now,

445
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,120
is "The Little Girl Under the Streetlight"

446
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,760
given by Uncle Zeng,

447
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,000
the thunderbolt king of Ocean Lane,

448
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He also said,

449
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,960
Hunian Hua,

450
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,160
I'll always be the girl under the streetlight.

451
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,800
You're still ordering songs.

452
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,880
, 4: 40.

453
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,200
At this time of year,

454
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,640
the use of fire and electricity increases.

455
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,720
Inform,

456
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,920

Sign up enthusiastically.

477
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,720
The song I sang just now

478
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,080
is the most popular one recently.

479
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
Come on.

480
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,360
Dance with us.

481
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:43,960
Yes.

482
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,120
Interact with your mom.

483
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,000
Sir,

484
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,680
it's our first meeting,

485
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,280
See you off

486
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,160
Chocolate Oreos.

487
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,080
Okay,

488
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,760
It can be twisted.

489
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,360
Lick it,

490
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,040
soak it,

491
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,440
It's delicious enough to jump.

492
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,920
With a twist of the cookie,

493
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,320
the dance will be more enjoyable.

494
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,240
Okay,

495
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,440
that lady, come on,

496
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,080
And that uncle

497
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,320
hasn't come yet.

498
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,560
Smells so good.

499
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,600
Since you like this song so much,

500
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,520
let's play the song

501
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,920
"The Little Girl Under the Streetlight",

502
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,800
Sing it for everyone.

503
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,360
This place is so lively.

504
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,400
Let's sing together.

505
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,880
You picked the one who can't dance the most.

506
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,440
Thank you.

507
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,280
Yes.

508
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,360
Auntie, it was a fire.

509
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:10,880
No, sister,

510
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,160
Yes.

511
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,200
A fire,

512
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,040
Okay,

513
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,640
It's so low, sir.

514
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,480
Fire!

515
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,400
Fire!

516
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,000
Stop dancing.

517
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,600
Stop dancing.

518
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,640
You youngsters, go put out the fire.

519
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,360
Fire!

520
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,280
Where did you lose the fire?

521
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,800
Where did you lose the fire?

522
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,720
Young people like you,

523
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,360
you are not as clumsy as me.

524
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,480
You didn't come

525
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,160
until I put out the fire.

526
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,280
I'm sorry.

527
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,840
That's weird.

528
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,680
At five o'clock,

529
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,960
the fire started.

530
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,280
I came here to put out the fire.

531
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,800
The gate of the compound

532
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,120
and the warehouse are closed,

533
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,080
I can't get in until I break the lock.

534
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,800
result

535
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,640
The person inside is dead.

536
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:35,760
There are "dead" people.

537
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,480
Where are the "dead" people?

538
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,520
He's dead.

539
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,560
The outer wall of the warehouse is fireproof,

540
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,160
so the fire didn't spread.

541
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,120
Hold on.

542
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,360
Uncle Li is on duty.

543
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,280
Where's Uncle Li?

544
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,200
I'm exhausted.

545
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,960
I'm going to take a break.

546
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,280
Old ladies like you,

547
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,640
why are you still here?

548
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,960
Go back to the ballroom.

549
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,960
Don't make any trouble.

550
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,480
Okay,

551
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,440
Let's go back to the ballroom first.

552
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,400
Didn't we say he died in there?

553
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,040
Yeah, get in.

554
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,400
Yes.

555
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,680
There are "dead" people.

556
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,040
Why are they lying flat?

557
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,080
How about burning them

558
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,520
to death here?

559
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,440
Pull the corpse down.

560
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,880
Three-head pull,

561
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,080
three, two, one, go,

562
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,320
Hand,

563
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,520
Why doesn't he have a middle finger on his hand?

564
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,520
Look at his head

565
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,120
being smashed,

566
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,320
Did you see that one's head was smashed?

567
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,840
Smash it

568
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,680
Back head spoon here,

569
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,640
doesn't he have bricks there?

570
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,080
And if you look at the brick here,

571
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
it should be done in this room,

572
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,960
It was in this room that he was smashed to death.

573
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,760
And look at this. It says,

574
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,680
push the gas,

575
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,480
This is gasoline.

576
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,200
Gasoline caused the fire,

577
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,120
He started the fire

578
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,240
because of the gasoline that was smashed,

579
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,520
Is it written in the newspaper?

580
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,840
"Death" after a severe head injury,

581
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,560
"Death" was burned by the murderer.

582
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,440
Then why is there an alarm clock?

583
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,760
Take a look at your gloves.

584
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
It might be the "time of death".

585
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,160
5: 10. What did it say in the

586
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,760
newspaper,

587
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,480
It was written in the newspaper in the evening,

588
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,160
1988,

589
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,760
The murder and corpse burning case in Chuyang Lane

590
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,720
will happen again.

591
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,320
Two people will die today.

592
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,680
Then why does it have an alarm clock?

593
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,480
The alarm clock should be timed,

594
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,440
with this red dial,

595
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,000
I think it should be half past three.

596
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,920
And fireworks are strictly prohibited in the warehouse.

597
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,080
Is this paint?

598
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,160
We're at the door. Isn't it written on it?

599
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,960
It's about painting walls,

600
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,040
renovating warehouses,

601
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,960
Right?

602
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,200
It takes 48 hours

603
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,440
for the paint on the wall to dry.

604
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,280
But when he died,

605
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,440
how could he rub the paint

606
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,560
on the wall,

607
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,680
Look at

608
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,400
its direction,

609
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,640
The top is rubbed upwards.

610
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,320
What could it be?

611
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,200
It's possible that they're like this.

612
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,920
I'll go up.

613
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,800
Be careful.

614
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,760
Don't step on that net.

615
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,440
Just step on the edge. It's possible that

616
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,360
they need to

617
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,680
breathe like this. Do you understand?

618
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,720
And then this body is attached to it.

619
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,600
Is that what you mean?

620
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,800
Isn't there something on him?

621
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,240
Search it.

622
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,000
Turn around.

623
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,120
What's the blue one?

624
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,840
Ke Wuku,

625
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,320
turn over that,

626
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,920
He has it on his chest,

627
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,480
and he has it on his body,

628
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,080
Both of them.

629
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,880
Look, there's another piece

630
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,800
on the ground. What's this for?

631
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,480
What is this?

632
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,040
This is

633
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,520
a piece of cloth,

634
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,800
This is a painting, right?

635
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,480
What does this look like?

636
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
It's plastic.

637
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,200
Glue,

638
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,880
the most important thing about it is that there's paint on it,

639
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,400
Turn around.

640
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,040
What's the blue one?

641
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,320
It was under my body,

642
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,880
so I didn't burn it out.

643
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,560
Did you put it on this bed in the first place?

644
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,240
It's possible.

645
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,520
The bed list,

646
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,680
Are the sheets made of plastic?

647
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,560
So this is Kang mat, right?

648
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,680
How do you feel about

649
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,360
Kang Xi? Kang what?

650
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,880
Kang mat,

651
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:32,760
what is it?

652
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,800
There is one in Northeast China,

653
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,520
which is something laid on the fire resistance.

654
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,200
What's the Kang mat

655
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,400
for? Waterproof?

656
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,960
Did we push the market to the north or the south?

657
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,520
Pushing the market is pushing the side,

658
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,000
pushing the side,

659
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,400
See what else?

660
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,280
Let's search again.

661
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,480
There's a key here.

662
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,520
The key

663
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,120
is pressed under him,

664
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,240
Here are two keys.

665
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,360
This key is the key to this door.

666
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,200
The warehouse door was closed,

667
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,160
so I broke the lock before I could get in.

668
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,840
Because the key is in the house.

669
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,440
If there's a fire,

670
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,760
Just open the door.

671
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,320
He's dead.

672
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,720
Because the shooting is "dead",

673
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,120
Yes.

674
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,800
So it's possible that

675
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,920
after he dies,

676
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,600
It's still in use.

677
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
That's what it says,

678
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,400
Yes.

679
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,360
That's what the case says.

680
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,040
Nonsense literature,

681
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,840
Let's keep it here.

682
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,600
The "murderer" locked the time of the crime,

683
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,360
and the only one who could enter the crime scene,

684
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,520
And Mr. Li who had conflicts with them.

685
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,880
There are two keys for each of the two doors,

686
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,480
one is kept by the doorman, Uncle Li,

687
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,800
One copy will be kept by Mr. Cang,

688
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,360
and the relevant personnel should keep the key properly.

689
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,320
Don't give it to anyone else.

690
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,120
Uncle Li and Uncle Cang have the key.

691
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,840
If they do,

692
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,440
why is Uncle Li so suspicious?

693
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,760
Because he has another key,

694
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,840
because the door is locked.

695
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,560
Wait a minute. Look,

696
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,040
there are two holes.

697
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,040
I suspect so.

698
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,200
Maybe there's a possibility

699
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,400
that he knocked in from that hole.

700
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,840
Why did you throw it in and knock on people?

701
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
It's not easy to knock,

702
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,400
and if you hit it,

703
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,440
It may not be "dead".

704
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,880
Do you know what's out there?

705
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,080
Then who is suffering?

706
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,440
I'll take a look.

707
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,680
Put this over there and compare it.

708
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,400
Let's see if we can take it out.

709
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,600
You can get in,

710
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:30,960
you can get in,

711
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,000
You can come in.

712
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,720
But there is a ladder here.

713
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,920
She turned around.

714
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,080
There's a ladder over there.

715
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,760
The killer is on the ladder.

716
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,800
Yes.

717
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,600
Is that

718
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,120
okay?

719
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,480
Sure

720
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,760
There's a table, right?

721
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,080
Yes, there's a table right here.

722
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,160
You can stand here.

723
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,440
I think the reason for raising it,

724
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,760
we must use those two holes to do something.

725
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,280
That's it.

726
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,040
They're working on something.

727
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,080
If I throw it like this,

728
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,720
I'll throw it down like this.

729
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,960
But he's very precise.

730
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,680
How can you be sure?

731
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,400
This is where they are,

732
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,400
because the wall has been wiped.

733
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,120
The paint was smeared.

734
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,400
It's possible that they're standing here,

735
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,520
or standing here like this,

736
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,640
Just these two people.

737
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,120
It's already stuck to the paint.

738
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,240
Just like that cockroach hut,

739
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,480
that's how they are.

740
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,200
Yeah, stick it there.

741
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,280
You're not dead, are you?

742
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,000
You're not dead, are you?

743
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,560
I think it's possible.

744
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,080
It's true,

745
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,480
isn't it?

746
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,160
Let's look for clues and so on.

747
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
It must be a box.

748
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,120
Take out the box.

749
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,960
See what's in that corner?

750
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,760
Is that a note?

751
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,400
Why is it here again?

752
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,160
What is this?

753
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,080
Is there a note?

754
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,120
"Push Charming",

755
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,880
fainted immediately after smelling it,

756
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,720
He won't wake up until 180 minutes later.

757
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,920
He won't wake up until 180 minutes later.

758
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
Then it might be like this,

759
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
when these two people were inside,

760
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,840
Dizzy first,

761
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,440
and then,

762
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,240
They should be lying somewhere,

763
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,320
using bricks from,

764
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,800
That's right. You mean

765
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,360
you'll drop it on your head

766
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,760
if you put it down.

767
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,240
I fell to my death.

768
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,320
It could be like this.

769
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,160
Could it be like this?

770
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,760
He set an alarm clock.

771
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,360
Then,

772
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
put it on the bed.

773
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,200
Because when it goes off,

774
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,960
someone reaches for that alarm clock,

775
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,200
He wants to stop it.

776
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,040
This is the right time to release the Ecstasy.

777
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,400
He happened

778
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,360
to be lying there.

779
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,800
I don't think it's feasible.

780
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,080
It's not that accurate, is it?

781
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,240
Let's look for it at the scene.

782
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Look, does this cloth look like this?

783
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,520
It feels a bit like this.

784
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,640
Like this,

785
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,960
This is a balloon,

786
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,720
a rainbow door,

787
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,880
Welcome balloons,

788
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,200
but why is this thing on the bed?

789
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,680
And he's holding it under them.

790
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,760
It's like

791
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,400
this balloon,

792
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,680
If you press it under them,

793
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,280
how could it rub against

794
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,120
the paint on the wall?

795
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,480
Look, there are two holes,

796
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,040
pressing them down,

797
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,000
Maybe before it caught fire,

798
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,400
he used something like this balloon,

799
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,080
Give it to this "corpse"

800
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,360
The stack is very high.

801
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,480
The head is right in these two places,

802
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,600
where it can reach the back of the head.

803
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,440
Then come in with your hand.

804
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:19,920
Take the brick.

805
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:20,960
It's dead.

806
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,800
There's paint on this balloon.

807
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,640
It means that before this thing,

808
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,440
it was attached to the wall.

809
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,320
If you rub the paint like this,

810
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,080
will it be possible?

811
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,240
Do you understand? For example,

812
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,760
this is

813
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,600
an inflatable cushion here.

814
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,480
The inflatable cushion is here.

815
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,120
And these two people are lying here,

816
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,840
lying on their stomachs,

817
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,320
Yeah, lie here

818
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:35,800
and burn it out.

819
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,000
This one will go down as soon as it collapses.

820
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,680
It's gone.

821
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,240
Then I went down.

822
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,640
It's gone.

823
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,600
And then I pressed it right under my body.

824
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,360
Yes,

825
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,280
Is that so?

826
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,160
It feels like it.

827
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,960
It feels a bit like

828
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,480
I fainted first.

829
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,920
I'm confused. Since they're all in the room,

830
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,720
let's just go straight to the point.

831
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,760
Why did he hit him in the back of the head through this?

832
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,840
Why is Uncle Li so suspicious?

833
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,960
Because he has another key,

834
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,600
because he can't get in.

835
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,440
Because it's not Uncle Li,

836
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,520
because he doesn't have the key,

837
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,320
Because he doesn't have the key,

838
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,640
it may not be Li.

839
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,600
They killed these two people,

840
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,920
so someone wants to frame Uncle Li.

841
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,440
In the "murder case" in the secret room,

842
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,880
he never showed up

843
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,040
at the scene of the "murder".

844
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,840
The main thing is that we're just inferring,

845
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,640
and you need to get some more evidence.

846
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,880
Let's see and find some clues or something.

847
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,680
Here,

848
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,160
Come on.

849
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:46,760
Take it out.

850
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,480
Take it out.

851
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,880
Is there?

852
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,120
Is this the goods?

853
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,120
Yes.

854
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,680
That's it.

855
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,240
That's it.

856
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,040
It's the blue one.

857
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,280
What's this?

858
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,720
This is it,

859
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,640
the blue balloon?

860
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,960
This should be the air goal,

861
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,680
not it This is the air bed, right?

862
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,160
Come on, whose lung capacity

863
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,720
is big. Fill it up.

864
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,760
It'll be gone after blowing it.

865
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,840
There's a gas pipe,

866
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,920
isn't there a gas pipe?

867
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,000
With this,

868
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
with this,

869
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Hold on.

870
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,600
Take a look at the word on the blower,

871
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,480
we can make

872
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,680
all kinds of air cushions,

873
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,240
Inflating pipes of various lengths

874
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,360
will be equipped with ultra-fast inflating,

875
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,520
It's an ultra-quiet blower.

876
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,560
This mattress

877
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,720
should have been made to order,

878
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,160
But it says it's ultra-silent. Look,

879
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,120
open it.

880
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,320
Wait a minute. Is this ultra-silent?

881
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,000
We are now the live streamer,

882
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,920
the one who overturned the car,

883
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,280
This thing is absolutely super silent.

884
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,320
But it says it's ultra-silent. Look,

885
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,320
open it.

886
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,240
What?

887
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,000
It's super silent.

888
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,400
It works so well.

889
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,640
Audience friends,

890
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,760
you can't hear this voice.

891
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,280
Do you believe it?

892
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,200
Of course not.

893
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,560
Only we can hear you.

894
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,840
You'll break me down later.

895
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,600
This is for stiff neck,

896
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,520
stiff neck

897
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,040
A flash.

898
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,080
All right,

899
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,360
All right,

900
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,480
I'm deaf.

901
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,120
Then turn it off first.

902
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,800
Turn it off first.

903
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,280
If that's the logic,

904
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,920
it's that person.

905
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,120
We don't have the key to this house,

906
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,480
so Uncle Li may have been wronged,

907
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,200
But the question is, where did Uncle Li go?

908
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,080
Let's go to Mr. Li's room first, right?

909
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,880
Come on. Hurry up.

910
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,200
Look for it.

911
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,360
July 1st,

912
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,640
There are too many goods

913
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,360
in the warehouse,

914
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,760
He asked the neighbors to help him move it.

915
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,640
In the end, it wasn't him who saw the door close

916
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,640
but the warehouse door closed by the younger generation,

917
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,360
And these people,

918
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,240
Zhang,

919
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
Xiao,

920
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,760
Qian,

921
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,280
Qian,

922
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,080
Zhao,

923
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,360
Xiao Wang Xiaoqian,

924
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,000
copper coins

925
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,840
There are six people.

926
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,240
That's a lot.

927
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,640
I have to go into his room to have a look.

928
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,320
Search it. Come on.

929
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,280
Hold on.

930
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,240
Uncle Li, this photo on the wall,

931
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,760
three people in the warehouse,

932
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,280
Me

933
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,720
Who is your friend Xiao Wang?

934
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,720
My friend, Xiao Wang,

935
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,120
also came to the warehouse on July 1.

936
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,000
Ms. Cai,

937
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,400
Ms. Cai is Mr. Li's wife,

938
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,880
Ms. Cai is a good friend of mine,

939
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,960
and she has been missing for a month,

940
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,320
On the day she left, Ms. Cai told me that

941
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,040
she was going to do something big.

942
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,720
Ms. Cai is a very good friend of mine,

943
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,520
and she bought my chocolate at my place.

944
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,280
I really like it.

945
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,080
Why is your brother here again?

946
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,840
Why are you here again?

947
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,960
original

948
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,640
You're a girl.

949
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,080
Miss Li, you are Miss Li,

950
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,880
Bai Sanwan is your mother.

951
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,880
What did you say?

952
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,560
What did you say?

953
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,400
That means

954
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,880
this is what you used to be, right?

955
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,320
What are you doing?

956
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,480
I'm sorry.

957
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,000
My mom's name is Li Nv.

958
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,000
My mother's name is Li Nv.

959
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,199
Is your mother's name Li Nv?

960
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,440
That means,

961
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,360
this is your grandma,

962
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,080
This is your grandpa

963
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,520
and this is your sister,

964
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,560
And then his dad,

965
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,960
and my grandpa is your dad,

966
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,719
Is he your uncle?

967
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
He's your uncle.

968
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,400
Are you his uncle?

969
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:35,960
You're my uncle?

970
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,400
Uncle,

971
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,679
You are my uncle.

972
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:40,760
Hold on.

973
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:41,760
Hold on.

974
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,600
You're my uncle?

975
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,800
Are you his uncle?

976
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,280
His uncle.

977
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,719
Hold on.

978
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,040
This is my dad,

979
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,120
and now he's

980
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,040
Bai Sanwan's mom,

981
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,080
This is your sister,

982
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,400
this is your sister,

983
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,800
Your mom,

984
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,600
I'm you,

985
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,120
You're his uncle, right?

986
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Nephew,

987
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,280
Nephew,

988
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:08,560
Nephew,

989
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,640
I never expected that,

990
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,440
Unexpectedly,

991
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,000
my nephew,

992
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,360
You're much more mature than I look.

993
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,800
I'm a little short of money recently,

994
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,200
Uncle,

995
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,480
Uncle can't do it either.

996
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,960
You've grown so old.

997
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
I can't believe you're still a junior.

998
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,440
How old are you?

999
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,560
I was born in 1993.

1000
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,480
I was born in 1997.

1001
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,920
No,

1002
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,320
Yes.

1003
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,280
I was born in 1997.

1004
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,960
You were born in 1997.

1005
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,240
You were born in 1993.

1006
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,800
Are you my uncle?

1007
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,560
She didn't give birth to me.

1008
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,960
You're not Miss Cai,

1009
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,440
You are.

1010
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,880
Your father got married for the second time,

1011
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,600
and I was born by my second wife.

1012
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,160
You're his second wife,

1013
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,240
but there's a picture of

1014
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,360
his first wife on his wall.

1015
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,680
Because it's 1988,

1016
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,800
and they were still together in 1988.

1017
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,320
No, I haven't met my mom yet.

1018
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,360
Then why did you get divorced?

1019
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:55,880
They've killed people.

1020
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,680
Why are you divorced?

1021
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,640
You've been talking about ethics for a long time,

1022
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,520
but your daily chatter is not clean.

1023
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,360
Wait a minute. There's something here.

1024
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,080
What?

1025
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,960
I don't know.

1026
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,680
Can you take it out?

1027
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,560
Good stuff,

1028
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,880
Miss Li,

1029
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,000
There's a story in it. Mom

1030
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,080
and Dad

1031
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,960
bought their favorite chocolate.

1032
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,760
They said it was a token of love between them.

1033
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,040
My parents bought me

1034
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,320
my favorite Oreos.

1035
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,400
I like to twist the Oreo away

1036
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,800
and eat the one with the white sandwich.

1037
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,680
It's delicious.

1038
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,480
Dad usually has a good temper.

1039
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,840
But she became bad-tempered after drinking.

1040
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,160
There was a fight with the warehouse

1041
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,600
keeper Uncle Cang Uncle Ku.

1042
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,760
The neighbors came to persuade us to fight,

1043
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,840
today Uncle Cang Uncle Ku

1044
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,200
and the owner of Xiao Wang's shop,

1045
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,160
Uncle Wang,

1046
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,120
what a fierce quarrel.

1047
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,080
Uncle Cang Uncle Ku

1048
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,400
discovered Uncle Wang's secret,

1049
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,480
The longevity exercises

1050
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,720
taught by Uncle Wang

1051
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,640
are a lie.

1052
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,720
Playing longevity exercises can cure all diseases

1053
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,360
and live forever.

1054
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,120
I tricked a lot of old people into spending a lot of money to learn it.

1055
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,200
I also cheated them

1056
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,560
of the hard-earned money they earned.

1057
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,040
In the end, the three of them got into a fight.

1058
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,320
That is,

1059
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,720
Wang also had a motive to "kill" them,

1060
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,120
I celebrated

1061
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,680
Dad's 38th birthday at noon today,

1062
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,200
I'm going to my grandma's house

1063
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:14,720
for the weekend with my mom,

1064
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,320
I'm so happy.

1065
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,240
But today it's so strange,

1066
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,120
is always on at three o'clock,

1067
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,320
I looked at the clock eagerly

1068
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,240
and turned on the TV at three o'clock,

1069
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,120
But I let it go for an hour.

1070
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,680
The fertilizer commercial doesn't air until four o'clock

1071
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,240
West ,

1072
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,160
But I have to go to class.

1073
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
So there's something wrong with the clock.

1074
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,480
I adjusted my watch

1075
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,600
and the time was wrong.

1076
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,640
As soon as I left the house,

1077
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,640
I ran into Uncle Cang and Uncle Ku and came back.

1078
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,160
I'm so angry.

1079
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,760
Today,

1080
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,160
July 2nd,

1081
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,120
She's going to class.

1082
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,920
She thought it was 4: 00, but it's actually

1083
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,480
3: 00.

1084
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,160
At three o'clock,

1085
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:36,840
they were still alive.

1086
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,560
Yes, he's still alive.

1087
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,920
Why did you adjust their watch?

1088
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,320
is to cause his daughter

1089
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,040
to make a time error.

1090
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,400
Hey,

1091
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Hey,

1092
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,320
Xiao He? Won't he be

1093
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,160
from 2022?

1094
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,600
The signal here is very bad.

1095
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,320
I don't know why.

1096
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,840
Where did you go?

1097
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,400
-I can't find you. -He, you

1098
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,160
might not believe me if I tell you,

1099
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,680
We launched the market

1100
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,760
in 1988.

1101
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,200
It was launched in 1988.

1102
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,000
What?

1103
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,960
You went back to 1988.

1104
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,200
How is that possible?

1105
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,720
There's a case here,

1106
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,120
and we're working on it.

1107
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,120
We'll find a way to contact you after solving it.

1108
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,320
Let's see how to get back.

1109
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,160
Okay,

1110
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,200
I'll finish that in advance.

1111
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,120
I found something.

1112
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,360
In 1988,

1113
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,160
Chuyangxiang Street,

1114
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,880
In the arson case,

1115
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,840
the murderer at that time,

1116
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,920
It's a man named Uncle Li.

1117
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,160
And Uncle Li, at 4: 00 to

1118
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,120
5: 00,

1119
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,720
He said he was having a drink

1120
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,120
with Wang in the compound,

1121
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,280
After five o'clock,

1122
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,440
Xiao Wang left.

1123
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,200
Uncle Li passed out drunk

1124
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,520
in the courtyard.

1125
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,200
Then there was a murder case.

1126
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,680
When you drink at 5:

1127
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,600
00, when Uncle Li gets

1128
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,200
drunk,

1129
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,080
Wang means,

1130
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,640
he arrived at his home around five o'clock.

1131
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,880
Besides, he's with a friend,

1132
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,680
so he has an alibi.

1133
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,080
Uncle Li was drunk,

1134
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,720
so he didn't even know what happened.

1135
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,360
And no one can prove it.

1136
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,600
What did he do

1137
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,680
in that place,

1138
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,560
But what Uncle Li can be sure of

1139
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,800
is that the key at that time,

1140
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,920
He hid it

1141
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,520
in a place that only he knows.

1142
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,920
And I've never been passive.

1143
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,520
And then Uncle Li ran away.

1144
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,480
So he was finally identified as a suspect.

1145
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,960
Now, the one who has a problem with the victim,

1146
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,080
is Wang.

1147
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,760
Wang and Uncle Li,

1148
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,560
but they didn't make it clear.

1149
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,080
Uncle Li,

1150
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,440
why did you kill the warehouse?

1151
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,320
He just drank wine,

1152
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,160
quarreled with others,

1153
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,960
But there's nothing specific.

1154
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,320
Understood.

1155
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
But Wang,

1156
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,360
he's quite serious.

1157
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,320
Wang,

1158
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,400
Wang,

1159
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,040
There's something wrong with Xiao Wang.

1160
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,840
Xiao Wang is suspicious.

1161
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,760
Hold on.

1162
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,120
Then why?

1163
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,200
Uncle Li changed his daughter's schedule,

1164
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,760
why did he change it?

1165
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,680
I'm sure Uncle Li didn't make it himself.

1166
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,040
I'm sure Uncle Li didn't do it.

1167
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,320
Who can come to his house and give him this tune?

1168
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,920
Wang,

1169
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,520
adjust their watch,

1170
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,920
is to create

1171
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,480
a "death" time,

1172
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,000
For Uncle Li with an alibi or something,

1173
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,800
he was identified,

1174
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,880
Because he met

1175
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,000
too many preconditions,

1176
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,920
In fact, there is no conclusive evidence.

1177
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,560
It's him.

1178
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
He framed Li.

1179
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
It must be like this.

1180
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,720
It must be a frame-up.

1181
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,360
Xiao Wang has a shop.

1182
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,520
Go straight to Xiao Wang's,

1183
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,560
Go to Wang's place first.

1184
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,040
Is this

1185
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,000
what Xiao Wang drives?

1186
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,640
Wang's place,

1187
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,320
Xiao Wang's shop,

1188
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,120
Xiao Wang's shop is so good,

1189
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,200
Xiao Wang's shop,

1190
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,880
Xiao Wang, can't you open the store?

1191
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,960
Come on, Bai.

1192
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,520
What time is it?

1193
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:14,920
Four,

1194
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,640
Five,

1195
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:17,960
Six,

1196
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,120
It's six o'clock.

1197
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,560
six o'clock

1198
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,400
Power failure.

1199
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,000
Help!

1200
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
No, I'm scared.

1201
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,240
I'm scared too.

1202
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,400
The flyer I handed out today,

1203
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,120
is that there will be a power outage this afternoon,

1204
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,080
There will be a power outage

1205
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,000
in this apartment from 6 pm to 6: 10 pm

1206
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,960
today?

1207
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,920
But you mean

1208
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,520
the blackout in 2022

1209
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,720
is not 1988 at all.

1210
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,880
The flyer I handed out today,

1211
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,480
there will be a power outage this afternoon.

1212
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,560
Open the door.

1213
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,240
Is it open?

1214
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:51,880
Open the door.

1215
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,120
You didn't catch someone.

1216
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,680
What's wrong?

1217
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,000
He opened the door,

1218
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,200
Come on,

1219
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:56,960
The door can be opened, right?

1220
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,520
Who is it?

1221
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,280
Are you mad?

1222
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,240
I'm not afraid.

1223
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:06,840
I'm not afraid.

1224
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,440
I'm not afraid.

1225
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,080
I'm not afraid of you.

1226
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,200
Come out.

1227
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,200
You're crazy.

1228
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,920
I'm not afraid.

1229
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,680
I have something in my hand,

1230
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,280
so whoever touches it throws it over.

1231
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,600
-I'm dying. -Brother, come

1232
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,400
down.

1233
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,240
I can't stand it. Come down.

1234
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,560
It finally lights up.

1235
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,840
What's wrong?

1236
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,400
Here.

1237
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,720
I'm so surprised.

1238
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,920
Why are there so many people here?

1239
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,800
Is there no light in this room?

1240
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,360
In this room.

1241
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,600
Wait a minute.

1242
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,720
Work permit

1243
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,320
Chuyang Lane Kobayashi,

1244
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,440
Photographer of Youth Photo Studio.

1245
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,560
Are they charmed?

1246
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,520
Who did they fall for?

1247
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,360
You must be

1248
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,160
fascinated by me.

1249
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,400
Who are you?

1250
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,440
How did you get in?

1251
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,240
Catch them!

1252
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,280
Go after him!

1253
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:31,800
What is it?

1254
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,520
Run!

1255
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,520
Go after him

1256
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,680
Let's go home. Don't arrest us.

1257
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,320
We're home.

1258
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,040
The three of you will arrest us.

1259
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,200
Only the two of us are the youngest,

1260
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,440
just the two of us.

1261
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,680
Arrest him.

1262
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,000
Wait a minute,

1263
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,600
sir. I was wrong.

1264
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,960
I didn't run away.

1265
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,840
He's going to arrest me.

1266
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,280
I'm really drunk.

1267
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,160
Catch them!

1268
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,000
Go after them!

1269
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,520
I'm not running.

1270
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,080
Behave yourself.

1271
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,240
honest

1272
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,720
Both of you

1273
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,840
bet on me. Be honest.

1274
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,880
Okay, behave yourself.

1275
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,480
Guo Baoyou,

1276
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,720
shut up!

1277
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,680
I was wrong.

1278
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,640
Don't hold hands.

1279
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,120
Bring them in.

1280
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,640
Is the person in charge here?

1281
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:43,240
Is the person in charge here?

1282
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,680
Is the person in charge here?

1283
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,000
I need to talk to your boss.

1284
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,280
Bring them in.

1285
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,800
Which one is in charge of you?

1286
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,520
Brother, I want to join you. Brother,

1287
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,240
I want to join you.

1288
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,520
Brother,

1289
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,400
I want to join you.

1290
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:58,960
Don't talk.

1291
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,360
Brother,

1292
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:00,720
don't talk.

1293
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,400
Behave yourself.

1294
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,160
Don't get us into trouble.

1295
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,000
Bai San Wan, shut up.

1296
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,280
I can cook noodles for you.

1297
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,760
Brother Bai San Wan only represents

1298
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,640
his own position,

1299
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,320
Don't talk. Be honest

1300
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,920
and you'll be fine.

1301
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,480
Where are you going?

1302
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,640
The question is where to go?

1303
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,360
Don't talk.

1304
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,040
Don't talk.

1305
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,040
Put them inside.

1306
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,040
You still have to go in.

1307
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,840
sole of one's foot

1308
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,200
Watch your feet.

1309
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,080
They stay outside,

1310
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,800
Hurry up.

1311
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,400
Who will stay outside?

1312
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,160
Me

1313
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:21,560
Wait,

1314
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,720
shall I stay outside?

1315
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,000
Take these two outside,

1316
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
and I'll separate them.

1317
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,840
Lock them out.

1318
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,560
No.

1319
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:27,960
Who are you?

1320
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,280
Behave yourself.

1321
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,040
Liu,

1322
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:30,720
who is this?

1323
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,440
Song,

1324
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,360
Brother,

1325
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,080
And Bai, right?

1326
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,880
Come out.

1327
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,040
I'm his man now.

1328
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,720
Be careful.

1329
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,360
I'm telling you,

1330
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,360
Let's go.

1331
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,000
Is it closed?

1332
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,400
Can we take it off now?

1333
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,240
Can you take it off now?

1334
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,080
I've already taken it off.

1335
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,080
Take it off.

1336
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,520
I'm fine.

1337
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,680
It's so dark.

1338
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,400
Can't I turn on the lights?

1339
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:56,960
No, I just touched the wall.

1340
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,160
Look for it.

1341
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,360
Let's look for it.

1342
00:45:59,360 --> 00:45:59,920
Brothers,

1343
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,880
brothers and sisters,

1344
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,640
Look for it.

1345
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,320
Although it's dark.

1346
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,120
What is this?

1347
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,840
There's something here.

1348
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,560
There's something here. Brother,

1349
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,160
There's a password box here.

1350
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,720
It must be the password.

1351
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,600
One, two,

1352
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,080
eight.

1353
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,400
Try 19880702.

1354
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:32,880
All right.

1355
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,480
No.

1356
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,880
Why is it so dark?

1357
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,360
here

1358
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,440
Is there a light?

1359
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:53,800
No,

1360
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,520
there must be no lights.

1361
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,000
I'm afraid there's someone here, you know?

1362
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,280
Don't scare me like that.

1363
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,200
It doesn't matter if it's not dark,

1364
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,880
but no one else is here.

1365
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:10,840
Liu Xia,

1366
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,240
No,

1367
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:11,560
Me,

1368
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,200
What are you doing?

1369
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,040
I'm getting used to the brightness.

1370
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,280
What are you doing?

1371
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,400
I'm looking to see if there's anyone.

1372
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,640
What are you doing?

1373
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,560
I'm looking to see if there's anyone.

1374
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:20,560
What are you doing?

1375
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,840
This is

1376
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,000
the door, right?

1377
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,560
This is TV,

1378
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,400
a bunch of TVs,

1379
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,200
Is it a bunch of TVs,

1380
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,160
we,

1381
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,000
I'm telling you,

1382
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,800
as long as one person comes out,

1383
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,600
Then we'll go crazy.

1384
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,680
We must be scared to death.

1385
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,120
I'm begging you.

1386
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,120
There shouldn't be anyone here, right?

1387
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,080
It's so scary.

1388
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,040
When the lights went out,

1389
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,480
I was as tall as Liu Xia.

1390
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,240
I have a little,

1391
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,600
I don't know what we're doing.

1392
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,360
I have a book in my hand.

1393
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,480
I'll throw it away

1394
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,320
if anyone dares to come over. This is the way through.

1395
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,360
Are you having fun there?

1396
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:53,880
They're fighting.

1397
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,640
There's a fight next door.

1398
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,440
I think

1399
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:58,760
we should,

1400
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,280
We need to find a lamp.

1401
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,640
We're here.

1402
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,880
But we have to do something.

1403
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,120
Find a way to do something, okay?

1404
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,960
No, I'm so scared when I look at this.

1405
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,520
I saw it, too. It's scary.

1406
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,800
I feel like one.

1407
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,840
I feel like a person,

1408
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,280
don't tell me,

1409
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,040
You said it was scary.

1410
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,280
Because I'm already thinking about it horribly.

1411
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,000
It's horrible if you say that again.

1412
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,200
This place became very scary.

1413
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,040
You know what?

1414
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,760
I can't just wait for them to save me.

1415
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,080
Where are you?

1416
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:38,880
What are you doing?

1417
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,040
We're here.

1418
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:42,920
Help us!

1419
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,240
Help us!

1420
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,320
Please save us.

1421
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:47,880
Is there

1422
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,080
anything else in this room?

1423
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:49,400
Wait a minute.

1424
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,040
I can't see anything

1425
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:50,920
up there.

1426
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,400
Did you write

1427
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,480
some English letters?

1428
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,600
Is this A?

1429
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,560
I can't see anything.

1430
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,720
It's dark.

1431
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:03,960
Hold on.

1432
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,920
I think I saw

1433
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,520
this flashlight,

1434
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,800
I saw a flashlight,

1435
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,160
right?

1436
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:09,520
I'm saved.

1437
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,320
Material Room B,

1438
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:21,720
let me tell you,

1439
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,360
Being on this show

1440
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,040
costs more than being on a singing show,

1441
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,600
Yes.

1442
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,760
And you can't control

1443
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,960
your scientific voice here,

1444
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,440
There is no scientific voice.

1445
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,000
Hold on.

1446
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,640
We have a lock here.

1447
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,520
Do you have the key?

1448
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,760
Who are you? Over there.

1449
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,360
I'm Liu Xia,

1450
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:43,800
who are you?

1451
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,240
Me,

1452
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:45,920
We...

1453
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,160
We're locked.

1454
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,440
We can't get out of here.

1455
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,040
Okay, it's okay.

1456
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:54,920
Let's find the key first.

1457
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,880
A key.

1458
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,840
A key box.

1459
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,440
Take this off first.

1460
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,440
Can it be like this?

1461
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,080
Here's a key

1462
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,840
and a light button in the material room.

1463
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,480
We found the lamp.

1464
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,040
What do you mean?

1465
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:24,280
Who is it?

1466
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:24,520
It finally lights up.

1467
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:25,680
It finally lights up.

1468
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,040
It finally lights up.

1469
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,280
What else is in this room?

1470
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:27,920
It's nothing.

1471
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,080
With the light control button in the supplies room,

1472
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,000
the light is turned on.

1473
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,200
I pressed the wrong button. Sorry.

1474
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,120
I pressed the wrong button.

1475
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,040
All right,

1476
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,400
There's a lock here.

1477
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,360
Anything else?

1478
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,080
There's also a key. The key should be

1479
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,720
… Did you find

1480
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,680
something?

1481
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,400
We have the files

1482
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,440
of Chuyang Lane staff here,

1483
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,640
We also have the key to the supply room,

1484
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,640
A's window,

1485
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,760
That's the key to your house.

1486
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,400
It's in our room.

1487
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,040
Fun things are not always young and old,

1488
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,520
yo-yo,

1489
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,720
Did you play this when you were little?

1490
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,360
Hard,

1491
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:09,840
which

1492
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:10,960
Yo-Yo,

1493
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,440
Yes.

1494
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,360
No, I think

1495
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,440
we should open the safe.

1496
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:25,960
Yes.

1497
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,120
Let's try it one by one.

1498
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,520
This eight-digit number

1499
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,680
is actually like a birthday,

1500
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:34,840
We have the files

1501
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,880
of Chuyang Lane staff here,

1502
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:39,840
cocoa

1503
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,920
Let's read birthday again

1504
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,160
Okay,

1505
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,200
One by one,

1506
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,960
did they say who's in charge of the supplies room?

1507
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,400
No.

1508
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,360
They wrote that

1509
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,920
Lao Wang is the owner of Xiao Wang's shop,

1510
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,240
Xiao Chen is an electrician,

1511
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,960
Xiao Lin is a photographer of Youth Photo Studio,

1512
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,520
I don't think those people are important.

1513
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,840
Xiao Peng, the material manager,

1514
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,560
will you give me his birthday?

1515
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,280
December 05,

1516
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,160
December 05,

1517
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,320
33 years old,

1518
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,120
33 years old,

1519
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,200
55,

1520
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:09,880
1955, 1988.

1521
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,000
No,

1522
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,800
it's ringing again.

1523
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,720
The blackout in 2022

1524
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,760
is because we

1525
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,600
went back to 2022.

1526
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,240
The power went out just now.

1527
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,040
No.

1528
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,200
We don't have "time travel".

1529
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,040
6: 00 p. m., 6:

1530
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:29,920
10 p. m.

1531
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,320
The power will go out at 6: 10 PM.

1532
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,600
That's 2022. Yeah,

1533
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,520
that's 2022.

1534
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,400
Go forward and be 33 years old,

1535
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,960
19891205。

1536
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,520
By the way,

1537
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,240
we've finally opened

1538
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,440
the storage rooms

1539
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,120
from Room B to Room A.

1540
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,440
Can you throw Ke Wuku

1541
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:07,720
from Room B

1542
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,440
to Room A?

1543
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,320
Hold on.

1544
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,120
I don't think so.

1545
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:12,800
We're leaving.

1546
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,760
You guys stay here.

1547
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,360
Goodbye.

1548
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,920
Who are you?

1549
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,720
Isn't it this one?

1550
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,040
Liu,

1551
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,840
I think we have your key.

1552
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,280
Yeah, give it to us.

1553
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,280
So you have to give it to us.

1554
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,760
We have to give it

1555
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,920
to you. How?

1556
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,720
I don't have any rope

1557
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,360
for you to throw over.

1558
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,320
Yo-Yo, go over there.

1559
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,600
What do you want to tie first?

1560
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,240
Yo-Yo,

1561
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,080
take the yo-yo,

1562
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:45,560
Take the yo-yo and roll it over.

1563
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,000
Tie it over there with a yo-yo.

1564
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,120
Do you have a rope?

1565
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,880
-Yes. -Wait for us.

1566
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:51,600
Liu,

1567
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,360
Throw something for you,

1568
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:53,840
after that

1569
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,240
Let's see if you can

1570
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:00,640
keep throwing it.

1571
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,560
Where did you throw it?

1572
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,400
What did you throw away?

1573
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,080
They're quite far away from each other.

1574
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,760
You guys,

1575
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,800
why do I see something?

1576
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,440
What?

1577
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,440
Is there a slide track?

1578
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,040
This yo-yo should be able to roll over.

1579
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,480
I lost the yo-yo

1580
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,360
for half a day,

1581
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,000
Come on,

1582
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:32,760
Yo-Yo is here.

1583
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,720
No, the rope is like this.

1584
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,480
Just roll over here.

1585
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,600
After we catch the ball,

1586
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,920
you tie the rope to that key,

1587
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,880
So we dragged

1588
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,520
the rope here.

1589
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:44,920
Okay, we … We … We're

1590
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,200
leaving now.

1591
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,040
We'll get out of here then.

1592
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,280
No.

1593
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,200
Mirror?

1594
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,720
Like a rearview mirror.

1595
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,240
I saw it.

1596
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:00,560
Yes, I did.

1597
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,360
It's such a big slope.

1598
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,280
Sure,

1599
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,880
And it's a slope,

1600
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,320
Yes.

1601
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,080
Let's get out of here.

1602
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,520
Loosen the rope.

1603
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,160
Let's get out of here.

1604
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,360
I'm leaving.

1605
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,080
Okay. Come on.

1606
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:32,440
No.

1607
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:32,800
Stop.

1608
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,160
It's okay.

1609
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,080
Relax.

1610
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,000
It can't roll over.

1611
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,160
You have to wrap the rope

1612
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:38,880
around it first.

1613
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,280
If you pull and roll,

1614
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,640
how can we pull and roll?

1615
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,000
How can we pull and roll at the same time?

1616
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,720
You can put the rope

1617
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,560
Entanglement,

1618
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,720
Wrap a backhand buckle.

1619
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,680
Then he pulled it and left, didn't he?

1620
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,200
He left after pulling back the button.

1621
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,080
What principle?

1622
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,200
You don't want to let us out, do you?

1623
00:55:59,200 --> 00:55:59,920
Just say it.

1624
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,280
That's what I mean.

1625
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,360
Yes, I don't want to.

1626
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:03,680
That's it then.

1627
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,560
That's it then.

1628
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,200
Anyway, we have Oreos

1629
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,000
and real fruits

1630
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,560
in our bags. Red pomelo, Four Seasons Spring,

1631
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,760
True fruit red pomelo spring all the year round,

1632
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,640
but I don't understand,

1633
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,400
Just roll like this.

1634
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,200
Can't you do that?

1635
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,400
I'm drunk.

1636
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,320
I'm really drunk.

1637
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:20,720
Drunk.

1638
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,480
Did you go down?

1639
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,360
No.

1640
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,760
Where's the key?

1641
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,360
I don't have a key,

1642
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,120
but is it possible

1643
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,000
to roll down like this?

1644
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,440
You can roll down.

1645
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,200
You can roll down.

1646
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,120
Did you get it?

1647
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,320
I got it.

1648
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,880
Let's just do it.

1649
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,400
Just tie the key if you don't need it.

1650
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,440
Tie the key directly.

1651
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,480
Just get out of here.

1652
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,160
Yeah, get out of here.

1653
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,000
They didn't have a fault tolerance rate

1654
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,880
and they didn't take it.

1655
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,320
We just... We won't

1656
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,160
make any mistakes.

1657
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:46,680
Trust me.

1658
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,320
Are you done?

1659
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:53,880
right away

1660
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,080
No.

1661
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,720
Almost there.

1662
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,600
Don't worry.

1663
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,400
You're really good at doing things,

1664
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:00,920
If you keep doing this,

1665
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,920
we'll die.

1666
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,480
Nobody goes out.

1667
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,720
Let's not go out.

1668
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,560
No.

1669
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,680
I was wrong.

1670
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,240
I'm sorry,

1671
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,760
when people are in extreme fear,

1672
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,080
I'm a little out of my mind.

1673
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:12,760
Please forgive me.

1674
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,320
We've picked Song Meili from the workshop

1675
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,560
with the most skillful hands,

1676
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,800
I'll do manual work for you.

1677
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,520
Yes.

1678
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,200
Now he's playing professionally.

1679
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:22,880
Yes.

1680
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,720
What the heck is this?

1681
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,720
What the heck is this?

1682
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,440
Why are your hands so clumsy?

1683
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,120
He told me just now,

1684
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,200
he wants to fight us to the death.

1685
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,880
Do you have jet lag?

1686
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,160
We've been talking for a minute.

1687
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,040
That's when he said,

1688
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,080
we're going to fight you

1689
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,400
long ago.

1690
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,760
If you say more, I'll swallow the key.

1691
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,840
We swallowed them all.

1692
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,400
I swallowed my key.

1693
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,120
Hurry up.

1694
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:44,840
In three minutes,

1695
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,800
if you don't send me the key,

1696
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,120
I'll ask Zhou Keke

1697
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,120
to swallow the key.

1698
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,240
Are you threatening him or me?

1699
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,080
Are you done?

1700
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:51,960
You haven't finished it yet.

1701
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,400
No.

1702
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:52,720
Okay,

1703
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,400
but it's just,

1704
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,680
I want to buckle this to death.

1705
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,960
I'm afraid it'll fall in the middle.

1706
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,800
I don't think it's going to fall off.

1707
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,320
It won't fall off.

1708
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,400
Come on,

1709
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,600
you guys.

1710
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,360
I'm leaving.

1711
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:07,800
I'm here.

1712
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,120
Come on,

1713
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:08,680
Get lost!

1714
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,000
Come on.

1715
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:23,480
Great,

1716
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:23,920
I got it.

1717
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,320
Got it?

1718
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:35,760
Pull the rope,

1719
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,560
pull the rope,

1720
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,520
What do you mean?

1721
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,320
What rope?

1722
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,000
There's no rope.

1723
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,600
You didn't tie it?

1724
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,800
Put all your eggs

1725
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,960
in one basket

1726
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,760
without tying the rope.

1727
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,600
What if it stops in the middle?

1728
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,080
This one has no fault tolerance.

1729
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,440
Did you stop?

1730
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:54,840
Yes,

1731
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,480
wait a minute.

1732
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,200
Hold on.

1733
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,280
Don't worry.

1734
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:00,920
Give me another one.

1735
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:01,600
Hit me again.

1736
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:02,880
Look.

1737
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,800
No, I have to bump into him.

1738
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,360
I still need

1739
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,080
another one.

1740
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,440
Many,

1741
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:37,720
It's okay.

1742
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,680
We're

1743
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,440
the billiards diva.

1744
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,320
We have to

1745
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:51,840
keep bumping. Keep bumping,

1746
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,720
Hit harder,

1747
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:55,720
take that ball,

1748
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,160
This ball,

1749
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,840
no, it's too strong.

1750
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,400
Don't … Don't get hit and run away. What should I

1751
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,640
do?

1752
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,560
Stop.

1753
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,800
The card is getting tighter.

1754
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,800
What do you mean?

1755
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,360
Brother Bai,

1756
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,080
can you see

1757
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:19,600
your sister's idea like this?

1758
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,600
It's a long way.

1759
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,120
Give me a hand.

1760
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:23,880
Let me see. How much more?

1761
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,360
Actually, it's not far.

1762
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,160
It's about the same if they bump into each other twice.

1763
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,160
You're so close to losing it.

1764
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,080
You should be able to get it if you hit it twice more.

1765
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:32,600
Why don't you give it to me?

1766
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,400
Give me another ball.

1767
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,800
Anyway, it's already like this.

1768
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,600
The jar is broken and broken.

1769
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,200
Just give it to me.

1770
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,280
Give the ball

1771
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:54,880
We got

1772
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:01,520
a successful rescue.

1773
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:05,960
Awesome.

1774
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,800
Friends,

1775
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,280
you "pig teammates"

1776
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,720
All right. Open the window.

1777
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,920
Yes. Where are our keys?

1778
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,320
It's in my hands.

1779
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,120
You can go out now.

1780
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:29,960
Let's go.

1781
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:30,480
Brothers,

1782
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,840
we're about to start a new journey.

1783
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,080
You have so many yo-yos here.

1784
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,280
We've been playing here for half a day.

1785
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,200
You first,

1786
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,720
If you want to go to the end,

1787
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,720
it'll be fine

1788
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,720
if it's so bright.

1789
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,880
Zhou Keke is acting weird today.

1790
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,720
Let's vote.

1791
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,000
He wants to go to the end,

1792
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,480
just because I think it's bright,

1793
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:56,880
Our lock,

1794
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,320
is it the lock here?

1795
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,160
The detention room.

1796
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:05,680
Someone is here.

1797
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,320
Miss Cai,

1798
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,160
sweet and sweet Xiao Zhou Zhou,

1799
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,680
Ms. Cai is Mr. Li's wife.

1800
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,280
Sister Cai is Uncle Li's wife,

1801
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,040
and he "killed" someone

1802
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:41,960
more than 30 years ago.

1803
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,320
I'm sure Li didn't do it.

1804
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,280
He's a good man.

1805
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,880
Let's put an end to this.

1806
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,480
Dad,

1807
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,240
Grandpa,

1808
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:49,760
Yes,

1809
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,080
Wang asked me for a drink,

1810
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,320
So I drank too much.

1811
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,720
In his sleep, he found that

1812
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,880
the warehouse was on fire,

1813
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,080
Arrest him.

1814
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,440
So scary.

1815
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,440
I want to report you.

1816
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,440
Then I found out

1817
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,640
about their plan.

1818
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,040
Hit the temple

1819
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,400
with a petrol tank.

1820
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,760
He hit the back of the head,

1821
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:08,800
Ms. Cai,

1822
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,120
You're also suspected of murder.

1823
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,480
Lock Tencent Video,

1824
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,160

See Jiageng's Diary of Apartment 11.

1830
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,680
In the middle of the week, there were a lot of short videos of the preview tidbits,

1831
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,040
which were swiped every day,

1832
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,400
Let me show you a 360-degree exploration of Apartment 11,

1833
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,800
and open the Tencent video soon.

1834
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,760
Search .

1835
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,280
Immerse yourself with the bulldozers.
