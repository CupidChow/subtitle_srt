1
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,600
What was that sound?

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,080
The butler

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,560
The butler is "dead"

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,840
It's very likely that

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,960
it was murder for money

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,800
That person definitely wasn’t just a butler

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,320
Do you know *Shoplifters*?

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,080
These people might have come together

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,000
A group of strangers

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
Their family is way too suspicious

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,200
The shoe is here.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,960
Right.

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,320
You can take that shoe out and have a look.

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,160
Is it the one we saw?

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,560
Foot.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,960
That shoe is...

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,080
It's that lady's small leather shoe.

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,480
So he buried that person here.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,800
Buried inside the dining table.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,600
You go.

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,240
Pull it out and see.

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,920
Let's pull it out and take a look.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,360
We picked the bravest among us.

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,400
We were just eating on this table.

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,760
This family is really sick.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm getting on the table.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,920
Sorry, everyone.

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,360
No disrespect intended.

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,400
Be careful not to fall.

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,880
Be careful.

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Careful.

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,520
Here.

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,000
It's wrapped in plastic wrap.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,960
He was probably afraid of the smell.

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,960
Should we lift her out?

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,520
Okay, let's do it.

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:53,920
Lift it up.

38
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,480
This is too horrifying.

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,640
Mouth.

40
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,480
It's very heavy.

41
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,800
Give it to me.

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,120
Daliu.

43
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,080
Put it on the chair?

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,960
Should we open this?

45
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,240
This is the clothing, right?

46
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,920
We're certain.

47
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,040
This...

48
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,680
Look at the bruises on her face.

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,440
See this yellowish part here.

50
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,640
Which means she had bruises.

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,200
It looks like she was...

52
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,480
Doesn't this look like a handprint?

53
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,400
Exactly.

54
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,840
I understand.

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,040
This is from covering her mouth.

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,680
This is where her mouth was covered.

57
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:36,920
Isn't that right?

58
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,840
Like this.

59
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,600
What do you mean "like this"?

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,280
Just like this.

61
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,000
When I'm behind you like this.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,400
Right.

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,840
The hand is in this position.

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,600
And then...

65
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:44,960
Isn't that correct?

66
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,360
Then I cover your mouth.

67
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,400
And I go "Ah!"

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,720
No!

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,920
That's what happened, right?

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
You've completely reenacted

71
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,880
the crime scene.

72
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,400
It was you.

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,520
So you knew all the details of the crime.

74
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,000
Entrapment!

75
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,640
Daliu!

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,280
You covered my mouth!

77
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,880
Daliu!

78
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,680
You silenced me!

79
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,400
I won't!

80
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,520
I don't want to use this.

81
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
It must have been you.

82
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,160
Your technique looks so practiced.

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,960
This is all "blood," right?

84
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,040
Look, there's "blood" on the arm.

85
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,160
The arm is covered in "bloodstains."

86
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,960
His hands are dirty.

87
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,760
Glitter ink.

88
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,080
Could this possibly be that ink?

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,600
Artsy.

90
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,280
And when his hands got wet,

91
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,440
his hands were covered in that red ink.

92
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,160
I even found

93
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,560
more on his body.

94
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,000
Gone.

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,520
It's all scratched off.

96
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,280
Look.

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,480
Should we compare the colors?

98
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,640
No need.

99
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,600
No need to compare.

100
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,560
It spilled.

101
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,120
You're the "killer."

102
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,560
You're the "killer."

103
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,200
Look, I've caught

104
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,960
more evidence.

105
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,560
Dear audience,

106
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,640
we don't solve cases this casually.

107
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,160
Here's what you do:

108
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,160
Sprinkle this bottle on it

109
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,200
to see if it's the same thing.

110
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,000
Just this color, see?

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,720
Just this color.

112
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,440
So this is his handprint.

113
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Sorry, everyone.

114
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,400
Uh, I'll go deal with this.

115
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
There's also this mark on the foot here.

116
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,080
So was he dragged here after "dying"?

117
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,840
Then why hide it here?

118
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,400
The most dangerous place

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,200
They deliberately arranged this grand banquet

120
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,839
We were just eating here earlier

121
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,440
No one noticed such a big commotion

122
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,839
They went out

123
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,400
They're out

124
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,000
It's also possible

125
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,160
They took advantage when they were away

126
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,680
But the butler usually doesn't go out

127
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,800
Anyway about this matter

128
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,240
It must have been done by the two of them conspiring together

129
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,760
Why is there someone lying here?

130
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,080
He can forget about using my secret to threaten me

131
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,280
You might not even be qualified to enter our home

132
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,400
Don't panic

133
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,520
Stay calm

134
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Cooperate more

135
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,800
Today is June 17th.

136
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,640
Today we received

137
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,520
an invitation from Guo Baoyou

138
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,200
for a family recognition ceremony.

139
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,960
to celebrate him finding his relatives.

140
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,440
At noon, we were at the Ju family banquet hall

141
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,120
having a meal when

142
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,200
we suddenly heard from their bathroom

143
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,680
what sounded like someone falling.

144
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,480
Then we went in

145
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,200
and found the butler "dead" inside.

146
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,360
Currently, the most suspicious

147
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,440
are definitely the Ju family members.

148
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,600
You just want to drag us into

149
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,960
a "murder" case.

150
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,720
We don't care at all who your father is.

151
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,840
Actually, after seeing it,

152
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,400
I don't care now either.

153
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,080
Earlier we checked

154
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,000
Ju Wenyi's,

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,880
Ju Yangsheng's,

156
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,520
and Ju Xingyun's

157
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,480
rooms.

158
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,480
What places did you check just now?

159
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,200
We just checked

160
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:30,920
Oh, right

161
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,600
We're looking at the crime scene

162
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
The crime scene is quite intense

163
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,440
This is our...

164
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,960
This...

165
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,720
We eat here

166
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,640
Right

167
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,600
This is the wife and Chenggong's bedroom

168
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,240
And over here is the crime scene

169
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,880
Which is...

170
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,840
The bathroom

171
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,560
And this spot...

172
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,200
Does everyone remember there was a...

173
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,240
Sink

174
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,960
Small sink

175
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,160
First, we found in the sink...

176
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,480
A green bottle

177
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,320
Yes

178
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,760
This green liquid

179
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,480
Is plant nutrient solution

180
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,040
Plant nutrient solution

181
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:13,840
What?

182
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,560
Plant nutrient solution

183
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,080
It was used to make grass grow in that flower bed

184
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,560
The one used to hide the "corpse"

185
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,080
They're connected

186
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,480
Right

187
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,960
Because they haven't discovered the "corpse" yet

188
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,000
Correct

189
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,160
The flowers on our table

190
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,520
Look

191
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,280
They're all fake

192
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,040
At the crime scene

193
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,800
There were many vases on that cabinet

194
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,440
And many plant nutrient solutions were placed there

195
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,840
But at every crime scene

196
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,800
The plant nutrient solutions all had labels

197
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,680
This one only has glue residue

198
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,080
It was torn off

199
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,520
Yes

200
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,240
And the plant nutrient solution label looks like this

201
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,920
This is the bottle found at the crime scene

202
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,680
And in the sink

203
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,560
We also found this

204
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,320
A poison called "Choke You"

205
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,480
This poison is colorless and odorless

206
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,560
When vaporized and inhaled

207
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,160
It can immediately cause "death"

208
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,040
The toxic gas dissipates after five seconds

209
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,360
Exactly

210
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,840
He inhaled it

211
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,800
This bottle at the crime scene

212
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,400
should have contained

213
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,880
this "Choke You" poison

214
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,600
Right

215
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,080
He was the one who changed the label

216
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,440
In the bathroom

217
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,240
we found a very ingenious

218
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,120
delayed-action device

219
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,320
First, on the butler's foot

220
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,480
there's a sticker

221
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,680
This sticker is called a "Push-Strong Demagnetizing Patch"

222
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,480
It's a patch that demagnetizes magnets

223
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,080
Does everyone remember

224
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
today beside the toilet

225
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,720
there was a cover

226
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,800
a flipped-up drain slot?

227
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,200
When he stepped on that slot

228
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,400
the slot would flip open

229
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,560
and remove the magnetic force

230
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,160
And why

231
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,640
would he trigger this foot device?

232
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,760
Because

233
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,280
that toilet has foot-sensor flushing

234
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,960
Foot-sensor flushing

235
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,320
So the moment he extends his foot

236
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,000
he would definitely extend that foot

237
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,600
Wait, in the bathroom

238
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,960
didn't we find in the flowerpot

239
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,640
that bottle of poison, right?

240
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:57,920
Right

241
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,800
I think it's very likely

242
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,280
that this thing

243
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,480
wasn't there

244
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,200
a string or something

245
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,280
that triggered a mechanism

246
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,320
and then made this fall down?

247
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,720
Meaning

248
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,120
everything was pre-arranged

249
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,280
As long as he used this toilet

250
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,240
he would "die"

251
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,400
But all the tools used in the crime

252
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,160
including the magnetic disk

253
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,200
were found in the river channel

254
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,960
So the strange thing is

255
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,800
how these crime tools

256
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,440
ended up here

257
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,680
I think

258
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,240
after we entered

259
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,520
someone took them out

260
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,440
Because the degaussing disk was needed to trigger the mechanism

261
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,600
So it could only have been taken

262
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,760
after the butler collapsed

263
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,360
Probably when we

264
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,240
were examining the "corpse"

265
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,200
they took it when we weren't paying attention

266
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,880
Exactly

267
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,039
Also at the crime scene

268
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,080
we found a phone

269
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,880
underneath the "victim"

270
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,480
The phone contained

271
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,880
information showing this family

272
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,480
had conducted background checks

273
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,200
on Guo Baoyou before meeting him

274
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,360
They discovered his profession

275
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,880
Because he recently became famous

276
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,160
and is now a top-tier

277
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,920
mystery writer

278
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,880
And then

279
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,560
Don't get too proud yet

280
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,800
The next photo is of him

281
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,040
This banquet hall we're dining in today

282
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,920
was specially renovated

283
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,680
for today's family recognition event

284
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,360
It's a prepared venue

285
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,920
And before the renovation was completed

286
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,160
Guo Baoyou

287
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,760
disguised himself as a decorator

288
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,400
and appeared at the renovation site

289
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,840
And one of the dates was June 14th.

290
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,480
That was three days ago.

291
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,960
You had already been to the crime scene.

292
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,880
Then let's begin the questioning now.

293
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,200
The person we want to question

294
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,080
I think we should first clear his suspicions

295
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,120
Only then can we trust what he says

296
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,280
Only then do I have the right to sit here

297
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,960
Yes, exactly

298
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,400
Take the seat of honor

299
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,040
Please have a seat.

300
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,440
This is the second time.

301
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,920
Interrogating me again, huh?

302
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,440
Our little group is too fragile.

303
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:52,880
First, you go ahead and speak.

304
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,400
You speak first.

305
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,640
Why did you visit the crime scene beforehand?

306
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,560
To be honest,

307
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,240
a week ago I saw someone

308
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,880
wearing this jade pendant

309
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,280
who passed by me quickly.

310
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,000
Then I contacted this Mr. He,

311
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,680
I said,

312
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,920
"Could you tell him

313
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,040
that I'm his son

314
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,560
and have him contact me?"

315
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,480
The next day,

316
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
he sent me a message,

317
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,120
and arranged to meet me today.

318
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,400
But,

319
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,080
I can't keep things to myself,

320
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,760
I kept wanting to see him in person -

321
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,880
what he's really like.

322
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,440
So I went there.

323
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I couldn't just barge in openly,

324
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,920
I wanted to stay hidden.

325
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,560
I thought,

326
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,360
I wanted to surprise him too.

327
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,240
I saw them setting things up at his place,

328
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,720
so I got myself

329
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,080
one of their staff uniforms.

330
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,600
I put it on

331
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,680
and went inside.

332
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,400
My hiding

333
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,680
was to avoid him directly.

334
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,920
That's how it was.

335
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,320
What did you see?

336
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,080
I saw my father

337
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,920
and the butler

338
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,520
having a heated argument.

339
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,880
"You must give me that 100,000 yuan.

340
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,840
If you don't,

341
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,040
I'll expose this family's

342
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,760
secrets to the public."

343
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,040
"How dare you say these things to me?

344
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,000
What good are these secrets to you?"

345
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,160
"I know your secrets,

346
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,000
and can ruin you anytime I want."

347
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,240
Then I became really curious about this butler

348
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,360
I was extremely curious

349
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,280
How could just a butler

350
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,760
dare to criticize the person who hired him?

351
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,000
Later, the butler returned to his room

352
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,040
I stood outside the butler's room

353
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,800
and eavesdropped

354
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,400
What did you hear?

355
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
Did you hear the recording

356
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,320
on my phone?

357
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,720
We heard it

358
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,320
Right, while listening

359
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
I turned on my phone's recorder

360
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,040
and recorded everything

361
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,360
He can forget about using my secrets to threaten me

362
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,960
After Guo Baoyou acknowledges his family ties

363
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,800
help me deal with him

364
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,640
I have many of his secrets in my hands

365
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,800
He wouldn't dare resist

366
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,560
As I kept listening

367
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
I sensed he was about to come out

368
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,120
So I quickly ran to the restroom across the way

369
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,680
And hid

370
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,600
So he is suspicious

371
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,200
He went to the restroom

372
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,280
He's been there

373
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,760
The crime scene

374
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,960
And remember what the butler said

375
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,360
After the family recognition was complete

376
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,480
He would "get rid of" his father

377
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,440
So to protect his father

378
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
He would "get rid of" the butler

379
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,080
Moreover, he was pretending

380
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,880
to be a renovation worker

381
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,680
so he could dispose of those things

382
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,440
directly into that pond

383
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:16,960
Exactly

384
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,000
We've got the "murder" motive

385
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,240
The timeline checks out

386
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,720
And the method too

387
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
Case solved

388
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,200
Let's wrap it up today

389
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,200
Vote

390
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,680
Let's go

391
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,760
Too hasty

392
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,120
Wait

393
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,640
Hold on

394
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,600
I can still "interrogate"

395
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,400
Let me finish

396
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,840
The recording you just heard

397
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,680
We heard it too

398
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,360
So what he recorded

399
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,200
is exactly what we just heard

400
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,720
the latter part of it

401
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,800
He can't possibly use my secret to threaten me

402
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,840
After Guo Baoyou acknowledges their relationship

403
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,320
It's the same

404
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,400
You'll help me deal with him

405
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,520
It doesn't matter, right?

406
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,560
I think we can close the case here

407
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
Because Ju Wenyi's phone

408
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,320
also has this recording

409
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,960
Exactly

410
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,000
It's basically identical

411
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,240
Do you have that...

412
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,040
Yes

413
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,800
Should we listen to it later?

414
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,480
Okay

415
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,040
Let's wait a while

416
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,000
Because it's not his clue

417
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,800
Alright

418
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,480
Good

419
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,160
Also

420
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,760
I found these in your home

421
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,440
(continuation of line 420)

422
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,000
From your childhood until now

423
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,120
letters your father kept writing to you

424
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,920
First of all, your father didn't

425
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,800
keep telling you in the letters

426
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,000
to stop looking for him

427
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,760
So this time

428
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,840
why was he so eager to see you?

429
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,120
Why didn't you have any doubts?

430
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,040
I was blinded by family affection

431
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,000
But to be honest

432
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,320
I did have some suspicions

433
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,520
Before, your father always

434
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,920
used this kind of stationery for letters

435
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,200
Then suddenly it changed to this

436
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,760
Why is that?

437
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,160
You'll have to ask my dad

438
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,440
It's not like I sent it to him

439
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,840
Something's fishy, definitely fishy

440
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,200
Do you think Gu Cheng Gong is your father?

441
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,280
Not really

442
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,400
About this jade pendant matter

443
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,800
It feels somewhat deliberate

444
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,920
That your necklace is part of a pair

445
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,760
Have you ever

446
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,680
For example, written about it in a novel

447
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Or shared it with others

448
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,320
Could anyone else possibly know about it?

449
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,280
Never shared it

450
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
I've already invited Teacher Ju Chenggong

451
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,120
successful person

452
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,160
Chenggong, hello

453
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,200
Well...

454
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,640
What's this about?

455
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,440
Just having a chat

456
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,240
You're my son

457
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,280
Now you're sitting here to "interrogate" me

458
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,320
This is outright treason, you know?

459
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,480
I think so too

460
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,680
May lightning strike him dead

461
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,480
Give me that "Thunderstorm" drama vibe

462
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,000
You really are...

463
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,400
This is it

464
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,720
It's not me who wants to "interrogate" you

465
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,240
It's him

466
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,880
Big Brother

467
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,120
Big Brother

468
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,760
You're not that much older than me

469
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,520
Uncle, bring out the table first

470
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,480
So there's no escape for me, right?

471
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,680
No way to fly away

472
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,520
Let's have a talk

473
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,040
Have a talk

474
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,400
First of all

475
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,240
We found in your room

476
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,560
your cellphone

477
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,000
You're peddling success theories

478
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,760
It's selling

479
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,200
Selling

480
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,680
Watch your wording

481
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,640
Okay

482
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,800
Selling

483
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,120
You're someone who sells success theories

484
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,760
An expert, right?

485
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,160
Yes

486
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,840
But your course costs just 9.9 yuan

487
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,240
Are you really successful?

488
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,560
Because I need to appeal to the masses

489
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,280
Our ordinary folks

490
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,720
Not all of you

491
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,840
can afford hundreds of thousands

492
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,360
When common people want success

493
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,200
Shouldn't they get an affordable price?

494
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,120
After paying you

495
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,440
I feel like you're the successful one

496
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,000
Many a little makes a mickle

497
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,080
Have you ever had cases where

498
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,960
peddling your success theories

499
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,680
these things

500
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,920
selling

501
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,320
Don't make me correct you a third time

502
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Okay, selling success experience

503
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,720
Were there people who didn't succeed?

504
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,960
How foolish of you to ask that question

505
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,840
You and your sister ask questions

506
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,160
in remarkably similar ways

507
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,960
Teacher

508
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,120
Teacher, I'd like to ask you something

509
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,640
About this success philosophy you're selling

510
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,360
Has it ever "killed" anyone?

511
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,240
Uncle, did you have a childhood friend

512
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,680
named Li Faxiao?

513
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,880
Does such a person exist?

514
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,480
He always wanted to sing

515
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,400
I did indeed have a childhood friend

516
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,360
He was one of my success philosophy

517
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,640
most devoted followers

518
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,080
He spent a lot of money

519
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,520
And then

520
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,320
he had an accident

521
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,760
This matter

522
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,840
fills me with deep remorse

523
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm very sad

524
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,160
No one is bothering you about this

525
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,480
Alright

526
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,720
Then I'll quickly move past this pain

527
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,440
Did you borrow money for him?

528
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,599
A hundred thousand yuan

529
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,440
Yes

530
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,880
You've also done this homework

531
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,359
Pretty good

532
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,760
Indeed

533
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,560
He spent a lot on my success course

534
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,520
Invested a significant amount

535
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,520
Then his mother fell ill

536
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,720
I assume you already know

537
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,000
He wanted to use that 100,000 yuan

538
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,480
To treat his mother

539
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,359
That made me feel even more ashamed

540
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,760
Because I thought since he's my childhood friend

541
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,160
I wanted to return the money to him

542
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,080
Why did you ask your butler for money?

543
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,560
Because my money

544
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,160
Is all kept with the butler

545
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,240
Wait, hold on

546
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,640
You and the butler are married, right?

547
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,760
Your mother is my wife

548
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,200
That feels like an insult

549
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,640
But I can't even argue back

550
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,560
And when you demanded money from the butler

551
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,400
You said

552
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,440
"100,000 yuan"

553
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,960
"You must give it to me immediately"

554
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,440
"This is what I rightfully deserve"

555
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,320
"None of us are good people here"

556
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,120
"At worst"

557
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,280
"It'll be mutual destruction"

558
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,760
Then immediately

559
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,120
The butler said

560
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,040
"I advise you"

561
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,360
"To behave properly"

562
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,880
"And prepare for the family reunion"

563
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,200
"Unless I 'die'"

564
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,360
"Don't even think about getting"

565
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,200
"A single cent from me"

566
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,600
So what's your relationship exactly?

567
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,280
Why does it seem like he's your boss?

568
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,960
Here we go again

569
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,280
The butler is pitiful

570
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,160
He started with nothing too

571
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,360
It was because I helped him

572
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,520
Then I thought

573
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,920
"You can be my butler"

574
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,880
"I'll let you manage all my money"

575
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,680
But over time

576
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,520
he started thinking the money was his

577
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,480
In his mind

578
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,520
he truly became the master of this household

579
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,040
Now he wants to take

580
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,080
all these assets for himself

581
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,960
Actually, your relationship with this butler

582
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,680
up until now

583
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,560
you still haven't told the truth

584
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,160
Are you and your wife really married?

585
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,280
Of course we're really married.

586
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,560
Your wife...

587
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,800
Why does she have...

588
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,000
a cheat sheet next to her livestream?

589
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,840
It lists everyone's birthdays,

590
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,760
names, relationships, and birthdays.

591
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,960
Can your wife not remember these?

592
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,160
That's an excellent question.

593
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,760
You should ask my wife.

594
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,160
How would I know?

595
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,320
You don't know about your own wife?

596
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,560
He can't make up an answer.

597
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,040
No, this isn't made up.

598
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,120
Do you know everything

599
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,720
about your wife?

600
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,560
I don't have a wife yet.

601
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,040
Right, you couldn't possibly have one.

602
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,520
Why?

603
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,800
Because you don't understand women at all.

604
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,920
I need to give people some space.

605
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,200
Fine, let me ask you another question.

606
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,760
Gu Yangsheng,

607
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,360
your father,

608
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,240
when is his birthday?

609
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,040
You wouldn't happen to not know

610
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,800
your own father's birthday, would you?

611
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,160
Alright, now let me ask you:

612
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,640
Do you remember

613
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,280
your grandfather's birthday?

614
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,720
My grandfather...

615
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,680
Yes.

616
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,440
You don't even remember that,

617
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,720
yet you're asking me?

618
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,600
Then let me ask you this:

619
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,680
In the past ten-plus years,

620
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,760
what did the stationery look like

621
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,840
that you used to write letters to your son?

622
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,160
Think about it

623
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,800
She just said it's been over ten years

624
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,680
Can you still remember the stationery?

625
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,520
The stationery was the same every year

626
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,680
Every year's stationery

627
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,200
Was it exactly the same?

628
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,000
Look

629
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,400
From what you're saying now

630
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,080
I can sense

631
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,200
that the stationery was different

632
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,600
So was it the same or different?

633
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,280
Of course it was different

634
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,520
Different

635
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,440
Right, sometimes it said "son"

636
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,400
Other times "my son"

637
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,360
Of course it was different

638
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,240
Don't talk nonsense

639
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,400
No, when I was little

640
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,880
My dad loved singing with me

641
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,200
Right

642
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,560
Yes

643
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,120
Can you sing it for me?

644
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,800
I remember teaching you

645
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,560
Do you remember the melody?

646
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,160
To prove your love for me still exists

647
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,520
Even if you just hum one line

648
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,120
Or two lines

649
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,640
Let me sing one line first

650
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,600
See if you can continue

651
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,440
Walking on the small road of Tuishi

652
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,080
Tuishi

653
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,160
Tuishi

654
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,000
We're from Tuishi

655
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,960
We are Tuishi

656
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,560
We are Tuishi people

657
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,400
We're so particular

658
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,240
On the small road of Tuishi

659
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,560
Do you remember?

660
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,360
What's the second line?

661
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,280
Carrying Tang Sanzang

662
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,640
No

663
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,800
And his three disciples

664
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,080
No

665
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,080
You can sing half a line again

666
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,520
Sing half a line again

667
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,760
Then I'll remember immediately

668
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,560
It's different now.

669
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,720
He's my uncle.

670
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,320
Alright.

671
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,520
We've reached a conclusion about this matter.

672
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,680
He's definitely not his real father.

673
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,760
He's being controlled.

674
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,320
Because in the butler's case,

675
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,080
he spoke to him very forcefully,

676
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,160
"You prepare for the family reunion first."

677
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,800
Meaning "I'm ordering you to do this."

678
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,120
Exactly.

679
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,640
At most, he's just an actor.

680
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,280
Confess and you'll get leniency.

681
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,680
Right.

682
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,920
Fine, ask whatever you want.

683
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,760
I won't answer anymore.

684
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,200
I won't commit any more crimes here.

685
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,560
What do you do?

686
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm just asking you,

687
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,480
I...

688
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,240
work as a driver

689
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,240
for the Success Guru.

690
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,680
I'm not your father.

691
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,520
You see?

692
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,640
Then where did you get this jade pendant?

693
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,880
This pendant...

694
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,520
was given to me by your mother.

695
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,240
That is, Mrs. Ju gave it to me.

696
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,200
We're not actually married either.

697
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,000
Success...

698
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,160
When I first saw this necklace,

699
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,880
I thought it suited you perfectly.

700
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,440
This necklace looks very valuable.

701
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,960
I think it matches my status perfectly.

702
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,880
I'll treasure it.

703
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Why did she give you the jade pendant?

704
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,280
She thought it would highlight my status

705
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,200
and help sell more success courses.

706
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,040
Because this pendant is quite valuable too.

707
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,520
Okay.

708
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,720
So you and his mother aren't really married?

709
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,160
Then what's your relationship?

710
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,040
We...

711
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,120
don't know each other.

712
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Don't know each other.

713
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,240
Our family was temporarily assembled.

714
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,800
We were just trying to make some money.

715
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,280
Then who's your boss?

716
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,000
The butler.

717
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,840
He's my boss.

718
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,000
All my money goes to him

719
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,280
Our livestream earnings go to him too

720
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,880
But

721
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,600
I didn't "kill" that person

722
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,440
I don't know

723
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,360
Did the butler tell you

724
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,880
about acknowledging him as my son?

725
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,440
Yes

726
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,160
That's why we're having this recognition ceremony today

727
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,480
Because he's a wildly popular

728
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,160
online novelist

729
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,880
So

730
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,160
I want to acknowledge him as my son

731
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,040
It will greatly boost my popularity

732
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,960
That's why I took the initiative

733
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,720
to propose this recognition ceremony

734
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,600
So do you know

735
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,120
who his real father is?

736
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,480
I don't know

737
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,760
So you're just here to make money

738
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,240
Right?

739
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,600
Yes, I'm just here for the money

740
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,280
When do you plan to leave here?

741
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,200
Or will you just

742
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,520
I want to earn enough money first

743
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,280
How much is enough?

744
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,280
What do you think

745
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,600
how much money would satisfy a person?

746
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,240
Forget it, you're broke.

747
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,200
How pathetic am I?

748
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,600
Poor,

749
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,240
and destined to be forever alone.

750
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,200
Any other questions?

751
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,080
I have one question.

752
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,840
Do you know that pretending to be successful

753
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,240
and selling,

754
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,600
your so-called success theories,

755
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,560
counts as false advertising?

756
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,600
Yes.

757
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,000
I admit it's false advertising.

758
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I owe all consumers an apology.

759
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,840
I apologize to them.

760
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,440
Apologies are useless.

761
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,400
Can you issue refunds?

762
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:37,920
Right.

763
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,280
Because all my money now

764
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,240
is with the butler.

765
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,800
Once I get the money,

766
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,680
I'll refund them.

767
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,960
The butler is "dead."

768
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,680
Who would most likely get that money?

769
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,360
Is there any chance

770
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,680
you'd take his position?

771
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,240
I didn't.

772
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,680
Think about it,

773
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,880
someone as simple as me,

774
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,880
answering whatever you ask.

775
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,280
Just watch the first half of the video.

776
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,480
What do you mean "answering whatever we ask"?

777
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,400
Please watch the video.

778
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,640
I wanted to ask you

779
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,920
have you seen these things before?

780
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,640
The green one

781
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,040
is our plant nutrient solution

782
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,200
It's all on the bathroom cabinet

783
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,680
This one is also on the bathroom cabinet

784
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,600
Not sure about that one

785
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,240
Haven't seen this before

786
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,600
Right

787
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,840
Come

788
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,760
Mrs. Ju

789
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,640
This way, please

790
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,720
Hello, madam

791
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,200
Hello

792
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,640
Let's begin

793
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,680
Hurry up with the questions, I need to use the restroom

794
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,160
Nervous—that means you're nervous

795
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,680
You're nervous

796
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,360
Mrs. Bai

797
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,440
Mrs. Bai

798
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,360
All Mrs. Bai

799
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:08,840
Okay

800
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,880
Yes, because in her phone

801
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,480
there are many

802
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,320
photoshopped pictures of her with Bai Sanwan

803
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,040
And she's...

804
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,360
She has a crush on Brother Bai

805
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,200
Also, the password on her bedside drawer

806
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,000
is "Mrs. Bai" (BTT)

807
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,480
Explain this

808
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,320
Explain what?

809
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,320
Explain these photos

810
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,560
I like you

811
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,040
Let me see the photos

812
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,360
Let's take a look at the photos

813
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,400
So blunt

814
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,840
So you do know her

815
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
I don't know

816
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,800
He's handsome

817
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,200
Makes delicious noodles

818
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,000
And he's very cultured

819
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,720
Gentle and kind-hearted

820
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,560
Yes, you might have some misunderstanding about me

821
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,600
I am...

822
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,480
No, in my heart

823
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,360
You're exactly like that

824
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,280
Why do you have his family's...

825
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,960
that jade pendant?

826
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,960
That's not mine

827
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,160
They've already confessed

828
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,080
Said you gave it to them

829
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,240
I did give it

830
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,200
But it wasn't mine

831
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,880
Then where did you get it from?

832
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,040
The butler gave it to me.

833
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,840
The butler gave it to you?

834
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,520
Yes.

835
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,920
He told me it was his jade pendant.

836
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,320
Then he asked me to give it to Joo Seong-gong to wear.

837
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:18,920
This...

838
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,400
Give it to Joo Seong-gong to wear.

839
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:22,880
Why?

840
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,600
Because this represents...

841
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,800
social status and wealth.

842
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,520
His live-streaming classes...

843
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,280
will sell better.

844
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,280
Alright.

845
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,080
After he wears it...

846
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,720
he'll appear to be of noble status.

847
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,680
This way when selling products...

848
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,360
people will trust him more.

849
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,400
The butler is my father.

850
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,800
Yes.

851
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,000
So your biological father has already "died"...

852
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,400
and is gone.

853
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,720
My dad

854
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,160
What is this?

855
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,080
What kind of thing is this?

856
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,160
This...

857
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,320
This has nothing to do with you.

858
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,920
Then you have to tell me what this is.

859
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,480
I can't talk about this.

860
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,160
It's related to an experience of mine

861
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,680
that I can't discuss.

862
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,440
One more crucial question

863
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,600
What is this photo?

864
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,200
Don't you think he looks familiar?

865
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,680
The left eye is you

866
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,880
The right eye is

867
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,320
your boss

868
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,440
your boss

869
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,240
Yes, exactly, the butler

870
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,880
Is this your child together?

871
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
This is also digitally composited by me

872
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,720
Digitally composited, right?

873
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,280
Then why

874
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,480
is the other eye your boss?

875
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,680
Yes

876
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Her relationship with her boss

877
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,280
might be unusual

878
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,480
He

879
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
is actually my husband

880
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,480
He's your real husband?

881
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:51,920
Yes

882
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,160
Then what you wrote

883
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,240
I'm sorry, it's all his fault

884
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,400
Mom couldn't protect you

885
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,120
That was my...

886
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,440
It's like this

887
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,640
I was pregnant before

888
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,840
I was supposed to have a normal pregnancy

889
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,680
I was so happy

890
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,520
because it's hard for me to conceive

891
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,000
But then my boss

892
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,320
ignored the fact that I was pregnant

893
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,920
and made me livestream for over ten hours every day

894
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,960
And then I had a miscarriage

895
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,000
Since childhood, I've always lacked love.

896
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,640
Then he appeared - a mature man.

897
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,440
He gave me so much care.

898
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,160
So I fell in love.

899
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,560
After falling in love,

900
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,440
our life together

901
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,000
wasn't actually that great.

902
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,880
Then four years ago he thought

903
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,160
live streaming could make money.

904
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,640
He said "Let's do live streaming."

905
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,400
But as we kept at it,

906
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,680
there wasn't much progress.

907
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,240
Then a year and a half ago,

908
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,960
he said:

909
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,680
"I have an idea.

910
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,480
Let's create a

911
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,640
perfect family persona.

912
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,400
People will believe it

913
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,800
and we can sell more."

914
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,120
So we renovated this house

915
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,000
and started performing

916
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,800
as a happy family here.

917
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,920
Mainly just to sell products.

918
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,560
But only me, Joo Seong-gong,

919
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,400
and Joo Haeng-un

920
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,240
the three of us sold well.

921
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,640
The others weren't as good.

922
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,120
They seemed a bit dim-witted.

923
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,040
Yes, really dim-witted.

924
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,640
During all these years,

925
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,800
in all this time,

926
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,240
did he ever mention his past life

927
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,440
or whether he had children?

928
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:09,760
No.

929
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,520
He always told me this was his first marriage.

930
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,280
But suddenly his grown son appeared.

931
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,080
I felt...

932
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,440
somewhat...

933
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,120
mixed emotions.

934
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,480
Right, speaking of which,

935
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,200
I always thought

936
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,040
I couldn't get pregnant

937
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,440
because of some health issue.

938
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,960
But tests showed nothing wrong.

939
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,440
Then one day I discovered

940
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,680
the housekeeper had been secretly

941
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,440
giving me birth control pills.

942
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,360
But I didn't know.

943
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,320
It must be because he has a grown son

944
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,760
You know

945
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,160
He's got this grown son here

946
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,480
He already has his own son

947
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:37,960
Right

948
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,360
So this jade pendant of his

949
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,400
was only given to you recently

950
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,280
It was given to you just to lure him here

951
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,600
He gave it to me seven days ago

952
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,160
I have a question

953
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,280
You and the butler

954
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,600
You said you're married

955
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,040
Are you legally married?

956
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,600
Or...

957
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,640
Legally registered marriage

958
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,120
So only you two have

959
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,080
a marital relationship

960
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,880
that's legally recognized

961
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,760
So if the butler

962
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,600
were to "pass away"

963
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,720
According to

964
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,640
the first-order heir

965
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,440
in terms of inheritance

966
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,360
only you could inherit this estate

967
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,240
Have you ever thought

968
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,280
that you could make him

969
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,280
disappear

970
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,440
Wouldn't you then

971
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,640
inherit the estate?

972
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,120
Yes, you're the primary heir

973
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,240
Are you asking if I resent him?

974
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,760
Of course I do

975
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,640
I lost my child

976
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,480
But between us

977
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,760
I'm his wife

978
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
We earn money

979
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,840
Doesn't it all come to the same?

980
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,760
Think about it

981
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,320
Then

982
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,480
You and your die-hard fan

983
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,760
had a chat log

984
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,880
where they messaged you saying

985
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
"You scammer

986
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,320
I bought the products you recommended

987
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,160
and followed your advice

988
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,880
But my husband Li Faxiao not only failed

989
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,560
but also 'died suddenly' from excessive stress

990
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,000
Those things you sold

991
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,640
I've checked them too

992
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,480
They're worthless

993
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,800
I'm going to report you"

994
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,440
You replied

995
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,280
"Facing such a situation

996
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,200
I'm truly sorry

997
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,360
Are you free tonight?

998
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,640
You can come to my place

999
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,600
I'll help you

1000
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,200
Trust me"

1001
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,600
"Okay, I'll arrive before you finish streaming"

1002
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,240
"The door's unlocked"

1003
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,000
"I'm coming in"

1004
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
"Waiting for you in the living room"

1005
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,640
This was on June 10th

1006
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,840
Did you two meet?

1007
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,480
No, we didn't

1008
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,840
When the agreed time came that day,

1009
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,000
I went to the living room to look for her.

1010
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I searched around,

1011
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,040
but found she wasn't there.

1012
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,960
Then I thought she had stood me up.

1013
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,800
I was quite angry about it.

1014
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,320
Didn't you send her a message or anything?

1015
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,280
No, after I didn't see her,

1016
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,440
I didn't send her any messages.

1017
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,080
You're selling these counterfeit products yourself

1018
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,640
Doesn't it hurt your conscience?

1019
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,160
I didn't know they were fake products

1020
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,440
My husband told me

1021
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:19,880
they were genuine

1022
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,920
You can't even tell real from fake?

1023
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,800
I found out through that fan

1024
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,560
I realized my husband was lying to me

1025
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,960
The clues we have

1026
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,120
can be connected

1027
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,480
Because this fan is already "dead"

1028
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,080
Really

1029
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,960
We found her "body"

1030
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,640
In those fake flowers in front of our dining table

1031
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,120
Among that pile of flowers

1032
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,400
There's a body buried in the flower bed

1033
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,480
So when your fan came to your house

1034
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,720
Is it possible your husband

1035
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,280
"killed" her?

1036
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,600
Wait a minute

1037
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,560
Because this fan

1038
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,280
in your live stream

1039
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,640
said you were selling fake goods

1040
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,000
And then you...

1041
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,920
No, you just said

1042
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,000
my husband "killed" her

1043
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,400
Yes

1044
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,680
I don't know

1045
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,160
I had no idea

1046
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,760
About you inviting her

1047
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,720
Did you tell anyone?

1048
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:03,840
No

1049
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,240
Madam, those bottles up ahead

1050
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,880
Do you know

1051
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,640
Yes

1052
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640
Have you seen these bottles before?

1053
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:18,720
No

1054
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,360
Uncle

1055
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,920
Should I call you Uncle

1056
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,600
or should I call you

1057
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,840
What's your real name?

1058
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,160
It's Ju Wenyi

1059
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,040
No, I'm not asking for your stage name

1060
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,360
What stage name?

1061
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,560
It's really Ju Wenyi

1062
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,600
Everything's already been revealed

1063
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,440
No point hiding anymore

1064
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,600
The others have already confessed

1065
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,040
You're not really family, right?

1066
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,000
You're just here

1067
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,200
to make money from livestreaming

1068
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,120
Don't try to trick me

1069
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,920
I also want to know who the "killer" is

1070
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,239
Right?

1071
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:13,679
Yes

1072
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,320
Then let's ask you a few things

1073
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,360
Because we found three messages

1074
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,080
on a phone

1075
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,320
First, you quit your job

1076
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,960
saying you're becoming a streamer

1077
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,120
making 500,000 a day

1078
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,480
Second,

1079
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,760
you broke up with your girlfriend

1080
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,120
And third,

1081
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,840
your biological father messaged you

1082
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,639
saying you'd call someone else dad

1083
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,560
just to sell products

1084
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,639
"Stop calling me dad"

1085
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,840
These are all your doing, right?

1086
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,639
Isn't this just

1087
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,520
a little joke between father and son?

1088
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,400
You've been blocked,

1089
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,800
and there's also

1090
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,600
a recording in your phone.

1091
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,000
Where did you get this recording?

1092
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,360
I secretly recorded it.

1093
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,080
Who was the butler talking to in the recording?

1094
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,960
I don't know that.

1095
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,199
He was on the phone with someone.

1096
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,800
I've already forged

1097
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,640
Ju Wenyi's overseas travel documents.

1098
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,800
Want him to leave with dignity.

1099
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,160
This Ju Wenyi,

1100
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,560
with such poor sales performance,

1101
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,680
still stubbornly refuses to leave.

1102
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,600
Keeps refusing to go away,

1103
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,800
and wants to fight me to the death.

1104
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,000
He can forget about using my secrets to threaten me.

1105
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,600
After Guo Baoyou acknowledges his kinship,

1106
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,480
help me deal with him.

1107
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,480
I have many of his secrets,

1108
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,880
so he won't dare resist.

1109
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,800
Why did he fake his identity?

1110
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,760
send you abroad

1111
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,600
Just because my performance was at the bottom

1112
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:29,840
couldn't sell anything

1113
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,960
Your performance was at the bottom

1114
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,440
so they gave you

1115
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,160
sent you abroad

1116
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,080
for better opportunities

1117
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,840
Is that what it means?

1118
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,080
Going international

1119
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,680
To be at the bottom internationally?

1120
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,960
Going abroad was actually a pretense

1121
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
It was an excuse for the fans

1122
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,640
Just say you left

1123
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,800
Right, just say I left

1124
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,200
Then they wanted to fire me

1125
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,200
Mainly because Guo Baoyou was coming

1126
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,480
and wanted to replace me

1127
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,880
They tricked you into joining

1128
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,920
So they'd have one more

1129
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,000
culture-focused streamer

1130
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,640
to promote products for him

1131
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,120
Plus you have the audience

1132
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,200
And of course

1133
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,480
my position isn't easily replaced

1134
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,000
right?

1135
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,600
You're at the bottom yet hard to replace?

1136
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,400
Exactly

1137
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,720
He's cultured

1138
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,240
Right, I'm a cultured person

1139
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,280
The recording here says

1140
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,400
You know one of his secrets

1141
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,600
So what's the butler's secret?

1142
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,000
It's our family's secret

1143
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
No

1144
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,240
Your family's secret

1145
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,120
So many people know about it

1146
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,280
Why didn't he send them abroad?

1147
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,360
You know he's going to deal with you

1148
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,040
Why aren't you leaving?

1149
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,000
Aren't you afraid?

1150
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,520
I want to take a gamble, right?

1151
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,040
What if my performance recovers?

1152
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,760
What's your split ratio with the butler?

1153
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,160
It was quite reasonable at first

1154
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,040
But later it became increasingly unfair

1155
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,640
Until it became

1156
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,560
Nine to one

1157
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,080
Who gets nine?

1158
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,480
Do I look like the one getting nine?

1159
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,280
He said he has an even bigger secret about you

1160
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,840
What is it?

1161
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,920
Actually

1162
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,280
In that recording just now

1163
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,000
That secret

1164
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,320
Is related to the pendant

1165
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,040
The pendant?

1166
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,560
This jade pendant was given to me by your mother

1167
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,080
I did give it

1168
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,240
But it wasn't mine

1169
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,080
The butler gave it to me

1170
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,320
What? What's the connection?

1171
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,080
Tell me about this white pendant

1172
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,520
I'm listening

1173
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,680
Because that pendant is mine

1174
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,600
I am your real father.

1175
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,480
I knew it

1176
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,720
Really?

1177
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,560
What the heck

1178
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,440
Seriously?

1179
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,000
I think

1180
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,600
He just wants you to call him "Dad" one more time

1181
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,960
He's just trying to take advantage of you

1182
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,480
Song Piaoliang, I think you're right

1183
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,560
But why do you have that jade pendant

1184
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,040
There's a "corpse" inside the dining table

1185
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,120
Did you know about this?

1186
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,680
Because we found on that woman's face

1187
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,360
her feet

1188
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,160
and arms

1189
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,520
traces of the ink you sold

1190
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,320
So what's the deal with this person?

1191
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,000
Explain it to me.

1192
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
I...

1193
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,000
Since you've already found out...

1194
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,720
I told you so.

1195
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,040
Right?

1196
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,480
That day was...

1197
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,320
June 10th.

1198
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,240
I was selling my ink in the livestream.

1199
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,320
Dear friends and family,

1200
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,760
you must cherish this opportunity.

1201
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,240
Because we don't have much stock left.

1202
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,600
Hurry up!

1203
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,040
Just as I was about to post the purchase link,

1204
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,040
the butler sent me a message.

1205
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,000
He asked me to come to his office.

1206
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,960
Then I accidentally...

1207
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,200
spilled it on my hand.

1208
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,840
Yes.

1209
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,200
This is it.

1210
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,600
Yes, this is the ink you were selling.

1211
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,920
When I got to the butler's office,

1212
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,560
he said,

1213
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,800
"I've given you a month's chance,"

1214
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,640
"but you're still at the bottom of performance."

1215
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,520
"I have to fire you."

1216
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,240
"I'll tell your fans"

1217
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,080
"that you went abroad to study."

1218
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,600
No, butler...

1219
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,480
Give me another chance.

1220
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,000
No, butler...

1221
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,520
No.

1222
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,160
Just once.

1223
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,920
No.

1224
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,600
I can't either

1225
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,280
Let me tell you

1226
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,040
If you don't let me stay here

1227
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,160
I'll expose that this family is fake

1228
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,280
I'll tell everyone

1229
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,520
No one gets to live

1230
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,080
At worst, it's mutual destruction

1231
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,160
While we were talking

1232
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,520
We noticed a woman at the door

1233
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,600
Eavesdropping on our conversation

1234
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,200
So I chased after her

1235
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,000
Because if she spreads the word

1236
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,920
We won't be able to livestream anymore

1237
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:22,640
Don't run

1238
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,880
When I caught up to her

1239
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,680
She was too panicked

1240
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,640
She struggled too violently

1241
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,360
I swung my arm

1242
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,040
And she fell down the stairs

1243
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,400
I didn't expect it to be such bad luck

1244
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,520
and just "die" from the fall

1245
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,200
So it was you who "killed" her

1246
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,920
Then the butler arrived

1247
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,720
Accusing me of "killing" someone

1248
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,680
What should we do?

1249
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,280
Let's go

1250
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,080
I suggested turning myself in

1251
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,800
The butler said I couldn't

1252
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,440
If you go

1253
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,960
Our secret will be exposed

1254
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,240
So he said

1255
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
Let's hide this "corpse"

1256
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,120
and conceal it

1257
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,600
The butler and I went out to prepare

1258
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,240
When we returned

1259
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,960
Just as I was about to move the "body"

1260
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,880
I noticed something

1261
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,840
Beside the "corpse"

1262
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,400
there was a pendant

1263
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,320
You found the pendant

1264
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,640
next to the "corpse"

1265
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,720
By the "corpse"

1266
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,280
The pendant

1267
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,400
Near the "body"

1268
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,200
This pendant

1269
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,840
Are you sure it belonged to that woman?

1270
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,920
Not the butler's?

1271
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,280
Yes

1272
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,720
It fell from that girl

1273
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,960
I picked it up

1274
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,840
But he snatched it away

1275
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,520
This item

1276
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,160
Looks obviously valuable

1277
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,320
It's a symbol of wealth

1278
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,240
Here

1279
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,640
So your mother is actually

1280
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,400
Li Faxiao's wife

1281
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
My father is Li Faxiao

1282
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,920
The idea of hiding the "body"

1283
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,640
was his suggestion

1284
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,760
Hiding it outside wasn't safe

1285
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,400
Only the flower bed in the banquet hall

1286
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,400
was the safest place

1287
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,000
So this woman

1288
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,120
was actually "killed" by you

1289
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,360
It was "manslaughter"

1290
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,560
Understand? Manslaughter is still a crime

1291
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,760
After he "killed" the butler

1292
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,320
no one would know he'd "killed" anyone

1293
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,920
So this is the real reason you don't want

1294
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,560
to leave this apartment, right?

1295
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:22,920
No

1296
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,120
When I wanted to act

1297
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,280
he was already "dead"

1298
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,880
But from what we can see now

1299
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,120
his motive

1300
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,000
makes him the prime suspect

1301
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,440
Please have a seat.

1302
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,880
Let's start with the issues we've uncovered.

1303
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,200
Alright.

1304
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,000
Okay.

1305
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,800
Why do you have

1306
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,240
a master key that can open

1307
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
all the Ju family's doors?

1308
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,240
That key card isn't mine.

1309
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,600
That key card belongs to the butler.

1310
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,280
Then why was it in your possession?

1311
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,880
Right.

1312
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,040
He looks exactly like that TV station's

1313
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,960
frontline reporter

1314
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,160
with poor signal reception over there

1315
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,560
After saying that

1316
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,240
Yes

1317
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,400
That card isn't on me

1318
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,200
You didn't take

1319
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,280
the room key from me

1320
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,760
In your room

1321
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,960
I know there's a box

1322
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,440
but I don't know

1323
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,720
where exactly the room key is

1324
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,440
It's in the box

1325
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,800
I only know that box belongs to the butler

1326
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,320
Who gave you that box?

1327
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,360
I took it from him

1328
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,240
When you were live streaming

1329
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,560
you discovered a "dead body"

1330
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,280
Do you remember?

1331
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,440
Hey, Uncle

1332
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,960
Where are you going?

1333
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,720
Look, it keeps coming and going

1334
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,640
This is hard to "interrogate" now

1335
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,760
It just keeps coming in waves

1336
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,640
Still completely deaf

1337
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,520
That's enough

1338
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,040
Okay, that's fine

1339
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,880
Let's get to the point

1340
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,720
During your live stream

1341
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,440
you found a "female corpse" on the ground

1342
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,360
What's going on?

1343
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,320
Does this have anything to do with you?

1344
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,640
No, nothing to do with me

1345
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,480
I was the one who found it

1346
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,560
Wait, how did he find it?

1347
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,440
"Female corpse"

1348
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,160
He was live streaming

1349
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,240
Take a look

1350
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,320
Who is this?

1351
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,000
This is...

1352
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,480
This is a "dead person"

1353
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,800
Who brought this person

1354
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,200
here?

1355
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,120
Then he didn't see Wenyi and the others?

1356
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,240
No, he didn't

1357
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,240
They went out

1358
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,040
The "corpse" was placed here

1359
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,960
and he happened to see it

1360
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,760
You didn't even try to control her

1361
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,720
Nor did you call the police

1362
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:38,920
About this matter...

1363
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,320
Because I came here

1364
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,400
and there are some secrets I can't reveal

1365
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,840
So I couldn't disrupt the situation

1366
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,760
Wenyi

1367
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,840
told us to keep an eye on you

1368
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,240
He said you've been to prison before

1369
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,280
That must be your secret, right?

1370
00:43:59,160 --> 00:43:59,840
Yes

1371
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,320
Before, I served time in prison

1372
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,000
I had some involvement with Ju Xiangying

1373
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,120
Ju who?

1374
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,480
Ju Xiangying

1375
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,080
Who is Ju Xiangying?

1376
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,120
And who is Ju Xiangying again?

1377
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,120
He's the butler who "died"

1378
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,760
His name was Ju Xiangying

1379
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,240
Yes, he was called Butler Ying

1380
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,200
Eighteen years ago

1381
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,600
I was originally a designer

1382
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,080
Ju Xiangying collaborated with me

1383
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,320
to develop a new technological product

1384
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,040
But to cut corners

1385
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,760
he altered a material formula

1386
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,920
which resulted in one user

1387
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,280
a high school student

1388
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,440
becoming quadriplegic

1389
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,240
Then because I was the designer

1390
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,560
I was imprisoned

1391
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,000
You took the blame

1392
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,600
Yes, I was actually wrongfully imprisoned

1393
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,400
Because it was him

1394
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,560
who framed me

1395
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,160
I was in prison for seventeen years

1396
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,880
and just got released

1397
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,000
Now I want to get close to this butler

1398
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,440
and then

1399
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,440
"finish him off"

1400
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:05,880
No

1401
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,880
I want to find

1402
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,840
the evidence of how he framed me back then

1403
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,640
to clear my name

1404
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,920
So you're actually not that old

1405
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,280
Right, I'm actually only in my forties

1406
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,400
You're pretending to be elderly

1407
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,160
selling health supplements

1408
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,320
Yes, they recruited me

1409
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:25,920
Then we needed to

1410
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,560
appear like a harmonious family

1411
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,160
so we needed an old man to play grandpa

1412
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,960
But he sent you to prison

1413
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,600
Why would he recruit you again

1414
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,360
to be near him?

1415
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,920
How could he allow

1416
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,080
a time bomb like you

1417
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,920
to be near him?

1418
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,080
He didn't recognize me

1419
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,400
It's been over ten years

1420
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,680
You've changed dramatically in these years

1421
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,120
Right

1422
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,480
When you saw the "corpse"

1423
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,920
did you lose anything?

1424
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,560
Yes

1425
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,840
A jade pendant for recognizing my son

1426
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,720
was left there

1427
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,000
I can't talk anymore

1428
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,640
Someone's coming

1429
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,360
Then I found out it was taken by Ju Chenggong

1430
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,160
and taken away

1431
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,000
You and your son

1432
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,440
As for me

1433
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,840
Are we allowed to write letters in prison?

1434
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:17,520
Yes

1435
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,520
We are allowed to write letters

1436
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,120
So I've been writing
Translation
to my son

1437
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,080
a greeting card

1438
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:21,480
Right

1439
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,840
This is so far

1440
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,800
the closest one

1441
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,720
The closest

1442
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,560
Because in my song

1443
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,560
the first line of the last four sentences is

1444
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,600
"Father Guo is the leader in the design field"

1445
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,240
Is there any change in your letter this year?

1446
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,680
There is a change in the letter

1447
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,320
Because after I was released from prison

1448
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,080
my circumstances improved

1449
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,240
Every year you write
Translation
to your son

1450
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,880
one sentence in the letter

1451
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,880
What is that sentence?

1452
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,640
That's

1453
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,960
Don't look for Dad

1454
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,800
Why don't you want your son to look for his dad?

1455
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,880
Because Dad is in prison

1456
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,280
So you're my real father

1457
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,480
He really is your dad

1458
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,960
This is even worse than that

1459
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,560
Then what's your real name?

1460
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,040
It's Guo Ba

1461
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,240
It's him

1462
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:34,720
Son

1463
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,600
Your old father

1464
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,400
The one you love most

1465
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,440
So he also had a "murder" motive

1466
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,000
He saw Ju Chenggong

1467
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,280
steal his jade pendant

1468
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,320
and then wanted to drag his son

1469
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,360
into this gang

1470
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,360
So to protect his son

1471
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,360
he might have wanted to "kill" that butler

1472
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,440
It definitely wasn't me who "killed" him

1473
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,800
If I wanted to "kill" him, I would've done it long ago

1474
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,160
Why would I wait until today?

1475
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:03,680
It's precisely because

1476
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,920
your son was brought here today

1477
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,560
Right, you can endure humiliation

1478
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,240
and bear heavy burdens yourself

1479
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,600
No, compared to finding your son

1480
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,280
clearing my name is

1481
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,240
even more important

1482
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,560
You...

1483
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,280
This isn't about

1484
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,640
you finding your son now

1485
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,520
It's about luring your son

1486
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,640
into this gang

1487
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,320
Right

1488
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,280
I was almost tricked into this pit of fire myself

1489
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,440
What? I didn't hear that

1490
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,080
Now he can't hear again

1491
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,600
Do you know about a poison called

1492
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,040
"Drive You Mad"?

1493
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,360
No, I don't know

1494
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,240
In his phone messages

1495
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,120
there was an application to the

1496
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,440
Psychological Crisis Intervention Team

1497
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,520
The reason stated was:

1498
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,440
"I've experienced

1499
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,680
the grief of my dearest jumping to their death

1500
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,760
I want to join you

1501
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,840
to prevent more tragedies"

1502
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,560
It connects

1503
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,600
The person we saw

1504
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,040
Dad, who is this person who jumped off the building?

1505
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,400
Who is it?

1506
00:48:59,240 --> 00:48:59,760
I can't say.

1507
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,440
I can only say it's someone very close.

1508
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,720
In his phone,

1509
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,760
there was a reminder.

1510
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,840
It was a memo.

1511
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,680
It listed:

1512
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,600
One, two, three, four, five, six—

1513
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,160
six "Zhen Guo Li" Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring drinks.

1514
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,400
And it said:

1515
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,720
"Real tea, real fruit,"

1516
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,200
"Grapefruit Meets You."

1517
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,800
"Hope everything goes well."

1518
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,960
This has nothing to do with the case.

1519
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,400
You should just return the phone to me.

1520
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:36,880
Ju Xingyun is here

1521
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,320
Hello, Ju Xingyun

1522
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,800
Hello, everyone

1523
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,600
Hello, Youyou

1524
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:43,800
Hi, Youyou

1525
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,000
Let's ask you something

1526
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:49,760
Okay

1527
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,560
Are you...

1528
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,280
also here to earn money through livestreaming?

1529
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,000
You're not actually family, right?

1530
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:58,840
Right

1531
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,680
When I was very young...

1532
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,080
my father abandoned me and my mother

1533
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,800
Then I lived with my mother

1534
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,720
But not long after...

1535
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,760
my mother "passed away"

1536
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,360
How did you get into this apartment back then?

1537
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,640
Well, here's the thing...

1538
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,040
Actually, I was just an ordinary

1539
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:20,640
office worker

1540
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,800
just a regular employee

1541
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,320
But because I really liked Youyou

1542
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,560
yet I felt I wasn't good enough for him

1543
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,560
I thought I needed to become famous

1544
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,400
I wasn't much back then

1545
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,440
It was fine

1546
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,360
But then

1547
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,240
Juxiangying told me

1548
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,080
"Just join our family

1549
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,680
and we'll make you famous"

1550
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,480
"You'll be a big influencer"

1551
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,360
I said I'd do it

1552
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,160
To become worthy of Youyou

1553
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,040
I joined them

1554
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,400
How could you be like this?

1555
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,000
It's both admirable and pitiful

1556
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,360
Now I feel I'm not good enough for you

1557
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,440
So have you ever hated the butler?

1558
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,000
Or was your relationship always harmonious?

1559
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,000
How could that be called harmonious?

1560
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,440
It definitely couldn't be harmonious either.

1561
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,880
And I've already said

1562
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,560
I'm leaving the Juhuo family.

1563
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,520
Then why are you leaving?

1564
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,360
Because of you

1565
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,600
He came

1566
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,400
But after he acknowledged his family ties

1567
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,960
he became my brother

1568
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,600
How could siblings possibly be together?

1569
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,960
I've had a crush on him for so long

1570
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,760
And today when I saw him, you said

1571
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,200
He has celestial beauty

1572
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,240
Divine appearance

1573
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,240
So handsome

1574
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:44,920
I've never seen

1575
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,400
someone so talented and handsome

1576
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,440
He's the ideal man

1577
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,640
To recap the previous events

1578
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,280
Because in Gu Lucky's room

1579
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,800
we found many Guo Baoyou body pillows

1580
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,320
Body pillows

1581
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,360
and even hangers with his face on them

1582
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,000
In his own computer

1583
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,880
he had his own forum

1584
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,720
And she would always

1585
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,680
leave comments under his posts

1586
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,520
right?

1587
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:05,840
Yes

1588
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,640
And do you remember

1589
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,280
when we first searched his room

1590
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,120
during the initial search

1591
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,280
everyone was criticizing him

1592
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,080
but there was only one person

1593
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,560
Ju Xingyun who kept supporting him

1594
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,520
always standing by him

1595
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,040
So it was you

1596
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,480
It was her

1597
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,160
Yes, her

1598
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,360
That would be me

1599
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,000
Fate works in mysterious ways

1600
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,520
But

1601
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:26,400
Ju Xiangying

1602
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,120
told me not to let personal feelings

1603
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,440
interfere with my grand ambitions

1604
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,600
He said no, you can't quit

1605
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,960
I want to leave Juhao Family

1606
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,720
Quit

1607
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,520
The contract you signed with me

1608
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,000
states that if you quit now

1609
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,920
you must pay massive compensation

1610
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,320
But I was determined

1611
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,120
I insisted on quitting

1612
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,080
Then he agreed

1613
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,120
but with one condition

1614
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,160
That being

1615
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:47,880
I'll give you one chance

1616
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,400
Within one week

1617
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,840
if your sales reach 5 million

1618
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,440
I'll let you quit

1619
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,560
But this was an extremely difficult

1620
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,720
target to reach

1621
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,400
Right

1622
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,920
That same afternoon I decided

1623
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,200
to double my livestream hours

1624
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,600
I told my fans

1625
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,520
"Please everyone, buy more"

1626
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,960
Who was your top donor?

1627
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,240
During the livestreams

1628
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,040
The top donor was my dad

1629
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,200
My biological father

1630
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,600
There's a video on the phone

1631
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,000
On her birthday

1632
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,040
Then her father Jiang bought her fifty sets

1633
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,840
Of the lucky set she was selling

1634
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,040
While she was selling the products

1635
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,600
Her father always supported her

1636
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,760
Then her father wrote in the live stream comments

1637
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,440
Wishing his daughter a happy birthday

1638
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,120
Yes, and after she saw it

1639
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,160
She was shocked

1640
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,120
"Bro, what are you saying?"

1641
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,120
She immediately ended the live stream

1642
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,600
Then there was a private message exchange

1643
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,280
Yes, I just wanted to confirm

1644
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,480
If he was really my father

1645
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,560
I didn't dare to acknowledge it

1646
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,600
But after confirming

1647
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,280
He indeed was

1648
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,800
I found out on the 12th

1649
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,680
That he was my father

1650
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,000
During the live stream

1651
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,760
After I confirmed it

1652
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,040
I wanted to meet him

1653
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,400
But on the morning of the 14th

1654
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,760
I received a notice

1655
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,560
Telling me to collect the "death" notification

1656
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:12,840
How did he "die"

1657
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,880
It was because he was overworked

1658
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,360
Overworked to death

1659
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,440
And then had a traffic accident

1660
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,280
Too much work

1661
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,400
Because I asked everyone

1662
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,200
To help me push for

1663
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,520
Higher sales targets

1664
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,720
My father saw this

1665
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,040
But he didn't have money either

1666
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,080
So he had to work even harder

1667
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,440
Work harder

1668
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,040
So her father did it

1669
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:31,640
For her sake

1670
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,680
To save her

1671
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,280
Right

1672
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,160
So you would think that

1673
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:35,880
It's because of the butler

1674
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,120
Of course it's because of the butler

1675
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,400
If he hadn't made such unreasonable demands

1676
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,800
My father wouldn't have "died"

1677
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,600
So you're telling us

1678
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,840
You want to "kill" the butler, right?

1679
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,600
Absolutely

1680
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,640
I just found out

1681
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,960
I just acknowledged my father

1682
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,800
Actually, we've sorted through

1683
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,560
all their grudges and entanglements

1684
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,000
their "murder" motives

1685
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,920
everyone has one

1686
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,520
Right

1687
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,840
Everyone has one, without exception

1688
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,640
Including him

1689
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,280
Guo Baoyou's

1690
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:13,880
could be considered

1691
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,480
about finding his father or something similar

1692
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,000
Yes

1693
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,920
Ju Chenggong's "murder" motive

1694
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,440
was wanting to "kill" him

1695
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,400
to get the money

1696
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,600
since he never got it

1697
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,880
He thinks it's about equivalent money

1698
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,720
Then Mrs. Ju's "murder" motive

1699
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,200
was to avenge her child

1700
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,640
Ju Wenyi's "murder" motive

1701
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,080
Ju Wenyi's is actually quite strong

1702
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,200
One is disposing of the "body"

1703
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,080
Another is

1704
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,360
he's now trying to drive him away

1705
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,400
and threatening him

1706
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,240
Relatively speaking

1707
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,000
he seems the most suspicious

1708
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,440
Right

1709
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,720
From what we see now

1710
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,480
As for Ju Yangsheng's "murder" motive

1711
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,760
it was to overturn the case

1712
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,040
But he doesn't seem to have a reason

1713
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,000
to "kill" him

1714
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,440
Right, he wants to investigate this matter

1715
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,120
but he also needs to protect his son

1716
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,520
Protecting his son should be very important

1717
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:50,480
Right

1718
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,320
What about Ju Xingyun's "murder" motive?

1719
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,760
She's (doing it) for her father

1720
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,520
to take revenge for her father

1721
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,640
Among all these people's "murder" motives

1722
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,440
who would absolutely need to

1723
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,720
"kill" the butler today?

1724
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,000
So there are two key points today

1725
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,920
First is that he came

1726
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,320
Then there's Wenyi

1727
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,240
It might be that

1728
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,000
Wenyi is somewhat anxious

1729
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:05,880
He's a bit anxious

1730
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,440
Once I came, wouldn't he be finished?

1731
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,320
And what's the other one?

1732
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,120
That would be Ju Xingyun

1733
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,840
Her father

1734
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,280
just "passed away" these past two days

1735
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:11,840
So it's possible

1736
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,640
she wanted revenge during these two days

1737
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,480
Blinded by anger

1738
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,320
So now we think

1739
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,240
the most urgent suspects are Xingyun and Wenyi

1740
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:18,800
Right?

1741
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,840
Also, among all our rooms

1742
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,760
only the butler's door

1743
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,840
has a coded lock

1744
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,280
others all use key cards

1745
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,600
Then let's think of a way later

1746
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,640
Let's search the butler's door

1747
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,080
Let's go

1748
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:30,360
Alright

1749
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,400
Go

1750
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,720
Thanks Xiao He

1751
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,440
Let's go

1752
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,240
Go

1753
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,560
Let's go see the butler's room

1754
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,160
Take the elevator

1755
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,240
Let's open the butler's room.

1756
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,560
Do you know the password?

1757
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,760
"Zhencha Zhenguo" is very likely.

1758
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,200
"Zhencha Zhenguo"?

1759
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:08,400
Wrong.

1760
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:08,720
Incorrect.

1761
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,760
Try using his real name

1762
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,040
which is Ju Xiangying

1763
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,000
The initials

1764
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,200
are JXY

1765
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,120
One two three

1766
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:22,880
So it was this simple

1767
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,120
It's three people

1768
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,120
We overthought it

1769
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,720
The boss's house indeed is

1770
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,880
Another doll

1771
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,560
I haven't seen this important clue yet

1772
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,560
Do not approach the abandoned power distribution room

1773
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,840
Disobedience will be "fatal"

1774
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,080
Listen to it speak

1775
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,400
Don't attend the family reunion banquet

1776
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,440
Disobedience means "death"

1777
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,920
There's always someone warning us

1778
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,920
Right

1779
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,160
Someone has been trying to help us

1780
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,120
Not helping us

1781
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,840
It's foretelling "death"

1782
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,920
It only foretells "who will die"

1783
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,560
Last time it predicted Song Huo

1784
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,920
This time it's predicting the butler

1785
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,320
Warning everyone in advance

1786
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,480
Where problems will occur

1787
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,040
Yes

1788
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:40,920
Developing lamp

1789
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,040
This must serve some purpose

1790
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,880
I think so too

1791
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,680
Follow doctor's orders

1792
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,160
What medicine

1793
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,920
Follow doctor's orders

1794
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,600
The medicine bottle is empty

1795
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,200
There's a box inside here

1796
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,320
A combination lock

1797
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,080
Is there

1798
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,560
any proof of their love

1799
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,440
like the butler and madam's

1800
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,320
wedding photo?

1801
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,440
Their wedding photo

1802
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,440
looks so forced and distant.

1803
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,840
2013520

1804
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,520
0520

1805
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,400
Try this combination lock.

1806
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,240
Here, 0520.

1807
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,200
Good day.

1808
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:38,880
Good day.

1809
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,880
0520

1810
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,280
It's open.

1811
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,160
It works.

1812
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,200
It's open.

1813
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,160
Smart.

1814
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,480
Important evidence.

1815
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,160
What's in here?

1816
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,960
Just cosmetics.

1817
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,120
Why would he have cosmetics in his pocket?

1818
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,320
This is a woman's case.

1819
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,400
Which means

1820
00:59:59,400 --> 00:59:59,800
Right.

1821
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:01,440
This room

1822
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,800
has two pillows.

1823
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,560
Probably

1824
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,920
a couple lived in this small room.

1825
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,440
Right?

1826
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,600
Such a small bed.

1827
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,800
Must've been tough for the couple.

1828
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,280
Right.

1829
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,040
So these things are

1830
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,120
Mrs. Ju's makeup products

1831
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,800

Is this your real son?

1836
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,480
This is the immortal peach

1837
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,080
We've been live-streamed this whole time

1838
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:29,640
Is this for real?

1839
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:30,920
Look

1840
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,680

Special Note

1849

Guo Baoyou

1850
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,760
Rising mystery novelist

1851
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,480
Extremely popular

1852
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,280
Can ride his popularity

1853
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,440
To boost the livestream's popularity and viewership

01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,640
2. Netizens' favorite rich family drama tropes

1855
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,080
The more dramatic and exaggerated everyone is

1856
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:49,960
The more attention it grabs

1857
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,640
Special Notes

1858
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,680
Morning live stream preparation phase

1859
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,680
Everyone must attend on time

1860
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,280
No going out

1861
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,600
Look at their lines

1862
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,080
Mrs. Gu slaps him

1863
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,000
Then he falls on me

1864
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,720
Mrs. Gu sits down

1865
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,720
Then waits for my reaction

1866
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,440
Everything was rehearsed

1867
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,400
All waiting for my reaction

1868
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,440
We've been live this whole time

1869
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,680
And look

1870
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,960
Now they're adding the product link

1871
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,640
Flat peach

1872
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,440
This is the product

1873
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,400
Give the flat peach a close-up

1874
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,520
It's good for beauty and skin

1875
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,120
Just show everyone

1876
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,240
More of this peach

1877
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,960
Let's see where this lands

1878
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,000
Everything before was fine

1879
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,080
This is the final segment

1880
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,120
Five-minute countdown

1881
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,280
The butler reminds Gu Success

1882
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,800
The live stream time is approaching

1883
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,920
This scared me

1884
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:33,640
I got it

1885
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,520
Alright, you can go now

1886
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,640
That's it, the live stream is over

1887
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,120
Is this his glue?

1888
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,080
The one you searched for

1889
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,000
Yes, it's his

1890
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,760
Strong transparent adhesive

1891
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,720
Invisible when dry

1892
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,840
When damp

1893
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,080
It leaves adhesive traces

1894
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,320
Under UV light, it fluoresces

1895
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,560
Push the strong demagnetizing sheet

1896
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:08,920
On the shoes

1897
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,000
It's stuck to the sole of the shoe

1898
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,880
Is this light

1899
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,400
Come on, let's take a look

1900
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,000
Just take a quick look first

1901
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,280
Just a quick glance first

1902
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,280
Come on, let's go check it out first

1903
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,160
Does he only have it on this one foot?

1904
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:27,760
Or both feet?

1905
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,080
He has it on both feet.

1906
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,120
Then he must have used it to stick something.

1907
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,280
What does this small square mean?

1908
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,680
This is from the butler's foot

1909
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,200
The mark of pushing a strong degaussing plate

1910
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,320
Left by the "deceased"

1911
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,480
Is there more?

1912
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:47,600
There's more here

1913
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,080
These are the "deceased's" footprints

1914
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:50,640
Here

1915
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,800
There's half a footprint

1916
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,320
There are footprints and square marks

1917
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,520
Just two sets of footprints

1918
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,720
Whose footprints?

1919
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:07,840
Here

1920
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,400
They lead outward

1921
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,880
Other than the butler

1922
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,600
who else has glue on their shoes?

1923
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,640
Then they must be the one who set up the poison gas

1924
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,200
So who could this person be?

1925
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:16,880
Look

1926
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,600
Look, there are footprints here

1927
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,400
Yes

1928
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,560
These are clearly shoe prints

1929
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,680
See where they lead

1930
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,080
This person walked in a big circle

1931
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,200
Here

1932
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:32,760
Then went out

1933
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:33,680
Here

1934
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:35,600
There are some here

1935
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:36,840
Here too

1936
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,520
And here as well

1937
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,560
This is terrifying

1938
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,280
Then they left

1939
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,080
Here

1940
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,000
This leads to the elevator

1941
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,320
Why would they go to the elevator?

1942
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,840
I think they deliberately avoided the main house

1943
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,240
They intentionally went around us

1944
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:54,840
Whose footprints?

1945
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,320
If they took the elevator

1946
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,240
They must have returned to their room

1947
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,840
Then let's check whose doorway has

1948
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,640
First check the madam's room

1949
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,440
Nothing in the madam's room

1950
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,520
I just checked the doorway

1951
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,880
Let's check those three rooms

1952
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,680
Right

1953
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,680
Come on, let's check upstairs

1954
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,240
Let's go

1955
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,240
I don't dare go first

1956
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:17,960
I...

1957
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,760
Thank you

1958
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:30,360
What

1959
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,640
There's a board that fell off

1960
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:32,400
You scared me

1961
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,880
You said there was nothing scary

1962
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,120
We're just scaring ourselves

1963
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:41,800
Trash bag

1964
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:44,840
What is this

1965
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,200
What the heck

1966
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,640
There's a trash bag here

1967
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:52,800
Don't go upstairs

1968
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,560
Come down

1969
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:53,960
Okay

1970
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,240
Come here, butler.

1971
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,560
Come over.

1972
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,680
Thank you, sir.

1973
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:05,040
Go.

1974
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,320
So the donut we just successfully gave him...

1975
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,160
He threw it away.

1976
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,680
This piece here...

1977
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,000
Is this medicine?

1978
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,400
Take it out.

1979
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,120
Let's see what medicine this is.

1980
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,160
This is what the boss takes.

1981
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,440
Isn't this the one kept by the bedside?

1982
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:26,800
He threw away all the medicine.

1983
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,120
Let me go take a look.

1984
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,200
That medicine bottle is...

1985
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,720
There's a code on it.

1986
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,760
Bring the medicine bottle here to check.

1987
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,640
Judging from this picture...

1988
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,120
It should be the same thing.

1989
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,080
But...

1990
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,720
But there's nothing inside it.

1991
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,080
Then why did he dump it?

1992
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:45,600
But we don't know.

1993
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,440
What is this thing?

1994
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:52,720
This serial number

1995
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,560
HFSGM

1996
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,200
It's a Cantonese song, right?

1997
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,400
Should we continue looking for footprints now?

1998
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,320
Let's look for footprints first.

1999
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,360
I suspect it's on the ninth floor.

2000
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,960
Probably in someone's room.

2001
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,640
Any here?

2002
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,280
No.

2003
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:24,800
Nothing.

2004
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,640
Have we checked the hallway?

2005
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,400
Not there either?

2006
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,480
No, nothing in the hallway.

2007
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,200
How many suspects do we have now?

2008
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,560
One, two, three, four...

2009
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,120
Five.

2010
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,160
Six.

2011
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,240
Haven't we checked his room yet?

2012
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:40,320
My room?

2013
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,560
Guo Baoyou's room.

2014
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,440
Right.

2015
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,000
Why are you smiling at me?

2016
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,880
Go check then.

2017
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:47,440
Okay.

2018
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,400
Then let's go look.

2019
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,640
Let's go, come on.

2020
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,200
Let's go to his room.

2021
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,320
Check if there are any footprints here.

2022
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,240
The footprints lead back to your room.

2023
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,720
Do you have any secrets you haven't told us?

2024
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,000
I don't have any secrets.

2025
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,000
All I can say is this is a misunderstanding.

2026
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,720
The evidence is irrefutable.

2027
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,240
So Guo Baoyou,

2028
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,600
is also in cahoots with them.

2029
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,200
The "dead" butler

2030
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,760
What exactly was his "fatal" cause?

2031
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,240
Why are you still at this point

2032
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:47,880
Haven't you...

2033
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,080
This really has nothing to do with me

2034
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:49,760
That's all I can say

2035
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,960
Framing someone

2036
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,520
Allergic reaction

2037
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,720
Would cause immediate suffocation

2038
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,040
Suffocation means death

2039
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,480
Who would frame him?

2040
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,840
Someone even called to ask me

2041
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,360
Was it you?

2042
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,040
Well...

2043
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,120
This is literally "The Truman Show"

2044
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,280
So much money!

2045
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,400
Then there might be more than one person

2046
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,080
Who wanted him dead

2047
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,760
Tried to "kill" but might have failed

2048
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,080
Someone got to him first and "killed" him

2049
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,680
Then there must be someone else

01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,760
