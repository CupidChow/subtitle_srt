1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,280
May 6th

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,320
was my first day moving into Apartment 11

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,520
In the afternoon, we found Zhenzhen

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,880
on the 8th floor of Apartment 11

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,320
Zhenzhen was murdered in the theater

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,160
Zhenzhen

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,960
Zhenzhen has "died"

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,960
Through interrogating the suspects

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,080
we've uncovered more

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,920
secrets hidden behind the case

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,680
Screenwriter Song, also Jiajia's boyfriend

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,880
has been dedicated to paying homage to classic works

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,680
That's not plagiarism

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,760
It's called homage, understand?

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,480
Homage

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,000
If she were to expose

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,200
your so-called "homage"

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,080
how would you punish her?

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,200
"Kill" her?

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,320
I didn't "kill anyone"

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,800
Meanwhile, what Zhenzhen captured

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,360
was campus heartthrob Cao Yangguang

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,960
actually having a hidden

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,800
dark side

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,560
When it filmed you

26
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,040
what were you doing holding those high heels?

27
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,400
I was cleaning the heels

28
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,599
Were you really cleaning them?

29
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,040
Anyway, the things I want

30
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,600
I always get in the end

31
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,840
You're terrifying

32
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,480
The most puzzling part is

33
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,960
Teng the agent claims the theater he entered

34
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,320
was covered in "blood stains"

35
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,960
I felt like I stepped on something

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,760
sticky and gooey

37
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,600
But surveillance footage shows

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,680
him entering spotless Theater 3

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,800
He entered Theater 3

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
The footage also shows

41
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,520
Zhenzhen and Bai Sanwan

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,480
entering the same theater

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,960
but only Bai Sanwan

44
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,520
left the crime scene

45
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,960
This makes Bai Sanwan

46
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,760
the prime suspect

47
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,560
All evidence points to him

48
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,600
Yet Bai Sanwan denies seeing Zhenzhen

49
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,240
But I really didn't see her

50
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,560
Faced with these contradictions

51
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Bai Sanwan offers his theory

52
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,600
Could it be possible that

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,640
my room's location changed

54
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,960
or the camera angles changed

55
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,280
or the room numbers changed?

56
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,960
Something's wrong

57
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,440
Meanwhile,

58
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,880
Everyone noticed suspicious aspects of Zhenzhen's identity

59
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,200
She exhibits two completely different personalities

60
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,720
She doesn't remember arranging to meet someone at the theater

61
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,200
Haven't we already cleared this up?

62
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,120
Why did you ask to meet me then?

63
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
I didn't arrange this meeting

64
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,880
He asked me the same thing

65
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,720
Why I had asked him to come

66
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
This led everyone to speculate

67
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,960
That this Zhenzhen

68
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,720
Might have a twin sister

69
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,560
Or perhaps more than one

70
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,120
You mean twins?

71
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,720
Two people

72
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,160
I recalled accidentally

73
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,120
Hitting Jiajia and leaving a scar

74
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,560
I accidentally hit her

75
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,760
With a basketball and knocked her down

76
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,280
I took her to the hospital for stitches

77
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,000
Jiajia is the one with the head scar

78
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,640
This might be the key

79
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,120
To verifying this theory

80
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,040
After returning to the crime scene,

81
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,560
crime scene

82
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,960
Check if there's a scar on the back of her head

83
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,920
Based on the scar

84
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,640
we confirmed the identity of the "corpse"

85
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,680
It was Zhenzhen

86
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,400
not Jiajia

87
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,360
The absence of a scar means

88
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,320
she wasn't Jiajia

89
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,400
To verify our earlier hypothesis

90
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,640
we carefully examined the theater's structure

91
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
I think it's

92
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,000
this wall

93
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
plus this door can rotate

94
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
There's space in between

95
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,480
Try pushing this

96
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,400
One, two, three

97
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,840
One, two, three

98
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,160
It moves

99
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,120
Unexpectedly, the space between

100
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,760
the theater's inner and outer doors

101
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,840
could actually rotate

102
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,840
Bai Sanwan's theory was correct

103
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,640
This is amazing

104
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,240
There's something

105
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,680
Stop

106
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,200
While operating the rotating

107
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,440
intermediate layer

108
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,560
we discovered

109
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,400
several hidden clues

110
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,560
confirming the existence of twin sisters

111
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,440
The sisters played one role together in the play

112
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,560
Using the theater's rotating structure

113
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,360
they moved between different stages

114
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,840
achieving seamless costume changes

115
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,960
There were indeed two sisters

116
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,400
In the midst of everyone's discussion,

117
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,800
Jiajia appeared.

118
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Why are you arresting me?

119
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,000
You run pretty fast.

120
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,040
These legs...

121
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,520
Facing everyone's questioning,

122
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,840
she finally confessed.

123
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,760
She is Jiajia, who has been in love with me for a long time.

124
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,200
That's right.

125
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,080
Have you forgotten we were dating back then?

126
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,080
I never dated you.

127
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,360
However,

128
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,000
it turns out it was all my wishful thinking.

129
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,280
You thought you were in a relationship,

130
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,560
but only now do I realize

131
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,160
she had always liked Bai Sanwan,

132
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,680
and even impersonated her sister Zhenzhen

133
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,320
just to be with him.

134
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,440
But because of this,

135
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,720
she became increasingly lost in the relationship.

136
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,120
So I

137
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,240
concealed the truth,

138
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,400
which ultimately cost me the love,

139
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,080
and even led to depression.

140
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,880
Having just returned today,

141
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,960
she discovered her sister had also been brutally "murdered."

142
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,800
While we were still immersed

143
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,440
in the sisters' emotional story,

144
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,920
she actually took the chance to escape.

145
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,680
Don't run!

146
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,560
This season will unfold over eleven weeks

147
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,600
telling the stories that occur in Apartment No. 11 of Tui City

148
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,440
Six players will move in as new residents

149
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,200
and occupy Apartment No. 11

150
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
They will be drawn into bizarre cases

151
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,720
By forming the "Apartment Detective Team"

152
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,320
they'll visit different floors

153
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,120
befriend various long-term residents

154
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,080
solve their own identity mysteries

155
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,080
and uncover secrets behind each case

156
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,000
The first six cases

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,680
will unlock one new resident's story each week

158
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,640
The complex relationships between new and old residents

159
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,120
will gradually come to light

160
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,520
Starting from the seventh case

161
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,920
all storylines will intertwine

162
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,040
As truths are revealed layer by layer

163
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,920
every choice made by the new residents

164
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,400
will influence the story's direction

165
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,480
and final outcome

166
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,840
In each case

167
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,680
the detective team must at the crime scene

168
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
identify the "victim"

169
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,360
and based on clues

170
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,000
pinpoint relevant suspects

171
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,720
Note:

172
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,720
Suspects aren't limited to Apartment No. 11 residents

173
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,160
or visitors

174
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
Suspects might even exist within the detective team

175
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,280
After gathering suspects

176
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,040
the team will interrogate them

177
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,480
and re-examine based on testimonies

178
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,320
finally voting to identify the "true culprit"

179
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,720
Only the "true culprit" is permitted to lie

180
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,320
Only by finding the real "murderer"

181
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,520
can players claim victory

182
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,040
Players who vote correctly

183
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,000
receive a golden key

184
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,400
If a player is the "murderer"

185
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,360
and successfully escapes

186
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,600
they'll receive a golden key

187
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,080
Let's follow the way the roulette wheel spins

188
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,120
Let's simulate it first

189
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,760
Okay

190
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,520
Jiajia

191
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,920
Sit for a while

192
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,320
You sit

193
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,480
Sit down, you can't leave anyway

194
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,960
Sit here

195
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,720
You scared me to "death"

196
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,320
Don't run

197
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,040
Don't move

198
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,000
Where did it go?

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,360
Where is everyone?

200
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
How can they run so fast?

201
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,760
Where is everyone?

202
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Couldn't catch up

203
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
This person is full of tricks

204
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,280
I can't even tell

205
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,880
Who's scaring me in each round

206
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,800
Seriously

207
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,680
Is there anything left at the crime scene?

208
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,440
There's something here

209
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,920
Over here, the crime scene

210
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,600
Now everything's

211
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,680
We shouldn't make such sounds casually now

212
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,680
Can't open it?

213
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,360
The crime scene door won't open

214
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,800
We can open it from over there

215
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,040
We can go around through this room

216
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,120
Number 2 can reach number 3

217
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,600
Is there anything we haven't taken?

218
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,240
We've taken everything, right?

219
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,760
She locked it from inside

220
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,040
We just need to open it

221
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,560
Take all those notes with us

222
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,920
The door was just...

223
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,080
Jiajia (just locked it)

224
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,360
Where's the "corpse"?

225
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,640
The bottle is gone too.

226
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,400
The person is gone too.

227
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,640
What about the "corpse"?

228
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,640
There's something suspicious.

229
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,120
Let's go quickly.

230
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,960
Something's not right.

231
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,880
Go.

232
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,040
She just...

233
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,640
Neither her sister (Zhenzhen) nor her actually "died".

234
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,280
Impossible.

235
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,160
She just came in.

236
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,320
And took the things away.

237
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,040
The "corpse" is gone.

238
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,000
The "corpse" has disappeared.

239
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,840
Why did we let her leave just now?

240
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,680
Just now...

241
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,960
It was the younger sister (Jiajia) who locked it.

242
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,560
Did the younger sister (Jiajia) lock it?

243
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,000
Definitely.

244
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,640
Because she came in again just now.

245
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,760
Then she must still be inside.

246
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Then she from

247
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,440
No one can escape from this side

248
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,480
This is a locked room

249
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,520
I think

250
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,320
Is there somewhere else she could go

251
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,360
Another place

252
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,880
No

253
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,200
A frail woman

254
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,160
Carrying her sister (Zhenzhen)

255
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,760
Wait, this air conditioner

256
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,840
Isn't running either

257
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,200
We just walked around outside

258
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,920
Not running

259
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,800
I think there might still be a way through.

260
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,360
This door must be able to open.

261
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,240
No entry.

262
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,040
It just says "prohibited."

263
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,440
But...

264
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,360
What about those...

265
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,560
passcodes we used before?

266
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,880
What's wrong?

267
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,240
Someone's pulling from inside, right?

268
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,280
Having a tug-of-war, huh?

269
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,840
There's "blood"

270
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,200
Is this a cat?

271
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,880
Or something else?

272
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,160
Is there more?

273
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,920
That's a cat

274
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,440
Cat

275
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,480
There's a "blood" mark on the door

276
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,520
But it seems...

277
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,080
Could a cat reach up there?

278
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,720
It couldn't have left a second mark

279
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,320
Right

280
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,880
This feels like...

281
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,640
Doesn't look like a paw

282
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,200
Not like a cat

283
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,080
This isn't a paw print

284
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,160
This doesn't resemble a paw print

285
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
This is just a pool of "blood"

286
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,880
This circular "bloodstain"

287
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,600
Circular

288
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,040
It's circular

289
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,000
Circular

290
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,720
Circular

291
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,080
It's a circular "bloodstain"

292
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,360
Circular

293
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,160
The bottle is gone too

294
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,880
The person is gone too

295
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,760
It's a circular "bloodstain"

296
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,800
The bottle opening...

297
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,840
Bring the bottle here

298
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,880
See if it can be opened

299
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,920
This bottle is missing

300
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,600
That bottle from earlier is gone too

301
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,400
The one that was on the ground

302
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,520
She took a bottle

303
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,160
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

304
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,360
Can it be opened?

305
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,400
Is the one you have red?

306
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,960
No

307
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,040
No

308
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,960
It's that bottle

309
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,720
Is it some kind of sensor device?

310
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,040
Yes

311
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,120
I think it can only be this lid

312
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,800
The main thing is that bottle is gone too

313
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,120
Was that bottle taken away?

314
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,440
I'll go to another room

315
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,920
to get a red bottle

316
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,280
Could it be like this?

317
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,800
Possibly

318
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,240
I think

319
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,480
Another possibility is

320
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,680
if this door can be opened

321
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,920
maybe entering leads to another space

322
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,880
The bottle is here

323
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,720
Stick it on

324
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,120
Let's try

325
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,640
Should we dip it in "blood" and stick it there?

326
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,400
It's open

327
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Another space has opened

328
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,560
Really taking the bottle

329
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,160
Is this the control panel?

330
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,200
Sister (Jiajia)'s clothes

331
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,000
Sister (Jiajia)'s clothes are here

332
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,800
More and more

333
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,200
Theater control room

334
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,240
Everyone inside

335
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,280
This door can be opened

336
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,600
Wait a moment

337
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,200
Operate Door B once

338
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,520
This is Door B

339
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,840
She's over there

340
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,520
Quick, go!

341
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:36,920
Running again

342
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,240
No, how did she...

343
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Why is she so arrogant?

344
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,960
Why has Jiajia disappeared again?

345
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,440
Let's go back.

346
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
Let's just focus on...

347
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,000
steadily solving the puzzles.

348
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,760
Let's first take a look at this room.

349
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,400
Let's check that room...

350
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,520
Right, just a quick look first.

351
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,200
What's inside?

352
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,520
Take a look.

353
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,560
What is she doing here?

354
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,680
Controlling all of this.

355
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,400
It changed.

356
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,160
Open the door.

357
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,280
Did you catch it?

358
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,880
Didn't catch it.

359
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,560
This is impossible to catch.

360
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,640
Can we see the surveillance here?

361
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,360
There should be something that can control this.

362
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,640
See where she's hiding.

363
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,920
This area is...

364
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,960
Why is this transparent glass here?

365
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,360
This is a blackboard.

366
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,760
Can't we write on this blackboard?

367
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,320
So...

368
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,720
That earlier one was number 1.

369
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,080
Room A.

370
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,920
This is...

371
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,040
This is it.

372
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,440
A.

373
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:41,920
Right.

374
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,120
This is the path from A to B.

375
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,040
Everything's connected now.

376
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,560
Fully connected.

377
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,640
Yes, this is the path from A to B.

378
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,560
Because 1 can't reach 2.

379
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,120
1 can't go to 2.

380
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,160
Simply because this isn't open here.

381
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,960
This isn't open.

382
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,840
That means

383
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,240
May 6, 2022

384
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,920
is today

385
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,800
8 o'clock

386
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,920
The path we just took

387
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,680
Just now and now

388
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,600
Right

389
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,920
Proves this room

390
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,800
hasn't been entered by anyone

391
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,120
Right, no one has come in

392
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,720
Correct

393
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,360
Actually, relatively speaking

394
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,920
Room 1 is still a locked room

395
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,680
Yes, because before this

396
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,640
it was never opened

397
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,560
There's no record

398
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,280
There are some wires here, are they useful?

399
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,160
Could some of these wires

400
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,800
be its switch or power source?

401
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,400
Is it possible there's a main unit hidden somewhere?

402
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:30,800
It has

403
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,200
underneath

404
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,920
clothes

405
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,520
Look

406
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:34,960
pocket

407
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,200
Is there any writing?

408
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,560
Pocket

409
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,320
Phone

410
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,080
There's a phone

411
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,280
Look, this big phone isn't visible

412
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,160
Really can't see it

413
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,120
Five people searched

414
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,760
Never expected

415
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,280
That you, who was once so important to me

416
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,040
would end your life by jumping off a building

417
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,760
I'm sorry

418
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,480
May 6, 10:30 AM

419
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,320
"Suicide"

420
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,440
May 6, 10:30 AM

421
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,120
That was when we were visiting your room

422
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,360
You jumped when we were visiting your room

423
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,240
So I think there's something else

424
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,600
What else is in the cabinet?

425
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,480
Another secret passage

426
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,880
Can this one rotate too?

427
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,440
Okay

428
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,400
Turn it

429
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,280
Turn one

430
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,480
Are you inside or outside?

431
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,160
I'm outside

432
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,920
It moved.

433
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,160
We can get out from here too.

434
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,080
No.

435
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,800
No, if that's the case,

436
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,040
then this way also allows entry and exit.

437
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,000
Okay, stop.

438
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,000
Another door?

439
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,640
This is a secret passage

440
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,440
It's just a place to store things

441
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:11,960
Hidden compartment

442
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,080
What's inside?

443
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,920
What's in here?

444
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,720
There's another one of these

445
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,040
Smart remote

446
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,560
Circuit breaker box

447
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,080
Remote control

448
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
Power supply

449
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,760
Power cut

450
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,360
What does this mean?

451
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,400
Take everything out

452
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
There's also a smartwatch

453
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,200
This computer has no password

454
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,120
Is this the surveillance?

455
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,600
Yes.

456
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,520
Surveillance.

457
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,400
It shows real-time monitoring of the theater hallway.

458
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,840
No playback or storage capability.

459
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,320
Power distribution box.

460
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,040
Turn it off, let me see.

461
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,240
Can we cut the power?

462
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,040
Power's off now.

463
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,440
It's dark.

464
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,400
This is live.

465
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,600
Just with a slight delay.

466
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,359
So the corridor sometimes goes dark

467
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,160
Right

468
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,079
This remote control

469
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,119
can turn the outside lights on and off

470
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:17,760
I think

471
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,640
This surveillance system can do real-time... what?

472
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
See in real-time

473
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,240
when everyone

474
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,880
entered which door

475
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,079
Then use these remote controls to operate

476
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,720
make it rotate

477
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,119
determine where to direct you

478
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,920
to turn to

479
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,480
Right

480
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,480
So when we came here before

481
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,600
sometimes it was lit

482
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,120
sometimes it was dark

483
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,240
What's the meaning of the darkness?

484
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,840
To make us confused about which door is which

485
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,800
Safe travels

486
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,000
Was it a good run?

487
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,920
Here's a copy of

488
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,960
the script outline for "True or False Love"

489
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,440
And then?

490
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,640
She added emphasis marks

491
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,320
under certain words

492
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,000
"The day was sunny and bright"

493
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
"Stunning white dress"

494
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,920
"White" refers to you

495
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,320
Right?

496
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,280
"Waiting punctually at the theater entrance for a date"

497
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,880
"Wan Song"

498
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,280
Song refers to Screenwriter Song, correct?

499
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,040
Yes

500
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,200
"Bao - Guo Baoyou"

501
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,880
I think I get it now

502
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,480
Doesn't she have this?

503
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,200
First, we need to separate all these characters individually

504
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,920
Separate them out

505
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,080
Then arrange them into a sentence

506
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,040
Just write out the dotted characters

507
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,520
Okay, that's good

508
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,000
Passable

509
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,280
Pretty good

510
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,680
Elder sister (Zhenzhen)

511
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,200
Elder sister (Zhenzhen)

512
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,120
Sky

513
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,400
Sunshine

514
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,760
Be at the theater on time

515
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,360
Song

516
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:28,840
Bag

517
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,200
Bag

518
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,200
Face

519
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,360
I can sense it now

520
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,080
Kuo, You, you

521
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,360
Why earlier...

522
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,840
These characters were pieced together

523
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,680
That earlier one

524
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,760
What number are they in?

525
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,960
It's imitating her handwriting

526
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
Imitating the handwriting of the younger sister Jiajia, the screenwriter

527
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,440
Paste

528
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,560
The "killer" took these characters of hers

529
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,600
Picked them out one by one

530
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,160
Just like that font

531
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,360
Extracted these characters

532
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,000
Imitate

533
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,760
Handwriting

534
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,440
Right?

535
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,240
Actually, they came from the characters above

536
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,800
Yes, pieced together from above like this

537
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:57,840
Right

538
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,800
Look at these two characters "theater"

539
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,360
They're exactly the same

540
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,640
So these were selected from here

541
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,400
The "killer" is

542
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,240
Imitating younger sister (Jiajia)'s handwriting

543
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,560
To write one for elder sister (Zhenzhen)

544
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,760
Trying to frame the younger sister (Jiajia)

545
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:08,960
Right?

546
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,960
Isn't there another watch that hasn't been turned on yet?

547
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,840
What's written under the watch?

548
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,080
The watch is here.

549
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,680
Disconnected.

550
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,680
Is it a smartwatch?

551
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,240
Can it connect to a phone?

552
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,760
Smartwatches can connect to phones.

553
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,800
Let's try.

554
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,040
Use Bluetooth.

555
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,120
It won't connect, right?

556
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,400
The theater prohibits phones and computers.

557
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,600
All phones must be stored here before entering.

558
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,440
Because this theater

559
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,040
doesn't allow phones inside.

560
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,520
All mobile phones

561
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,080
must be checked at the entrance.

562
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,360
So he could bring this in

563
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,320
without needing to bring his phone.

564
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,120
And still make calls.

565
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,560
Fabricating her call records, right?

566
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,280
Right.

567
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,800
No,

568
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,160
this way

569
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,520
he could fake his alibi.

570
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,840
An alibi.

571
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,520
Because if he took his phone when leaving,

572
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,200
when he stored the phone

573
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,680
and when he retrieved it

574
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,280
would show his presence or absence.

575
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,760
Exactly.

576
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,720
It's proof of his movements.

577
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,400
Understand?

578
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,480
For example, at 3:35 I took my phone,

579
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,800
meaning at 3:35 I left.

580
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,840
That proves I was gone.

581
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,280
Right.

582
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,840
But if I didn't take it,

583
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,440
I wouldn't need my phone inside,

584
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,200
so it wouldn't matter.

585
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,560
I could keep using this to make calls.

586
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,360
Yes, exactly.

587
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:14,840
Right?

588
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,320
Correct.

589
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,400
Then who used it

590
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,040
and hid it in the secret compartment?

591
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,800
Could it be that Xiao Cao?

592
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,680
Or that screenwriter Song?

593
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,160
You mean the "killer" left it here?

594
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,200
Yes, the "killer" left it.

595
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,240
The "killer"

596
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,840
The "murderer"

597
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,520
These things

598
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,600
were definitely left here by the "killer"

599
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,200
after being used

600
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,520
and placed here.

601
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,920
He's inside here now.

602
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,400
One controls the switches,

603
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,360
another monitors the hallway lights,

604
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,400
tracking everyone's movements

605
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,480
and the sequence of their comings and goings.

606
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,600
Then using this to control

607
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,120
including the exterior,

608
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
he created

609
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
a perfect alibi for himself.

610
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,640
Right.

611
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,520
He also kept newspaper clippings.

612
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,440
Let's see what else is in this hidden compartment.

613
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,160
Take a look.

614
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,960
See where it leads.

615
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,200
Let's see where it goes.

616
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,400
Be careful.

617
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
This hidden compartment

618
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,960
can actually hide people inside.

619
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,800
Yes.

620
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,160
All three of us could fit in here.

621
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,720
Turn it.

622
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,800
Yes, just give it a turn.

623
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,560
Maybe you'll see something.

624
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,000
Keke, you come too.

625
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,480
You guys turn it, but be careful.

626
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,080
Go.

627
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,440
See what you can find.

628
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
Let's see.

629
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,840
This is kinda scary.

630
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,680
See if we can spot anything.

631
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,880
Don't be afraid.

632
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,320
It's okay.

633
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,240
There's a door

634
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,680
No

635
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,200
Can we go out?

636
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,160
The "killer" can go

637
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,360
The "killer" can go anywhere

638
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,680
Here it comes

639
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,720
What did you see?

640
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,280
Nothing at all

641
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,960
This means

642
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,480
He can transfer through this

643
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,400
He can go to any room

644
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,440
He can even move large objects

645
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,520
Can go wherever he wants

646
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,080
If he's in another room

647
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,720
"Kill" her

648
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,160
Then leave her here and still transfer

649
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,280
No, we can't think like that

650
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,400
He can be in any

651
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,320
He can make anyone go to any room

652
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,000
He can send anyone to any room

653
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,840
He can

654
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,600
Prevent others from seeing the "corpse"

655
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,520
For example, if he's in Room A

656
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,320
"Killed" someone in so-called Room 1

657
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,840
And he can simultaneously make others

658
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,680
Enter Room 1

659
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,320
Without seeing this "corpse"

660
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,800
But

661
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,120
The "corpse" will always be in Room A

662
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,400
The person "died" in Room A

663
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,840
They definitely "died" in Room A

664
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,160
Won't be "killed" elsewhere

665
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,120
Then moved there

666
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,160
Shuffling back and forth like this

667
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,400
Wait a moment

668
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,920
The intercom outside is ringing

669
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,960
Friends, can you hear me?

670
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Xiao He

671
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,840
Hello?

672
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,600
I'm here

673
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,200
How's your investigation going?

674
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,080
It's getting late

675
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,680
Why don't you all come

676
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,480
to the restaurant on the first floor to discuss

677
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Then we'll hold a vote

678
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,880
to select a suspect

679
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,720
I'll hand over the person and all

680
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,880
relevant evidence to

681
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,200
the relevant authorities for handling

682
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,360
We've collected all the evidence

683
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,720
Good work, everyone

684
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,160
I've prepared a table for everyone

685
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,400
Inside this table

686
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,840
there is some key information

687
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,960
such as the victim

688
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,680
time and location

689
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,760
After everyone has discussed

690
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,480
shall we go vote together?

691
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,120
Come on

692
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,520
Where's Teng the agent?

693
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,760
The boss called him away

694
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,480
Regarding today's occupancy rate issue

695
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,360
That needs to be addressed

696
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,000
Then let's all discuss slowly

697
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,680
Call me if anything comes up

698
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,120
Alright?

699
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,520
Okay

700
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,240
We've discovered

701
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
Zhenzhen "died" in the Zhenzhen Theater

702
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,360
Then through secondary search

703
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,680
We found the entire theater

704
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,920
Can rotate

705
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,320
Right

706
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,600
And inside the theater

707
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,800
There's a hidden compartment

708
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,880
And inside this compartment

709
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,240
We found a computer

710
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,920
The "killer's" murder weapon

711
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,640
That can monitor the entire environment's

712
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,760
Real-time surveillance

713
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,480
So what we need to do now is

714
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,280
Figure out how to reconstruct

715
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,280
This "killing" method

716
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,200
Exactly

717
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,360
Here, let me draw a diagram

718
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,160
Our theater

719
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,480
Is a circular theater

720
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,560
This is a circle

721
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,520
Let's assume

722
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,680
This is the elevator entrance to the north

723
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,400
This should be Room A

724
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,000
This is Room B

725
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,960
Room C, Room D

726
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,920
This middle path

727
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,640
The "killer" uses this

728
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,480
to commit the "murders"

729
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,040
Right?

730
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,520
Because you can't go directly from Room A to Room B

731
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,000
Unless you use that plug, right?

732
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,480
Therefore

733
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,400
The surveillance room

734
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,120
is actually directly opposite the elevator

735
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,560
Yes

736
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,080
Right?

737
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,800
Room B can go one-way to Room C

738
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,760
Room C can go one-way to Room D

739
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,240
Room D can go one-way to Room A

740
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,480
Then the entire room resets

741
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,000
What's displayed outside

742
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,760
should be Door 1

743
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,920
Door 2

744
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,080
Door 3

745
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,880
Door 4

746
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,280
These are the normal room numbers

747
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,800
This is the most normal state

748
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,240
Right?

749
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,560
Yes

750
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,160
First let's assume

751
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,560
First let's assume

752
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,320
After the "killer" enters the room

753
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,720
First makes a rotation

754
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,960
180 degrees

755
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,000
Room A becomes Door 3

756
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,640
Room B becomes Door 4

757
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,560
Room C becomes Door 1

758
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,280
Room D becomes Door 2

759
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,920
This is Door 2, right?

760
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,280
This is Door 2, right?

761
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,760
Exactly

762
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,520
Then the "killer" deceives both sides

763
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,240
He used his older sister Zhenzhen's phone number

764
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,600
to send messages to several of us

765
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,920
telling us to go find her

766
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,400
Then used younger sister Jiajia's handwriting style

767
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,320
to deceive older sister Zhenzhen

768
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,800
and make sister Zhenzhen come to the meeting

769
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,240
Yes, exactly

770
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,080
The person currently in Room C is Bai

771
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,880
You are at...

772
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,680
I'm at Door 2

773
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,160
I'm in Room D, at Door 2

774
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Who is going to Door 4?

775
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,520
Door 4 is Screenwriter Song

776
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,080
So that means Screenwriter Song is at Door 4

777
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,800
Okay, now about the first person who left

778
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,480
It's this person at 1:15

779
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
It's Cao Yangguang

780
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,000
But now because he has a watch

781
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,960
which means that

782
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,240
he can send messages to her

783
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,800
but he might not have actually left

784
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,480
Do you understand?

785
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,520
As long as he has the key to that secret compartment

786
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,320
Right

787
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,640
He could hide inside

788
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,720
Hide until she meets the last person

789
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,320
Then strike

790
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,800
The problem is

791
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,480
once he rotates this (hidden compartment)

792
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,200
wouldn't Sister Zhenzhen directly

793
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,240
go meet someone else?

794
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,960
When Sister Zhenzhen

795
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,880
rotates back to Room A

796
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,000
he can stab her right inside the room

797
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,720
He doesn't need to use the hidden compartment

798
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,160
"I'll just wait for you inside the room"

799
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,680
No,

800
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,160
he can't stay inside continuously

801
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,880
Why would

802
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,040
Sister Zhenzhen need to

803
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,280
go to Room A again?

804
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,160
Because after Sister Zhenzhen

805
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,440
finished searching for me,

806
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,840
he manipulated the hidden compartment to move

807
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,680
then he rotated Door 1 back to Room A

808
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,480
So Sister Zhenzhen looked for Door 1

809
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,400
saying "This is Door 1"

810
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,160
and then entered here

811
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,600
No, listen

812
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,920
She directed Cao Yangguang to Theater 1

813
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,440
Right

814
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,800
But Cao Yangguang entered through Gate 3

815
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,480
Sister Zhenzhen still went to Gate 1

816
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,600
No, listen carefully

817
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,520
He met with

818
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,480
Sister Zhenzhen in Room A

819
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Then Sister Zhenzhen went to other rooms

820
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
to meet the rest of us, right?

821
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,360
Yes

822
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,400
The second person she met was Screenwriter Song

823
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,760
I was the third person she met

824
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,040
After meeting me

825
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,520
Sister Zhenzhen went back to change clothes

826
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,360
While she was changing

827
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,280
He directly operated

828
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,520
to rotate the hidden compartment 180 degrees

829
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,840
Thus changing Room A's entrance from Gate 3 to Gate 1

830
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,600
It became Gate 1 again

831
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,360
So Sister Zhenzhen looked for Gate 1

832
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,280
Thinking this was Gate 1

833
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,080
And then entered here

834
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,000
He wouldn't need to

835
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
enter that compartment again

836
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,120
He could operate directly inside the room

837
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,000
and complete everything there

838
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,720
to deal with the person

839
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,400
Right

840
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:39,680
So

841
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,920
If Cao Yangguang wanted to "kill" someone

842
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,600
he wouldn't need the compartment

843
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,840
His suspicion is basically cleared

844
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,200
No suspicion at all

845
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,160
Right, Door 1 and Door 3 suspicions are cleared

846
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,040
You

847
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,480
really

848
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,200
It's not your turn yet

849
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,800
Let me tell you

850
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,400
Door 1 and Door 3 can be cleared

851
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,960
No

852
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,840
You could be

853
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,000
You're one level above us

854
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,360
Because first of all

855
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:53,600
Because primarily

856
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,000
The "killer"

857
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,640
must have used this hidden compartment

858
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:55,800
definitely used this hidden compartment

859
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,280
to commit the crime

860
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,880
to "carry out the murder"

861
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,240
So he definitely wouldn't

862
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,320
enter through Door 1 or Door 3 directly

863
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,800
Because Door 1 and Door 3

864
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,960
one is the crime scene

865
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,240
and the other is where it (the hidden compartment) rolls to

866
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,320
these two

867
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,440
Do you understand what I mean?

868
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,080
Understood.

869
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,760
No need.

870
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,600
He had no reason.

871
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,360
to expose himself openly.

872
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,400
More suspicious.

873
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:17,840
Right.

874
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,360
So I can rule out three people.

875
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,680
One is me.

876
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,480
One is Cao.

877
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,440
Cao Yangguang.

878
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:23,720
Right.

879
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,280
And one is our.

880
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,720
middleman.

881
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:26,920
Right.

882
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,720
I think the three of us.

883
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,240
can be temporarily cleared of suspicion.

884
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,640
That leaves the suspects as.

885
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,760
One is you.

886
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,680
One is that screenwriter Song.

887
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,160
And another one is.

888
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,720
her sister.

889
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,080
Jiajia.

890
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,360
Right.

891
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,440
Those three are more suspicious.

892
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,920
The boss just needed me for something

893
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,480
Where are we at now?

894
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,120
Eliminated

895
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,480
Seems like you got eliminated, bro

896
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,320
I got eliminated?

897
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,480
Yeah, you're not the issue

898
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,240
Why?

899
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
For now, we've temporarily ruled out

900
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,640
Cao Yangguang and Bai Sanwan

901
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,120
If you put it that way

902
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,280
saying Guo and Song are the prime suspects

903
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,080
is perfectly reasonable

904
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,840
Indeed, we two are the most suspicious

905
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,440
Now let's examine the motive

906
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,720
No, first let's simulate the route

907
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,680
If you were the "killer"

908
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,840
how would you move?

909
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,160
Let the "killer" themselves explain it to you

910
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,840
If I were the "killer"

911
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,320
First

912
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,160
He's in Room C

913
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,200
I'm in Room D

914
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,480
And the "victim died" in Room A

915
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,760
Why would I still use the secret compartment?

916
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,600
I could just push the door open

917
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
and stab her to "death"

918
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,320
Then your face would be recorded there

919
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
Alright, then I'll wait here

920
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,000
Look

921
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,800
This secret compartment is here, right?

922
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,440
The compartment moves from here

923
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,760
Then I control the compartment to rotate

924
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,440
to this position

925
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,160
Then when the compartment rotates again

926
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,440
I take the opportunity to get on

927
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,400
Then I get off here

928
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,360
The compartment rotates back

929
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,720
Meaning the compartment didn't actually move

930
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,680
No

931
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,360
It's like this

932
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,000
What I'm saying makes perfect sense

933
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,600
No

934
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,000
I mean there's really no problem with my explanation

935
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,720
No, you go directly from Room D through the one-way door

936
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,920
to Room A, right?

937
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,560
After "killing"

938
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,280
use the secret compartment

939
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,680
Right

940
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,920
Go directly onto the compartment

941
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,320
Then make a full circle back to that spot

942
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:07,880
What I mean is

943
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm saying

944
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,560
If the "killer" must use the compartment

945
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,400
then taking this route also requires using it

946
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,200
Meaning I get on the compartment

947
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,520
then come here to "kill" her

948
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,200
Afterwards, I wait for the compartment to rotate back

949
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,880
I get on the compartment

950
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,040
then make another full circle to return here

951
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,760
The existence of this compartment must be

952
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,520
it must be used

953
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,960
Is it really necessary to use it?

954
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,440
Yes

955
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,840
He's really highly suspicious

956
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,560
You don't have to believe me

957
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,240
But the question is, what's my motive?

958
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,600
The issue is, why would I know

959
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,520
about this theater's layout?

960
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,960
This theater's layout—

961
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,680
I'm truly here for the first time

962
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,600
Not necessarily believing you

963
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,360
Right

964
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,160
"The killer" could be lying

965
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,840
You can't

966
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,640
This "killer"

967
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,160
must be familiar with the theater's layout

968
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,160
and know about this sisterly relationship

969
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,240
Right, another question is

970
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,920
who else would know about the sisters' relationship

971
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,360
Right

972
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,200
This is something we never knew about

973
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,880
The sisterly relationship

974
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,920
Screenwriter Song definitely knows

975
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,960
Screenwriter Song, right

976
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,600
I think it's Screenwriter Song

977
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,760
Because they co-wrote that thing together

978
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,960
"The Qiao Family's Descendants"

979
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,520
Right

980
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,160
And the two sisters even fought

981
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,760
because of Screenwriter Song

982
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,360
They had arguments

983
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,000
They definitely knew Screenwriter Song

984
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,480
Right

985
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,960
Isn't that right?

986
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,360
Sanwan, did you know?

987
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,960
I didn't know

988
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,640
If I had known

989
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,240
how could I have sent that bowl?

990
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,240
Did you know?

991
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,080
How could I have known?

992
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,280
No, but he might have known

993
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,680
Who? Which he? Who is he?

994
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,280
Guo Baoyou

995
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,800
How would I know?

996
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,000
Because only he knew

997
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,080
She had an injury on her head

998
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,720
That injury was caused by him

999
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,600
I only found out today

1000
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,200
after learning about the sisterly relationship

1001
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,520
I was trying to tell the sisters apart

1002
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,680
that I discovered who had it

1003
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,640
I had no idea before

1004
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,040
I also think

1005
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,520
today when you were distinguishing the sisters

1006
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,720
you already knew about her head

1007
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,720
you've always known about her scar

1008
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,200
but you never told us

1009
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,440
You never asked

1010
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,440
No,

1011
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,880
let alone whether you knew or not,

1012
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,960
can you explain to me

1013
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,440
why you told Jiajia

1014
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,400
that we dated?

1015
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:08,960
But Jiajia said

1016
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,160
we never dated.

1017
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,760
Here's the thing:

1018
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,440
I've come to realize

1019
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,920
the person I dated

1020
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,120
was probably Zhenzhen.

1021
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,320
Because I couldn't tell them apart.

1022
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,720
Impossible, she has a scar on her head.

1023
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,880
That scar was caused by you.

1024
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,600
I caused it?

1025
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,200
When we were together,

1026
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,560
it's not like I could

1027
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,360
be parting her hair every day

1028
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,520
You should have seen it in her hair.

1029
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,480
You can't force me to have seen it.

1030
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,400
It's not like she's some old monkey

1031
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,640
where I'd be picking lice from her hair

1032
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,840
and parting her hair every day.

1033
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,120
Why would I keep checking for scars?

1034
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,160
She might have been wearing

1035
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,560
Xiao Guo,

1036
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,680
and later on,

1037
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,600
the time we spent together

1038
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,840
became shorter and shorter,

1039
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,120
until eventually

1040
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,640
we stopped meeting altogether.

1041
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,320
The reason for all this

1042
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,440
was because

1043
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,640
this screenwriter Song impersonated Xiaomian online

1044
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,440
and posted that

1045
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,560
I was a "pervert."

1046
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:00,960
Vote for him.

1047
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,600
I vote for him.

1048
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,720
Who do you vote for?

1049
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,280
He impersonated my Xiaomian,

1050
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,440
impersonated my sister.

1051
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,360
You have love but no principles.

1052
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,320
That forum

1053
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,960
was the forum Zhenzhen (elder sister) usually used.

1054
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,560
Zhenzhen saw on it

1055
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,240
that her sister Jiajia

1056
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
"You shouldn't be with him"

1057
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,320
"He's a scoundrel"

1058
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,400
Let Zhenzhen handle it

1059
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,440
During that period

1060
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,080
I also couldn't contact her for a while

1061
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,360
because she changed her phone number

1062
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,200
Later that phone number told me

1063
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,400
she said she was Jiajia

1064
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,640
So I always thought

1065
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,880
I was chatting with Jiajia

1066
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
but it was actually Zhenzhen

1067
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,400
Do you remember

1068
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,280
under his forum post

1069
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,960
his last message at that time

1070
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,600
said someone was (slandering him)

1071
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,480
Someone was

1072
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,560
messing with me

1073
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,720
I'm about to find out who this person is

1074
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,800
That was your comment, right?

1075
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,240
Yes

1076
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,720
All the harsh words came from me

1077
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,680
I was indeed the one who said them

1078
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,080
No

1079
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,440
What I mean is

1080
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,920
He must be looking for

1081
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,120
what this thing is

1082
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,080
He would definitely immediately

1083
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,960
confront Jiajia (younger sister)

1084
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,640
If he and her

1085
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,000
were really involved before

1086
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,520
He would first confront Jiajia saying

1087
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,200
"Why are you doing this to me?"

1088
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,640
Then Jiajia would say "It wasn't me"

1089
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,400
"It was my sister Zhenzhen"

1090
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,360
She has this anti-"scumbag" alliance

1091
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,120
Then he found Zhenzhen (elder sister)

1092
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,600
Right

1093
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,440
So,

1094
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,159
the probability that he knows about the sister relationship

1095
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,120
is relatively high.

1096
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Bro, can you reconstruct

1097
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,719
Song's crime scene

1098
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,520
Yes, look

1099
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,080
Song entered this room, right?

1100
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,960
Sister Zhenzhen was going to change clothes in the middle

1101
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,639
Then come to this room to meet me

1102
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,400
Right?

1103
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,600
Moreover

1104
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,520
There's one thing we can't forget

1105
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,840
When he was scaring us

1106
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,000
He was standing right behind

1107
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,080
It startled me

1108
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,159
Then after Sister Zhenzhen entered

1109
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,239
He used this hidden compartment to rotate

1110
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,760
At this point he got off

1111
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,960
And rotated the compartment back here

1112
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,440
He was standing right behind you two

1113
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:51,920
Right

1114
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,239
Then why didn't he call us?

1115
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,400
He didn't say

1116
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
He didn't

1117
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,520
But he was standing right there at that time

1118
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Then after a while he quietly came over

1119
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,600
Yes

1120
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,360
So before Sister Zhenzhen entered this room

1121
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,760
This hidden compartment shouldn't have moved, right?

1122
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,960
We need to consider one thing

1123
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,840
That this "killer"

1124
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,600
Might be lying

1125
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,560
So the information we got

1126
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,640
Might not be true

1127
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,960
At this point, it should already be Door 1, right?

1128
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,280
Didn't you say it just rotated back?

1129
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,760
Yes, it's already rotated back.

1130
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,640
It's reached this position now.

1131
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,040
It has rotated back.

1132
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,080
But he still needs to perform one more

1133
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,960
180-degree turn.

1134
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,560
Guo Baoyou

1135
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,600
You must discuss this with everyone.

1136
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,680
Otherwise after you finish discussing,

1137
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,480
no one will understand anything.

1138
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,320
I thought you could do ventriloquism.

1139
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,280
No.

1140
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,880
Biebie: I think [someone] is right.

1141
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,920
Biebie: Because it's named Zhou.

1142
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,280
That's right.

1143
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,600
Biebie: My name is Zhou.

1144
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,200
I'm the first batch of chocolate

1145
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,440
made together with Zhou Keke.

1146
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,800
I really can't watch this anymore.

1147
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,560
You people

1148
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,200
are so uncooperative.

1149
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
So impolite, I'm sorry.

1150
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,320
Let it rest for a while.

1151
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
Biebie: I think [someone] is right.

1152
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,200
Because none of us

1153
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,400
have discussed things together.

1154
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:00,680
Discussed things together.

1155
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,680
Our individual information

1156
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,440
can't be properly shared.

1157
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,320
Right.

1158
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,520
Good, so you've figured it out, right?

1159
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:09,960
You must have figured out the crime process.

1160
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,760
You must have figured out how the crime was committed.

1161
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,520
You've figured it out, good.

1162
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,560
Now let's quietly...

1163
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,760
listen to him recount it from the beginning.

1164
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,120
How he committed the crime, right?

1165
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,240
Who are you saying committed the crime?

1166
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,760
"The killer."

1167
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,520
You're trying to fish for information again.

1168
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:19,920
You're trying to get me to talk again.

1169
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,800
Let's assume for now

1170
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,920
the "killer" is Song (the screenwriter) who entered Room B

1171
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,400
Alright

1172
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,800
Right

1173
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,960
He came to commit the crime

1174
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,080
He had arranged with Sister Zhenzhen

1175
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,720
at 1:10 PM

1176
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,600
in this room

1177
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,120
because this room

1178
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,560
was actually Door 3 at that time

1179
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,280
And the person in this room

1180
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,440
is Cao Yangguang.

1181
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,200
At 13:20, he came here to meet Song (the screenwriter).

1182
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,400
At 13:30,

1183
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:48,960
because Sister (Zhenzhen)

1184
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,880
every time she meets someone,

1185
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,080
it never exceeds two minutes.

1186
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,440
She just meets and says "Why are you here?"

1187
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,200
"Didn't you ask me to come?"

1188
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:53,800
"I don't know either."

1189
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,200
Sister (Zhenzhen) leaves -

1190
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,280
it doesn't even take a minute.

1191
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,840
Right?

1192
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,480
So it's practically negligible.

1193
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,600
When Sister (Zhenzhen)

1194
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,280
finishes meeting me at 13:30,

1195
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,400
at 13:40, Sister (Zhenzhen)

1196
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,600
goes to Room A again.

1197
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,360
Screenwriter Song starts operating the secret compartment,

1198
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,560
making a 180-degree turn.

1199
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,720
Then,

1200
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,120
Screenwriter Song gets on this vehicle here,

1201
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,200
the vehicle turns around -

1202
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,720
just makes one circle and comes back.

1203
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,600
He gets off again at this spot.

1204
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,000
Then Screenwriter Song "kills" her.

1205
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,240
After "killing" her,

1206
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,360
Screenwriter Song

1207
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,160
returns to his original room.

1208
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,560
Yes.

1209
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,320
After he goes up,

1210
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,960
he gets off here again.

1211
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,520
Teng

1212
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,240
At 13:46,

1213
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,080
comes to this room

1214
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,360
and sees this "corpse."

1215
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,280
Teng runs away.

1216
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,680
Then he can leave from here.

1217
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,320
Before leaving,

1218
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,560
he turns the secret compartment back to its original position.

1219
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,000
This is the complete crime process.

1220
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,680
I think you're right

1221
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,240
Agreed

1222
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,320
He could have created

1223
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,480
this perfect alibi

1224
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,280
I could have created it too

1225
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,720
I'm just using him as an example

1226
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,080
Can't the three of us complete it?

1227
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,600
If you're talking about participation,

1228
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,840
this criminal process

1229
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,240
all three of us could be involved.

1230
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,400
Only Cao doesn't need to be involved.

1231
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,360
So Cao is 100% excluded.

1232
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,920
Cao is definitely 100% excluded.

1233
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,600
I have to say this:

1234
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,800
Even if you have just one percent

1235
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,840
chance of involvement,

1236
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,320
possibility of committing the crime,

1237
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,240
you can't be completely ruled out.

1238
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,600
His probability is relatively lower,

1239
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,120
but it's still possible.

1240
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,320
Even if Bai's chances are low,

1241
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,560
I still want to vote for him.

1242
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,360
My sister is deeply in love with you.

1243
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,760
If you can't have her, you'd rather destroy her, is that it?

1244
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,440
So currently the suspects are...

1245
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,840
Song (screenwriter) equals Guo (Baoyou)...

1246
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,000
greater than Bai (Sanwan), right?

1247
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,320
Yes, that's correct.

1248
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:22,720
Moreover...

1249
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,360
Bai would have an easier time committing the crime than Song (screenwriter).

1250
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,040
Because Song (screenwriter) would need to go around an extra half circle compared to you.

1251
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,760
Okay.

1252
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,240
Right?

1253
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,480
If we say...

1254
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,920
that I committed the crime...

1255
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,720
Would I leave such obvious...

1256
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,560
evidence behind?

1257
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,720
Right, this actually doesn't add up.

1258
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,440
But indeed...

1259
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,560
This is actually meant to frame Bai.

1260
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,320
We can think of it this way.

1261
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,480
This is clearly meant to frame me.

1262
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,720
Bai could also be framing himself.

1263
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,200
I've thought about that too.

1264
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,400
He could be framing himself.

1265
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,200
Yes, a scheme within a scheme.

1266
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
What you're thinking is...

1267
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,600
A smart person would think...

1268
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,480
that they wouldn't frame themselves.

1269
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,720
What are detectives for?

1270
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,600
Isn't it to figure out these little details?

1271
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,000
No.

1272
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Wait a minute.

1273
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,600
That makes sense.

1274
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,760
I think your analysis...

1275
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,160
about counter-investigation, right?

1276
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,000
shows very strong counter-investigation skills.

1277
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,640
It's very reasonable.

1278
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,760
This possibility indeed exists.

1279
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,720
All the evidence points to me.

1280
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,680
I've made myself look too...

1281
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,840
Why do you always act so self-destructive?

1282
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,520
No.

1283
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,760
I'm not saying it's you.

1284
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,680
Just saying the possibility exists.

1285
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,080
In that case, it's good that person is gone.

1286
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,520
Right.

1287
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
I don't have concrete evidence,

1288
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,200
but I have a wild theory.

1289
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,760
Go ahead.

1290
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,600
Jiajia

1291
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,960
and Screenwriter Song

1292
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,760
are working together.

1293
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,080
Because Jiajia has been stubbornly

1294
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,760
insisting on being with Screenwriter Song,

1295
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,920
determined to be with him,

1296
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,960
even though her sister (Zhenzhen) strongly opposes it.

1297
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,040
Moreover, Jiajia would definitely

1298
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,720
be very familiar with the theater layout

1299
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,160
since they performed there together.

1300
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,480
Therefore,

1301
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,440
only Jiajia and Screenwriter Song working together

1302
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,400
could coordinate this perfectly.

1303
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,320
In fact,

1304
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,920
could they both be the "killers"?

1305
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,480
Yes, because the phone found

1306
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,400
in the theater control room was Jiajia's.

1307
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,720
Anyone could have typed that message from Jiajia.

1308
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,880
If they're working together,

1309
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,600
they could just write it directly

1310
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,040
without needing to trace the handwriting.

1311
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,360
Do you understand?

1312
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,440
Because she wants to erase her own involvement.

1313
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,320
Right, her intention is

1314
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,080
to distance herself,

1315
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,040
making you think

1316
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,840
it definitely couldn't be Jiajia.

1317
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,680
She's clearing herself of suspicion,

1318
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,440
creating proof that it wasn't her.

1319
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:19,960
There's another issue -

1320
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,440
it's possible that after meeting Screenwriter Song,

1321
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,320
Zhenzhen was already "dead."

1322
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,800
Because Screenwriter Song could claim

1323
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
he had met with her.

1324
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,000
You mean Zhenzhen was "dead,"

1325
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,920
and the one we met later was Jiajia?

1326
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,840
The one you met was Jiajia.

1327
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,080
You wouldn't know if it was Jiajia

1328
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,640
or Zhenzhen.

1329
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,280
She just needed to say one thing to me,

1330
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,760
that would be enough.

1331
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,360
You wouldn't know which one you met.

1332
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,840
Jiajia wasn't seen,

1333
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,320
she only returned at 2 o'clock.

1334
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,920
She could be lying.

1335
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,000
If she's the "killer,"

1336
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,840
she could lie.

1337
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,680
Sorry

1338
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,960
I scared you again

1339
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,680
Sorry

1340
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,760
Next time shout "report" before entering

1341
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,880
He knocked

1342
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,720
Really?

1343
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,200
He knocked

1344
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,640
Everyone was too focused

1345
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,000
Right

1346
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,960
Every time it's you who scares us

1347
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,080
He was too sudden

1348
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,120
Brother Teng, take it easy

1349
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,200
He was too sudden

1350
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,280
Can't blame me

1351
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,240
I don't blame this

1352
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,040
We definitely can't blame anyone

1353
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,120
I didn't mean to do it either

1354
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,560
How's the discussion going?

1355
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,440
Do we have any preliminary conclusions?

1356
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,240
We can only say we've narrowed it down

1357
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:40,880
Narrowed the possibilities

1358
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,800
So we can fill it out now, right?

1359
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,080
Here you go, Brother Teng

1360
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,920
Come on, Brother Teng

1361
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
This is for you

1362
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,360
After this is filled out

1363
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,880
Everyone can vote

1364
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,480
And since today is everyone's first day

1365
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,200
Working so hard

1366
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,240
To solve our apartment's mystery

1367
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,760
So I have a...

1368
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,280
More people will "die" in this apartment later

1369
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
Whatever happens in our apartment

1370
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
I think it's all quite normal

1371
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,600
Right, Brother Teng?

1372
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,800
How can you say that?

1373
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm sorry

1374
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,400
We can't prevent incidents

1375
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,440
But we can solve them properly

1376
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,920
So you only fix things after they happen?

1377
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,760
Can't you prevent them from happening?

1378
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,720
Mending the fold after sheep are lost

1379
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,000
It's already too late

1380
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,880
Sometimes there's just no way

1381
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,080
We're a mixed-use residential-commercial building

1382
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,320
So there are many

1383
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,320
Interest clubs here

1384
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,280
How about we come up with a group name and slogan?

1385
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,800
Let's decide on one

1386
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,560
And then

1387
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,920
We can have some interest-based activities

1388
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,160
Everyone can participate together, right?

1389
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,440
Your group name will be "Easy to Be Foolish"

1390
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,080
Not "Hard to Be Foolish"

1391
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,480
Call it "Song Pretty and Her 'Killer' Squad"

1392
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,640
And Her Useless Men

1393
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,160
We'll be called...

1394
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,600
Let me think...

1395
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,080
Song Ning

1396
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,080
Song Ning

1397
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,560
Song Ning Bai

1398
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,240
Wait no, your name here is Liu Xialai

1399
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,160
Song Liu

1400
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,280
Song Liu Bai

1401
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:56,600
Guo

1402
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,080
Ke Wuku

1403
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,760
Song Ning Bai Qiuku

1404
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,920
Bai Qiuku

1405
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,520
His surname is Ke, right?

1406
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,040
Yes, it's Ke Wuku

1407
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,240
Right, surname Ke

1408
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,840
Zhou Ke

1409
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,240
Yu

1410
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,640
No

1411
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,000
"Zhou" "Ke" "Yu"

1412
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,920
"Zhou" "Ke" "Yu" works

1413
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,600
This is "Yu"

1414
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,280
Then we'll leave first, right?

1415
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,760
This group has nothing to do with us

1416
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,440
No

1417
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:19,880
Right?

1418
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,760
"Zhou" "Ke" "Yu"

1419
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,080
Let's call it

1420
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,760
Give you a pot of "Zhou" "Ke" "Yu"

1421
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,560
"Zhou" "Ke" "Yu" in a pot

1422
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,120
Bai Zhou

1423
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,160
Bai Zhou

1424
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,840
Bai Song Yi Guo

1425
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,040
Bai Song Yi Guo

1426
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,880
All Liu now

1427
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,240
Bai Song Yi Guo Zhou

1428
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,760
Liu Yi Ku

1429
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,840
Bai Song Yi Guo Zhou Liu Yi Ku

1430
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,720
Let's give away eleven pots of porridge

1431
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,720
There are eleven anyway

1432
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,640
Eleven pots are too many

1433
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,720
Split the eleven

1434
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,200
Same "one"

1435
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:57,800
Okay

1436
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,520
So this is the group name?

1437
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,000
Alright

1438
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,800
Good, no problem

1439
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,000
Then congratulations to our

1440
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,240
Bai Song 1 Guo Zhou group formation

1441
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,440
Don't understand

1442
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,920
Look at Teng Zhongjie

1443
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,560
Can't even force a smile

1444
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,800
He's the one who keeps asking why

1445
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,840
That guy

1446
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,400
Come on, let's do it again

1447
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,160
Let's try it

1448
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:19,680
One more time

1449
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,000
Ready, one two three go

1450
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,440
Ready, one two three go

1451
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,800
The expressions must be on point

1452
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,720
Let me start first

1453
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,480
Okay

1454
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,760
Who are you?

1455
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,800
We are...

1456
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,320
Why?

1457
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,720
Too lame

1458
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,080
I think it's too lame

1459
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,000
Not bad

1460
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,760
Pretty interesting

1461
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,520
Not too bad

1462
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,120
Let's tentatively decide on this group name

1463
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,720
And this slogan

1464
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,560
Very good

1465
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,280
Really like it

1466
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,160
Later we'll go to the property management monitoring room

1467
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,040
There will be a voting box there

1468
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,400
Everyone just needs to cast their votes

1469
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,160
All voting results

1470
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,600
And relevant materials

1471
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,280
Will be compiled by me later

1472
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,080
Then transferred to relevant departments

1473
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,720
This crime process is too hard to write

1474
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,800
Right now I feel exactly like

1475
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,560
someone who's gotten the exam paper

1476
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,600
and written their name

1477
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,840
but doesn't know how to answer

1478
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,200
Can't even convince myself

1479
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,560
Just like taking an exam

1480
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,680
Then I'll take my leave first

1481
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,160
Everyone

1482
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,080
Alright, bro

1483
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,920
Keep it up, everyone

1484
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,000
Did you just write "whatever"?

1485
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,520
Is that what you wrote?

1486
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,440
How are you so fast?

1487
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,760
I'll write first

1488
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,880
Lives are at stake

1489
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,720
Everyone, be careful

1490
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,480
I'll take my leave now

1491
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,840
I voted for

1492
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,520
Screenwriter Song

1493
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,160
Screenwriter Song and Guo Baoyou are the most likely suspects

1494
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,200
If I had to choose between them

1495
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,200
then I can only

1496
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,040
judge by their facial features

1497
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,920
Sorry, my abilities are limited

1498
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,240
Sherlock Holmes once said

1499
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,760
When you eliminate all possibilities

1500
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,160
whatever remains

1501
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:41,880
no matter how improbable

1502
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,880
must be the truth

1503
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,360
So

1504
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,160
the "culprit" I suspect is

1505
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,880
Screenwriter Song

1506
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,400
Please, let this be right

1507
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,800
<summaryA character quotes Sherlock Holmes' famous deduction principle and concludes that Screenwriter Song is the culprit, hoping their suspicion is correct.

1508
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,520
So in the end,

1509
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,240
I chose

1510
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,800
The person I'm voting for today is

1511
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,280
Jiajia

1512
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,240
I think she

1513
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,200
has the strongest motive

1514
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,760
among everyone

1515
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,080
it should be the strongest

1516
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,760
and most justified

1517
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,840
Since childhood, many boys have flocked around you

1518
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,520
Your jealousy toward your sister (Zhenzhen)

1519
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,920
Every romance

1520
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,040
ended up with your sister (Zhenzhen)

1521
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,120
Don’t ruin things between me and Screenwriter Song

1522
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,360
Regarding Screenwriter Song

1523
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,120
you clashed with your sister (Zhenzhen) again

1524
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:48,880
over differing views

1525
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,680
leading to a rift

1526
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,240
If you keep being stubborn

1527
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,560
You know I can make Screenwriter Song

1528
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,880
ruined like the other "scumbags"

1529
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,480
Don’t push me

1530
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,800
For Screenwriter Song

1531
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,000
I’d do anything

1532
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,720
I believe it’s a mix of conflicts

1533
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,920
that drove her to "kill"

1534
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,800
Few would frame me like this

1535
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,800
Only she holds such resentment toward me

1536
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,480
I voted for

1537
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,760
Guo Baoyou

1538
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,160
Because he himself

1539
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,120
is very knowledgeable about mechanisms and such

1540
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,600
He's also one of the top ten

1541
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,120
most outstanding novelists

1542
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,560
He's very afraid that this matter

1543
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,240
might be exposed

1544
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:33,960
You deserve it

1545
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,880
You call me a "scumbag" - do you have proof?

1546
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,160
Just you wait

1547
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,440
As for Screenwriter Song

1548
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,240
I actually think he could be possible too

1549
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,520
But the thing is

1550
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,520
If he wanted to

1551
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,320
"kill" someone after meeting everyone

1552
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,280
his travel distance would be too far

1553
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,200
Could it be Bai Sanwan?

1554
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,320
But Bai Sanwan probably doesn't know

1555
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,280
that the sisters (Zhenzhen and Jiajia) have

1556
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,280
different identities, right?

1557
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,320
Oh no...

1558
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,280
I'm standing here

1559
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,920
doubting myself now

1560
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,720
If my solution is wrong,

1561
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,920
I'll just have to try harder next time

1562
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,440
They're in

1563
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:18,920
They've entered

1564
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,640
It's fine

1565
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,640
We're all good friends

1566
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,640
They'll understand

1567
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,000
Currently, Jiajia's relationship with Screenwriter Song

1568
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,960
is the closest

1569
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,800
So he might know

1570
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,440
that these two are twins

1571
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,160
and also knows the theater's layout

1572
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,560
Therefore I believe

1573
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,080
the "culprit" is

1574
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,160
Screenwriter Song

1575
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,960
Through investigation and on-site examination,

1576
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,720
there are actually five suspects in the end.

1577
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,720
Cao Yangguang's own room

1578
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,920
doesn't require the use of a hidden compartment,

1579
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,200
so Cao Yangguang is ruled out.

1580
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,600
Moreover, to confirm the "culprit's" suspicion,

1581
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,480
two conditions must be met:

1582
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,360
First, knowing Zhenzhen and Jiajia's

1583
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,120
sisterly relationship,

1584
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,320
and being familiar with the theater's internal structure.

1585
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,680
Bai Sanwan claims he's just an audience member,

1586
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,520
so he likely doesn't know the theater's layout.

1587
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,640
Additionally, because he likes Zhenzhen,

1588
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,600
he mistook Jiajia for Zhenzhen

1589
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,280
and gave her a love token,

1590
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,400
resulting in him not realizing

1591
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,560
the difference between the two sisters.

1592
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,320
Therefore, I'm ruling out Bai Sanwan as well.

1593
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,200
Thus,

1594
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,560
I cast my vote for

1595
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,360
All the evidence

1596
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,040
I will hand it over to the relevant authorities

1597
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,320
Everyone should go back and rest for now

1598
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,960
Hey, friends

1599
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,240
Today's our first day moving in

1600
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,760
I see we've all added each other on WeChat

1601
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,880
Let me create a group chat for our

1602
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,000
detective team

1603
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,760
What do you think?

1604
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,360
Aren't you all curious about

1605
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,520
who that woman who jumped was?

1606
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,440
The woman in red

1607
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:58,400
Right

1608
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,040
Why could only the six of us see her?

1609
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,520
I think that's really strange

1610
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,360
And the property management staff

1611
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,440
really couldn't see her?

1612
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,200
We're not staying here

1613
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:04,640
Not staying

1614
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,080
This is a haunted house

1615
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,360
Why didn't I see it?

1616
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,680
And why did the "body" disappear?

1617
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,240
That's kinda scary

1618
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,520
Where did it go exactly?

1619
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,800
Then the TV showed a bunch of

1620
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,960
threatening messages aimed at us

1621
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,040
And finally

1622
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,480
there was some kind of symbol

1623
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,480
Do you remember?

1624
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,520
Has anyone seen this symbol before?

1625
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,520
The red text said

1626
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,480
Everything is connected to this symbol

1627
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,280
Where should we look for info about this symbol?

1628
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,040
Aren't you all curious about

1629
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,520
why Jiajia took away

1630
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,760
Zhenzhen's "body"?

1631
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,640
What about the "corpse"?

1632
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,640
Is Zhenzhen really "dead"?

1633
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,200
Did Zhenzhen "die"?

1634
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,120
I don't know.

1635
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,240
But

1636
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,600
Do you remember

1637
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,960
on Jiajia's phone

1638
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,680
there was mention of someone jumping off a building?

1639
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,480
Is it possible

1640
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,400
it's the same person we saw?

1641
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,200
So Jiajia also knew

1642
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,200
about the jumping incident.

1643
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,000
This apartment always feels mysterious,

1644
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,840
full of secrets.

1645
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,040
What do you think about

1646
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,920
Cao Yangguang?

1647
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,400
What secrets is he hiding?

1648
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,360
I don't know, too many questions.

1649
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,040
And Liu Xialai,

1650
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,120
why did you suddenly ask today

1651
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,000
if Cao Yangguang knows you?

1652
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,240
Do you know me?

1653
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:14,560
No,

1654
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,120
nothing.

1655
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,320
I just suddenly

1656
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,400
well, you know,

1657
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,360
got talkative, nothing serious.

1658
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,440
I wanted to see if he actually

1659
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,160
knows us or not.

1660
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,280
Whether he really

1661
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,640
comes here often.

1662
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,280
No, it's nothing.

1663
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,880
I think what we should be asking is

1664
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,680
about this Guo Baoyou,

1665
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,240
because every night he follows

1666
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,800
that girl home.

1667
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,320
Hey Guo Baoyou, don't you think you're being a bit

1668
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,400
well, kind of "perverted"?

1669
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,040
You're playing

1670
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,600
I've said it over ten thousand times

1671
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,440
I'm really not a "pervert"

1672
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,200
I just wanted to walk them home

1673
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,720
Today, Bai Sanwan

1674
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,560
He actually only explained one bowl

1675
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,120
Which was an apology to his brother

1676
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,520
But there were two other bowls

1677
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,200
Each bearing different messages

1678
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,800
"Sorry to that man"

1679
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,240
And "Sorry to that girl"

1680
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,960
He didn't explain either of these

1681
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,480
Why is this coming back to me again?

1682
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,320
This really has nothing to do with today's matter

1683
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,360
Everyone should rest early

1684
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,320
Good night

1685
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,280
Yes, alright then

1686
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,440
I'm too tired

1687
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,720
I'm going to sleep first, good night everyone

1688
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,720
First day moving in

1689
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,600
Wishing everyone good night

1690
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,400
Still have to work tomorrow

1691
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,400
Alright then, good night

1692
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,760
Everyone, good night

1693
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,520
Time for beauty sleep, good night

1694
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,440
Alright then, good night family

1702
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,240
Applauding ourselves

1703
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,680
The smartest group

1704
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,280
Can't wait to see the outcome

1705
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,120
We all chose correctly

1706
00:53:59,120 --> 00:53:59,960
It must be so

1707
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,120
Very confident

1708
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:01,680
I'm so curious

1709
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,400
Will everyone's choices

1710
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,600
be the same?

1711
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,400
Let's discuss first

1712
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,400
Come on

1713
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,520
I'm Modern Brothers Liu Yuning, everyone

1714
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,640
Liu Yuning from Modern Brothers is here

1715
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,280
Zhou Shen

1716
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,760
I'm still Zhou Keke

1717
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,000
Teacher Bai Yu

1718
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,680
Teacher Bai

1719
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,560
This is

1720
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,360
This is Teacher Song Zuer

1721
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,240
Hello

1722
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:19,960
It's you

1723
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,520
You're here again

1724
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,480
Hello

1725
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,120
INTO1's Zhou Keyu

1726
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,640
Right?

1727
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,080
Yes

1728
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,240
Awesome

1729
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,240
Brother

1730
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:28,640
Have a seat

1731
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,120
Brother

1732
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,680
You're so handsome

1733
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,120
Brother

1734
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,120
You have such youthful energy

1735
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,400
Real tea, real fruit bits

1736
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,400
Genuine deductive skills

1737
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,640
Real tea, real fruit

1738
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,120
The moment of truth

1739
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,960
With super delicious fruit bits

1740
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,040
Ruby grapefruit four seasons spring

1741
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,520
Let's uncover the truth together

1742
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,520
Everyone has already used the on-site information

1743
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,000
to identify their own "murderer"

1744
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,600
Is your choice correct?

1745
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,400
Hopefully it is

1746
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,160
Not sure

1747
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:01,520
Right now we're

1748
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,080
completely confused

1749
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:02,920
Right

1750
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,000
Players who vote correctly

1751
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,040
will receive a golden key

1752
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:14,920
Golden key

1753
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,280
What's it for?

1754
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,680
It can open golden locks

1755
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,440
For what purpose?

1756
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,400
Are you still

1757
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,000
this confident?

1758
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,240
Bro

1759
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,440
Among the players

1760
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,440
the "murderer" might be hiding

1761
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,960
If the "murderer" escapes

1762
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,840
they'll also get a golden key

1763
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,320
You'll definitely get one

1764
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,400
So it's possible that

1765
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,480
the "murderer" gets one

1766
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,440
and the players also get one

1767
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,440
No one thinks

1768
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,320
he's the "murderer"

1769
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,320
Or rather, those who think

1770
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,480
he's the "murderer" are the fewest

1771
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,200
pointed at the "murderer"

1772
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,400
then the "murderer" didn't escape

1773
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,080
So it's rare for the "murderer"

1774
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:43,720
Not really

1775
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,880
This logic

1776
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,760
is too confusing for us

1777
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,320
Our abilities

1778
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:47,640
Can we learn from

1779
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,520
Zhenguoli Hongyou Sijichun?

1780
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,560
Okay

1781
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,800
In this week's story

1782
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,200
Initially

1783
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,720
the suspects you identified were

1784
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,120
Later,

1785
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,160
the suspect list grew to include Jiajia.

1786
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:10,840
After voting,

1787
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,040
three people received votes.

1788
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,760
They are:

1789
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,120
Jiajia,

1790
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,000
Screenwriter Song,

1791
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,240
and Guo Baoyou.

1792
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,640
The vote for Jiajia came from

1793
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,600
Bai Sanwan.

1794
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,520
Just to encourage her, right?

1795
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,200
Is that what you meant?

1796
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,440
The vote for Guo Baoyou came from

1797
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,320
Song Piaoliang.

1798
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,640
Those who voted for Screenwriter Song

1799
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,240
are Teng Zhongjie,

1800
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,800
Liu Xialai,

1801
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,360
Zhou Keke,

1802
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,520
Guo Baoyou,

1803
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,880
and Ke Wuku.

1804
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,960
Brother, we truly are family,

1805
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,440
really.

1806
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,400
Why am I so stubborn about this?

1807
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,600
Next, we'll reveal the truth of Week 1's story

1808
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,400
"True or False Love."

1809
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,920
The real "culprit" is

1810
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,520
The real "culprit" is

1811
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,040
who?

1812
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,560
The real "culprit" is

1813
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,520
The true "murderer" is

1814
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,640
The regression has begun

1815
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,360
It's Screenwriter Song

1816
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,600
It was Screenwriter Song

1817
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,680
This plot

1818
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,240
Is it really this ordinary?

1819
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,880
You better hope it's ordinary

1820
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,800
Yes, exactly

1821
00:57:59,240 --> 00:57:59,920
No need to get too excited

1822
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,840
So happy

1823
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,760
Brother, let me summarize one thing

1824
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,480
"The Descendants of the Qiao Family" isn't for us

1825
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,800
That's the grandson of the Qiao family

1826
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,080
Descendants aren't suitable for us

1827
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,480
The decisive evidence everyone missed

1828
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,200
It was inside the rotating hidden compartment

1829
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,760
and on the doorframe of Room B

1830
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,600
bloodstained cat paw prints were left

1831
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,520
You three

1832
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,240
Didn't you search the hidden compartment several times?

1833
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:36,600
No

1834
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,080
We didn't see any cat paw prints

1835
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,120
So we missed this

1836
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,760
Why would there be a cat?

1837
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,280
The cat left the scene

1838
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,920
It must have been when a door opened

1839
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,440
That's the only way it could have left

1840
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,280
But the number of times doors opened at the scene

1841
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,120
was limited

1842
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,840
It corresponds to when suspects

1843
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,840
entered or exited

1844
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,760
So the cat must have followed

1845
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,080
one of the suspects

1846
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,160
or the "murderer"

1847
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,600
to leave the scene

1848
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,120
The cat prints that disappeared from Room A

1849
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,880
appeared in the hidden compartment

1850
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,160
and in Room B where

1851
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,200
the "murderer" had been

1852
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,200
The cat prints were very faint

1853
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,600
You had to look carefully

1854
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,240
to notice them

1855
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,120
We missed the cat prints

1856
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:17,880
in Room B

1857
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,800
Probably because

1858
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,640
they were too inconspicuous

1859
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,240
Too hard to notice

1860
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,360
I brought my dog for nothing

1861
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:24,800
Really

1862
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,840
Right, you should have let it sniff

1863
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,520
Sniff around

1864
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,040
and track

1865
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,800
All your knowledge about pets

1866
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,520
went to waste

1867
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,680
At 9 o'clock this morning,

1868
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,080
Screenwriter Song, based on Jiajia's previously

1869
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,560
publicly released manuscripts,

1870
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,120
imitated Jiajia's handwriting

1871
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,240
to leave a note for Zhenzhen.

1872
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,360
In the morning, Zhenzhen

1873
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,760
at the Zhenzhen Theater mailbox on the first floor

1874
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,840
retrieved the note

1875
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,920
and would go to the appointment in the afternoon.

1876
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,160
Before noon at 12 o'clock,

1877
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,960
Screenwriter Song took advantage of the empty theater

1878
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,280
to store his phone and enter the theater staff room.

1879
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,680
He secretly obtained

1880
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,840
boss Zhenzhen's phone,

1881
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,680
which could be brought into the theater.

1882
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,040
Inside, he found three

1883
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,280
boyfriends who had been in recent contact:

1884
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,000
Bai Sanwan,

1885
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,680
Guo Baoyou,

1886
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,640
and Cao Yangguang.

1887
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,560
He separately arranged to meet them at 1 PM

1888
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,560
at Theater 1,

1889
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,440
Theater 2,

1890
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,000
and Theater 3,

1891
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,600
and asked them to message him

1892
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,440
to meet at Theater 4.

1893
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,640
After they replied,

1894
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,120
Screenwriter Song deleted Zhenzhen's

1895
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,720
entire WeChat chat history

1896
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,440
to destroy the evidence.

1897
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,040
Screenwriter Song took away

1898
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,440
The theater staff monitored the computers in real-time

1899
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,920
constantly checking the surveillance

1900
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,600
to ensure everyone acted according to his plan

1901
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,560
He also took the circuit breaker remote

1902
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,240
This allowed him to remotely control

1903
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,080
the power outage in the hallway

1904
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,240
so that Zhenzhen, who knew the theater layout well,

1905
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,800
would be unable to see the room numbers

1906
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,400
in the dark hallway

1907
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,000
ensuring his trick of swapping room numbers

1908
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,920
wouldn't be exposed

1909
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:40,920
At 12:30

1910
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,440
everything was ready

1911
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,760
Screenwriter Song pressed the remote

1912
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,640
and rotated the theater walls

1913
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,800
for the first time

1914
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,080
causing the room numbers and theaters

1915
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,280
to mismatch

1916
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,040
Theater 1 and Theater 3 swapped numbers

1917
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,360
Theater 2 and Theater 4 swapped numbers

1918
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,440
Around 1:00 PM

1919
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,040
Screenwriter Song entered Door 4

1920
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,240
leaving his image on the viewer counter

1921
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,680
as proof of his entry

1922
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,280
After that, he stayed in the room

1923
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,960
quietly observing the other theaters

1924
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,400
At 12:56

1925
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,240
all three boyfriends had arrived

1926
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,800
So he used the circuit breaker remote

1927
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,560
to cut off the hallway's power

1928
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,960
The hallway lights went out completely

1929
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,440
Now the hallway was pitch black

1930
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,120
13:10

1931
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,920
Zhenzhen returns to the theater on time

1932
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,040
and enters the hallway

1933
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,520
After discovering the power outage

1934
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,520
Being very familiar with the theater's layout

1935
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,480
she relies on her innate sense of direction

1936
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,480
to feel her way to Theater 1

1937
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,600
Just as Screenwriter Song anticipated

1938
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,400
In the darkness, she doesn't notice

1939
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,080
that the entrance to Theater 1

1940
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,320
is labeled as Theater 3

1941
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,320
13:15

1942
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,920
Zhenzhen and Cao Yangguang leave the room one after another

1943
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,120
Zhenzhen goes to the dressing room to change

1944
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,120
13:20

1945
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,480
Zhenzhen comes to Theater 2 to meet Screenwriter Song

1946
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,080
Assuming Jiajia's identity

1947
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,960
she asks why Screenwriter Song came to see her

1948
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,360
"Haven't we already settled this?"

1949
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,520
"Why did you still ask to meet?"

1950
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,760
He pretends not to know she's Zhenzhen

1951
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,240
and begs her not to expose him

1952
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,440
"Would I really plagiarize?"

1953
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,680
13:25

1954
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,240
Zhenzhen leaves Theater 2 for the dressing room

1955
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,080
She doesn't notice

1956
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,440
that Screenwriter Song hasn't left the theater

1957
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,120
Screenwriter Song

1958
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,080
uses a smartwatch he smuggled in

1959
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,720
to message someone

1960
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,560
The chat records

1961
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,600
automatically sync to his phone

1962
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,240
This creates the illusion

1963
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,240
that he's already finished talking with Zhenzhen

1964
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,960
and left after retrieving his phone from the locker

1965
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,400
13:30

1966
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,200
After changing outfits

1967
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,160
Zhenzhen goes to Theater 4 to meet Guo Baoyou

1968
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,400
13:35

1969
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,360
Zhenzhen and Guo Baoyou leave the theater

1970
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,480
Zhenzhen goes to the dressing room to change

1971
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,880
After Guo Baoyou leaves

1972
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,720
while the hallway is empty

1973
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,920
Screenwriter Song rotates the theater walls for the second time

1974
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,160
so Zhenzhen gets caught by the audience counter

1975
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,640
entering Theater 1's door

1976
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,320
13:40

1977
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,520
Zhenzhen goes to Room A of Theater 1

1978
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,440
to meet Bai Sanwan

1979
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,200
but Bai Sanwan is actually in Room C of Theater 3

1980
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,440
Zhenzhen waits alone in the empty Theater 1

1981
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,000
Screenwriter Song takes the opportunity to rotate the theater walls for the third time

1982
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,840
causing the secret compartment to pass by Theater 2

1983
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,760
and enter the hidden compartment

1984
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,720
13:42

1985
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,080
He rotates the theater walls for the fourth time

1986
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,160
and passes through the one-way door of Theater 4

1987
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,640
charging into Theater 1

1988
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,320
stabbing her in the chest with a knife

1989
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:15,960
Afterwards,

1990
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,600
He then took advantage of the hidden compartment in the movable wall

1991
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,200
When it passed by Theater 1,

1992
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,680
and jumped onto the compartment again.

1993
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,920
The timing was perfect.

1994
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,240
At 1:44 PM,

1995
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,760
Screenwriter Song rotated the theater wall for the fifth time.

1996
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,880
As the hidden compartment passed Theater 2,

1997
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,040
he entered Theater 2.

1998
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,280
He left behind the trip remote control,

1999
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,200
the disconnected smartwatch,

2000
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,680
the theater staff's monitoring computer,

2001
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,320
and the "Hottest Drama" magazine

2002
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,960
he used to mimic Jiajia's handwriting in the compartment.

2003
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,360
Carrying the wall rotation remote,

2004
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,360
he cautiously exited the door.

2005
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,360
At Door 4's viewer counter,

2006
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,120
he left his exit record.

2007
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:53,560
At this moment,

2008
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,080
in the darkness,

2009
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:58,160
he sensed a man entering the theater corridor

2010
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,000
and entering Door 3,

2011
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,680
Room A.

2012
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,720
Two minutes later,

2013
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,440
the man left again.

2014
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,200
Shortly after, Bai Sanwan also exited Door 1,

2015
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,320
Room C.

2016
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,400
Screenwriter Song heard him leave the corridor.

2017
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,560
At 1:54 PM,

2018
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,320
Screenwriter Song rotated the theater wall for the sixth time,

2019
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,560
returning it to its original position.

2020
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,240
During the wall's rotation,

2021
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,760
he hid the remote

2022
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,040
in the door crack of Theater 1, the crime scene.

2023
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,680
He then waited in the darkness

2024
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,600
until the elevator area was empty.

2025
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,160
Seizing the opportunity, he quickly left the 8th floor,

2026
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,720
perfectly executing his plan.

2027
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,800
After his departure,

2028
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,680
Guo Baoyou, wanting to confront Jiajia again,

2029
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,440
and Bai Sanwan, who couldn't reach Zhenzhen by phone,

2030
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,840
both returned to the 8th-floor theater.

2031
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:50,120
hoping to see Zhenzhen and Jiajia reappear.

2032
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,280
All evidence is hidden at the crime scene.

2033
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,440
So next,

2034
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,280
I hope everyone can more carefully

2035
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,200
examine the scene.

2036
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,200
Don't miss any remaining clues.

2037
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:02,880
Okay.

2038
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,800
Next time we'll conduct a thorough search.

2039
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,720
Now,

2040
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,200
let's congratulate the players who voted correctly:

2041
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,680
Liu Xialai,

2042
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,880
Guo Baoyou,

2043
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,840
Zhou Keke,

2044
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,520
Ke Wuku,

2045
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,880
and Teng Zhongjie.

2046
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,520
Please collect your golden keys

2047
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,480
from the building model behind us.

2048
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,200
Let's deduce

2049
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,400
which one is the building model.

2050
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,160
Is it this staircase?

2051
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:25,840
Here we go.

2052
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:26,440
Fifth floor.

2053
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

2054
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,840
It's open.

2055
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,480
Opened.

2056
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,320
There are six keys.

2057
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,680
Can we take them ourselves?

2058
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,800
Yes, go ahead.

2059
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,920
You've earned them.

2060
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,040
You sound so cold.

2061
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,680
Brother says: "You take them."

2062
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,280
Go ahead.

2063
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:41,800
You take it.

2064
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,680
And you're shaking your leg.

2065
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,200
Take it.

2066
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,200
We'll work harder next time.

2067
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,520
Congratulations to all players

2068
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,200
for unlocking the 8th floor story of Apartment 11.

2069
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,200
There are more stories and spaces

2070
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,240
waiting to be unlocked.

2071
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,520
So currently only the 8th floor

2072
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,520
story is illuminated.

2073
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,120
And the 3rd floor is the platform.

2074
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,160
There are more stories

2075
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,040
waiting for us to discover.

2076
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:03,640
Let's go!

2077
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,720
Brother, we can do it.

2078
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,560
Okay.

2079
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:06,120
Keep it up.

2080
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:07,880
We can do it.

2081
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,760
Today's story

2082
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,360
is something that each of us

2083
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,920
finds quite challenging

2084
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,440
with all its intricate details

2085
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,080
and the perpetrator's methods are quite sophisticated

2086
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:20,520
Indeed

2087
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,520
So now

2088
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,720
let's invite Professor

2089
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,080
Ma Ai from China University of Political Science and Law

2090
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:25,480
an expert in criminal psychology

2091
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,240
Professor Ma Ai

2092
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,120
to help us

2093
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,160
analyze this case

2094
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:29,600
Welcome, Professor

2095
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:34,720
Hello, Teacher Ma

2096
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,600
Hello everyone

2097
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,920
You seem quite intimidating

2098
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,880
Just like during class when

2099
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:39,360
Stand up

2100
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,080
Good morning, teacher

2101
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:42,720
Good morning, students

2102
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,960
Please sit down

2103
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,920
I'm curious about one thing in particular

2104
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,760
The "Anti-Scum" alliance

2105
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:49,560
Yes

2106
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,120
Regarding matters of revenge

2107
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,280
From the perspective of love

2108
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,720
How should we analyze this?

2109
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,880
You'll notice that

2110
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,320
The "Anti-Scum" alliance

2111
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,240
Seems very righteous, doesn't it?

2112
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,080
And the "Anti-Scum" alliance's

2113
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,320
Motivations are good

2114
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,840
Their goals are good

2115
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,280
But what's slightly problematic is

2116
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,160
These matters should be left to

2117
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,280
The legal system

2118
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,040
Or moral judgment

2119
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,040
But now you're taking it upon yourself

2120
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,320
She's actually breaking the law too

2121
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,320
And might get herself in trouble

2122
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:14,840
Exactly

2123
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,680
It's somewhat counterproductive

2124
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,880
Often times

2125
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,240
Moral condemnation

2126
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,640
Is what we should all do

2127
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,400
But

2128
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,880
Revealing someone's privacy

2129
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,360
If exposed

2130
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,040
Or

2131
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,200
Using deceptive means

2132
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,680
To obtain information

2133
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,120
Yes

2134
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,560
That's somewhat questionable

2135
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,320
Right

2136
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,640
What do you all think qualifies as

2137
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,760
"playboys" and "playgirls"?

2138
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,040
If we're talking about this, I'm out.

2139
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:39,880
Don't want to speak carelessly.

2140
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,960
No one dares to speak carelessly.

2141
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,320
Professor Ma Ai,

2142
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,840
what kind of people do you think

2143
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,400
are "playboys and playgirls"?

2144
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,040
What do you consider to be

2145
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,320
what qualifies as

2146
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,360
This is entirely a matter of

2147
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,120
different perspectives.

2148
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:52,720
The wise see it differently.

2149
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,160
Exactly.

2150
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,920
But why do we need to

2151
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,000
label people as

2152
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,120
"playboys and playgirls"?

2153
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,760
This is fast-food mentality.

2154
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,120
This is a result of

2155
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,280
human evolution.

2156
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,880
Regarding what makes someone a "playboy/playgirl,"

2157
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,080
I always feel

2158
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,520
people are like kaleidoscopes.

2159
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,920
You can't just shake it twice,

2160
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,600
see two patterns,

2161
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,600
and completely dismiss them.

2162
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,520
They might have their own

2163
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,399
shining qualities.

2164
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:19,240
Exactly.

2165
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:20,399
We should still

2166
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:21,600
try to be relatively

2167
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,720
comprehensive

2168
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,680
in understanding someone.

2169
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,040
Don't label someone just because

2170
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,200
they didn't meet your expectations.

2171
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,960
Don't casually label people.

2172
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:31,359
Of course,

2173
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,120
what I'm describing is a social phenomenon,

2174
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,120
and it's different from

2175
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:34,840
the deliberate

2176
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,880
"playboys/playgirls" who might

2177
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,240
truly exist in our case.

2178
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,160
These calculated manipulators

2179
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:39,920
are different.

2180
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,520
We're discussing social phenomena here.

2181
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,640
In criminal psychology,

2182
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,560
cases solely due to

2183
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,040
incompatible views on relationships

2184
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,319
such "murderers"

2185
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:49,920
do they account for a high proportion?

2186
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,080
There are two aspects:

2187
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,399
During premarital dating phase,

2188
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,399
due to this kind of

2189
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:56,439
relationship incompatibility

2190
01:08:56,439 --> 01:08:57,840
actual murders are rare,

2191
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,000
but I must warn you,

2192
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,359
suicides are more common.

2193
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:02,359
First,

2194
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:03,800
they want to prove they're right,

2195
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,319
second,

2196
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:05,760
they want to punish them,

2197
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,920
punish this so-called "scumbag",

2198
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,080
and third,

2199
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:09,920
more likely

2200
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:10,920
it's related to insufficient psychological resilience

2201
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,479
still connected to lack of psychological resilience

2202
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:13,240
leading to some

2203
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,000
psychological

2204
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,439
unhealthy phenomena

2205
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:17,319
being strongly correlated.

2206
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,960
Post-marriage murders due to

2207
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,319
incompatible relationship views

2208
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,319
have become

2209
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:23,840
quite rare in recent years.

2210
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,080
Although in our case,

2211
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,319
after reviewing our story,

2212
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:28,800
we found a "culprit",

2213
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,640
but in cases like this,

2214
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,000
with someone like Bai Sanwan,

2215
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,200
who illegally modified

2216
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:33,920
a motorcycle,

2217
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,200
and then his good friend

2218
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,240
rode that motorcycle

2219
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,720
and died,

2220
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,040
right.

2221
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:38,439
In such situations,

2222
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:40,560
did Bai Sanwan break the law?

2223
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:40,920
Does he bear

2224
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,399
legal responsibility?

2225
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:43,920
Bai Sanwan's violation

2226
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,040
or crime?

2227
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,880
Let me explain it this way:

2228
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,920
If you modify a motor vehicle,

2229
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,160
that itself is indeed illegal

2230
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,439
because our country's

2231
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:57,120
"Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China"

2232
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,760
clearly stipulates

2233
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,360
that modifications to motor vehicles'

2234
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,120
structure and design

2235
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:02,960
are not permitted.

2236
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:03,680
But secondly,

2237
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,640
the most crucial point is,

2238
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,080
if I knew that

2239
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,160
Guo Qilin often rides my bike when I'm away

2240
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,800
and I modified it,

2241
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,400
then it would clearly be

2242
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,680
premeditated

2243
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,040
"murder."

2244
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:16,800
Right.

2245
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,400
I knew

2246
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,720
that after modification,

2247
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,480
someone unfamiliar with it

2248
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,960
might have an accident while riding it.

2249
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,280
Right.

2250
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,600
If I locked

2251
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,440
this bike with three heavy locks

2252
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,200
inside my house,

2253
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,520
and this person stole it

2254
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,280
and rode it,

2255
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,160
then I wouldn't be responsible,

2256
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:32,960
because

2257
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,040
I wouldn't be at fault in that case.

2258
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,680
But if you place it in

2259
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,120
a place where it can easily be stolen

2260
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,800
then you're negligent

2261
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,600
and you'll bear criminal responsibility

2262
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,080
You should have foreseen

2263
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,040
that your modified vehicle could be taken by others

2264
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,560
leading to a traffic accident

2265
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,120
with vehicles destroyed and lives lost

2266
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,560
You should have anticipated

2267
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,800
but you failed to do so

2268
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,000
Or you were overconfident

2269
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,120
that it could be avoided

2270
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:58,760
In such cases

2271
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,440
it would constitute

2272
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,600
a criminal offense

2273
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:00,960
Therefore

2274
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,080
this motorcycle must be secured with

2275
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,560
Shen Shen's three heavy locks

2276
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,480
and properly locked up

2277
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,600
So Bai Sanwan

2278
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,160
didn't lock it securely enough

2279
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,240
I hid it in a warehouse

2280
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,280
Right, hiding it in a warehouse is fine

2281
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,480
But psychologically

2282
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,680
I can't get past it

2283
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,520
Psychologically there's

2284
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,840
deep guilt

2285
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,880
Shen Shen feels guilty again

2286
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,040
Who is Shen Shen?

2287
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:21,800
Shen Shen

2288
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,120
Yes

2289
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,960
His name is Shen Shen

2290
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,040
He is Shen Shen

2291
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,280
This is awkward

2292
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:27,760
Classmates

2293
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,680
Let's ask Teacher Ma a question

2294
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,680
Stump him

2295
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:30,320
Stump him

2296
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:30,960
Quick, stump him

2297
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:31,680
Pretty good

2298
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,200
That copy of yours

2299
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,400
was posted online

2300
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,560
I'd like to consult with you about

2301
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,640
this Guo Baoyou

2302
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,760
While I was inside

2303
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,360
I got into a relationship

2304
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,320
My girlfriend's name is Jiajia

2305
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,880
She didn't admit it

2306
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,880
Why are you still here with me now?

2307
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,840
This is where you made us slip up

2308
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,480
You dated Jiajia for a while

2309
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,800
Yes, I was in a relationship with Jiajia

2310
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,440
Of course

2311
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,240
Her sister (Zhenzhen) was extremely

2312
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:52,920
arbitrary

2313
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:53,400
Her sister (Zhenzhen)

2314
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:53,920
suddenly decided

2315
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,680
that I was a

2316
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,280
"scumbag"

2317
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,400
and insisted on exposing me

2318
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,160
and persuaded her sister (Jiajia)

2319
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,240
not to be with me

2320
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:58,800
Here's what happened

2321
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,040
Because I couldn't tell the sisters apart

2322
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,760
I mistook her (Zhenzhen) for

2323
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,280
the younger sister (Jiajia)

2324
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,160
So I shared many of my

2325
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:03,600
secrets

2326
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,720
with her

2327
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,720
I'm a novelist

2328
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,440
I gave her my manuscripts

2329
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,000
But without my permission

2330
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:09,920
she posted my manuscripts

2331
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,320
online

2332
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,240
To humiliate him

2333
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,880
Yes, no need to elaborate

2334
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,320
To get revenge on him

2335
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,120
Basically to tell him

2336
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,080
his writing sucks

2337
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,240
I'm not talking about you

2338
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,840
I mean Guo Baoyou

2339
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,520
Right

2340
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,560
So regarding this matter

2341
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,040
would you say this constitutes infringement?

2342
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,440
Of course it's infringement

2343
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,520
Confiscate illegal gains

2344
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,560
Order him to cease infringement

2345
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,280
and may impose

2346
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,680
a fine up to 100,000 yuan

2347
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,040
This is what the copyright administrative department

2348
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:33,960
can do

2349
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,040
For serious cases

2350
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,360
the copyright administrative department

2351
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,320
may confiscate

2352
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,280
the main equipment

2353
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,440
used for internet access

2354
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,600
such as computers

2355
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,400
If it constitutes a crime

2356
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,000
criminal liability shall be investigated

2357
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,440
Teacher, I

2358
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,360
suddenly have a question

2359
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:50,960
Tell me

2360
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,800
For example, in the show

2361
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,040
there's this person

2362
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,560
Guo Baoyou

2363
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,240
who followed a thousand women home at night

2364
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,880
back to their homes

2365
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,840
What kind of behavior is this?

2366
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,320
I can't...

2367
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,000
Let's not talk about this question

2368
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,240
This question makes me sound like a "pervert"

2369
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,040
No

2370
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:08,800
But I think

2371
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,680
this needs to be discussed

2372
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,680
The first time

2373
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:14,320
it might be accidental

2374
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:14,960
The second time

2375
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:15,720
The third time

2376
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,680
I think you should

2377
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,840
report it to the police

2378
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:18,960
I know

2379
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,040
You see, continuous stalking

2380
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,040
What do you mean by stalking?

2381
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,400
Continuous escorting

2382
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:23,960
Yes, continuous escorting

2383
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,560
would only cause trouble

2384
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,800
So to avoid

2385
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,600
getting sued

2386
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,440
change targets daily

2387
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,840
But I think

2388
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,480
if you do this

2389
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,120
then psychologically

2390
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:35,880
I must be sick

2391
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,560
a little bit messed up

2392
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,520
Not me

2393
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,680
He's that mystery novelist

2394
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,600
Not me

2395
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,000
If Qilin does this every night

2396
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,680
keeps doing this

2397
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,760
Wouldn't he be exhausted to death?

2398
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,120
After we're done here

2399
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:48,920
I still have to give someone a ride home

2400
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:49,480
Still have to drive them

2401
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,480
Today it's Liu Yuning from Modern Brothers

2402
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,760
When did you stop driving girls home?

2403
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,680
Really? Is that so?

2404
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,920
Now you're driving boys instead

2405
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:54,600
If there were a girl

2406
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,240
following me every day

2407
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,760
I'd give her Bai Yu's address

2408
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,120
You violated privacy rights

2409
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,200
Throughout the entire story

2410
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:01,880
Professor Ma Ai

2411
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,280
Do you still have

2412
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:02,560
any

2413
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,480
particular points you'd like us to pay more attention to

2414
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,240
some details?

2415
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,560
In this case

2416
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,560
what's one key point we should especially note

2417
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:10,280
what is it?

2418
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,240
Often there are times

2419
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,160
when our intentions are good

2420
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,320
but you must remember

2421
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,880
the methods you use

2422
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,600
to achieve your goals

2423
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,120
are equally important

2424
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,760
First, don't break the law yourself

2425
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,040
You can seek legal remedies

2426
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,280
through organizations or institutions

2427
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:26,960
for protection

2428
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,400
Such remedies

2429
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,040
You must never resort to

2430
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,280
excessive self-help remedies

2431
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,280
Punishing someone

2432
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,280
especially personal punishment

2433
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,640
or damaging someone's reputation

2434
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,600
is never an individual's right

2435
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,120
It's the state's right

2436
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,360
the law's right, correct?

2437
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,600
If everyone believes in

2438
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,520
the law

2439
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,320
then the law can protect you

2440
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,040
Alright

2441
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,200
Thank you

2442
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:50,960
Professor Ma

2443
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,240
Thank you, Professor Ma

2444
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,200
Let's thank Professor Ma once again

2445
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,440
Thank you, Professor Ma

2446
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:54,920
Okay, thank you

2447
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:55,880
Let's all say together

2448
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,440
our show's name, alright?

2449
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,120
Let's meet next week

2450
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,880
on "Let's Start Reasoning"

2451
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:10,280
This apartment is truly a mysterious place

2452
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,480
Stay away from the abandoned power distribution room

2453
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,080
Disobedience will lead to "death"

2454
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,480
Someone has "died"

2455
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:16,440
It must be "murder"

2456
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,520
There's a knife and a cat on his desk

2457
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,320
He must have been "killing" pets all along

2458
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,320
This "scumbag couple plotted murder for money"

2459
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,720
If you dare expose my secret

2460
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,840
I'll make you disappear from this world

2461
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,520
Then he deserves it

2462
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,520
He should "die"

2463
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,520
You can find time anytime

2464
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,720
To "kill" him, right?

2465
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,360
Of course I want to "kill" him

2466
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,200
I'll make my move early

2467
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,400
You're using us

2468
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,320
I didn't know about this

2469
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,200
You're lying

2470
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,080
There might be some secret hidden here

2471
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,120
Help!

2472
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,000
Why should I tell you?

2473
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:45,440
Get out!

2474
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,760
Look at this symbol

2475
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,400
The one that threatened us

2476
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,800
Bai Sanwan and I are in mortal danger

2477
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,240
Could we have been hypnotized?

2478
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,640
Being used as someone's pawn

2479
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,040
A mask wearing human skin

2480
01:15:58,800 --> 01:15:59,480
Are you crazy?

2481
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,880
What nonsense are you spouting?

2482
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,640
At this very moment

2483
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,200
I might not believe what he's saying either

2484
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,200
With such intelligence, why not do something good?

2485
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,880
Why "kill" people?

2486
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,360
This is a "perverted peeping tom's" bedroom

2487
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,080
There's a long-haired person

2488
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:11,720
Hiding

2489
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:12,400
Behind the sofa

2490
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,560
There's no one under here, right?

2491
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,880
Kinda feels like "Parasite"

2492
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,560
What?

2493
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:18,840
This...

2494
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:19,320
Chase him!

2495
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,360
So he's the one with split personality

2496
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:23,440
He went down

2497
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,640
There never was a Liu Xialai

2498
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,680
Why is there a woman crying?

2499
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,120
My thoughts on this plot

2500
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,560
The strongest impression is actually

2501
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,440
We shouldn't judge based solely on our limited understanding

2502
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,320
or partial knowledge

2503
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,560
and hastily conclude that one side is wrong

2504
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,000
When we do anything, we must

2505
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:56,800
Think it through carefully

2506
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,000
We must take responsibility for this matter

2507
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,240
As the saying goes, no investigation, no right to speak

2508
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,880
Of course, it's also because nowadays

2509
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,360
The cost of voicing opinions is too low

2510
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,720
Everyone can

2511
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,280
on all channels and platforms

2512
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,320
Then go and

2513
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,840
share your own perspectives and opinions

2514
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,240
regardless of whether your views

2515
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,080
are correct or not

2516
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,160
In relationships,

2517
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,560
try to communicate promptly

2518
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,600
and handle emotional issues rationally

2519
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,600
Don't seek revenge

2520
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,640
I believe a healthy view on love

2521
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,720
should mean that in this relationship

2522
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:28,000
I can comfortably be myself

2523
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,360
And I think the most important thing is liking

2524
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,800
whether you genuinely

2525
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,640
can appreciate this person from start to finish

2526
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,320
No matter what he appreciates about you,

2527
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,400
so I believe whether it's

2528
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,400
a romantic relationship or family relationship,

2529
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,560
the most important thing is

2530
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,400
letting you be happily yourself.

2531
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,000
Then you'll feel that being with this person

2532
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,400
is very comfortable.

2533
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,920
I think the most crucial point is

2534
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,480
no matter how much you love someone,

2535
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,520
you must still maintain your independence.

2536
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,320
When we ourselves

2537
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,520
are liked in that moment,

2538
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,080
it must be because of

2539
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,600
the shining qualities we possess

2540
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,920
that attracted that person.

2541
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:02,520
Not because

2542
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,760
we conform to that person

2543
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,760
to become what they want to like,

2544
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,560
because then you've lost yourself.

2545
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,080
I believe when two people are in love,

2546
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,400
no matter the circumstances,

2547
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,000
it's best to part on good terms,

2548
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,200
giving each other a bright future

2549
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:16,920
and mutual blessings.

2550
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,480
I think this is the best approach.

2551
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,680
If too extreme methods are used,

2552
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,480
like what happened today,

2553
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,280
that's not good.
