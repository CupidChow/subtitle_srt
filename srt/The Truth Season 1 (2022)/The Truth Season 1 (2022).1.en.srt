1
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,680
2022

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,880
We found a house on the beach.

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,160
A building with a strange shape.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,560
It faces the sea.

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,720
Remain aloof from the world

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,840
The silent pane

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,960
Well-proportioned

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,600
The dark corridor.

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,400
And covered with dust.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,120
Footsteps with echoes.

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,280
And a sudden meowing.

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,720
The mysterious atmosphere

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,840
One second to the top.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,800
You can't help but imagine

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,280
What will happen?

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,960
So we spent nearly a hundred days

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
Built a

18
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,760
The new drama world.

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,120
More than 1,000 drawings.

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
With exquisite craftsmanship.

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,120
The scene of 20,000 square meters is totally new.

22
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,640
About 100 characters.

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,000
Interlocking

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,000
To form 200,000 characters.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,560
"Urban Fables"

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,240
In the next few days,

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,720
Let's enter together.

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,960
In this drama world,

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,000
To follow the mysterious new tenants.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,320
To meet all kinds of apartment residents.

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,920
To unlock the mysteries.

32
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,400
To explore the building together.

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,080
The hidden ultimate truth.

34
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,200
The new tenants who are about to move in.

35
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,960
The murderer turned things upside down.

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,520
To hide something.

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,080
But I think

38
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,600
In turn, you can hide something.

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,160
I already know who the murderer is.

40
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,000
Why is there a cat?

41
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,440
The real fruit, red pomelo, the Spring Festival.

42
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,560
The real fruit, red pomelo, the Spring Festival.

43
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,840
Start reasoning.

44
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,320
It's made of real tea, real fruit,

45
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,240
The real fruit, red pomelo, the Spring Festival.

46
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,480
To be broadcast under the title.

47
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,640
To "Start Reasoning."

48
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,720
Please answer the following questions.

49
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,360
Do you have the following characteristics?

50
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,800
multiple-choice question

51
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,000
bold

52
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,680
Take risks.

53
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,560
I have the guts.

54
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,560
I don't know.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,880
You have to be bold.

56
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,600
My guts are normal size.

57
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,720
Take risks.

58
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,200
You can take risks.

59
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,200
I guess I'm more adventurous.

60
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,320
Interesting soul. You must have it.

61
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,880
Yeah, funnywoman can't lose.

62
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,920
With curiosity,

63
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,840
I have this.

64
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,520
You have a smart brain.

65
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,400
I have a brain.

66
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,520
Is he wise or not?

67
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,200
Opinions differ

68
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,600
With an interesting soul.

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,080
I have a soul.

70
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,160
It seems to be round.

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,920
Is wisdom.

72
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,440
Yes

73
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,880
The brain doesn't have

74
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,280
I like reasoning games.

75
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,880
Of course I like this.

76
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,520
because

77
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,480
Such as Detective Conan.

78
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:16,840
I have...

79
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,000
Know all the cases inside.

80
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,400
I think...

81
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,000
curious

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,720
And I like reasoning games.

83
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
I can't guarantee anything else.

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,320
You have a smart brain.

85
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,080
Without wisdom,

86
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,120
Why do you say that?

87
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,120
No one says he's smart.

88
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,760
No way

89
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,440
No,

90
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,320
Yes

91
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,680
You have a smart brain.

92
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,800
With an interesting soul.

93
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,680
I can't answer them.

94
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,000
Why are you talking so much?

95
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,320
This is my resume.

96
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,600
Why did you put my resume on it?

97
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,320
I'm ready.

98
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,440
Start reasoning.

99
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,840
Start reasoning.

100
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
Start reasoning.

101
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,400
Start reasoning.

102
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,800
Start reasoning.

103
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,080
This season, through eleven weeks,

104
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,280
To tell the story of what happened in the apartment of Tuishi 11.

105
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,880
Six players will be the new residents.

106
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,520
Check into Apartment 11.

107
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,680
They will be involved in a mysterious case.

108
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,960
By forming the Apartment Reasoning Team,

109
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
To different floors.

110
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,680
To meet different old residents.

111
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,280
To solve the enigma of their respective parentage.

112
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,640
To explore the secrets behind the case.

113
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,440
The first six cases

114
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,880
Will unlock the story of a new tenant every week.

115
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,080
The intricate relationship between the old and the new.

116
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,360
Will surface.

117
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,120
Since the Seventh Case,

118
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
All the stories are interwoven and combined.

119
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520
As the truth is revealed,

120
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,400
For the new residents.

121
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,840
Will affect the story.

122
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,320
The development direction and the final outcome.

123
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,320
In every case,

124
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,160
The Reasoning Team needs to

125
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,920
Find the identity of the deceased.

126
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,720
And identify the suspects according to the clues.

127
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,280
Be careful

128
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,640
Suspects are not limited to

129
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,200
The interior of Apartment 11.

130
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,680
And visitors.

131
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,960
It's possible in the reasoning group.

132
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,560
There are suspects.

133
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
After gathering the suspects,

134
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,080
They will be questioned by the reasoning team.

135
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,960
And based on the testimony,

136
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,080
The final vote to lock the "real murderer"

137
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,320
Only the real murderer can lie.

138
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,520
Only by finding the real murderer,

139
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,600
The player wins.

140
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,600
The player who voted correctly

141
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,160
Can get a golden key.

142
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,000
If the player is the murderer,

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,040
You will get a golden key if you escape.

144
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,520
This is the market.

145
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,800
On the seashore of the city lies

146
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,160
Apartment No. 11 is commercial and residential.

147
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,520
You can eat here.

148
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,640
You can go shopping.

149
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,880
You can have leisure and entertainment.

150
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,360
Of course

151
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,440
You can't miss it.

152
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,880
All kinds of residents.

153
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,560
And a professional property management team.

154
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,919
The working soul.

155
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,880
I'm a good worker.

156
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
And I...

157
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,200
Is one of them.

158
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,159
The intern manager of Apartment 11.

159
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,600
Xiao He.

160
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,520
Welcome to the push market.

161
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,200
Let's start reasoning in apartment 11.

162
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,040
Hello

163
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,360
Your dog.

164
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,440
yes

165
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,320
What's his name?

166
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,440
Called barley.

167
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,360
barley

168
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,000
that's right

169
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,440
"please come in"

170
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:18,960
Hello

171
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,200
Hello

172
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,280
Are you the tenant here today?

173
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,320
Check in.

174
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,840
Me and I

00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,480
It's time for you.

176
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,200
Agent Teng has made an appointment.

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,160
Come here, please.

Then we're here.

Agent Teng, hello.

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,640
Hello, everyone.

184
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,680
Welcome to No.11.

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,280
apartment

186
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,320

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,680
I am.

188
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,400
Everyone loves it.

189
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,040
Agent Teng.

190
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,360
Fang Hai is boundless.

191
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
We can meet again.

192
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,400
That's fate.

193
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,320
sit

194
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,240
Everyone is tired from the journey.

195
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,520
Do you really want to

196
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,160
To see our house.

197
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,080
yes

198
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,360
You sell pirated CDs.

199
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,120
Are all here.

200
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,880
Hurry up.

201
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,120
Everyone and I

202
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
We met online.

203
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,080
We all know their screen names.

204
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
Actually,

205
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,960
I can't match the numbers.

206
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,440
Let's check the numbers.

207
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,840
Room 702.

208
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,120
Household nickname

209
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,440
To make cocoa.

210
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,240
Zhou Keke can do anything.

211
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,280
It's you, isn't it?

212
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,760
Yes

213
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,600
I'm a chocolate maker.

214
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,320
People like to eat chocolate.

215
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,000
You can come to me.

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,600
That's great.

217
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,240
Room 608.

218
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,520
And wrap it up.

219
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,680
I

220
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,520
And wrap it up.

221
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,240
You're right.

222
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,960
My name is...

223
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,680
Guo Baoyu.

224
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,520
Northeast

225
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,240
What do I mean?

226
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,200
I'm a man blessed by Bao Qingtian.

227
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,280
Because I'm a mystery writer.

228
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,800
So I think

229
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,240
Bao Qingtian has been in the dark.

230
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,880
Bless me.

231
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,000
What is your representative work?

232
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,800
It hasn't been written yet.

233
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,880
I came here to

234
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,160
And write in this place.

235
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,080
Not every writer

236
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,120
Are all representative works.

237
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,600
It's also possible that I won't be

238
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,680
Room 602.

239
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,720
Savadika

240
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,160
I

241
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,760
Yes

242
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,680
Three bowls of delivery cards.

243
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,520
Because I'm the owner of a noodle restaurant.

244
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,440
As long as you have eaten three bowls of noodles in my restaurant,

245
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,200
I will give you

246
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,400
My membership card.

247
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,480
Since we have become neighbors,

248
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,600
I'll give you a membership card.

249
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,840
What's the use of the membership card?

250
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,320
Yes, what can I do?

251
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,040
to give a discount

252
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,480
Room 605 is beautiful.

253
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,200
This must be

254
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,760
It must be her.

255
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,520
Simple words but deep meaning

256
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
Is beautiful.

257
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,800
I'm a craftsman.

258
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,280
Obviously, these dresses

259
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,360
I made them myself.

260
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,000
Then I hooked one myself.

261
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,640
FLOWER

262
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,320
I hope you can be well in the future.

263
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,200
To take care of us.

264
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,880
This is the time to give gifts.

265
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,480
Room number 401.

266
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,320
You are the most beautiful cloud in my horizon.

267
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,920
Let me take care of you.

268
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,840
It's me.

269
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm Liu Xia.

270
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,960
Why are you saying that?

271
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,040
I'm a

272
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,200
Pet foster care worker.

273
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,400
You're so tall.

274
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,400
It's too high to see you down.

275
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:26,800
come down

276
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,440
that's right

277
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,760
This was fostered by someone else.

278
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,680
Room 406.

279
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,600
K-u-ku

280
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
I

281
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,880
That's not K-u-ku.

282
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,120
It's K-u-ku.

283
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,720
I'm a

284
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,920
unemployed person

285
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,000
You're always doing whatever you want.

286
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,520
What's the job now?

287
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,000
Why are you wearing Tang San today?

288
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,760
I just got this

289
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,920
A role-playing exhibition.

290
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,400
And I didn't have time to change.

291
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
You need to check in first.

292
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,840
Three words for you.

293
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
K-u-ku

294
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,160
Brother Teng, as far as I remember,

295
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,240
It seems that

296
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,360
Do they have any discount?

297
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,040
To me.

298
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,680
I was about to say

299
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,040
I was about to say

300
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,200
I didn't mean a 50 percent discount.

301
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,840
There's a 50 percent discount voucher.

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,040
Remember that

303
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,360
Yes

304
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,800
We have to take this.

305
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
This is important.

306
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,760
I thought you might forget to use it.

307
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,560
cannot

308
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,000
It's the only temptation you have here.

309
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
A 50 percent discount.

310
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,840
Alright.

311
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,080
That Xiao Zhe

312
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,840
Little fold.

313
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,760
It's a small discount.

314
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,480
Yes, Xiao He.

315
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,400
Show them the houses.

316
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,240
no problem

317
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,040
I hope you can enjoy it.

318
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,960
For you.

319
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,240
Some of the rooms

320
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,160
A little design.

321
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,280
A little design.

322
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,560
Don't say anything if you can't think of it.

323
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,880
Stop it.

324
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,280
Everyone, follow me.

325
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,160
Everyone, look this way.

326
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,560
This is one of our bulletin boards.

327
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,760
Are these the owners who have checked in?

328
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,320
Yes, this is the owner.

329
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,080
And above is our agent Teng.

330
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,920
He's the golden agent on our side.

331
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,160
The gold medalist.

332
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,080
Everyone, please look at this poster.

333
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,720
Big star.

334
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,800
The drama queen.

335
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,640
This investigation

336
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,160
But on the eighth floor of our building,

337
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,600
She opened a theater.

338
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,600
It's so beautiful.

339
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,560
And this is a detective.

340
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,440
The next play

341
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,960
That's amazing.

342
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,360
I've seen this play.

343
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,520
The number of offspring increases every year.

344
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,640
How to sing that song?

345
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:16,960
I've heard of it.

346
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,800
What life?

347
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,000
You should face the storm.

348
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,480
Life is so wet.

349
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,360
Then this way.

350
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,600
It's one of our elevator rooms.

351
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,400
This side is ours.

352
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,600
A place to store couriers.

353
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,920
And then there's the vending machine.

354
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,200
It has our

355
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,120
The real fruit, red pomelo, the Spring Festival.

356
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,840
The dog can be put here.

357
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
This little house has a owner.

358
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,560
Who is it?

359
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
It's from our side.

360
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,320
Meow Mews's apartment.

361
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,560
Is there a cat here?

362
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,000
But it usually stays in the apartment.

363
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,600
Walking around.

364
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,880
It will come back when you're tired.

365
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,760
Let's get on the elevator.

366
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,840
Next, I'll show you the room.

367
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,920
Please come in.

368
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,600
Is everyone here?

369
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,400
Is there anyone else out there?

370
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,080
to be dead

371
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,800
a row

372
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,840
Then let's go.

373
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,800
Isn't that

374
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,960
Detective.

375
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,000
We were investigating.

376
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,160
yes

377
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,440
The fourth floor is here.

378
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,480
The fourth floor is Liu Xia's Ke Wu Cool.

379
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,800
This is mine

380
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,960
406

381
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,760
My room is so cool.

382
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,120
401

383
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,480
This is my home.

384
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,920
This is great.

385
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,680
I'm 608.

386
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,800
This is mine

387
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,080
Your room is fine.

388
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,040
It's cool.

389
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,960
Should I tell you about my room?

390
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,840
It's really beautiful.

391
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:45,880
come

392
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,720
I'll take you to see

393
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,960
Zhou Keke's room.

394
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,920
My room.

395
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,280
Because it's a super invincible

396
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,440
The luxurious viewing room.

397
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,080
Yes

398
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,560
This is the scenery.

399
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,640
Please come in.

400
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,640
Agent Teng.

401
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,160
What about

402
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,120
Do you still like the environment?

403
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,320
Isn't this great?

404
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,120
This is what I imagined.

405
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,520
The chocolate factory.

406
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,920
Master Zhou.

407
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,280
It must be a good business.

408
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,520
Is our VIP client.

409
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:23,960
not bad

410
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,680
Your order.

411
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,360
This is one of our rare ocean view rooms.

412
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,480
I'm here to give you the key.

413
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,440
Brother Teng.

414
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,160
Please serve the client first.

415
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,960
I have something to do downstairs.

416
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,400
All right, thank you.

417
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,320
See you later.

418
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,960
Bye

419
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,680
The most important thing is here.

420
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,040
Come on, babies.

421
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,400
The Invincible Seascape.

422
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,840
Come. Come and look at this.

423
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,920
Let's look far away.

424
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,000
This castle

425
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,960
There was a famous movie.

426
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,360
It's called The Richest Man in Xihong City.

427
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
To get the scenery here.

428
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,680
This is like a castle, right?

429
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,360
main

430
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,920
No, you can look this way.

431
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,640
The scenery is good.

432
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,080
below

433
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,680
What? What is it?

434
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,240
Is that a person?

435
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,760
She fell alone.

436
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Why didn't I see it?

437
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,319
No,

438
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:12,880
impossible

439
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,280
How could we fall?

440
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,960
How could we lose people?

441
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,400
No,

442
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,880
Is there?

443
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,520
Look down. Is there?

444
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:23,920
people

445
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,480
She fell and died.

446
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,119
Right?

447
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,480
yes

448
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,400
There's a girl.

449
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,120
There's a red dress lying there.

450
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,800
Someone jumped off the building, right?

451
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Someone jumped downstairs.

452
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,400
The falling incident

453
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,840
Falling from the sky,

454
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
We're not staying.

455
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,560
You're the murderer.

456
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,320
Why didn't I see it?

457
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,320
Agent Teng, it's not safe.

458
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,960
We have elevators and stairs.

459
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,640
There are fire exits.

460
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,000
It's impossible to get down from here.

461
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,280
Who is there?

462
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,000
A woman jumped. I saw it.

463
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,600
hallucination

464
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,280
Didn't you just see

465
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,640
What color clothes to wear.

466
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,720
It's red.

467
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,280
impossible

468
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,760
Really

469
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,240
impossible

470
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,760
It's impossible for us to jump.

471
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,080
Why don't we go down and have a look?

472
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,920
Let's go down and have a look.

473
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,280
go

474
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,920
Let's go and look out the window.

475
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Only I didn't see it.

476
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,960
You really didn't see it?

477
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,320
I really didn't see it.

478
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,400
No

479
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,600
Didn't you see someone fall?

480
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,640
Did anyone fall?

481
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,520
Yes

482
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,360
I didn't see it.

483
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,800
Did someone jump just now?

484
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,680
to jump from a building

485
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,280
No one jumped from the building.

486
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,840
I've been sweeping the floor.

487
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
I remember it was left

488
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,760
Isn't it here?

489
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,400
Nothing.

490
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,320
This is the place.

491
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,880
Right?

492
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,960
Even the position is the same.

493
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,480
No one

494
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,920
This is the window.

495
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,480
No one

496
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Did anyone fall?

497
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,280
I didn't see it.

498
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,000
No one jumped from the building.

499
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,440
I've been sweeping the floor.

500
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,240
That's too weird.

501
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,400
There's something wrong with the people here.

502
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,600
There must be something wrong.

503
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,240
To hide the corpse.

504
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,720
Where did they hide him?

505
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,680
It's windy here.

506
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,560
Let's go inside.

507
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,480
Let's go there.

508
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,880
Come back.

509
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,800
It's good to eat more.

510
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,280
So what happened?

511
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,560
Someone fell down just now.

512
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,000
There's a man in red.

513
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,920
I was standing here just now.

514
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,480
I'm reviewing.

515
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,000
Why are you studying here?

516
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,320
Because this side is big,

517
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,080
It's easy to recite.

518
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,960
I don't want to disturb the guests in the public area.

519
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,920
Are you new here?

520
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,400
Let me tell you something.

521
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,120
What's up

522
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,480
Apartment No.11

523
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,240
Has been acting weird.

524
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,360
Is it strange?

525
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,400
I can always hear it in the middle of the night.

526
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,440
There's a woman crying.

527
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,960
But they didn't hear it.

528
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,560
A woman's cry

529
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,360
Stop it.

530
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,800
Don't scare the client with your nonsense.

531
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,720
We didn't.

532
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,840
Believe in science.

533
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,120
I really heard it.

534
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,600
There's really a woman crying.

535
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,320
Let's go.

536
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,840
Stop it.

537
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,400
What's your name?

538
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
My name is Hao Bao Jie.

539
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,360
Hao Bajie.

540
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,680
Don't bother about the cleaner.

541
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,760
The cleaner is so weird.

542
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,920
It's weird.

543
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,040
It's so weird.

544
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,320
Apartment 11.

545
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,400
Waiting for your arrival.

546
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,000
what

547
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,440
No

548
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,360
want

549
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,080
Huai

550
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,640
Doubt

551
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,840
you

552
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,560
see

553
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,520
reach

554
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,320
of

555
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,440
Is the key.

556
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,240
as soon as possible

557
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
look for

558
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,280
reach

559
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,920
Truth

560
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,960
otherwise

561
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,200
you

562
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,240
Metropolis

563
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,640
"Dead."

564
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,040
"Dead."

565
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,080
Or we will die.

566
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,440
So what you just saw is the truth.

567
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,840
That is to say

568
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,520
Don't doubt it.

569
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,720
What we saw

570
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,560
What we saw

571
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,120
Someone fell off.

572
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,560
And we need to find it.

573
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,880
Otherwise, we will die.

574
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,320
Please come in.

575
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,040
Since we haven't officially checked in yet,

576
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,920
Let's go.

577
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,000
This place is too

578
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,000
I'll escort everyone to their rooms.

579
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,040
I live on the seventh floor alone.

580
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,680
You live on the seventh floor.

581
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,560
Because the 7th floor is very noble.

582
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,040
it

583
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,200
The room is big.

584
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,280
So there are not many rooms.

585
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,520
Be safe tonight.

586
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,840
You live in a sea view room.

587
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,400
please

588
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,920
go

589
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,720
Don't forget.

590
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,880
Bye

591
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,640
Agent Teng.

592
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,600
What is this?

593
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,920
What is this?

594
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,560
To scare people.

595
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,000
this

596
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,040
I wanted to sleep.

597
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,840
How can I sleep?

598
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,000
She fell alone.

599
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,840
Why didn't I see it?

600
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,320
I didn't see it.

601
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,240
To hide the corpse.

602
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,840
Where did they hide her?

603
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,120
I can always hear a woman crying in the middle of the night.

604
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,400
But they didn't hear it.

605
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,880
Apartment No.11

606
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,520
Has been acting weird.

607
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,960
We're not staying.

608
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,520
"The Haunted Mansion."

609
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,760
Agent Teng, you said you're fine.

610
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,240
Who lives on the eighth floor?

611
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,080
Eighth floor.

612
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,640
Detective.

613
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,360
Detective.

614
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,760
So now, two people are dead?

615
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,600
There's something wrong with the people here.

616
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,960
Someone is laughing in front.

617
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,320
Was there someone there?

618
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,760
Who is this?

619
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,840
The appointment schedule.

620
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,560
Jia Jia is my girlfriend.

621
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,160
Why is she with Screenwriter Song?

622
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,680
See you on Monday.

623
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,440
Mom, please.

624
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,080
Three bowls of white.

625
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Absolutely unexpected

626
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,160
Why do you have so many boyfriends?

627
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Many people love her.

628
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Why are you doing this?

629
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,280
The King of the Sea with multiple personalities.

630
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,160
I think he's suspicious.

631
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,240
I advise you to mind your own business.

632
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,920
I know a huge secret.

633
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,440
Don't talk nonsense.

634
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,280
Be careful. I'll sue you.

635
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,560
You were the only one there.

636
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,080
All the evidence points to him.

637
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,000
But the question is, what's my motive?

638
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,200
Can't you finish three bowls?

639
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,920
It's obviously to frame me.

640
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,480
With Song's screenwriter.

641
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,640
You know the last person I want

642
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,280
It's you.

643
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,400
Do you know that we have

644
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,440
All the evidence

645
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,160
say

646
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,400
