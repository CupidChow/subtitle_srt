1
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,240
There's a "dead" person

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,400
Look, there are two holes there

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,560
It's a locked-room "murder" case

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,160
Someone is trying to frame Old Man Li

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,400
Old Man Cang and Old Man Ku discovered

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,400
Uncle Wang's secret

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,920
That Wang also had a motive to "kill" him

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,080
What are you doing now?

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,680
Power outage

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,800
This isn't 1988 at all

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
The door opened

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,320
Sister Cai

13
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,160
Sweet Little Zhou Zhou

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,560
Sister Cai is Old Man Li's wife

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,440
Sister Cai, what are you doing here?

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,440
No

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:17,800
You

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,760
Hurry up and let me out

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,800
Quick, get me out of here

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,520
What were you all doing?

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,280
Took you so long to come rescue me

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,360
I've been listening here the whole time

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,120
You're so clumsy

24
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,640
What were you doing over there?

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,440
For so long

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,120
Sorry

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,520
What's with the ball?

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,360
Fumbling around

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,880
I'm sorry

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,520
What's this ball for?

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,320
And what's with the rope?

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,040
Mess around with it

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,440
Sister Cai

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,840
They're the ones who delayed your rescue

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,960
Yes

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,640
Really?

37
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,720
Let's go out, Sister Cai

38
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,840
Hurry, let's go out

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,080
Who locked you in here?

40
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,680
Open this door

41
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
You didn't find the key, did you?

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,640
I didn't

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,680
Those two keys we had earlier

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,160
We took them all out

45
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,880
I have a key

46
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,360
I don't know if it's for this

47
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,800
Let's try it

48
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,160
Come on

49
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,280
Earlier there was a big guy

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,400
When he brought me in

51
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,760
I took it from his pocket

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Let's go

53
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,400
You go first

54
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,880
Why should I go first?

55
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,240
I won't go first

56
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,400
I'm not going first

57
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,760
What, Sister Cai is afraid of the dark too?

58
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,320
I'm scared

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,840
Okay, this should work now

60
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,400
Crawl in

61
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,960
What kind of place is this?

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,200
Six unregistered individuals detected

63
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,080
Intruding into Chuyang Alley

64
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,760
This is a surveillance room

65
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,560
Here's a plan to return to Chuyang Lane

66
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,880
Using apartment rumors and elderly pain points

67
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,560
Step two

68
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,280
Renovate my basement-level storefront

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,240
to make modifications

70
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,680
Recreate a replica of Chuyang Lane

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
Then hire actors to perform

72
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,840
To deceive those helpless elderly people

73
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,520
This is awesome

74
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,760
So impressive

75
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,560
6:10

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,040
Power outage

77
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,880
The power outage I told you about from 6:00 to 6:10

78
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,920
So there'll be a 10-minute blackout now

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,360
But you said the blackout was in 2022

80
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,520
We haven't "time traveled"

81
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,680
This is 2022

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,880
We haven't "time traveled"

83
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,360
This is 2022

84
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,600
That was fake "time travel"

85
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,080
A fake 1988

86
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,160
Wait a minute

87
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,120
So those two who "died"

88
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,520
Aren't Lao Cang and Lao Ku

89
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,200
Lao Cang and Lao Ku

90
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,400
"Died" back in 1988

91
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,080
Isn't this 2022?

92
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,240
Hold on

93
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,640
Who else "died"?

94
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,200
We found two "corpses"

95
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,600
In 1988

96
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,960
The Chuyang Lane "murder and corpse burning case"

97
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,080
Will happen again

98
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,640
Two people will "die" today

99
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,120
Step Three

100
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,520
Trick them into thinking Youth Photo Studio is a "time machine"

101
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,480
To "time travel" to 1988

102
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,880
You need to pay

103
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,040
Round-trip "time travel" requires payment

104
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,880
Exchanging for 1988 currency

105
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,960
Requires payment

106
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,880
Buying "time travel" supplies costs money

107
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,840
Right, Sister Cai

108
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,480
Didn't you come to

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Youth Photo Studio and then

110
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,280
disappeared?

111
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,480
If the old folks discover the secret

112
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,680
Or become not even worth deceiving

113
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,920
Then we'll eliminate them by special means

114
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,400
Have you discovered the secret?

115
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,519
I wasn't eliminated, I'm still alive

116
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,680
Look

117
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,360
This door leads to that store

118
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,480
Look

119
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,600
There are people outside

120
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,560
Don’t get caught

121
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,760
Originally, I came to Xiao Wang’s store

122
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,400
Disguised as the owner of Xiao Wang’s store

123
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,680
I hid in Chuyang Alley

124
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,600
to oversee operations

125
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,080
The keys to the warehouse yard and storage rooms

126
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
could only be kept by me alone

127
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,120
Just one final step

128
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,760
All areas

129
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,280
Deploy signal jammers

130
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,240
Except for authorized staff devices

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,000
These people outside

132
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,400
are still watching us

133
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,920
They're all company employees

134
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,360
Right

135
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,320
When did you get in?

136
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,160
Get them!

137
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,520
Run!

138
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,840
First, we need to clarify the "deceased's" identity.

139
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,240
It should be...

140
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,880
You're dressed like white fungus.

141
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,640
What's the point?

142
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,760
White fungus, silver ear mushroom.

143
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,840
I think the "deceased" should be Old Wang.

144
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,680
What?

145
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,720
Because only he has...

146
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,560
the keys to the compound and warehouse.

147
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,600
Old Wang is "dead."

148
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,320
It's possible...

149
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,640
He's missing a finger.

150
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,120
You can tell by looking at his fingers.

151
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,160
Two "corpses."

152
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,320
One of them is missing a finger.

153
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,880
Then who's the other one?

154
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,320
Come

155
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,840
It's a long story—let's sit down and listen carefully.

156
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,640
Why is Sister Cai here?

157
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,320
Locked up over there.

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
After I gave you that Youth Photo Studio,

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:07,880
where did you go?

160
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,040
You little scammer, give me back my money!

161
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,280
You're still scamming people out of their money.

162
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,920
He gave me this Youth Photo Studio's

163
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,960
a sort of...

164
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,080
a brochure

165
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,720
and said you could make friends there.

166
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,680
For empty nesters like us,

167
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,560
it looked quite appealing after reading it.

168
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,600
So I went to take photos at that studio.

169
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,280
That person said

170
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,400
I could return to 1988.

171
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,240
I really wanted to go back to 1988.

172
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,960
My spouse was still there,

173
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,440
my daughter was still there.

174
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,240
Yes,

175
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,320
back then,

176
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,840
our family was still whole.

177
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,280
Now it's just me left alone.

178
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,280
They said I needed to pay 100,000 yuan to go,

179
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,600
but I paid it anyway.

180
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,800
Just to see my family again.

181
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,040
Then whoosh -

182
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,560
I went to 1988.

183
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,720
Did you see Old Li?

184
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,400
No.

185
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,160
I lived there for a month,

186
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,360
but never saw them.

187
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,920
After living there a month,

188
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,160
I asked later,

189
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,280
"Why can't I see my family?"

190
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,960
They said to see my relatives,

191
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,520
I needed to pay another 100,000 yuan.

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,160
I'd already paid,

193
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,920
then another 100,000,

194
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,760
and another 100,000,

195
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,560
and another 100,000.

196
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,480
How did you end up locked up there?

197
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,480
Because I later discovered

198
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,560
their scheme:

199
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,080
if you tried to escape,

200
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,920
they'd capture you

201
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,000
and take you away.

202
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,840
What are you doing?

203
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,880
Go!

204
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,040
What are you doing?

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,040
How much money did you get?

206
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,200
I didn't get any.

207
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,320
This is Old Li's son.

208
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,800
This is Old Li's son.

209
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,400
Old Li is my father.

210
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,640
But isn't your surname Zhou?

211
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
I took my mother's surname.

212
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,640
After Old Li ran away with her,

213
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,800
nine years later they had another child.

214
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,000
That emotional traitor.

215
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,600
Because later my mother "died" first,

216
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,640
then my father abandoned me.

217
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,840
He stopped supporting me.

218
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,360
After that, my aunt raised me.

219
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,400
She treated me like a mother.

220
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,440
My aunt named me Zhou Keke.

221
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,520
Zhou Keke, you've got issues.

222
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,000
Let me tell you,

223
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,800
I think we came here

224
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,000
because he brought us here.

225
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,200
I think one possibility is that

226
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,280
you wanted to find your father

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and used us

228
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,679
to investigate this old case

229
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,520
set up a trap

230
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,200
set up a trap

231
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,720
July 2, 1988

232
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,040
Do you remember that homicide case?

233
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,960
Of course I remember

234
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,000
Back in 1988

235
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
our family lived right here

236
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,280
near the warehouse area

237
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,000
Chuyang Alley

238
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Their pun isn't very good

239
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,640
Indeed, quite mediocre

240
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Official roast

241
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,160
Then there was a fire

242
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,520
After the fire

243
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,640
Xiaocang and Xiaoku had accidents

244
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,680
But they suspected

245
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,360
that my husband Lao Li started the fire

246
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,000
Then Lao Li disappeared ever since

247
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,000
But I believe

248
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,240
it definitely wasn't my Lao Li's doing

249
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,880
Yes

250
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,960
He was a good man

251
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,840
a kind-hearted person

252
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,040
There was indeed this case back then

253
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,320
It did happen

254
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,560
The Chuyang Alley "homicide" arson case

255
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,200
Thirty-four years have passed

256
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,880
That incident back then

257
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
did truly happen

258
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,320
And now these two

259
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,440
are imitating that old case

260
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,040
recreating all the original criminal methods

261
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,960
Now one of them

262
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,360
this "victim" is Lao Wang

263
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,400
Then who's the other one?

264
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,000
What else can we find?

265
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,400
Headphones, computer, things like that

266
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,400
Lao Wang

267
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,280
1966

268
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,040
July 7

269
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,600
There's also a Xiao Wang

270
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,400
They're the same person

271
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
See, the ID numbers match

272
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,520
They're absolutely the same person

273
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,320
Haven't seen him in over thirty years

274
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,800
Next one

275
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,240
Gathering evidence to report, be careful

276
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,920
Okay, little bro

277
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,160
I've already decided to withdraw

278
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,440
And made arrangements with Xiao Hezi

279
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,000
To sell all these ground-floor storefronts to her

280
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,560
She's very happy

281
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,960
She can have her complete

282
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,480
Apartment No. 11

283
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,680
I said next week

284
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,080
You'll just be starting your business

285
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,680
Right now there's still the landlord

286
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,040
Yes

287
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,200
Xiao Hezi is the sub-landlord, right?

288
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,560
She's an agent

289
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,040
Is he preparing to flee?

290
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,120
Yes, of course he's going to run

291
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,440
Because someone's going to report him

292
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,160
Right

293
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,960
Lao Wang's (Xiao Wang's) cabinet

294
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,000
What's Lao Wang's (Xiao Wang's) birthday?

295
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,560
Lao Wang (Xiao Wang)

296
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:49,880
0707

297
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,480
Is it four digits?

298
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,560
Yes, four digits

299
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,120
Try it

300
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,760
Where did you find this, kid?

301
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,600
Right here.

302
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:09,960
Here.

303
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,080
It says "Little Lin".

304
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,600
We arrested Sister Cai today.

305
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,800
These are all her belongings.

306
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,280
Keep an eye on her.

307
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
This was written by Little Lin.

308
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,640
Who is Little Lin?

309
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,040
Little Lin is the person we just saw.

310
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,880
After my thorough investigation,

311
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,080
this is a fake from 1988.

312
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,240
Little Wang revealed

313
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,920
his true colors.

314
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,400
Who is Little Wang?

315
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,720
Little Wang

316
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,200
is the person from

317
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,160
Old Wang's (Little Wang's) shop.

318
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,640
It was from Little Wang that I learned

319
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,120
about the Chuyang Lane plan.

320
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,320
I saw that brat's diary.

321
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,280
It must be that Little Wang (Old Wang)

322
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,120
who framed Old Li.

323
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,840
I wrote this too.

324
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,680
I saw that brat's diary.

325
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,760
It must be that Little Wang (Old Wang)

326
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,520
who framed Old Li.

327
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,600
Yes, Little Wang (Old Wang) is no good.

328
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,000
I must find out

329
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,320
how Little Wang (Old Wang)

330
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,960
framed Old Li back then.

331
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,000
I have all of Bratty Girl and Old Li's belongings with me

332
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm going back to 1988

333
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,960
Will I get to see them?

334
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,920
I arranged Old Li's duty room

335
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,200
exactly as it was before

336
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,160
But I didn't see Bratty Girl or Old Li

337
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,080
Why is that?

338
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,200
Even if Little Wang (Old Wang) is old now

339
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,080
I'd still recognize him

340
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,120
He and that Little Little Wang

341
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,480
were actually working together

342
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,200
That Little Wang (Old Wang) from back then

343
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,760
Here

344
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,520
Come

345
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,360
Old Wang (Little Wang)

346
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,440
I have something important to tell you

347
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Meet me at 3:30 this afternoon

348
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,920
at the Chuyang Alley warehouse entrance

349
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,040
Little Little Wang

350
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,680
Little Little Wang

351
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,440
Sister Cai, is this note yours?

352
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,120
No

353
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,040
It's not

354
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,680
Old Wang (Little Wang)

355
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,520
I have something important to tell you

356
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,160
Meet at the warehouse entrance - Little Little Wang

357
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,880
Then the other "dead" one should be

358
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,760
Little Little Wang

359
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,280
Is that possible?

360
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
It's possible

361
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,520
It's possible he was the one who arranged to meet him

362
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,360
Check who's missing from the surveillance footage

363
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,760
This one's here, these two are here

364
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,920
Who's missing?

365
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,840
Little Little Wang isn't here

366
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,560
So

367
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:10,920
Sister Cai

368
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,280
you're also a murder suspect

369
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,280
Me?

370
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,000
I'd recognize Little Wang (Old Wang) even when he's old

371
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,840
He and that Little Little Wang

372
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,240
were actually in cahoots

373
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,760
You need to investigate

374
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,280
how he framed your husband back then

375
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,920
Right, but

376
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,440
Is the "dead" person him?

377
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,120
It's Old Wang (Little Wang)

378
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,400
Little Wang (Old Wang) and Little Little Wang

379
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,880
Let's take a look

380
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,080
if there are any clues inside here

381
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,040
Get down

382
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,760
Get down

383
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,240
Let's see what clues are in this cabinet

384
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,360
Xiaoxiao Wang's personal cabinet

385
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,760
Let's see

386
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,720
Xiaoxiao Wang's personal cabinet

387
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,960
There's one here

388
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,760
There's a phone here

389
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,560
There's a mobile phone

390
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,960
This box has a key.

391
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,400
Okay, thanks.

392
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,880
Let me tell you something.

393
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,640
After drinking it all,

394
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,360
there's a key inside.

395
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,120
Here, move this.

396
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,560
Too much.

397
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,480
Let's see what's on the phone.

398
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,400
Xiao Xiaowang told a friend:

399
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,440
"I've been feeling down lately.

400
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,240
Fortunately, with this,

401
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,400
I can temporarily forget

402
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,240
the unpleasant things.

403
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
My sleep quality has improved too."

404
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,560
It's this cup with a link.

405
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,480
This link again.

406
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,600
"You'll all 'die'."

407
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,720
Then the friend asked for details.

408
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,400
He said:

409
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,440
"I can't stand it anymore,

410
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,360
working with Lao Wang (Xiao Wang).

411
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,160
Now whenever I close my eyes,

412
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,800
those elderly victims we scammed

413
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,840
appear before me one by one,

414
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,280
as if demanding repayment.

415
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,760
Lao Wang (Xiao Wang)

416
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,160
doesn't value others' lives

417
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,680
at all.

418
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,440
Once when drunk, he even boasted to me

419
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,400
that thirty-some years ago

420
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,360
he 'killed' someone,

421
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,200
and pinned the blame on someone else.

422
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,960
In the past,

423
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,640
the person who 'murdered' Lao Cang and Lao Ku

424
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,800
You see,

425
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,440
now your 'murder' motive is clear.

426
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,760
This person framed your father.

427
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,920
I didn't know about any of this.

428
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,640
I absolutely can't continue

429
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
collaborating with such people.

430
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
I already have a plan.

431
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,800
I will definitely leave this place.

432
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,520
Wait and see in ten days.

433
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,600
June 22nd.

434
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,360
There's a door lock here

435
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,080
It says "Uncle Li's birthday"

436
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,200
Meaning the door lock's password

437
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,920
is Uncle Li's birthday

438
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,680
0702

439
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,440
Where is this door lock?

440
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,040
Uncle Li's birthday

441
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,760
There's also a video

442
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,200
Let's take a look

443
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,600
10 days left until departure

444
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,560
9 days left until departure

445
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,600
8 days left until departure

446
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,400
Everything must be inside that store

447
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,320
That's the place

448
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,720
Right?

449
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,160
Is this some kind of clue?

450
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,920
7 days left until departure

451
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,840
He "died"

452
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,560
No

453
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,320
He put it in his pocket

454
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,640
He seemed to twist something

455
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,640
Two

456
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,840
Three

457
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,600
Four

458
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,280
Five

459
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,840
With a bang

460
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,040
There was a door sound

461
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,560
He walked out

462
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,440
Tea aroma meets fruit bits

463
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,080
Milk makes it more delicious

464
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,080
Our shop offers various flavors of

465
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,400
Special Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring with real fruit bits

466
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,520
Using Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring with real fruit bits

467
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,560
as the base

468
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,320
Not only has a light tea fragrance

469
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,200
But also chewable real fruit bits

470
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,440
Paired with premium fresh milk

471
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,800
Super delicious

472
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,680
New summer drink choice

473
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,720
Boss, I'll have this one

474
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Deliver to this address

475
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,880
Okay

476
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,640
You always order this flavor

477
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,440
How many do you want?

478
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,680
I'll deliver them to your door

479
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,359
Ten cups

480
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,000
Alright

481
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,319
Little Wang

482
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,000
I finally caught you

483
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,920
What are you doing here?

484
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,240
I've been here all along - didn't expect that, did you?

485
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,040
Isn't this your father's voice?

486
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,080
I haven't seen my father in a long time

487
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,520
He left me when I was five

488
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,600
Actually, I should thank you

489
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,400
For helping me find my grandson and son

490
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,320
Grandson?

491
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,560
So I'm the grandson?

492
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,280
And you're the son

493
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,040
Uncle

494
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,120
You've ruined my life

495
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,560
Let's settle everything today

496
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,640
Let's go inside and talk

497
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,640
Let's sort this out

498
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,280
We should follow along with his

499
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,160
current position to search

500
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,280
There should be something underneath

501
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,080
No

502
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,840
Look at this thing

503
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,640
If we consider it as

504
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,840
representing time

505
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,480
Isn't this the 2 o'clock direction?

506
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:04,760
Yes

507
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,840
What time direction is this?

508
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,280
Seven o'clock

509
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:08,760
Three

510
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,880
Three o'clock direction

511
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,280
Nine o'clock

512
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,600
We currently don't need places with numbers

513
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,640
Are we waiting for the clock to strike five?

514
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,440
Not exactly

515
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,440
But that countdown earlier

516
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,600
I think it's definitely important

517
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,200
Why are we pretending to be Sherlock Holmes?

518
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,840
Let's call the police

519
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,520
We're well-informed

520
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,440
I don't want to guess blindly anymore

521
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,200
I'm calling the police

522
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,360
Hello, is this 110? (Police emergency number)

523
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,240
When listening to this part earlier

524
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,120
After the clock chimed

525
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,840
there was a door sound

526
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,480
Did you hear it?

527
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,320
Someone came in

528
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,080
Right

529
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,720
Coming to buy milk

530
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,480
There's no milk sold inside here

531
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,160
Only outside sells milk

532
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,520
It's an outside store, right?

533
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,640
And he opened a door somewhere

534
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,280
It's an outside store, right?

535
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,080
Cheese (photography term)

536
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,680
Time travel

537
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,480
Possibly

538
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,840
So cool

539
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,400
Opened a door somewhere

540
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,720
If we're searching, we should look outside

541
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,000
There's nothing left in here anyway

542
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,480
Right

543
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,080
Let's go take a look

544
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,000
Come back quick

545
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,840
The big guy at the entrance might see us

546
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,200
There's actually someone

547
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,600
Yeah

548
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,520
What can they do if I go out?

549
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,080
They'll just drag you back

550
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,920
It's definitely this room

551
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,400
We're just missing a key

552
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,280
There's a door inside here.

553
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,600
I'm going to take a look.

554
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,320
What do you mean?

555
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,760
There's a door inside the cabinet that leads somewhere.

556
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,720
We need to find a mechanism.

557
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,840
To open that inner door.

558
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,080
Could it be related to that bell sound?

559
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,080
Possibly.

560
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,560
Where else is there a clock?

561
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,840
He just carried in a clock.

562
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,360
That clock was just at the very top.

563
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,080
Where was it placed just now?

564
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,520
Right in the middle.

565
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,200
It seems like he wound up a watch

566
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,000
Is it possible

567
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
For example, adjusting the watch

568
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,640
The watch chimes

569
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,320
Five chimes

570
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,040
They just left

571
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,680
And then

572
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,880
Check if the inner door is open

573
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,600
It's open

574
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,840
Open now

575
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,600
Got it open

576
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,360
Let's go, guys

577
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,400
Moving out

578
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,320
What's open?

579
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,160
That cabinet?

580
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,560
How did you open it?

581
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,440
Some clever tricks

582
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,360
Go

583
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,000
So he went through here

584
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,600
Hurry up

585
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,320
What are you doing?

586
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,640
Who are you?

587
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,280
What do you want?

588
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,160
Chase them!

589
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,040
Hurry, go!

590
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,120
Hurry up

591
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,800
Hurry up

592
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,640
Close the door

593
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,160
Where is this?

594
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,440
This is Dakaiyan Street

595
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,840
We're home

596
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,760
So this is where he bought the Zhenguoli special drinks

597
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,000
Where are we going now?

598
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,160
Zhenguoli Special Drink Shop

599
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,000
Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring

600
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,480
Hello

601
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,680
Welcome

602
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,160
Welcome

603
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,480
Hello

604
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,000
Hello

605
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,680
Welcome to

606
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,280
Zhenguoli Special Drink Shop

607
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,240
Was there anyone today

608
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,360
who bought ten special drinks from you?

609
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,440
Many people came today

610
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,120
Called Xiao Xiao Wang

611
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,800
He's a regular customer

612
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,400
He buys every time he comes

613
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,760
He always buys the same flavor

614
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,440
Let me play you the recording

615
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,240
I'll let you hear it

616
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,360
New summer drink choice

617
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,440
Boss wants this

618
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,600
Deliver to this address

619
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,360
Ten cups

620
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,120
Okay

621
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,920
Yes

622
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,640
That's my voice

623
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,400
But I really can't remember

624
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,200
Because I'm not sensitive

625
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,320
to voices or appearances

626
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,800
Right, I only remember flavors

627
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,760
with great accuracy

628
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,000
I happen to have prepared four cups today

629
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,840
Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring special

630
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,520
Try all four of these

631
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,320
Then if you can confirm

632
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,840
which flavor he drank

633
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,360
maybe I can identify which person it was

634
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,560
Is it this one?

635
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,080
No

636
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:28,960
Not this one

637
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,440
Made with Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring

638
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,120
special drink

639
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,240
It's so delicious

640
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,240
This one

641
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,320
This one

642
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,600
Right

643
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,280
It has a subtle tea fragrance

644
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,600
With real fruit pieces you can chew

645
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,680
Most importantly, it contains premium fresh milk

646
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,520
Never gets boring no matter how much you drink

647
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,120
Exactly this one

648
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
This Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring Tea special blend

649
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,800
The tea-infused ruby grapefruit one

650
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,480
That would be the one living in B101

651
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,280
That customer

652
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,720
B101

653
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,240
B101

654
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,440
Yes, he often asks for home delivery

655
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:09,880
Right?

656
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,640
Okay, thank you.

657
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,200
Thank you.

658
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,960
Thank you, goodbye.

659
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,080
Please come again.

660
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,920
Okay.

661
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,600
101

662
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,760
That must be someone's password

663
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,840
Isn't it someone's birthday?

664
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,640
Old Li's birthday

665
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,000
It's written in his phone

666
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,120
Uncle Li's birthday

667
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
Right, Uncle Li's birthday

668
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,960
So it's 1950, right?

669
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,080
50

670
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,760
07

671
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,920
02

672
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,880
Unlocked

673
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,320
Let's go

674
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,560
Sweet little Zhou Zhou

675
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,920
Why is your photo here?

676
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,640
Look

677
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,000
He said

678
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
I can only watch you from afar

679
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,920
But having hugged you

680
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,880
I'm already very happy

681
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,680
Never thought you'd have such a special connection

682
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,160
With

683
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,000
a bunch of peculiar people

684
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Together formed this peculiar

685
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,080
Bai Song

686
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,800
1 Guo Zhou Liu 1 Cool Detective Team

687
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,280
Though I don't understand what you're doing

688
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,560
But seeing you so happy

689
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,680
makes me happy too

690
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,840
It's her birthday today

691
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,120
He's that kitty

692
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,560
He is

693
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
He's that kitty

694
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,360
He's dressed up as that meow-meow

695
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,760
Come

696
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,800
You only hugged three bowls

697
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,880
That means you two are suspects

698
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,680
Because he only hugged those two

699
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,480
Only hugged us two

700
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
And he mentioned above that he hugged you

701
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,560
That kitty

702
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,800
Lives in basement level 1

703
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,600
He's meow-meow

704
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,920
Wait a moment

705
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,320
This...

706
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,480
These are letters

707
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,000
What does it say here?

708
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,560
Current identity

709
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
Meow meow?

710
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,560
Yes, meow

711
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,200
Meow meow

712
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,720
Isn't he a meow cat?

713
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,480
That cat

714
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,400
Be careful not to "blow up"

715
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,440
To avoid dragging you down,

716
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,240
I've decided to disappear from your world.

717
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,240
This is my mother

718
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,520
Li's daughter

719
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,360
Li's daughter

720
00:26:59,360 --> 00:26:59,880
My mother

721
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,560
"died" in 2007

722
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,120
So that means

723
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,640
You're my grandson

724
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,280
That's right

725
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,280
Quick, give me a hug

726
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,880
Come here quickly

727
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,640
Nephew

728
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,480
Go away

729
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,520
Nephew

730
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,720
Get away

731
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,880
Nephew

732
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,280
Ah Zhou

733
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,600
You saved me when I was in trouble

734
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,360
You thought

735
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,280
I was your father's "killer"

736
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,960
But after getting to know me

737
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,560
You said this "killer" wasn't so cold

738
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,280
Wouldn't have "killed" your father

739
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,440
We struggled between love and pain

740
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,640
After much turmoil

741
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,920
We decided to be together

742
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,760
This must be Keke's mother

743
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,280
My mom

744
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,680
Yes

745
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,640
To clear my name

746
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,680
We worked together to solve the case

747
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,400
But in the end, you were "killed"

748
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,360
by the murderer and his lackey Xiao Xiao Wang

749
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,840
I could only drown in sorrow

750
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,360
I will definitely avenge you

751
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,080
I hope one day you'll forgive me

752
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,720
Looking forward to taking a photo together with you

753
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,320
"Home With Kids"

754
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,280
Phone

755
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,240
Whose phone?

756
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,080
Old Li

757
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,040
Isn't it Old Li?

758
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,000
Check the photo

759
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:21,880
Come on

760
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,360
Don't jump

761
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,040
What does this say?

762
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,880
Sleep-talking

763
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,440
Don't jump

764
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,600
Don't jump

765
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,040
Don't jump

766
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,480
What are you jumping for?

767
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,760
Xiaoxiao Wang's Chat History

768
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Xiaoxiao Wang said:

769
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,080
After all we've just discussed,

770
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,800
there's one thing I still can't figure out.

771
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
How did you know

772
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,680
about our scam using Retro Street

773
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
and all the plans?

774
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Then Old Li said:

775
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,320
Don't worry about it.

776
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,800
I know everything anyway.

777
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,440
He said: "Alright,"

778
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,040
"I know both Old Wang (Xiao Wang) and I

779
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,680
have wronged you."

780
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,600
Then Xiaoxiao Wang continued:

781
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,880
I'm on duty tonight.

782
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,800
After 10 pm, I'll take you to Chuyang Alley

783
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,360
to check something.

784
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,840
We'll discuss

785
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,560
the plan to "eliminate"

786
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Old Wang (Xiao Wang).

787
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,640
By the way,

788
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,400
for easier operation,

789
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,680
you should stay at my place recently.

790
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,240
I've changed the passcode to your birthday -

791
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,160
July 2nd.

792
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,480
I'll first use "Charming Mist" knockout gas

793
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,680
to knock out the staff at Chuyang Alley.

794
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,720
So in that room,

795
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,320
they were knocked out, right?

796
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,560
They were unconscious at the time.

797
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,560
Then invite Old Wang (Xiao Wang) to the warehouse

798
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,240
"Kill" him

799
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,960
and leave behind

800
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,200
traces pointing to those old methods

801
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,120
I hope your children

802
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,640
can help clear your name

803
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,120
Then I can leave in peace

804
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,720
Remember to show them the video

805
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,720
to lead them to Chuyang Alley to find the truth

806
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,400
So this place

807
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,440
actually belongs to Xiao Xiao Wang

808
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,480
Yes, Xiao Xiao Wang's family

809
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,760
Xiao Xiao Wang's place

810
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,840
Old Li came to live here

811
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,320
There's more later

812
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:42,920
video

813
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,640
The one they showed us

814
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,880
You're the ones from the apartment

815
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,800
The one we just saw on TV

816
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
that we watched

817
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,480
He wanted us to handle it

818
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,800
Yes, they wanted to lure us

819
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,160
to that (photo studio)

820
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,480
Right, because they said the "murder and corpse burning" case

821
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,560
would happen again

822
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,400
How did Xiao Xiao Wang "die"

823
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,440
That's right

824
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:00,760
You see

825
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,120
Xiao Xiao Wang wanted to "take out" Old Wang (Little Wang)

826
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,080
So he arranged to meet Old Wang (Little Wang) there

827
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,040
He wanted Old Li to join him

828
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,000
But unexpectedly

829
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,840
This same Xiao Xiao Wang had previously "caused the death of"

830
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,800
Mother Zhou

831
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,040
So Old Li used this as an opportunity

832
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,880
First to "eliminate" Old Wang (Little Wang)

833
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,240
Then later "eliminated" Xiao Xiao Wang

834
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,040
That's roughly what happened

835
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,440
Your father

836
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,080
Dad

837
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,840
What should I call him?

838
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,440
Grandpa (maternal)

839
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:38,920
Grandpa (maternal)

840
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:39,920
Yes

841
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,120
Who is this fat guy?

842
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,480
This is your husband

843
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,440
Isn't this my Cai?

844
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,960
Come watch the show!

845
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,760
The show's starting!

846
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,320
Long time no see

847
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,000
How come you...

848
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,240
...have aged so much?

849
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,880
It's been over thirty years since we last met.

850
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,040
After thirty years apart, of course we'd age like this.

851
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
You're still alive.

852
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,000
If it weren't for you,

853
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,840
I would have "died" long ago.

854
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,400
Have you been waiting for me all this time?

855
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,840
Yes.

856
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,000
Who is he?

857
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:28,920
Who is he?

858
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,040
He's my son.

859
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,480
You've never met him.

860
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,920
I'm your wife.

861
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,040
He's your son, but I've never seen him.

862
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,520
Because you're my ex-wife.

863
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,960
Did we get divorced?

864
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,240
Yes, we did.

865
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,840
That's nonsense.

866
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,480
In 1988,

867
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,840
you just ran away.

868
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,280
That's right.

869
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,120
I've been looking for you.

870
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,480
I've searched for you all these years.

871
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,240
Now we meet,

872
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,040
what have you brought me?

873
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,200
You've brought me a son.

874
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,680
Sit down

875
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,600
Listen to me carefully

876
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:04,840
Come here

877
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:05,720
Cai

878
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,040
Cai

879
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,040
Why is he my son?

880
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,920
Because after we separated

881
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
I kept thinking

882
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,120
About this

883
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,680
Finding someone else

884
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,160
But I didn't pursue it

885
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,560
This chubby kid

886
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,040
Chubby kid

887
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,320
Is he related to us?

888
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,160
No relation

889
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,200
Good that there's no relation

890
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,120
Otherwise my mind would be even more confused

891
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,440
He's not related to me

892
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,240
They can't all be related

893
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,280
None of these are related

894
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,040
Finally one without any relation

895
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,640
I went back to 1988 to find you

896
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,360
I was tricked

897
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,640
You got tricked again

898
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,040
Why say "again"?

899
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,400
You were tricked by him once

900
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,600
Always saying "again"

901
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,960
Cai Cai, this trait of yours never changes

902
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,120
When I left you back then

903
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,760
I left you a letter

904
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,720
I wanted you to remarry

905
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,920
It was for you and our daughter

906
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,920
To have a complete family

907
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,320
Remember the ones who were "burned to death"

908
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,880
Zhou Cangcang and Zhou Kuku

909
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,400
His mother was Zhou Cangcang's daughter

910
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,000
Right

911
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,080
His mother too

912
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,360
Later, believe me

913
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,800
I didn't "kill" her father and uncle

914
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,400
So she investigated with me

915
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,960
But in 2002

916
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,840
She was "murdered"

917
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,440
Of course

918
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,240
You didn't protect

919
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,800
You didn't protect his mother either

920
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,360
Yes

921
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Then how dare you come here

922
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,720
First, we have a question.

923
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,120
We just want to know about "the deceased."

924
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,200
Are you aware of "the dead people"?

925
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,800
Two people "died."

926
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,720
Of course I know.

927
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,040
Two people "died" today, did you know?

928
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,040
Not the two who "died" in 1988.

929
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,600
I know.

930
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,280
You know again?

931
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,840
Of course.

932
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,520
We're already aware of this matter.

933
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,800
We just hope you could...

934
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,440
Let's compare notes.

935
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,040
See if we have the same information.

936
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,040
Do you suspect him?

937
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,440
No suspicion, just want to know.

938
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,120
How did you...

939
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,880
This is it.

940
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,560
How was the crime committed?

941
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,320
No.

942
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
I mean how this case was handled.

943
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,560
Those who "died" today were...

944
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,840
Xiaoxiao Wang and Old Wang (or Xiao Wang).

945
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,280
Right.

946
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,040
This Old Wang (Xiao Wang) was killed by Xiaoxiao Wang.

947
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,520
"Killed."

948
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,600
We're aware of this.

949
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,680
Since Xiaoxiao Wang was the "murderer,"

950
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,080
how did he end up being "killed" instead?

951
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,159
Xiaoxiao Wang "committed suicide."

952
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,840
I don't want to live.

953
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,800
Impossible.

954
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,320
Impossible.

955
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,159
"Suicide" is impossible.

956
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,480
He had an agreement with you.

957
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,120
That after everything was done,

958
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,239
you would spare his life.

959
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,280
Let him go.

960
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,320
It must be "homicide," right?

961
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,480
Yes, definitely ("homicide").

962
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,080
That's what you think.

963
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,840
To leave, he wanted to leave.

964
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,600
You're leaving again.

965
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,280
You want to leave.

966
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm not leaving.

967
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,320
This contains Xiaoxiao Wang's...

968
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,760
photo.

969
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,159
Tip-off letter.

970
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,760
And Old Wang's (Little Wang's)

971
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,800
USB drive containing all criminal records

972
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,280
The two people closest to you here

973
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,920
won't give it to either of us

974
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,560
I am Little Xiao Wang

975
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,600
By the time you read this letter

976
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,040
I have already "killed" my boss

977
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,760
and "committed suicide"

978
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,520
We deceived many elderly people

979
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,040
swindling their life savings

980
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,560
Even

981
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,920
drove those lonely elders

982
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,480
to pay with their lives

983
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,840
Our deeds were deeply sinful

984
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,480
unforgivable

985
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,360
only "death" can atone

986
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,720
Moreover

987
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,640
I've left at the scene

988
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,200
clues pointing to the 1988

989
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,640
"murder" and arson case

990
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:17,920
Little Xiao Wang

991
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,800
So your father is finally cleared of suspicion

992
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,680
Grandpa

993
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,400
Congratulations

994
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,920
Not necessarily

995
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,280
I'm not entirely convinced

996
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,560
So how did Aunt Zhou "die"?

997
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,840
Back then, he was still young.

998
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,960
I have to take care of him

999
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,320
So his mother is investigating

1000
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,840
who was responsible for her father's "death"

1001
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,360
In the end,

1002
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,680
by Xiao Wang (Old Wang)

1003
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,840
now Old Wang (Xiao Wang)

1004
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,320
discovered

1005
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,240
he and Xiao Xiao Wang together

1006
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,720
Pushed his mother down

1007
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,760
This is the rapper

1008
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,480
It was because of your aunt

1009
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,680
Aunt Zhou

1010
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,040
And your uncle Zhou Zengzeng

1011
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,000
He didn’t believe

1012
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,680
That I was innocent

1013
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,800
Thought I pushed your mom off the cliff

1014
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,600
Moreover

1015
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,240
Firmly believed that back in 1988

1016
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,280
It was me who "killed" your grandfather

1017
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,400
I had no choice

1018
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,960
So I came out to investigate again

1019
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
Later I discovered

1020
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,920
He "killed" Zhou Cangcang and Zhou Kuku

1021
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,000
because he taught them longevity exercises

1022
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,720
and got exposed by them

1023
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,200
Then I found out

1024
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,160
Old Wang (Little Wang) and Little Little Wang were here

1025
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,400
They restored

1026
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,840
this old Chuyang Alley

1027
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,360
and opened this Youth Photo Studio

1028
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,760
doing exactly the same things as before

1029
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,280
cheating elderly people out of their money again

1030
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,880
To hide my identity

1031
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,040
I've been staying inside this Meow Meow

1032
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,240
I couldn't reveal myself to you

1033
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,600
because I couldn't prove myself yet

1034
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,080
Until that day on June 25th

1035
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,720
when I caught Little Little Wang here

1036
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,440
Little Wang

1037
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,880
I've finally caught you

1038
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,480
What are you doing here?

1039
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,560
I've been here all along. Didn't expect that, did you?

1040
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,720
I should thank you all

1041
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,120
for helping me find my two children

1042
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
But you've ruined my life

1043
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,040
Today

1044
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,800
let's settle everything once and for all

1045
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,080
I just wanted to

1046
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,040
have a final reckoning with him

1047
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,480
and make things clear

1048
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,400
But then Little Wang told me

1049
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,240
that he's actually been dissatisfied

1050
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,960
with Old Wang (Young Wang) all these years

1051
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,000
Little Wang

1052
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,240
also discovered he has a terminal illness

1053
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,040
and doesn't have long to live

1054
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,880
He told me

1055
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,600
he could help me

1056
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,680
clear my name

1057
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,880
Clear my name

1058
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,560
and restore

1059
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:42,960
the truth about

1060
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,720
the 1988

1061
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,520
warehouse "murder" case

1062
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,760
That's why

1063
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,560
I deliberately left that

1064
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,000
video footage

1065
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,080
outside your restaurant today

1066
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,920
along with a newspaper

1067
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,840
I wanted you all

1068
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,480
to solve this case

1069
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,200
Solve this case

1070
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,800
He recreated

1071
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,080
the crime scene from back then

1072
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,680
just to show you

1073
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,400
that even without the warehouse key

1074
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,360
it's still possible

1075
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,120
to make two people appear "dead"

1076
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,200
There's one more here

1077
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,160
This is

1078
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,280
This is for you

1079
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,800
This was given to me by Xiao Xiao Wang

1080
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,240
At that time, he planned to do it in this warehouse

1081
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,920
how to "kill" Lao Wang (Xiao Wang)

1082
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,720
and then "commit suicide" himself

1083
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,160
A diagram of the human body

1084
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,320
July 2nd

1085
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,720
Using a gasoline can

1086
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
Strike Lao Wang (Xiao Wang)'s temple

1087
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Gasoline can

1088
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,680
He hit the back of the head

1089
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,240
Both were struck on the back of the head

1090
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,240
Look at his head

1091
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,080
"Died" from severe head trauma

1092
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,720
Suddenly I also felt something was wrong

1093
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,880
This reminded me of Xiao Xiao Wang

1094
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,440
On June 26th

1095
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,000
He went to scout Chu Yang Alley

1096
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,800
To put it bluntly, he wanted to recreate

1097
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,560
the exact methods from 1988

1098
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,480
of the "murder" scene

1099
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,160
all the techniques

1100
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,200
Then

1101
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,480
he asked me to move in with him

1102
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,440
and even changed the passcode

1103
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,560
to my birthday

1104
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,880
Xiao Xiao Wang discovered

1105
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,200
a tracking device on himself

1106
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:24,880
A tracker

1107
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,400
We discussed at the time

1108
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,280
whether to discard the tracker

1109
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,800
but were afraid of alerting someone

1110
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,520
Since we didn't know

1111
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,800
who had placed the tracker on him

1112
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,600
so he gave the tracker to me

1113
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,800
Moreover, he gave me a key.

1114
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,240
It's said that inside here

1115
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,680
there are many important clues

1116
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,840
Right, there's one box we haven't opened

1117
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,400
While everyone's here together,

1118
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,920
let me ask you one more question.

1119
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,000
About this "Meet You" organization,

1120
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,880
what kind of organization is it?

1121
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,000
Would you mind telling us about it?

1122
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,400
Meow meow

1123
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,920
Tea and fruits meet

1124
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,880
"Meet You" (organization name)

1125
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,840
Thank you to the "Meet You" organization

1126
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,760
for giving me this opportunity

1127
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,400
Would you mind telling us about it?

1128
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,800
No, I wouldn't

1129
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,840
Why, grandpa?

1130
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:30,800
Alright

1131
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,400
Okay, grandpa

1132
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,040
Let me ask one question

1133
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,280
Earlier on the phone you were talking in your sleep

1134
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,800
What was that about?

1135
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,360
Right

1136
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,040
That's right

1137
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,080
You said "don't jump"

1138
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,880
Jump from what?

1139
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,640
Don't jump

1140
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,800
Don't jump

1141
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,120
This "don't jump"

1142
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,640
Actually it's because

1143
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,320
The most important person to me

1144
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:47,920
When they jumped from the building

1145
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,760
I didn't see it

1146
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,360
I deeply regret it

1147
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,840
I've always wished I had been there

1148
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,080
I could have stopped him

1149
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,560
Then I think our top priority

1150
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,920
is to check the tracker

1151
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,440
Where is the tracker?

1152
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,200
It's on me

1153
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,440
There's also a key

1154
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,520
Yes, you gave it to us

1155
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,320
This is the tracker

1156
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,560
This is the key

1157
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:16,880
Okay

1158
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,560
Let's split up

1159
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,280
and go to Old Wang's shop

1160
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,120
to check the key he left

1161
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,720
and see if there are any other clues

1162
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,760
Because he said there were important clues

1163
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,480
in that box

1164
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,080
Where's the tracker?

1165
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,040
He gave it to me

1166
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,600
Let me get you your favorite snack

1167
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,440
Xiao Bai, you like Oreos too?

1168
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
Did your mom name you Xiao Bai

1169
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,640
because you like the white cream in Oreos?

1170
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,760
(continuation of previous line)

1171
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,360
That's right

1172
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,120
No wonder our Lao Li likes

1173
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,240
the black Oreos

1174
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,640
Just like the black cookies

1175
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,520
protecting the white cream

1176
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,560
He probably hopes

1177
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,640
to always protect you all

1178
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,200
These Oreos are our family's

1179
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,280
lucky little cookies

1180
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,680
Come on, let's all eat together

1181
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,880
Oreos are like a family

1182
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,560
The white cream can't exist alone

1183
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,720
The black and white embracing, playing together

1184
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,000
will keep our family together forever

1185
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:10,840
Okay

1186
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,200
Alright

1187
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:11,560
Good

1188
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,800
You guys investigate thoroughly here

1189
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,120
Fine

1190
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,400
You just

1191
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,640
I'll go find that

1192
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,200
Xiao He

1193
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,320
I'll go to the boss

1194
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,280
To report that everything's fine

1195
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,320
All right then

1196
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,280
I'll go ahead first

1197
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,040
I won't bother with you guys then

1198
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,560
Go ahead

1199
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,600
Goodbye

1200
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,560
From what I remember,

1201
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,120
there was a secret passage.

1202
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,360
It's over here.

1203
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:40,920
Yes.

1204
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,800
Get down

1205
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,920
Someone's here

1206
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,160
Keep all the elderly safely at home

1207
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,400
If you see any young people on the street

1208
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Arrest them all

1209
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,400
Song Piaoliang, go inside by yourself

1210
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,280
Then close the door

1211
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,760
You guys

1212
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,280
Get out of the photo studio

1213
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,120
Go find those young people from earlier

1214
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,120
I'm already inside.

1215
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,560
Come out

1216
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,720
Alright, let's go

1217
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,160
Go

1218
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,600
I'll cover the rear

1219
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:48,280
Move

1220
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,280
Little Wang

1221
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,640
Counter keys

1222
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,240
There are scratches on the lock

1223
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:18,960
It's been opened by someone

1224
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,560
Then this doll appeared again

1225
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,000
It's foretelling "death"

1226
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,160
It only foretells "the deceased"

1227
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,880
This looks like a

1228
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,520
tear open

1229
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,240
Let's search the Twitter location tracker

1230
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,600
Right

1231
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,840
Got it

1232
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,760
Two hundred thirty

1233
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,840
Zhou

1234
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,640
What?

1235
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,080
b

1236
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,960
Isn't this Zhou Keke's "Biao Biao"?

1237
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,640
This profile picture

1238
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,240
Yes

1239
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,400
This username might be Zhou Biao Biao

1240
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,400
Yes, Zhou BB

1241
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,480
That must be his online alias

1242
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,440
Zhou Keke himself

1243
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,400
But he uses "Biao Biao" as his username

1244
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:08,840
Right?

1245
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,320
Suspicious, right?

1246
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,240
Go

1247
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,080
Which room does Zhou Keke live in?

1248
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,000
7th (floor)

1249
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,760
701

1250
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,200
Cocoa is actually a scientist

1251
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,640
A chemist

1252
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,880
He might not just be making chocolate

1253
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,640
Right

1254
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,560
Making chocolate doesn't involve such complicated things

1255
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,080
There's a notebook here

1256
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:43,720
Friends

1257
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,920
Niao Niao's Diary Protecting Keke

1258
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,160
Is this Niao Niao a living creature?

1259
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,280
Or does this person have dual...

1260
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,560
split personalities?

1261
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,080
Yes, like having multiple personalities

1262
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,720
Is there something?

1263
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,240
Youth Photo Studio

1264
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,800
Is this that piece of paper?

1265
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,320
Yes

1266
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,760
Give it to Sister Cai

1267
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,520
He's highly suspicious

1268
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,160
Find him

1269
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:10,760
Okay

1270
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,000
Zhou Biaobiao

1271
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,160
said

1272
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,920
Stop pinching me

1273
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,160
I told you earlier

1274
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,000
to confess honestly

1275
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,920
Now look

1276
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,240
That tracker is mine

1277
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,200
Also found at his place was

1278
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,480
a dedicated drug-making area

1279
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,480
It's a chemistry lab

1280
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,880
A place for making drugs - date rape drugs

1281
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,640
That was for developing

1282
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,320
chocolate-flavored products

1283
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,600
There was also a notebook

1284
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,920
"Biaobiao's Diary Protecting Keke"

1285
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,880
"Keke don't cry"

1286
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,800
"Mom is gone"

1287
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,680
"Biaobiao is still here"

1288
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,200
It's like... what is he

1289
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,240
When his mother "passed away"

1290
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,120
he became extremely depressed

1291
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,040
Maybe he imagined that thing as

1292
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,080
protection

1293
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:07,720
emotional support

1294
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,480
Yes, emotional support

1295
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,360
You see

1296
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,520
He was bullied as a child

1297
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,120
They said nobody wanted this kid

1298
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,120
He would say "Biaobiao"

1299
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:14,880
"Keke don't listen"

1300
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,920
It was that kind of protection

1301
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,280
comforting him

1302
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,600
watching over him

1303
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,880
And when someone bullied Keke

1304
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,120
he would take revenge

1305
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,280
he would take revenge

1306
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,240
Split personality

1307
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,640
There's a phone here

1308
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,720
It's yours

1309
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,000
This is Keke

1310
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:36,720
Don't don't (a nickname)

1311
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,640
I've found the "murderer"

1312
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,840
Those who hurt you

1313
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,960
should all "die"

1314
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,280
should all "die"

1315
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,880
He said to Don't don't

1316
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,960
I've found the "murderer"

1317
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,800
Those who hurt you

1318
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,920
should all "die"

1319
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,400
Zhou Keke also has a "motive for murder"

1320
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,480
Zhou Keke came in last

1321
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,400
Zhou Keke didn't come in

1322
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,040
The place where drugs are made

1323
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,880
Date rape drug

1324
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,520
We came here

1325
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,720
He must have brought us here

1326
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,800
Zhou Keke is acting very strange today

1327
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,000
should all "die"

1328
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,440
Speak for yourself

1329
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,000
It wasn't me

1330
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,720
Now that it's come to this

1331
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,840
You still won't confess

1332
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,720
It wasn't me

1333
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,640
How could it not be you? It was Biubiu, right?

1334
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,840
Shifting the blame onto

1335
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,680
When the next time comes

1336
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,400
We won't bring Biubiu

1337
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,280
Biubiu's been taken in

1338
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,840
Come on, even though there's no property surveillance room today

1339
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,880
But you go over there

1340
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,560
Zhou Biaobiao

1341
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,320
Let me confess honestly

1342
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,520
I'm actually Old Li's son

1343
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,400
My full name

1344
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,960
My real name is Li Erzi (Li Son)

1345
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,360
Li Erzi

1346
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,520
Truly a great name

1347
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,200
Yes, I put in a lot of effort

1348
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:55,800
to come up with this name

1349
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,280
Li Erzi

1350
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,080
You checked the dictionary

1351
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:57,880
Right, I looked it up

1352
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,440
When I was five years old

1353
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,320
When my mother went to find cocoa beans

1354
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,600
she "accidentally fell to her death"

1355
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,400
Then my father

1356
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,600
which is you

1357
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,000
said nothing at all

1358
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,440
He just left a note

1359
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,800
"I can't raise you anymore"

1360
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,720
and then left me

1361
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,960
How heartless

1362
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,280
Fortunately I had my aunt

1363
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,480
Aunt Zhou

1364
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,520
She raised me until I was ten

1365
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,960
She treated me like a mother

1366
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,840
So Aunt Zhou followed

1367
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,960
our Zhou family tradition

1368
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,840
of ABB-style names

1369
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,360
and gave me this name

1370
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,160
called Zhou Keke

1371
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,200
Then later

1372
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,760
when I turned ten

1373
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,840
Aunt Zhou also "passed away"

1374
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,080
So I went to the orphanage

1375
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,640
Then only Zhou Biaobiao

1376
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,080
could stay with me

1377
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,960
Mom always kept "Bie Bie" for me

1378
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,320
Because when I was little

1379
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,280
everyone kept saying I didn't have a father

1380
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,280
and "Bie Bie" was

1381
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,720
I was the pot that made the first chocolate with Zhou Mama

1382
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,360
(continuation of previous line)

1383
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,240
But

1384
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,240
because Mama

1385
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,040
left Zhou Keke

1386
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,080
she told me

1387
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,120
I must protect Zhou Keke

1388
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,160
When he gets bullied

1389
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,840
I must come out and fight those bad people for him

1390
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,520
Why is he called Zhou Keke?

1391
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,800
Because Zhou Keke is afraid of offending others

1392
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,440
or making people unhappy

1393
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,840
Whatever people ask him to do

1394
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,240
he does it

1395
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,960
He never says no

1396
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,600
Only when I appear

1397
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,600
can I say for him

1398
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,120
"Don't bully Zhou Keke"

1399
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,080
So

1400
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,160
"Biao Biao" is the one who can shout for me

1401
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,560
"I don't want to do that thing"

1402
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,400
"No"

1403
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,240
Zhou Keke will do anything

1404
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,400
What is this thing?

1405
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,320
But we became friends so quickly

1406
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,160
Indeed

1407
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:10,800
Right

1408
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,560
Let's make another chocolate today

1409
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,880
Okay, great

1410
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,320
Bai Sanwan, you kicked someone's door down again

1411
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,480
Why do you always kick doors?

1412
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,640
Yeah

1413
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,240
Too violent

1414
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,400
Bai Song 1 Guo Zhou

1415
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,200
Liu 1 Cool

1416
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,360
Then, but

1417
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,600
Auntie Zhou kept telling me

1418
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,000
that my father "killed"

1419
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,600
my mother

1420
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,520
But after investigating

1421
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,040
I discovered

1422
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,760
that actually my mother

1423
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,440
was "murdered" by two people that day

1424
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,240
One of them

1425
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,640
had a mole on his neck

1426
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,360
Then I found someone with a mole

1427
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,120
That person was called Xiao Xiao Wang

1428
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,200
What did you do to him?

1429
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,800
On the 25th, I found Xiao Xiao Wang

1430
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,120
He lived in our apartment building

1431
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:52,920
Then on the 26th

1432
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,600
I secretly followed him to his home

1433
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,080
I figured out his password

1434
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,880
and sneaked in

1435
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,040
I placed a tracker on his clothes

1436
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,840
I wanted to track his daily movements

1437
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,360
where he went

1438
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,680
I wanted to avenge my mother

1439
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,160
But on the 27th I discovered

1440
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,920
my tracking device's location

1441
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,960
stopped updating

1442
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,680
When I tried to check the tracker again

1443
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,520
to see if there were any changes

1444
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,600
I found I couldn't access it anymore

1445
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,320
Verification failed

1446
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,200
System locked

1447
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,280
The password had been changed

1448
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,520
I never saw Xiao Xiao Wang again

1449
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,720
So I never got the chance

1450
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,760
to do this thing

1451
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,920
But look at the back of the "victim's" head

1452
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,200
Was that hit by your "Biao Biao"?

1453
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,320
But haven't you noticed

1454
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,520
my dad raised a question?

1455
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,080
What he said was

1456
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,160
"The victim"

1457
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,440
recreated all the original criminal methods

1458
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,240
I simply don't know

1459
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,240
what those criminal methods were

1460
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,800
When that incident happened

1461
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,880
I wasn't even born yet

1462
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,760
But Xiao Xiao Wang

1463
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,120
actually wasn't there at the time either

1464
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,720
It's not necessarily that

1465
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,840
you had to be present at the time

1466
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,200
to know how to "kill" this person

1467
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:56,840
right?

1468
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,640
As long as you know Old Wang's (Xiao Wang's)

1469
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,600
this secret, that's enough

1470
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,840
Koko really doesn't know anything

1471
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,360
Koko just wants to help mom

1472
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:11,720
No

1473
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,880
There's one question

1474
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,400
Why did you want Sister Cai to go in?

1475
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,440
For Sister Cai

1476
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,480
It's about getting Sister Cai

1477
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,920
involved in this scam

1478
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:19,840
That Sister Cai...

1479
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,800
I just noticed she's been very unhappy lately

1480
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,520
But Youth Photo Studio claimed

1481
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,080
they could make every elderly person happy

1482
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,920
So you sent her there

1483
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,360
to have others lock her up?

1484
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,680
No, I didn't know what was inside

1485
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,120
I only knew

1486
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,160
it was a happy place

1487
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:30,880
I wanted her to be happy

1488
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,400
So you'd

1489
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,360
been to this place before?

1490
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,680
Never been there

1491
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,880
I just saw the flyer

1492
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,240
Do you know who Sister Cai is?

1493
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,400
I don't know Sister Cai

1494
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,760
Our relationship...

1495
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,200
Sister Cai really liked

1496
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,240
eating the chocolates I made

1497
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:44,960
And Sister Cai

1498
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,680
she's also someone like me

1499
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,280
abandoned and all alone

1500
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,480
Who knew we were abandoned by the same person

1501
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,320
This is what the three of us rummaged through

1502
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,480
You guys are here at their place

1503
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,480
rummaging through things again

1504
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,320
This is it

1505
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,080
So many clues

1506
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,560
Because there's another doll

1507
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,680
What does this doll say?

1508
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,360
Don't go to Chuyang Alley

1509
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,080
Disobey and you'll "die"

1510
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:27,680
Don't what?

1511
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,600
Don't go to Chuyang Alley

1512
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,000
Don't go to Chuyang Alley—you'll "die"

1513
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,800
This was their original modus operandi

1514
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,720
Just as we suspected

1515
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,960
Let me see

1516
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,120
Even with both doors locked

1517
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,320
The "murder" could still be committed from outside

1518
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,320
Replace the mattress with a special air cushion

1519
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,600
Hide the extended inflation valve

1520
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,160
on the air cushion

1521
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,240
Attach a thin wire

1522
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,520
Secure the other end of the wire

1523
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,680
outside the vent window

1524
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,560
Possibly before the fire started

1525
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,960
He used something like balloons

1526
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,720
to stack this "corpse" unusually high

1527
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,360
Step two: after someone enters the warehouse

1528
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,080
Use "knockout smoke" to render them unconscious

1529
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,400
This is the "knockout smoke"

1530
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:58,880
That is

1531
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,680
the anesthetic drug

1532
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,680
He likely knocked them out first

1533
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,400
Step three

1534
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,560
Outside the warehouse, use wooden crates

1535
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,280
to build a ladder

1536
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,320
Climb near the vent window

1537
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,440
Then pull the thin wire

1538
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,560
to extend the inflation valve outside the vent

1539
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,600
Connect the air pump to inflate

1540
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,840
Wait until the bed rises to the vent

1541
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,840
"Kill" them with a brick

1542
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,200
Up to this point

1543
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:13,680
Then inflate

1544
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:15,960
After full inflation

1545
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,840
Reach a hand inside

1546
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,800
Take the brick

1547
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,280
"Dead"

1548
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,680
Great, we've successfully deduced it again

1549
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,240
Impressive

1550
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:21,880
Excellent

1551
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,560
Then they said

1552
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,640
Our "murder" plan

1553
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,160
doesn't require executing the full method

1554
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:28,680
Day 1

1555
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,480
Complete step one during the warehouse open day

1556
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,480
Which is to replace the bed

1557
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,480
Then place the inflation valve on the air mattress

1558
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,200
Run an air hose from the valve to the outside

1559
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,400
Hide gasoline in the warehouse

1560
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,320
Day 2

1561
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,640
At 3 PM I'll first take down the staff

1562
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,400
Hide them behind the counter

1563
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,400
Then we'll all enter the warehouse together

1564
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,680
After "killing," prepare everything

1565
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,640
Then leave peacefully

1566
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,480
Xiaoxiao Wang "committed suicide"

1567
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,320
No

1568
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,080
Xiaoxiao Wang didn't intend to "commit suicide"

1569
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,920
Because he originally planned to finish it

1570
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,760
and then leave

1571
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,360
He crossed out three and four.

1572
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,920
He plans to skip steps three and four

1573
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,440
Right

1574
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,400
He thinks steps three and four are unnecessary

1575
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,360
Steps three and four involve inflating from outside

1576
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:16,800
Inflating

1577
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,000
Either method could "eliminate" him

1578
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,360
So if he chooses arson

1579
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:20,840
He wouldn't need

1580
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,640
to "bludgeon" him with bricks

1581
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,720
No need for the air cushion

1582
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,280
That's the idea

1583
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,040
Just knock him out directly

1584
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,240
then finish by "burning" him

1585
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,120
But both methods

1586
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,560
still appeared at the crime scene

1587
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,080
meaning both were carried out

1588
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,320
No

1589
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,800
It means there's another person

1590
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,320
Little Wang originally

1591
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,560
wanted to follow the plan below

1592
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,080
But he didn't do it

1593
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,080
and just burned it directly

1594
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,800
But there must be someone else

1595
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,280
who wanted to "eliminate" Little Wang along with it

1596
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:47,960
holding a brick

1597
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,960
to "smash" both of them

1598
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,200
That person must have seen this paper too.

1599
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,600
Who else might have seen this thing?

1600
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,400
This was likely written by two people

1601
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,920
One in red, one in blue

1602
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,360
Was this done with you?

1603
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,240
The initial plan was written by me.

1604
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,760
Because he wanted to recreate the original crime method.

1605
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,200
Yes.

1606
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,240
The earlier plan was drafted by me.

1607
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,160
But it was later modified with blue pen.

1608
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,200
Disclosed by Xiao Xiao Wang.

1609
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,040
I told him.

1610
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,080
Old Wang (Xiao Wang) that I discovered.

1611
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,080
The crime steps at that time.

1612
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,680
Then I told him.

1613
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,840
Is there anything inside the bag?

1614
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,480
A woman's wig

1615
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,520
There's "blood" on this

1616
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,920
Little Wang, I won't let you succeed

1617
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,920
If you insist on this

1618
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,560
then your fate

1619
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,160
will be like these stinky dance shoes

1620
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,000
and this rotten wig

1621
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,240
rotten and stinking

1622
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,280
A Pair of Embroidered Shoes

1623
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,400
Look, it's marked here with "Ladybug"

1624
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,320
This storage room

1625
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,960
And there's a circle drawn around Ladybug

1626
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,560
Where is Ladybug?

1627
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,240
According to this map

1628
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,280
The dance hall

1629
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,840
Ladybug's office

1630
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,560
We still need to go to the dance hall first, right?

1631
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,160
Only then can we find out

1632
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:32,720
Right

1633
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,160
But we need to find a way to distract them

1634
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,040
Before we can go to the dance hall

1635
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,680
You guys go out through the photo studio

1636
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,160
And look for those young people from earlier

1637
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,800
Can we get out from this way?

1638
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,400
The problem is

1639
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,160
It seems we can't exit from here

1640
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:51,920
Let me check again

1641
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,360
Can't get out

1642
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,640
Can't go this way, that door's locked

1643
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,080
You've found all these keys, right?

1644
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,080
Xiao Xiao Wang gave me a key

1645
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,240
So this key

1646
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,800
is for opening the storage room door

1647
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,440
This secret passage leads to the warehouse

1648
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:18,840
Right

1649
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,080
Blindfold them

1650
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,760
This is the storage room

1651
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,000
This storage room should connect to

1652
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,240
today's warehouse

1653
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,160
So if we exit from here

1654
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,360
we can actually reach the courtyard

1655
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,960
You can't go to the courtyard, they're still there

1656
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,480
If you go out

1657
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,680
they'll catch you and take you to the storage room

1658
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,760
right?

1659
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,160
The storage room is accessible now

1660
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:46,920
so it doesn't matter

1661
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,320
We just need someone to make a trip there

1662
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,520
Then while they're being captured

1663
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,840
you all go to the dance hall

1664
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,720
The problem is the remaining person

1665
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,760
can't go to the dance hall

1666
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,840
We need to find a way to distract them

1667
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,680
so we can go to the dance hall

1668
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,760
and bring them inside

1669
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:01,400
It's locked

1670
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,640
Ours is locked too, we can't get out

1671
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,360
The storage room is accessible now

1672
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,680
Could this chain be useful?

1673
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,000
I've got it

1674
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,960
One person exits through the main gate.

1675
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,120
Then they're going to

1676
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,040
escort him back and lock him in the storage room, right?

1677
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,280
Then you turn around

1678
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,760
we'll follow his steps

1679
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,520
closely behind them

1680
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,840
Once they enter the main courtyard

1681
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,080
there's that iron gate, right?

1682
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,320
Just lock this at that iron gate

1683
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:22,840
lock it

1684
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,640
Then he comes out from here

1685
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,800
There's also this chain here

1686
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,520
We've got so many locks

1687
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,040
If he runs out

1688
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,160
just lock the windows and it's done

1689
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:31,920
Right

1690
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,400
Okay

1691
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,920
I'll go lure them

1692
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,320
Are you sure?

1693
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,160
Don't go alone

1694
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,200
Come on, let's go together holding hands

1695
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,240
Let's go, no need to hold hands

1696
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,480
Alright, let's go, ready

1697
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,080
Wait, don't go yet

1698
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:43,920
Wait

1699
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,560
Hold on

1700
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,200
Bro

1701
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,080
Don't do this

1702
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:51,720
Here

1703
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,640
have something to eat

1704
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,800
Two kids

1705
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,960
Let's play marbles

1706
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,480
Yes, we're going to play shuttlecock

1707
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,040
Have you played this before?

1708
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,240
Grab them

1709
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,480
Don't

1710
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,320
Stop grabbing people

1711
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,680
We didn't do anything

1712
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,920
Why are we all being grabbed?

1713
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,800
Why are you dragging us away again?

1714
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,760
Caught

1715
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,240
Don't want to

1716
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,200
Entering the door again

1717
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:11,800
Back in the warehouse again

1718
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,800
Why are we in the warehouse again?

1719
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,160
Warehouse again

1720
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,360
I'm exhausted

1721
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,360
We're in, back in this courtyard again

1722
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,240
Come on, hurry

1723
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,040
Quick

1724
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,720
What are you doing?

1725
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,440
Then where should we go?

1726
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:28,760
Then where should we go?

1727
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,080
What should we do?

1728
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,360
No key.

1729
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,400
No key.

1730
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,640
What should we do?

1731
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,320
Key.

1732
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,160
Key.

1733
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,440
We forgot the key.

1734
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,960
"You killed someone"

1735
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,440
Shut up

1736
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,840
You coward

1737
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,120
You irresponsible bastard

1738
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,480
How can you face my elder sister?

1739
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,400
You little brats causing trouble here

1740
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,240
None of you are getting out

1741
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,680
Sister Hua locked the door

1742
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,320
That threatening letter you wrote

1743
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,320
We saw it

1744
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,840
You two betrayed the boss

1745
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,760
Besides Old Wang (or Xiao Wang)

1746
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,960
There's an even bigger boss

1747
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,680
Traitors

1748
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,080
At this critical moment, you still won't confess

1749
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,080
Dad, believe me

1750
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:11,960
I believe

1751
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,160
This person's using the "self-injury" tactic

1752
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,880
Keke really doesn't know anything

1753
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,800
Keke just wants...

1754
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,720
Don't bully Zhou Keke

1755
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,560
