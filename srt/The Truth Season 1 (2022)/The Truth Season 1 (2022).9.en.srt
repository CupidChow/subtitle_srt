1
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:20,880
Hello,

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,600
you don't have many clients.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,320
There's only one client.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,480
I just moved in.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,040
Just moved in,

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,080
come on

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,600
Your room is really cool.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,640
Did I let you eat it?

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,600
Eat,

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,720
Make yourself at home.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,360
Brother Shi, take a look.

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,240
How much money do I have?

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,720
I don't even have money.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,280
Do you have money?

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,160
I'm a millionaire.

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,320
I'll buy it for the restaurant later.

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:39,760
Treat me.

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,560
You bought it for the three of us.

19
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,440
It seems that you are very loyal.

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,640
I'll buy it for you.

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,600
This way, I'm also very loyal.

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,800
You're so smart.

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,320
I think for our weekly story,

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,040
I can make a weekly serial.

25
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,880
You have to buy the copyright.

26
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,480
I'll hide your names.

27
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,560
For example, his name is Zhou Shen,

28
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,400
his name is INTO1 Zhou Keyu,

29
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,120
Your name is Modern Brother Liu Yuning,

30
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,080
aren't you the same as Song scriptwriter?

31
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,880
I just changed two words.

32
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,240
Who do you think the murderer is?

33
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,920
I think Fang Xiaomei is suspicious,

34
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
she has been leading the way.

35
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,360
Does she look like someone who can lead a rhythm?

36
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,120
What's wrong with you?

37
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,200
I'm telling you, you're such a mess.

38
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,440
After all, we have to treat your lover,

39
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,600
don't give me face next time.

40
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,040
It seems that they don't love each other very much.

41
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,720
You.

42
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,320
Wear a watch.

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,880
My brother didn't like ice cream,

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,280
so he killed my brother.

45
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,000
My brother's "death"

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,720
Is it not directly related to my brother?

47
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,080
Yes

48
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
"Love Killing"?

49
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
It has nothing to do with it.

50
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,480
Do you love your brother very much?

51
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,080
It has nothing to do with it.

52
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,160
My brother didn't know anything about the freezer,

53
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,280
so he put his brother in there

54
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,960
and froze him to death,

55
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,560
No,

56
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,880
I threw away all the ice cream

57
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,000
in the house.

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,800
And then my brother died

59
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,880
because he couldn't eat ice cream,

60
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,400
Well,

61
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,160
did my brother die because he ate ice cream?

62
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,680
No.

63
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
Did my brother die by accident?

64
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,560
Yes.

65
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,480
But Liu, you don't have a bed in your room.

66
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,120
You don't have a bed.

67
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,080
There's really no bed in this room.

68
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,200
I want to sleep with the dog.

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,640
Right?

70
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,720
Which board do you usually sleep on?

71
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,720
I can sleep with the dog.

72
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,240
Open the cabinet and go to sleep.

73
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,000
Your room is really cool.

74
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,720
Hello,

75
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,960
Dog,

76
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,600
No licking.

77
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,080
Sit down

78
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,720
You have so few clients.

79
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,440
Only one client,

80
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:06,680
yes,

81
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,560
I just moved in.

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,000
He just moved in.

83
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,160
This is his studio,

84
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,840
It doesn't look like a house

85
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,640
or a studio to me.

86
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,960
If you don't recover well.

87
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,840
I don't think I can get out of here.

88
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,760
Come on!

89
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,000
-What's going on? -Forget

90
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
it. That's it.

91
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,920
It was suspended just now,

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,440
but now the magnet seems to be

93
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,280
broken by Bai San Bowl,

94
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,080
It has nothing to do with me.

95
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,600
You broke it, didn't you?

96
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,640
Yes.

97
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,080
Guo Baoyou,

98
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,560
are you really

99
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,640
wearing sneakers in your pajamas?

100
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:18,920
Really?

101
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,240
Why are you wearing sneakers?

102
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,800
Slippers,

103
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,360
look at this.

104
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,280
There's another one who just came back from the show,

105
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,280
who just came back from the show,

106
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,240
You're back from the show,

107
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,280
why are you pretending to be a bossy president?

108
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,440
It's just a substitute training, isn't it?

109
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,600
No, I'm unemployed.

110
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,120
Unemployed vagrants.

111
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,840
Unemployed vagrants.

112
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,480
Freelance?

113
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,360
So I ate it.

114
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,320
Did I let you eat?

115
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,120
Eat,

116
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,240
As if it were your own home,

117
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,400
I told you that it's like being your own home.

118
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,520
Eat a banana,

119
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,960
the first thing Liu came down to say,

120
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,000
Did I let you eat?

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,600
Yes.

122
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,880
Let's sit down for a while.

123
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,440
You guys are too noisy.

124
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,240
You don't have much room to sit in,

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,120
so why did you ask us to come here?

126
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,280
Where the dog sits,

127
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,000
you can sit,

128
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,680
Yes.

129
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,400
What's the real name of our group?

130
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,240
It's settled, isn't it?

131
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,680
Our name is Bai Song 1 Guo Zhou

132
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,240
Liu 1 Cool,

133
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,640
Take off your shoes?

134
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,080
Up here,

135
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,520
you have to take it off.

136
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,840
Don't take it off.

137
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,560
Do you want to take off the dog?

138
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,520
But we don't have to take it off,

139
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,080
but dogs do?

140
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,920
Who are you looking down on?

141
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,240
Sit down,

142
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,320
Come on.

143
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,440
I'm not a dog.

144
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,120
Brother,

145
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
grab it.

146
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,080
Scratch it.

147
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,000
Qiafan,

148
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,120
let's go.

149
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
Fried chicken with potato beef brisket and ginger,

150
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,200
scrambled egg with tomato,

151
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,000
A bumper harvest of grain,

152
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,920
hot and sour squid rolls,

153
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,840
Shredded lettuce. Brother Shi,

154
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
take a look at me. How much is it?

155
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,360
I did.

156
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,760
Why did you come first again?

157
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,440
I'm hungry.

158
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,280
Your money?

159
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,800
I don't even have money.

160
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,960
Not only do you have no money,

161
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,000
but look at you,

162
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,600
You learned Brother Teng from me again,

163
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,480
and you even keep accounts,

164
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,720
Why didn't you pay the property fee?

165
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,360
You don't even charge the restaurant card.

166
00:05:59,680 --> 00:05:59,960
What's wrong with that?

167
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,680
Who is this?

168
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,320
What do you

169
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,440
want to buy?

170
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,960
Packing box,

171
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,640
packing basin,

172
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,400
Ke Wu is so cool.

173
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
Who wants to hold a basin?

174
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,720
Have a leopard print. Let me see

175
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,560
how much money you have.

176
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:09,960
I don't know.

177
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,680
I'll take a look

178
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,160
and then you can pull it.

179
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,200
Ten yuan.

180
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,960
Ten yuan.

181
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,560
But Xiao He,

182
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,880
I have good news for you,

183
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,640
189 yuan.

184
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,520
The owner of Box

185
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,800
has decided to pack it for you.

186
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,680
Because you've been acting

187
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,440
more seriously lately?

188
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:22,880
Yes.

189
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,440
Thank you, boss.

190
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,240
The work is worth it.

191
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,480
Give me ten yuan then.

192
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,080
Okay,

193
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,840
I owe you eight yuan, don't I?

194
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,960
Here's ten yuan.

195
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,480
You want to give me two yuan?

196
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:31,800
No.

197
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,320
Last time, you took He's meal

198
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,040
for a month,

199
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,680
I ate too much.

200
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,640
So now we all have one card for each of us,

201
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,520
and we are not allowed to swipe it on behalf of him,

202
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,280
This is mine.

203
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,080
You don't have to worry about it.

204
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,560
It's okay.

205
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,280
It's written here,

206
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,800
Guo,

207
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
it says "He",

208
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,640
Don't look,

209
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,120
Guo.

210
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,680
Look,

211
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,200
there's no deduction,

212
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,560
I really can't do it.

213
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,280
Otherwise,

214
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,960
More credit.

215
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,200
More credit.

216
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,160
Would you like to

217
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,240
pay the bill on credit?

218
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,800
Write an IOU,

219
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,720
sign it,

220
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,560
-I'm not

221
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,880
coming. -Come on, pretty!

222
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,320
Why are you so greedy?

223
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,880
I had a set meal

224
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
for 58 yuan yesterday,

225
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,440
58 yuan will be deducted.

226
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,120
Look at your card.

227
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,680
In the past week,

228
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,840
you've been coming one after another,

229
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,600
You're out of money?

230
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,760
You don't have any money in your card?

231
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,440
Last time, he told me that he had no money.

232
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,360
That's why we have to

233
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,320
pay the property fee on credit.

234
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,280
You have one, too.

235
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,440
Yes, I don't have any money.

236
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,400
Ke Wuku has no money.

237
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,120
Ke Wuku doesn't have money either.

238
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,600
Do you have money?

239
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,520
I'm a millionaire.

240
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,040
He's a millionaire.

241
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
How much money do you have in this card?

242
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,160
I'll buy the restaurant later.

243
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,640
Treat me.

244
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,960
How much money do you have in your card?

245
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,480
I don't have much money in the card,

246
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,840
it's 189 yuan.

247
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,520
189 yuan

248
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,560
is enough to treat us to dinner.

249
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,240
One card for each of us.

250
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,880
No way.

251
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,320
He eats three portions.

252
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,400
I have a big appetite,

253
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,600
so let's just take a plate,

254
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,400
We can use one with him.

255
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,720
Come on, Brother Bai.

256
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,360
How much is it?

257
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you have money?

258
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,360
Brother Bai,

259
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,600
Brother,

260
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,280
I'm here.

261
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
Thank you,

262
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,520
Brother Bai,

263
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,240
Just brush one person today.

264
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,640
You have 183 yuan in your card,

265
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,880
so he can eat it for three people.

266
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,440
You don't even have money in your cards.

267
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,320
I'm a millionaire,

268
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,240
Neither of us,

269
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,160
not even a single point,

270
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,040
We owe each other eight yuan.

271
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,120
Millionaire.

272
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,400
Yes

273
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,560
Just invite all of us.

274
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,760
But I don't have money in my card.

275
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,640
Can a millionaire deposit it in a meal card?

276
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,040
Exactly

277
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,320
How many people can I pay

278
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,760
if I deposit 1 million yuan in the bus card?

279
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,960
How much money do you have?

280
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,960
Are you going to pay them all?

281
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,720
Pay it.

282
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,960
You should be able to pay for three people.

283
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,800
Pay the three of you,

284
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,720
Pay,

285
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,640
All right. How about this?

286
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,920
You treat the three of us.

287
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,760
It seems that you are very loyal.

288
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,280
Then I'll buy it for you.

289
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,200
This way, I'm also very loyal.

290
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay,

291
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,320
Okay,

292
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,680
Sure

293
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,840
That makes sense.

294
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,640
You're so smart.

295
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,760
Sure, no problem.

296
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,200
-Are you hungry? -Let's eat together.

297
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,240
I don't need it.

298
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,760
Thank you.

299
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,400
Those who have swiped their cards,

300
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,320
you can eat first.

301
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,800
Go ahead.

302
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,160
He's really

303
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,800
a good person.

304
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,000
Why are we living like this every day?

305
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You ask me,

306
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,600
I have to rely on other people's relief every day.

307
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,240
These noodles

308
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,800
are great. Hello.

309
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,920
Hello, sir.

310
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,440
Hello,

311
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,400
come on. 58 yuan.

312
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,120
You have 800 yuan.

313
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,480
So you're the boss.

314
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,720
My chocolate business is so good.

315
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,640
You have 800 yuan.

316
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,480
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

317
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,240
A real "local tyrant",

318
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,560
Okay,

319
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,600
Then I'll give you 58 yuan.

320
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:01,920
Okay,

321
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,400
Please confirm.

322
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,360
This consumption is 58 yuan,

323
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,600
leaving 742 yuan.

324
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,000
How much did you pay?

325
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,160
We only have over 100 yuan.

326
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,880
It only costs more than 100 yuan.

327
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,080
What does it taste like?

328
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,840
It's so annoying,

329
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,680
What do you mean?

330
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,440
Are you the boss?

331
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,920
Wait for me to get that 5million out.

332
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,440
I scared the hell out of you.

333
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,960
You really like noodles

334
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,560
and three bowls of white noodles.

335
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,960
Why don't you have 800 yuan

336
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,400
Zero yuan

337
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,960
I have zero yuan.

338
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,640
Zero yuan,

339
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,360
zero yuan for me too,

340
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,120
I still owe money.

341
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,720
Then why?

342
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,360
Because your business is good, right?

343
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,480
Because my chocolate is very popular.

344
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,640
Who has money in the card all the time?

345
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,600
This matter is very suspicious.

346
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Where did he get the money?

347
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,920
Maybe the business is really good.

348
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,240
You see,

349
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,640
Bai San Wan only sells three bowls of noodles every day,

350
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
How could he be rich?

351
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,400
You made 800 yuan this week.

352
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,480
I only earn 800 yuan a week.

353
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,720
The business is not very good either.

354
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,280
It costs more than 3 thousand a month.

355
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,920
Pushing the market,

356
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,120
earning 3 houses a month and walking sideways,

357
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,640
Yes, there's something very important

358
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,320
that I want to tell you,

359
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,640
As for the video you watched,

360
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,240
I have no idea.

361
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,120
Did you really not go

362
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,360
if you didn't know it?

363
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,160
Although I know him,

364
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,720
I really didn't know he lived here.

365
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,560
Did you really watch the video?

366
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,600
There is, isn't there?

367
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,560
It's indeed him.

368
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,360
Where is the video?

369
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,520
Whose room can we go to later?

370
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,040
In the cleaning room,

371
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,920
I think the cleaning room,

372
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,760
We need to go there again.

373
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,960
Yes. Let's observe it again.

374
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll swipe my card right away.

375
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,760
I'll swipe my card right away,

376
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,040
Come on.

377
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,240
We have a lot of rich people here.

378
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,080
Okay,

379
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,000
So you saw me

380
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,720
on the CCTV, didn't you?

381
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,160
Yes.

382
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,880
We saw you arguing with Song Huo.

383
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,600
Then Song Huo wrote a date,

384
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,880
"I've never been to Fang Xiaomei's room. ",

385
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,640
I haven't had any communication with Song Huo.

386
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,160
Then someone is trying to frame him.

387
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,840
It's his face again.

388
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,160
It doesn't have to be a whole thing. Maybe

389
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,040
he's wearing

390
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,360
a personal skin mask or something.

391
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,680
You have a big brain,

392
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,960
do you mean wearing a leather headgear?

393
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,480
That video

394
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,680
is you.

395
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,760
You feel that

396
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,680
it's just like what you took.

397
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,520
Video synthesis,

398
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,320
AI face-changing,

399
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Among the current suspects,

400
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,840
who would have such a level?

401
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,440
By the computer,

402
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,000
Mei,

403
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,400
Yes,

404
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,920
she's good at beauty,

405
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
She's good at beauty,

406
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,800
so when she was

407
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,920
in a video

408
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,080
with Moonlight,

409
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,240
I didn't even notice her in the moonlight.

410
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,640
He doesn't look like that at all.

411
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,960
But that's real-time monitoring. It's not easy

412
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,680
to change your face.

413
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
It's all real time.

414
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,000
No,

415
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,600
I think it's possible to change your face.

416
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,440
But it's possible that you're lying.

417
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,040
It's possible,

418
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,840
of course,

419
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,640
You're right.

420
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,280
I can also say that

421
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,080
you are all accomplices.

422
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,000
But when Liu Xia was questioned,

423
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,120
he didn't act like a lying

424
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,400
Mr. Kewuku,

425
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,160
You do,

426
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,680
Yes

427
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,320
I'll show you when you've charged the money.

428
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,120
Give it a try.

429
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,560
Sorry, you only have 80 cents left in your card.

430
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,600
80 cents.

431
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,000
Come on, brother,

432
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,760
please sit down.

433
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,680
Okay. Thank you, brother.

434
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,000
Fifty-eight then.

435
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,400
Come on,

436
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,160
Please swipe your card.

437
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,880
It costs 58 yuan this time.

438
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,640
The sudden appearance of that long hair,

439
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,480
maybe it has something to do

440
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,120
with the guy who jumped off the building last week.

441
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,400
The one who jumped off the building last week,

442
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,160
finally,

443
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,000
Jia Jia with her sister (Detective)

444
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,040
It's gone too.

445
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,200
Where did Jia Jia go last?

446
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,880
Do you have her WeChat?

447
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
Isn't he Jia Jia's boyfriend?

448
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,200
You should have asked him.

449
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,720
The detective used Jia Jia's number to talk to me.

450
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,440
I should have asked Xiao Mei just now.

451
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,720
There's also an article in her diary that says,

452
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,760
Why did our beloved you

453
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,640
leave us?

454
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,400
Most importantly,

455
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,880
you left me forever.

456
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,480
Jia Jia said the same thing last week.

457
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,200
Unexpectedly,

458
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,640
You, who used to be so important to me,

459
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,440
would end your life by jumping off a building.

460
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,120
I'm sorry,

461
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,320
that's right. I forgot

462
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,880
the last article in the diary.

463
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,440
You guys,

464
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,920
I'm telling you, you're too messy.

465
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,800
You guys are weird.

466
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,080
After all, we have to keep it for your lover,

467
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,240
so you don't have to show me face next time.

468
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,640
What do you mean?

469
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,320
It seems that they don't love each other very much.

470
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,160
No.

471
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,240
You.

472
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,840
Wear a watch.

473
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,360
I'm back.

474
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,400
Are you sick?

475
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,040
I'm having plastic surgery,

476
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,560
You get plastic surgery too,

477
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,520
I get plastic surgery and you get plastic surgery too,

478
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,400
What's wrong with you?

479
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,880
After dressing up, I found that

480
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
this person is actually not that important anymore.

481
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,280
A makeover,

482
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,840
and now this 5million is my own,

483
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,680
There's also a possibility that

484
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,520
Xiaomei knows I'm Cao Yueguang.

485
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,000
But she doesn't love you anymore.

486
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,160
Yeah, she wanted money,

487
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,280
pretended to be in love with Song Huo,

488
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,080
Ask Song Huo to check on you

489
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,640
because Song Huo has

490
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,240
a transaction record.

491
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,080
One of them,

492
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,760
Song Huo told him,

493
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,800
He's going to kill me.

494
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,320
The man said,

495
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
yes, the money is in place,

496
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,680
Yes.

497
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,000
Take action as soon as the money is available.

498
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,120
Xiaomei gave Song Huo

499
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,760
your information on purpose.

500
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,200
I want him to get the money.

501
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,080
Divide it equally between two people.

502
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,480
And the message in the doll,

503
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,800
why is it like a reminder,

504
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,040
Stay away from the abandoned power distribution room.

505
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,840
If you don't listen, you'll die.

506
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,800
If you don't listen, you'll die.

507
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,920
That voice

508
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,800
sounds like a reminder,

509
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,960
We must protect Song Huo,

510
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,840
and tell him not to go to that place.

511
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,880
Or you'll die.

512
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,040
It sounds strange.

513
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
And that doll,

514
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,280
we don't have any evidence to prove it,

515
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,920
It must be Song Huo's own.

516
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,040
I think

517
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,760
since Song Huo went to his room

518
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,000
and took the bank card away, didn't he?

519
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,520
It means his goal should be money.

520
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,320
Yes, of course,

521
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,240
right?

522
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,520
But he didn't have time to pick it up.

523
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,200
So who do you think the murderer is?

524
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,720
I think Fang Xiaomei is suspicious too.

525
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,320
That's her.

526
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,880
Vote for her.

527
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,440
She's been leading the way.

528
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,040
Vote for her,

529
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,440
Yes.

530
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,640
Trying to hide something.

531
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,320
It's not like her. Does it look like

532
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,920
someone who can lead a rhythm?

533
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,160
You're sick.

534
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,280
What nonsense are you talking about?

535
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
I'm a conservative woman,

536
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,000
so you told Song Huo

537
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,640
the password of your house,

538
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,360
I'm not at home.

539
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,840
What if I lose my parcel at the door?

540
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,000
I bought them with my hard money,

541
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,640
so you'll be safe if you put them in your house.

542
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,520
Do you have a sister?

543
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,000
No, I didn't.

544
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,120
But I think you're cute.

545
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,960
If you want,

546
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,920
you can be my sister.

547
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,440
I like to be alone.

548
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,080
I'm telling you,

549
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,160
I'm going to tell the police now.

550
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,040
What do you mean?

551
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,120
Let's search it later.

552
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,680
The crime scene,

553
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,880
the crime scene and the cleaning room,

554
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,560
When we go to the crime scene,

555
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,960
there's one thing that's worth watching.

556
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,520
The footprints of the cat,

557
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,000
because

558
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,240
Every time there's a cat at the crime scene,

559
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,560
it's because he has cat footprints on him,

560
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,000
And the most relevant thing

561
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,800
about this cat's footprints last time,

562
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,080
The path of the murderer?

563
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,920
That's right.

564
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,120
There are cat footprints this time,

565
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,240
so we need to take a look again.

566
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,600
On the way to the cleaning room

567
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,200
and Xiao Mei's room,

568
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,920
Take a closer look. Yes,

569
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,800
take a closer look.

570
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,960
Is there anywhere else?

571
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,240
I think we all

572
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,640
have a story,

573
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,280
Otherwise, we wouldn't have been called here

574
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,240
at the same time

575
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,840
and rented here together.

576
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,200
And I think,

577
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,120
in fact, our life here,

578
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,480
It's very interesting.

579
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,760
I've been sorting out

580
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,880
what happened in the past week.

581
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,480
I think for our weekly story,

582
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,680
I can make a weekly serial.

583
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,000
Aren't you going to give us some money?

584
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,080
Sign something or something,

585
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,480
we archetypes,

586
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,280
You have to buy the copyright.

587
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,920
I'll hide your names.

588
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,520
I'll use an alias,

589
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
like his name is Zhou Shen,

590
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,320
His name is INTO1 Zhou Keyu,

591
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,160
and your name is Modern Brother Liu Yuning,

592
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,880
This is Song Zu'er

593
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,600
and this is Bai Yu,

594
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:41,920
No way.

595
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,480
Because our friends and family

596
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,040
saw this.

597
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,960
You think of us.

598
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,920
I won't think of it.

599
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,120
Aren't you the same as Song scriptwriter?

600
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,880
Just change two words,

601
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,800
are you the last time?

602
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,520
I saw the benefits in Song scriptwriter,

603
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,840
I'm a great writer,

604
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,480
Please respect me.

605
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,520
Is there money in the future?

606
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,840
Then you can treat us to dinner all the time.

607
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,760
When I earn the payment.

608
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,880
Isn't it already published?

609
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,560
No.

610
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,000
I haven't posted it yet.

611
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,240
It's just on my own

612
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,720
mystery novel network,

613
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,480
Maybe

614
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,120
we were hit hard by last week.

615
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,360
So it's like I was injected with chicken blood today.

616
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,320
The madness has started.

617
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,680
Well,

618
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,360
Go after him!

619
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,800
Well

620
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,680
Hide in that room.

621
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,040
Mr. Bai is so brave today.

622
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,000
He crossed all the cartons

623
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,800
one by one,

624
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,320
I heard a lot of noise.

625
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,760
At that time, I thought,

626
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,880
I was really risking my life to chase that body double Zhang.

627
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,440
They said I flew a little,

628
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,360
but that was instinct.

629
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,120
There's a box on the floor.

630
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,840
I just want to cross it.

631
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,880
I don't think it's that exaggerated.

632
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,400
Play properly.

633
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,520
I don't think so,

634
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,200
Brother,

635
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,680
Brother,

636
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,760
Be careful.

637
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,080
You're very suspicious.

638
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,440
Brother,

639
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,120
You're very suspicious.

640
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,640
We,

641
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,880
Can we hold on a little bit?

642
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Why is there a cat here?

643
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,040
I'm afraid of cats the most.

644
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,920
You can have this.

645
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,880
If you're in danger, just call me

646
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,240
"Brother, slow down".

647
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,960
It must be here.

648
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,160
There's a camera here.

649
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,960
How do we get up there?

650
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
I really can't get up there.

651
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,960
Let's go.

652
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,880
Come on,

653
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,760
That means you two are suspicious.

654
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,640
It's cool. It's nothing.

655
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
Okay, very clean.

656
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,839
Okay, throw the key back.

657
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,480
Indeed,

658
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,359
there's nothing.

659
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,760
What's wrong?

660
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,960
You're not allowed to push it.

661
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:15,800
Excuse me,

662
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,599
there's one,

663
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,040
No, I didn't.

664
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,440
In the secret compartment,

665
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,440
maybe there's a little bit inside,

666
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,960
After last week's experience,

667
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,319
this week,

668
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,880
Everyone has been interested in every corner,

669
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,599
every room,

670
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,480
Every place we went,

671
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,600
we did a carpet search.

672
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,640
Even if there are some things

673
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,400
that we don't understand in the first place,

674
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,960
But we found out in the first place,

675
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,360
what is HMSM?

676
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,280
What is this?

677
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Drink, touch, touch,

678
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,520
this is the password,

679
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,080
Add, subtract, multiply and divide.

680
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,200
How do you divide left and right?

681
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,360
Is this useless?

682
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,320
It's a door. The mirror

683
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,240
can be pushed open.

684
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240
So it's not a mirror.

685
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,000
That's glass.

686
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,000
Who can stand upside down with one hand?

687
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,840
Five,

688
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,880
Four,

689
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Three,

690
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,000
Two,

691
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,280
One,

692
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,760
Data collection is complete.

693
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,040
Drill and climb,

694
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
up and down,

695
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,240
Running and jumping,

696
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,400
it's a test for everyone's physical strength.

697
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,720
It seems that reasoning requires not only brain

698
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,360
but also physical strength.

699
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,840
I think for someone like Fang Xiaomei,

700
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,000
you can't reveal the information

701
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,440
that you live alone,

702
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,480
And her house password,

703
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,200
including her social network

704
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,520
account and password,

705
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,600
is very well designed.

706
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
As long as someone

707
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,480
who knows her a little,

708
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,280
I think everyone will know.

709
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,920
Nowadays, society must

710
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,640
pay great attention to our privacy.

711
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,080
Maybe,

712
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,680
when you sign up for an account,

713
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,880
You've already given your phone address

714
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,640
to someone else.

715
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,560
Or if you're not careful,

716
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,240
which photo's location

717
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,040
reveals

718
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,080
where your permanent address is?

719
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,040
Whether it's your ID,

720
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,880
phone number,

721
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,400
And there are verification codes and things like that.

722
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,200
You must have this awareness of prevention.

723
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,680
When I was little, my family once told me,

724
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,280
"Be greedy for petty gains and suffer big losses. ",

725
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,640
So,

726
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,800
when something,

727
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
When you want to apply your information,

728
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,600
or apply your verification code,

729
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,160
He said he would give you some rewards.

730
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,840
Or money,

731
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,240
I don't think you should trust it,

732
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,280
Don't lose a lot of things

733
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,200
because of petty gains.

734
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,240
Mobile phones are covered with anti-peeping film,

735
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
and secondly,

736
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
Your phone password,

737
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,840
and the password to your room.

738
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,600
You have to set these things up,

739
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,400
and then

740
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,800
you have to be on guard against

741
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,000
all these things around you,

742
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,080
Something that might invade your privacy.

743
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,400
Yes.

744
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,080
Also,

745
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,360
don't randomly click on some

746
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,640
weird software on the Internet.

747
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,960
Because to be honest now,

748
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,720
you don't know,

749
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,960
How advanced is the technology?

750
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,280
I think the biggest feeling is,

751
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,520
first of all, don't have

752
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,960
any bad thoughts.

753
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,640
Because you will definitely pay the price

754
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,160
on the other hand,

755
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,040
or in some way.

756
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,640
And actually,

757
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,320
these things that you want,

758
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,080
You can get it

759
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,520
through your own efforts.

760
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,800
Just be open-minded,

761
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,240
really?

762
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,680
Don't envy other people's lives,

763
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,960
then be confident,

764
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,320
I hope you won't be too careless.

765
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,760
Let some evil people

766
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,440
use these points to hurt us.

767
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,480
I hope you can protect yourself.
