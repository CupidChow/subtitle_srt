1
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,040
Teng Zhongjie knows about the time reset

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,520
This matter

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,000
He also "time traveled"

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,120
He's investigating us

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,680
Because they're victims

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,480
That's why I trust them to investigate me the most

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,080
This was edited by him

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,760
He made us investigate his sister

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,680
About her "death"

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,040
Right, about who exactly sold the "Bukuki"

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,040
Xiao Bamei and Teacher Lou's suicide jump

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,760
Are also related

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,040
You also had a secret three years ago

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,200
We all had a big secret three years ago

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,040
Three years ago

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,320
There was a "corpse burning" case

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,080
All six of you are connected to this case

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,360
First, in your room,

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,960
there's a 2019 calendar.

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,120
Then write,

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,040
"Started seeing Xiaojing home in 2019."

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,000
He from

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,760
What?

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,320
Only that month marked "Zhulai" wasn't recorded.

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,960
Zhulai

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,760
July

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,600
What does "Zhulai" mean?

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,280
July, right?

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,920
Yes.

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,160
Zhulai

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,160
Only July 30th,

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,400
the day Xiaojing "died",

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,280
he didn't see her home.

34
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,200
Why didn't you see her home that day?

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,080
Xiaojing was my girlfriend.

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,000
I from

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,120
February 14, 2019,

38
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,800
asked her to be my girlfriend.

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,040
Invitation

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,920
Invitation

41
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,080
Will you accept?

42
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,800
Agreed.

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,720
"Let's be in a relationship."

44
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
Press F to accept.

45
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,160
And she agreed at that time.

46
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,760
From then on,

47
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,480
we talked about everything every day.

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,280
We were always together.

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,800
Every night I would see her home.

50
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,120
She was studying music performance then.

51
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,200
Studying music performance.

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,160
On the first Tuesday of July,

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,920
she told me,

54
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,440
"I'm using this summer break

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,160
to improve my piano skills.

56
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,480
I found a piano teacher,

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,840
Teacher Lou.

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,160
From now on every Tuesday

59
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,560
I'll have lessons with him."

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,480
On July 23rd,

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,960
during her fourth lesson,

62
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,720
she came back and told me,

63
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,880
"I discovered

64
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,960
Teacher Lou's secret."

65
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,080
Secret

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,720
At 6 PM on July 23rd

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,840
Xiaojing sent Teacher Lou a message saying:

68
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,440
Teacher

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,000
Is what I saw at your place real?

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,400
I really can't believe you actually...

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
...

72
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,160
Teacher replied:

73
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,360
Xiaojing, let me explain

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,040
Then

75
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,720
Xiaojing said:

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,680
I won't listen

77
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,440
I won't listen

78
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,520
Then Teacher Lou said:

79
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,880
Fine, if you won't listen

80
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,040
I know even if I tell you

81
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,440
you might not be able to accept it

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,480
But promise me, teacher

83
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,240
please don't tell anyone, okay?

84
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Say something

85
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,040
Promise me, teacher

86
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
What was it about?

87
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,320
It's about Teacher Lou having

88
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
a "cross-dressing fetish."

89
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,720
I secretly photographed him wearing girls' clothes

90
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,560
and Xiao Jing found out.

91
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,280
He was afraid it would damage his teaching reputation

92
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,640
and all that.

93
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,120
Right?

94
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,040
Afraid of public disgrace and such.

95
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,840
Afraid she might tell others.

96
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,200
Yes, Xiao Jing sent those screenshots

97
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,960
to Guo Baoyou.

98
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,080
Guo Baoyou said, "Tell me more."

99
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,360
They talked for about ten minutes

100
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,040
probably explaining the whole story.

101
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,520
Yes.

102
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,800
Then another week passed,

103
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,440
which was July 30th,

104
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,200
the day of the incident.

105
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,360
Because it was another Tuesday,

106
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,920
Jing went to class again.

107
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,840
I stayed home alone

108
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,120
That's when I started

109
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,360
getting into mystery novels.

110
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,920
I used to be a book reviewer.

111
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,720
Then somehow

112
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,160
I read this terrible book

113
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,480
and became absolutely furious.

114
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,600
I started obsessively

115
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,840
writing long critiques at home.

116
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,000
I wanted to criticize the author.

117
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,960
I lost track of time while writing.

118
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,280
When I checked the time again,

119
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,440
it was already night.

120
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,160
Late at night.

121
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,960
So I didn't go to see her off that day.

122
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,880
I messaged Jing again,

123
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,720
but she didn't reply.

124
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,440
I thought she might be asleep.

125
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,920
But the next day,

126
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,000
I saw the news.

127
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,240
My Jing had left me forever.

128
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,240
But the reason

129
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,720
you "escorted a thousand girls home"

130
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,560
was precisely because of Xiaojing's incident

131
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,760
Yes, exactly because of that

132
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,840
Ever since that incident

133
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,840
I realized how crucial girls' safety is

134
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,920
That's why I developed this habit

135
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,280
I insisted that I must

136
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,800
personally see every girl

137
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
enter her own home

138
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,040
before I could feel at ease

139
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,760
It became an ingrained habit

140
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,240
But that didn't stop him from being "weird"

141
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Both things could coexist

142
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,400
Right, you escorting people home

143
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
that itself is pretty "creepy"

144
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,000
Alright, so later this matter...

145
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,400
was about my girlfriend "passing away."

146
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,120
Then there was a netizen

147
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,760
named "Don't-Miss-It-If-You-Pass-By"

148
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,880
This person said:

149
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,560
"On July 30, 2019,

150
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,880
in the grove near Apartment 11,

151
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,440
a young life was lost here.

152
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,360
We must absolutely catch the 'murderer.'

153
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,280
I beg all netizens to actively provide clues.

154
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
If this demon isn't eliminated,

155
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,240
there will surely be consequences."

156
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,880
Song Piaoliang probably reposted this Weibo post too.

157
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,960
Yes.

158
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,960
Then he used an anonymous account -

159
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,680
of course it must be you.

160
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,560
It's me, it was me.

161
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,640
He said:

162
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,920
"Xiao Jing was silenced by Teacher Lou

163
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,400
because she knew Teacher Lou's secret.

164
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,520
I believe

165
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,680
I'm someone who knows the inside story of this matter.

166
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,560
Because it's about my girlfriend -

167
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm certainly more heartbroken than anyone.

168
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,240
So at that time,

169
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,200
I didn't investigate too much.

170
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,880
I just intuitively thought

171
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,360
Teacher Lou wasn't a good person.

172
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
Based on my own analysis,

173
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,000
think about it - she knew

174
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,960
Teacher Lou's secret,

175
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
and the day before,

176
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
it was her class day.

177
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,280
So I think Teacher Lou

178
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,200
is highly suspicious."

179
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,560
<summaryA person recounts how their girlfriend's mysterious death led them to suspect Teacher Lou, citing online posts and personal intuition as evidence.

180
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,040
But

181
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,560
I'm someone who

182
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,640
can keep secrets well

183
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,880
I never revealed

184
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,160
Teacher Lou's cross-dressing habit

185
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Then I just said

186
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,520
Teacher Lou has serious issues

187
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,640
Then many people started digging into him

188
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,680
and eventually exposed his

189
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,440
cross-dressing secret

190
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
When I saw it was already out

191
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,200
I stopped talking about it

192
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,040
Then at this point

193
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,000
he posted something like

194
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,920
"Hey everyone"

195
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,200
"Didn't I tell you before"

196
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,880
"Xiao Jing knew Teacher Lou's secret"

197
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,040
"that's why she was 'silenced'"

198
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,120
"What do you think"

199
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,160
"should I"

200
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,880
"go search his house for clues"

201
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,360
(parentheses)

202
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,120
"If likes exceed 100k, I'll go"

203
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,000
At that time the likes

204
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,440
reached 100,001

205
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,720
so that was enough

206
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,320
Then people in comments urged him

207
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,840
"Go! If you don't go you're not human"

208
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,360
Another said "If you don't go you're a dog"

209
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,480
Someone else said "Agree with above"

210
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,600
Then others encouraged

211
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,960
"I heard there's so much evidence against Teacher Lou"

212
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,680
"yet he still won't admit it"

213
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,520
"Suggest dressing as Xiao Jing to scare him"

214
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,920
So Guo Baoyou

215
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,720
actually dressed as Xiao Jing

216
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,640
wore women's clothes

217
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,840
"You have this hobby too?"

218
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
"No, this is what you call"

219
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,200
"fighting magic with magic"

220
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,480
Yes

221
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,080
So he also dressed as Xiao Jing

222
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,480
and went

223
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,600
Then the camera was placed here

224
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,320
Ready to start filming

225
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,280
Then at this moment, walking that way

226
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,880
When reaching the window

227
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,520
Suddenly an old lady appeared

228
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,640
Scaring him into running away

229
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,320
Then this old lady

230
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,360
Tripped over something unknown

231
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,480
Then he grabbed his phone and ran

232
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,680
That's where the video ends, right

233
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,960
Because before this

234
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,160
My girlfriend took classes at his place

235
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,920
And told me where he lived

236
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,520
So I went there late at night

237
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,040
I arrived there

238
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,280
I originally wanted to film something

239
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,960
But just as I set up my phone

240
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,880
Looking over here

241
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,360
There was another old lady

242
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,120
This old lady

243
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,480
Came charging at me

244
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
I took my phone

245
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
And ran away

246
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,280
What happened after that I don't know

247
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,600
I just left

248
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,440
Yeah, this old lady suddenly

249
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,800
Just fell down

250
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,080
Who is this old lady

251
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,840
Who is the old lady

252
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Honestly I don't know

253
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,680
Right, these are all the leads we have for now.

254
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,920
Anyway, it's in his room.

255
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,080
Then Teng the agent contacted you.

256
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,560
This is exactly what he talked about.

257
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,200
Because of all that mess on Weibo.

258
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,520
Actually, I was the one who stirred things up.

259
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,840
I was the first to speak out.

260
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,480
I said Teacher Lou didn't seem like a good person.

261
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,440
Told everyone to dig up dirt.

262
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,240
That's what happened.

263
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,960
Then Agent Teng messaged me saying.

264
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,000
"Come over."

265
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,360
And when I got here, he brought this up.

266
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,720
Said "Look what you did back then."

267
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,080
"You incited online bullying."

268
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,720
"Used the internet to hide your face."

269
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,840
"Did you make threats?"

270
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,880
Of course I made threats.

271
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,920
I said "What's wrong with that?"

272
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,040
"You drove my girlfriend to her death."

273
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,120
"Are you Old Wang?"

274
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,040
Yeah, I said some harsh words to him

275
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,280
Then he chickened out

276
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,320
As soon as he heard about me

277
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,800
When he saw me like this, he

278
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,280
stopped talking

279
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,680
So you saw in the room

280
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,720
was it the agent?

281
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,640
I was watching from the doorway too

282
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,560
Identified him by his toe prints

283
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,280
Toe prints

284
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,440
His life line is quite long

285
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,560
His big toe says "Teng Agency"

286
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,280
If you want to scold someone

287
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,240
who lost his girlfriend

288
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,040
I can't stop you

289
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,880
You seem quite happy about it

290
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,520
Later

291
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,880
you were stalking, weren't you?

292
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,040
Later Jiajia got back together

293
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,080
That was three years later

294
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,920
How could you do this?

295
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,080
What's wrong with people like you?

296
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,040
No matter what, you just repost

297
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,560
And you don't even register any name

298
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,320
Still following other girls

299
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,520
Stalking others, you creep

300
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,400
You think no one knows

301
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,039
who you are?

302
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,240
Hiding behind the internet to attack people

303
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,120
Yes

304
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,320
You even cyberbully others

305
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,600
How terrifying

306
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,680
Is that okay?

307
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,160
Thanks.

308
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,360
Sure, come back.

309
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,080
Okay.

310
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,480
Now let's ask

311
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,120
Bai Sanwan

312
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,040
Come here.

313
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,680
What's wrong?

314
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,800
Already starting to feel guilty?

315
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Legs gone weak

316
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,760
Someone with a past

317
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,440
This is also

318
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
Also someone with a past

319
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,160
The first piece of evidence is

320
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,120
The confession letter in Bai Sanwan's room

321
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,040
What is this?

322
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,760
No

323
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,160
Nothing

324
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,760
Just kidding

325
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,840
You're Bai Sanwan, right?

326
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,160
First let me ask you about this

327
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,880
That girl, I'm sorry

328
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
Which girl are you apologizing to?

329
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,320
This girl

330
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,880
is

331
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,480
Xiaojing

332
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,680
Yes, you guessed right

333
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,680
You two shared the same girlfriend again

334
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,440
A cursed relationship

335
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,200
Xiaojing

336
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,440
Has a

337
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,680
very complicated relationship with me

338
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,440
Can you bear it?

339
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,120
Explain in detail

340
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,760
She's your aunt

341
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
You're her nephew

342
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,480
Then we're practically family

343
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,600
Brother Zhou

344
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,400
Why is there someone else?

345
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,480
Yes, I wronged her

346
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:44,880
Be more specific

347
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,480
Explain in detail

348
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,280
Give me the specifics

349
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,400
Why did you wrong her?

350
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,640
Speaking of this matter

351
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,120
Keep asking

352
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,560
There are many reasons

353
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,400
Another one is

354
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,960
That man, I wronged you

355
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,720
Yes, I wronged him too

356
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,920
Teacher Lou, right?

357
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,480
Exactly, you guessed right

358
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,240
Teacher Lou

359
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,640
Yes, I wronged both of them

360
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,640
He wronged both of them simultaneously

361
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,040
That's right

362
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
It's about that case back then

363
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,960
He wronged everyone involved

364
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,680
Found on your tablet

365
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,560
Also on the same day three years ago when the "victim" died

366
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,880
On July 30th

367
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,880
You went to Huasheng Used Cars

368
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,040
You wanted to sell your motorcycle

369
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,600
This motorcycle was a

370
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,840
Damaged motorcycle from a crash

371
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Then the person said

372
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,680
Let me be blunt first

373
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,360
This piece of junk won't fetch much money

374
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Then you said whatever

375
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,000
Just get rid of it quickly

376
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,080
And sold it

377
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,800
Yes, that's right

378
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,480
I checked your location

379
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,600
It was on Tuilihai Avenue

380
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,720
Near the small grove

381
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,360
Which is to say

382
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
That's where Xiaojing was "murdered"

383
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,240
In other words

384
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,120
Near the crime scene where Xiaojing was "murdered"

385
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,080
That's where the accident happened, right?

386
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,600
How did the crash happen?

387
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,520
Then you said

388
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,640
You talk too much

389
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,880
Just transfer the money quickly

390
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,280
Yes, is this related to him?

391
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,320
He asked me, really?

392
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,560
Now we're asking you

393
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,720
Yes, what's the deal with this motorcycle?

394
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,960
What's going on with this?

395
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,560
Why was it near the crime scene?

396
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,640
I understand now.

397
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,520
Actually, he doesn't need to answer.

398
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,440
I can answer for him.

399
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,640
He hit Xiaojing and "killed" her.

400
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,840
Then "burned the body."

401
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,200
And fled the scene.

402
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,120
Get rid of this.

403
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,560
Case solved.

404
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,320
But we thought it was this Teacher Lou.

405
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
You feel guilty.

406
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,880
Yes.

407
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,480
So he wronged this man.

408
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,880
And wronged this girl.

409
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,120
Damn, you hit-and-run.

410
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,040
Just curse at him.

411
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,440
Come on.

412
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,800
Just "execute" him.

413
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,320
I'm going to "kill" him.

414
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,680
He hit and "killed" your girlfriend.

415
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,880
The worst part is,

416
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,560
he also took your girlfriend's necklace

417
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,320
and sold it.

418
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,000
Right.

419
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,080
Is this your girlfriend's?

420
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,840
This is hers.

421
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,280
Let me see.

422
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes.

423
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,920
This is Xiaojing's.

424
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,000
What's this?

425
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,520
This is Xiaojing's three-piece jade set.

426
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,360
Passed down from her family.

427
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,840
You hit and "killed" someone,

428
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,520
and took their belongings.

429
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,320
You're despicable.

430
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,880
Police!

431
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,640
They're here.

432
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,440
Taking him away.

433
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,480
Is this it?

434
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
Since you know the truth,

435
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,880
you can go to the police station.

436
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,840
Then you can just wait to "die."

437
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,960
Then you can just wait to "die."

438
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,480
That's too much

439
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,920
He's joking around

440
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:56,920
Immature

441
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,760
At that moment I had one thought

442
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,720
Let him go, he'll come back

443
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,240
Aren't you tired, bro?

444
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,800
No

445
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,480
It's not what you think

446
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,240
Panting like this

447
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,760
Let me explain what happened

448
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,440
What's going on?

449
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,880
As you all know,

450
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,640
I was trying to raise 500,000 yuan

451
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,120
for Zhenzhen to open a theater.

452
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,720
Zhenzhen

453
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,760
wanted to start a theater,

454
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,600
but she was short on funds.

455
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,640
I tried to find ways to raise the money,

456
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,720
and managed to gather 500,000,

457
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,840
then gave it to her anonymously.

458
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes.

459
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,560
I modified my motorcycle

460
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,600
and stored it in a warehouse.

461
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,920
Originally, I was supposed to go the next day

462
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,000
to participate in a

463
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,240
not-so-legitimate race,

464
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,800
but

465
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,520
the night before,

466
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,000
I discovered

467
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,880
there was another way

468
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,760
to get the money.

469
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,680
Here's what happened:

470
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,280
On July 30th,

471
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,520
I was riding on Tuilihai Avenue,

472
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,640
I was

473
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,160
driving properly,

474
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,960
riding along just fine,

475
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,920
when suddenly someone

476
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,640
from the side

477
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,280
crashed into me on their bike.

478
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,320
I hit you while riding my bike

479
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,840
Yes

480
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,920
I got off

481
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,800
Then I noticed

482
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,760
The man seemed seriously injured

483
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,480
It was a man, right?

484
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,440
A man

485
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,120
Yes

486
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,320
I had a competition to attend the next day

487
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,720
To win that 500,000 yuan

488
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,160
Right?

489
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,920
Yes

490
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,160
So I made a call

491
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,080
Called an ambulance

492
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,280
Then I left

493
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,800
But my bag fell on the ground

494
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,160
I picked it up and left

495
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,800
Went back home

496
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,880
I didn't want it to affect my money-making the next day

497
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,800
After returning home

498
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,120
I realized I took the wrong bag

499
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,240
Our bags looked too similar

500
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,040
In this bag

501
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
What was inside?

502
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,720
There was a set of three jade artifacts

503
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,640
Suddenly I thought this jade

504
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,800
Seemed quite valuable

505
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,520
If I could exchange it for money

506
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,240
Maybe I wouldn't have to

507
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,560
Participate in that illegal race

508
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,440
So then

509
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,200
I sold the jade

510
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,440
And got rid of the motorcycle

511
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,000
So I didn't join that race

512
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,720
Then

513
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,480
The next day

514
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,320
I saw the news report

515
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,960
About a girl

516
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,360
Who "died" at that location

517
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,240
They posted online

518
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,760
Photos of the "deceased" when she was alive

519
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,360
And I realized

520
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,800
On the "deceased"

521
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,600
there was a three-piece jade set

522
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,440
I understand

523
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,800
This bag could only be

524
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,680
the one dropped by the person who hit me

525
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,960
So I thought

526
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,600
the person who hit me

527
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,520
must be the "murderer"

528
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,680
Then just a few days later

529
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,320
everyone online said Teacher Lou did it

530
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,720
Because the motorcycle rider

531
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,040
who hit me

532
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,000
didn't match

533
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,600
Teacher Lou's online image

534
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,880
that I'd seen

535
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,600
You think it wasn't Teacher Lou?

536
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,440
Wearing a helmet

537
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,800
the body type and build didn't match

538
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Then I started thinking

539
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,720
whether I should testify

540
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,360
But then I thought

541
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,040
given what I'd done

542
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,680
it wouldn't be appropriate

543
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
I took stolen goods

544
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,360
took the wrong bag

545
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,760
and even sold the items

546
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,440
After I realized all this

547
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
I wanted to investigate at the hospital

548
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,320
But when I went there

549
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,840
I couldn't find any information about him

550
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,200
He didn't go - he was afraid to

551
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,520
You called the ambulance then left

552
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,160
But he didn't get in the ambulance, he ran away

553
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,200
The specifics aren't clear

554
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,040
I was still thinking

555
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
about whether or not to testify

556
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,880
And then

557
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,440
Right after that

558
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,599
Teacher Lou

559
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,119
"committed suicide"

560
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,599
"committed suicide"

561
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,040
I deeply regretted it

562
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,720
I didn't come forward to testify at the time

563
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,920
Right, I just didn't step forward

564
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,160
to vouch for him

565
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,720
Not testifying was wronging Teacher Lou

566
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,760
And then selling the stolen goods

567
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,480
was wronging my girlfriend

568
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,640
If I had to compare

569
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,400
I actually wronged Teacher Lou more

570
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,280
I was struggling at the time

571
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
about whether I should testify or not

572
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,240
and then it was too late

573
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,760
Perhaps you could have changed

574
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,400
the outcome of many things

575
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,640
You're absolutely right

576
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,760
I feel that

577
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,320
the so-called "person you've wronged"

578
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,360
that "you" refers to

579
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
Teacher Lou

580
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,640
It's more like Teacher Lou

581
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,080
We both owe an apology

582
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,440
Exactly

583
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,880
What did you say to Teng the agent yesterday?

584
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,800
I was just like you guys

585
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,440
After entering, I could only see feet

586
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,000
Then I brought up what happened three years ago

587
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,760
Asked what was going on

588
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,160
And then at the end he threatened me,

589
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,440
saying he'd tell my girlfriend Zhenzhen

590
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,400
That's impossible

591
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,280
This 300,000 is dirty money, right?

592
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,120
My girlfriend would definitely

593
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,560
After all we've been through

594
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,120
all these things we've experienced together

595
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,520
and now we're finally together

596
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,560
I got angry

597
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,480
I stood up ready to

598
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,280
confront him

599
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,080
kick the door

600
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,480
then suddenly realized the door

601
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
wouldn't open

602
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,040
You pushed the door, right?

603
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,840
Yes, I pushed, but

604
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,320
but actually you were supposed to pull it?

605
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,600
Right at that moment

606
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,560
No matter how angry I get outside,

607
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,640
they just lie in bed without moving.

608
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,080
Completely calm.

609
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,240
It's really quite disrespectful to us.

610
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,200
Talking to us while lying down,

611
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,280
and with the door closed.

612
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,160
Yes, you could at least scold me,

613
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,120
stand up and yell at us.

614
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,840
But when I saw this situation,

615
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
I decided not to waste time with you.

616
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,560
I'll just leave.

617
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,080
So I left.

618
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,000
Right.

619
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,200
Alright, it's time for the countdown.

620
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,080
Alright, countdown time.

621
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,600
Three.

622
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,240
Two.

623
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,600
One.

624
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,280
You,

625
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,360
you could have

626
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,520
saved many lives.

627
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,320
Do you realize that?

628
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,920
Those were her "last belongings."

629
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,160
You people,

630
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,040
are you even men?

631
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Cyberbullying Teacher Lou,

632
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,680
and you dare to criticize me?

633
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,360
But you could have stopped

634
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,400
this cyberbullying.

635
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,280
Come on.

636
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,160
How strange

637
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,920
So tired

638
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,040
No

639
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,280
I plan to go back today

640
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,520
I'll come clean with Zhenzhen

641
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,040
Right

642
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,400
I can't bear this torment in my heart anymore

643
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,480
Let's ask Ke Wuku next.

644
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,840
Alright, Ke Wuku

645
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,640
In your notebook

646
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,440
he wrote a roadmap

647
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
From Tui City University

648
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,440
to Apartment No. 11

649
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,840
Then he drew a circle in the middle

650
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,760
specifically marking a small grove

651
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,840
And there are also some things on it

652
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,440
These might be some imprinted marks

653
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:23,960
It says:

654
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,080
Old classmate

655
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,960
Long time no see

656
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,480
After school

657
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,840
In the grove near Apartment 11

658
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,680
Can we meet?

659
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
I need your help with something

660
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Who are you writing this to?

661
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,520
Xiao Jing

662
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:40,960
Xiao Jing

663
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,920
This...

664
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,360
To be honest

665
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,520
it was indeed written for Xiao Jing

666
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,160
I have here a record of your

667
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,520
medical diagnosis

668
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,560
The diagnosis results show

669
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,400
facial

670
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,080
hand

671
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,240
multiple soft tissue contusions

672
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,400
hand joints

673
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,840
and an elbow fracture

674
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,720
There are also scratch marks from fingernails on your arm

675
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,880
scratched by nails

676
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,400
He was scratched by Xiao Jing's nails

677
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
How do you explain these injuries?

678
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,720
That day was

679
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,280
That day was

680
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,760
July 30th

681
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,960
He's the one who hit me

682
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
Exactly

683
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,360
Indeed

684
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,800
The one who was in the accident with Bai that day

685
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,400
was me

686
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,880
Look

687
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,960
But you're the one who hit me and caused this

688
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,320
You're the one who hit me and caused this

689
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,240
You're fine though

690
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,320
I was driving normally

691
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
You came from the side and knocked me over

692
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,680
No

693
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,760
I was

694
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,640
But it's because

695
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,960
I'd never ridden a motorcycle before

696
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,480
I was

697
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,080
Then how dare you ride one

698
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,120
Fine, I got what I deserved, right

699
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,680
Why do you

700
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,040
have those three jade pieces of hers

701
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,160
Right, where did you get them

702
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,240
Are these your girlfriend's things

703
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,000
These are her things

704
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,400
I see

705
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,360
These belong to Xiaojing

706
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,000
But this bag

707
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,760
could only be the bag left by the person who hit me

708
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,000
So I think

709
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,720
the person who hit me

710
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,200
must be the "murderer"

711
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,920
You "killed" her and took her jade

712
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,120
I'm furious right now

713
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,680
No

714
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,080
Wait a minute

715
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,560
Don't

716
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,040
Listen to me

717
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,800
Let me tell you bit by bit

718
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,040
I used to be a

719
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,240
poor kid

720
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,560
I had two good buddies

721
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,400
one named Kaikai

722
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,520
and another named Xiaonao

723
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,360
Xiaonao was Kaikai's girlfriend

724
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
Back then

725
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,760
after high school graduation I didn't go to college

726
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,960
just spent every day fooling around

727
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,240
playing games at internet cafes and such

728
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,960
Eventually I realized while drifting along

729
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,840
I was out of money

730
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,440
So one day

731
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,840
I had to figure out a way

732
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,080
to get some money

733
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,640
Yeah, get some

734
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,200
While thinking how to get money

735
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,480
I remembered back in high school

736
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,960
there was this senior girl

737
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
who seemed to come from a well-off family

738
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,360
This senior was Xiaojing

739
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,760
While thinking about it

740
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,200
I started following Xiaojing every day

741
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,600
and discovered every Tuesday

742
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,120
she would always

743
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,200
pass through Tuilihai Avenue

744
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,560
and go through that small grove

745
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,160
Right, you drew this map yourself

746
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,280
Yes, this is what I drew

747
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,440
This exact route

748
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,520
Didn't you notice

749
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,160
he accompanied her every day?

750
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,760
No

751
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,600
Maybe because

752
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,520
He thought we were just passersby

753
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,680
We were chatting and laughing together

754
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,280
All lovey-dovey and affectionate

755
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,400
How could we be just passersby?

756
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,560
Maybe you were outside his field of vision

757
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,360
Anyway, he didn't notice

758
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,240
I didn't know at that time

759
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,760
That she had a guardian angel by her side

760
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,320
Then on July 30th

761
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,480
I made my decision

762
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,880
With these two friends of mine

763
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,040
Xiao Kai and Xiao Nao

764
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,600
We made a plan

765
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,120
I said the three of us together

766
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,880
How were you going to

767
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
"Kill" someone?

768
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,160
Robbery, bro

769
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,560
We wouldn't dare

770
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,160
We didn't have the guts

771
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,920
After the robbery

772
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,320
If reported, you'd get caught too

773
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,640
Using my identity as her classmate

774
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,240
I lured her to this

775
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,080
Small grove

776
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,520
Right

777
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,760
Once there, everything went according to plan

778
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,120
Jumped out

779
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,920
Hand it over

780
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,640
Let me ask you

781
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,960
Did Xiao Jing resist or not?

782
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,920
She tried a little

783
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,720
Those nail marks were actually from her scratching

784
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,920
So we stole

785
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,240
that set of three jade artifacts

786
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,480
What's important is

787
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,320
I saw with my own eyes her walking out of the grove.

788
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,840
No, but I think

789
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,040
You won't so easily

790
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,120
let her go

791
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,440
You want to "kill" her

792
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
What good would that do us?

793
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,520
After she left

794
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,920
I suddenly

795
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,440
felt the urge to pee

796
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,480
Well,

797
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
I needed to use the bathroom

798
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,560
suddenly

799
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,320
No,

800
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,640
that's not it

801
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Listen to what you're saying

802
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,240
I admit I lost control at that moment

803
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,880
So I said,

804
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,720
"I really have to go to the bathroom"

805
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,840
I was in the bathroom

806
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,320
and stayed there for quite a while

807
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,480
When I came out, I noticed

808
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,880
that Xiao Nao had already left

809
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,960
She said I took too long

810
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,160
and didn't want to wait for me

811
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,640
Then Xiao Kai

812
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,880
left me a motorcycle

813
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,480
He said, "Wait a minute"

814
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,880
"Take our motorcycle"

815
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,200
"and go home by yourself"

816
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,560
"Then when you get back"

817
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,040
"deal with all the stuff we grabbed"

818
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,920
"and handle it properly"

819
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,760
"Convert what can be sold into cash"

820
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,520
"and we'll split it later"

821
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,440
But that was my first time

822
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,600
I'd never ridden a motorcycle before

823
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,760
With a sudden twist

824
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,240
Too fast

825
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,480
Suddenly saw in front of me

826
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,560
Another motorcycle came rushing toward me

827
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,440
And then instantly

828
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,280
I was knocked unconscious

829
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,160
Knocked unconscious, yes

830
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,760
Then

831
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,440
When I came to

832
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
I was already in the hospital

833
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,520
My bag that I carried with me was gone

834
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,400
Just when I tried to contact my friend

835
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,280
I called him

836
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,800
But he wouldn't answer calls or reply to messages

837
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,560
Xiao Kai and the others

838
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,520
Then under my hospital bed

839
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,200
Under the pillow

840
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,920
I found a tile fragment

841
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,880
With words written on it:

842
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,680
"Bitter - Let's never meet again"

843
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,720
This matter was getting serious

844
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,720
Xiao Kai and Xiao Nao were quite frightening

845
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,280
Not long after

846
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,320
I saw the news

847
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,840
That Xiao Jing was found

848
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,320
Murdered and burned in the woods

849
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,440
Then I understood

850
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,800
Perhaps

851
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,200
That girl met with misfortune that day

852
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,240
Afraid we'd get involved in this matter

853
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,360
I think the way this was handled

854
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,960
And the whole process

855
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,840
Were completely wrong

856
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,440
From how it sounds

857
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,600
He doesn't seem very remorseful toward Teacher Lou

858
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:21,920
Right

859
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,200
Only his two friends

860
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,760
After "killing" Xiao Jing

861
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,720
And dragging her back to the grove

862
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,960
That's how you became

863
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,040
Sorry about this matter with Teacher Lou

864
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,160
Yes, they framed Teacher Lou

865
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,560
Right

866
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,760
Actually, you and Teacher Lou

867
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Had no connection

868
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,960
Now you have nothing to do

869
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,920
With this matter involving Teacher Lou

870
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,760
Correct

871
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,240
Later they reported that

872
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
This person called Teacher Lou

873
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,880
Was the "murderer"

874
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,200
I specifically tried to recall

875
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,720
That night

876
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,920
What exactly happened

877
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,360
Because that day we

878
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
Didn't see Teacher Lou

879
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,080
At the crime scene

880
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,640
So I wondered if it's possible that

881
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,040
After Xiao Jing left the grove

882
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,600
Teacher Lou was waiting for her somewhere

883
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,160
Lying in ambush

884
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,640
Ambushing or something

885
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:04,960
Hearing him say this

886
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,600
I even started thinking

887
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,760
Xiao Jing might not be "dead"

888
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,640
Because with "burned remains" you can't tell who it is

889
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,720
Exactly, that's possible

890
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,360
Can't tell

891
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,080
Indeed

892
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,200
No

893
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm just making a bold hypothesis

894
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,920
He didn't say anything about

895
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,320
That is quite bold

896
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,600
It's him

897
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,800
It's you

898
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,480
You're the one

899
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,320
With nothing better to do, why did you...

900
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,120
rob someone?

901
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,480
How dare you criticize others?

902
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,800
He even hit me

903
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,280
Tell me

904
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,560
What kind of person hits someone

905
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,600
leaves them lying there nearly...

906
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
completely broken

907
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,840
lying there

908
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,040
and says they're almost gone

909
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,560
then sees there's still stuff in the bag

910
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,160
and just leaves?

911
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,560
If you can't ride properly, don't ride at all

912
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,000
Breaking traffic rules without even knowing how to ride

913
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,160
And you think you're justified?

914
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,800
You're literally committing highway robbery

915
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,480
Your brother "kills", you rob

916
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,000
I just can't...

917
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,240
Your family really has something special

918
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,480
The Ke family members are really...

919
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,520
This is...

920
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
"Death penalty" then, I'm done

921
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,400
Wait a minute

922
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,920
I've truthfully confessed everything

923
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,840
That's how things happened

924
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,200
But later I...

925
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,800
Ke Wuku

926
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,040
has already reformed myself

927
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,440
Everyone has seen many of my past

928
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,560
mistakes I've made

929
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,040
violating the law

930
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,200
but afterwards I must stand up

931
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,400
and take responsibility

932
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,000
Now there's only one left.

933
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,560
Old Liu.

934
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,560
The finale is usually something special.

935
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
This finale...

936
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,280
Why is there a woman's bag in your room?

937
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,640
This bag is

938
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,040
This is Fang Xiaomei's, right?

939
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,680
Yes, this is Fang Xiaomei's bag.

940
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,600
What's this invitation about?

941
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,720
Our younger sister Xiao Bamei

942
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,600
has passed away

943
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,920
Miss Fang Xiaomei is cordially invited

944
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,440
to attend the memorial service

945
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,040
From her brother, Xiao Tengteng

946
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,400
July 18, 2022

947
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,840
This was meant for Fang Xiaomei

948
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,240
Why do you have it?

949
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,840
Yes, this belongs to Fang Xiaomei

950
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,360
Because we're currently...

951
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,640
We're together now

952
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,280
Living together

953
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,800
Yes

954
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,040
Were Bamei and Fang Xiaomei close?

955
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,640
I don't know about that

956
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,360
That's her personal social circle

957
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,320
You're living together but know nothing?

958
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:49,920
You...

959
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,080
I...

960
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,080
I believe relationships should have freedom

961
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,280
What nonsense

962
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,720
Give each other space

963
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,000
Mutual space

964
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,400
Space means not asking questions

965
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,240
So I don't ask anything

966
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,960
And she never mentioned Xiao Bamei to you?

967
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,000
Right

968
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,720
In your family group chat

969
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,800
There's someone named Cao Chao Buluosuo

970
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,440
This is just one of our Cao family group chats

971
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
Cao Yangguang said:

972
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,720
If I fail this exam, I'll have to drop out

973
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,760
What should I do?

974
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,840
Mom Cao said Teacher Lou won't pass me

975
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,960
Cao Yangguang: Mhm

976
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Dad Cao said without Lou, you'll pass

977
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,280
Lou

978
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,520
Cao Yangguang: Mhm

979
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,880
Mom Cao said there's a way

980
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,200
Dad Cao said just wait

981
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Because this Teacher Lou

982
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,000
is Cao Yangguang's

983
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,600
teacher

984
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,320
tutor

985
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,520
Right

986
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,080
Because Cao Yangguang is

987
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,840
really good at keyboard/piano

988
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,240
But now he's taking entrance exams

989
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,760
However

990
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,720
for his piano major course

991
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,960
Teacher Lou gave him zero

992
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,640
I don't know the details

993
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,000
But basically because

994
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,520
he gave Yangguang zero

995
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,640
he can't advance to the next level

996
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Just one music class is blocking his progress

997
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,160
Because this is his major subject

998
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,240
Like if I applied to acting school

999
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,720
but got zero in acting, would they accept me?

1000
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,920
You understand?

1001
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,720
What does "without Lou you'll pass" mean?

1002
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,800
It means if Lou's not involved, you'll pass

1003
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
So,

1004
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,520
you guys made the building disappear?

1005
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,040
No, it's like this...

1006
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,800
Because I was...

1007
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,040
essentially adopted by someone,

1008
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,520
right?

1009
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,800
Although his father didn't like me,

1010
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,200
and Cao Yangguang didn't really like me either,

1011
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,960
but Mrs. Cao treated me really well.

1012
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,040
Then Mrs. Cao came to me

1013
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,400
asking if there was any way

1014
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,880
to help your younger brother.

1015
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,200
So I started thinking about what to do...

1016
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
how to deal with Teacher Lou.

1017
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,120
First, I'll ruin his reputation.

1018
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,440
These days it's all about

1019
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,600
online public opinion.

1020
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,360
Just smear his name.

1021
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,680
Whether he actually did these things or not,

1022
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,440
first of all, his current

1023
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,720
position at the school

1024
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,600
will be suspended.

1025
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,520
So I went online to dig up dirt on him

1026
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,160
This one on Twitter's trending page

1027
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,520
Did you find or take this photo?

1028
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,160
This grove photo

1029
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,440
I photoshopped this picture

1030
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,880
At the time I found one rumor

1031
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,280
that he had a cross-dressing habit

1032
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,040
or something like that

1033
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,480
from those gossip accounts

1034
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,480
I found some

1035
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,600
posts from public accounts

1036
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
but I didn't actually know if they were true

1037
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,400
Then there were claims about him and underage girls

1038
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,600
That's when I thought

1039
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,440
this might be something

1040
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,560
I could work with

1041
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,400
So

1042
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,000
since I'm good at photo editing

1043
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,960
I went online

1044
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,520
and created a fake image

1045
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,840
I photoshopped him

1046
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,480
into the grove scene

1047
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,120
to "prove" he was there that night

1048
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,320
Basically to pin

1049
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,560
this whole thing on him

1050
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,920
So you fabricated evidence

1051
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,480
He's the root of everything

1052
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,760
The real culprit

1053
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,360
Putting this out there

1054
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,280
for public judgment

1055
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,360
If I'm right

1056
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,680
he gets what he deserves

1057
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,640
If I'm wrong

1058
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,360
others will clear his name

1059
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:41,880
But I never expected

1060
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,280
who knew he was so fragile

1061
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,920
to "commit suicide"

1062
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,400
Right?

1063
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,360
What did you say to Teng the agent?

1064
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,760
Pretty much the same as what you guys said.

1065
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,160
He just said

1066
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,480
"I already know the truth about this matter"

1067
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,600
"I'm going to expose you" and stuff like that

1068
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,200
Basically just

1069
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,720
"You need to take responsibility for your actions"

1070
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,080
I said I didn't do anything wrong

1071
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,280
It was just a prank

1072
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,160
Then he said "this matter of yours"

1073
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,200
"I will definitely make it public"

1074
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,160
So I said

1075
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,360
"Well then you just wait and see"

1076
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,040
Basically I threw out a tough remark too

1077
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,160
Threw out a tough remark

1078
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,560
I said "Hmph, you're so mean"

1079
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,720
Something along those lines

1080
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,240
There's something else I haven't mentioned

1081
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,760
Let me share it with you

1082
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,400
Because it's kind of

1083
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,760
A heart-to-heart between friends

1084
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,760
Indeed

1085
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,880
Indeed

1086
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,600
A heart-to-heart between friends

1087
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,720
A sudden heart-to-heart between friends

1088
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,840
Actually, the reason I was adopted by the Cao family

1089
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
Was because of Cao Yangguang

1090
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,080
Don't let his handsome appearance fool you

1091
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,040
But his kidneys are bad

1092
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,240
Bad kidneys

1093
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,040
His blood type is quite unusual

1094
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
It's the "panda blood" type

1095
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,560
A rare blood type

1096
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,600
So why was I adopted by the Cao family?

1097
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,040
Because I have the same blood type as him

1098
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,080
You need to give him blood transfusions

1099
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,480
Right

1100
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,000
If his kidneys ever fail

1101
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,400
I'm like a backup

1102
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,560
Then the Cao family

1103
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,960
Is absolutely breaking the law

1104
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,280
When "Mother Cao" "passed away"

1105
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,080
they finally told me the truth

1106
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,040
So in a fit of anger

1107
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,480
I left that household

1108
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,800
The Cao family is somewhat...

1109
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,360
So your heart has grown somewhat dark

1110
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,639
I admit

1111
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,560
Then I "killed" Teng the agent

1112
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,520
But it's not worth it for me

1113
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,280
Bro, that's going too far

1114
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,800
What did Teng the agent do to deserve this?

1115
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,360
It's not like Teng wanted to harvest my kidney

1116
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,400
I'm actually quite happy now

1117
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,280
I have my girlfriend with me

1118
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,840
I have 5 million inheritance, right?

1119
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,719
Why would I

1120
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,840
have a grudge against Teng?

1121
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,320
Right?

1122
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,880
It's not worth it

1123
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,560
As friends, let's be more open

1124
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,280
Is there anything else

1125
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,120
you want to tell us?

1126
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
Heart-to-heart talks between friends should have limits

1127
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,840
That's about enough

1128
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,679
There's not much left to say

1129
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,920
Then we're about

1130
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,400
let's just

1131
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,199
begin

1132
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:46,639
start cursing

1133
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,960
What's wrong with you?

1134
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,480
How could you do this?

1135
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,639
How could you be like this?

1136
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,040
I did nothing wrong

1137
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,760
What's going on?

1138
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,320
You even photoshopped fake pictures?

1139
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,880
How could you do this?

1140
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,880
Come back

1141
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,480
Okay

1142
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:07,880
Alright

1143
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,640
Teng the mediator had heart-to-heart talks with all six of us

1144
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,080
Painfully

1145
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,520
Yours lasted twenty minutes

1146
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,240
Just this little chat

1147
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,560
Right, yours took the longest

1148
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,840
When I talked with Teng the mediator,

1149
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,400
he told me

1150
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
he knew my secret from three years ago

1151
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,520
He knew about my robbery incident

1152
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,160
He believed

1153
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,240
that our current robbery

1154
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,720
was definitely connected

1155
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,640
to Xiaojing's "death"

1156
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,040
I had just gone through

1157
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,240
losing Cry Brother

1158
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,400
and Cool Brother

1159
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,080
They're all gone now

1160
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,280
Now it's just me and my sister-in-law left

1161
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
I thought

1162
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,160
I absolutely couldn't let him

1163
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,760
disrupt my life like this

1164
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,840
So I had a huge argument with him

1165
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,120
That's why my twenty minutes was so long

1166
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,680
We were arguing the whole time

1167
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,360
I sat where I could see his feet

1168
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:26,920
that spot

1169
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,600
and argued with him

1170
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,840
You just insulted his feet?

1171
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,440
No

1172
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,600
Look how your feet are

1173
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,880
All chapped and peeling

1174
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,800
Come over here if you dare

1175
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
No

1176
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,160
His door wouldn't open

1177
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,480
I tried pushing it

1178
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,280
Because I got really angry

1179
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,080
I was ready to push

1180
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,440
go in and deal with him

1181
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:40,880
Take him down

1182
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,240
You all want to take him down

1183
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,160
All want to take him down, show him up

1184
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,120
After failing to push the door open

1185
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,880
I left - it was 11:50 then

1186
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,800
Let me briefly summarize.

1187
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,400
Okay.

1188
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,640
Regarding the incident three years ago,

1189
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
it mainly involved

1190
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,240
Xiao Jing and Teacher Lou.

1191
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,200
Xiao Jing was "killed,"

1192
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,760
but this matter

1193
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,720
because of everyone's

1194
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,280
and

1195
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,560
online comments from netizens,

1196
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,200
led our Teacher Lou

1197
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,920
to

1198
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,880
being unable to bear the pressure and "committing suicide."

1199
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,240
Everyone shares responsibility.

1200
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,120
So I think

1201
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
when we speak

1202
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,280
or accuse others in the future,

1203
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,200
we should carefully consider first

1204
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,440
and only speak out

1205
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,040
after respecting the facts.

1206
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,120
Next,

1207
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,920
let's all search

1208
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,880
for any clues Teng Zhongjie might have left.

1209
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,800
Okay.

1210
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,360
Can we go to Teacher Lou's home?

1211
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,840
509.

1212
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,760
509.

1213
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,040
Then let's go check Teacher Lou's home.

1214
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,360
Okay.

1215
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,160
Great.

1216
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,640
Alright.

1217
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,280
Let's go.

1218
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,880
509.

1219
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,440
This way.

1220
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,680
509 is Teacher Lou's home.

1221
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,800
It needs a password.

1222
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,400
Brother Teng has Teacher Lou's home password.

1223
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,520
1.

1224
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,280
9.

1225
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,960
8.

1226
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,480
9.

1227
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,160
0.

1228
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,720
5.

1229
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,240
1.

1230
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,920
0.

1231
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,440
Enter.

1232
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:10,960
Okay.

1233
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,240
Run

1234
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,320
No, not me

1235
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,000
So many sticky notes

1236
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:37,960
High

1237
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,240
High heels

1238
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,040
They're all high heels, right?

1239
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,560
There's more than one person

1240
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,880
The umbrella on the left is sister's

1241
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,720
The middle umbrella is

1242
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,240
Mom's

1243
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,160
Mom

1244
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,000
This is your son Xiaolou's favorite book

1245
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:54,960
Mom

1246
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,440
Turn on the heater to warm up

1247
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,600
Mom

1248
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,240
Your son is me, Xiaolou

1249
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,960
Your daughter is Sister Lou

1250
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,200
You're Mom Lou

1251
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,800
His mother

1252
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,040
These are all for his mother

1253
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,400
No one else

1254
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,080
Look

1255
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,160
I've prepared all the ingredients

1256
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,960
The knife is very sharp

1257
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,720
Don't use it yourself

1258
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,440
His mother just can't remember things

1259
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,680
Now I suspect one possibility is

1260
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,640
Alzheimer's disease

1261
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,600
Yes

1262
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,120
Yes, Alzheimer's disease

1263
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,760
His mother forgets

1264
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,640
All the shoes here

1265
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,440
are only women's, no men's

1266
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,600
Men's are over there

1267
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,000
Are those men's shoes?

1268
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,760
Are these?

1269
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,360
They're so small

1270
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,520
No

1271
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,400
These are old lady shoes

1272
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,560
Elderly shoes

1273
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,600
Only women's shoes

1274
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,200
He doesn't live here

1275
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,040
This must be

1276
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,160
where his mother and sister live

1277
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,240
There's another question

1278
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,880
He "died"

1279
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,480
Then where did his mother and sister go?

1280
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,920
So much dirt

1281
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,000
Why do I feel

1282
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,040
This is where his mother sleeps

1283
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,520
Because you see

1284
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,400
This is an elderly person's type of bed

1285
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:19,960
There's this

1286
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,400
This should be

1287
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,680
His mom sleeps here

1288
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,400
This might be the nursing bed

1289
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:27,920
This

1290
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,360
Where did his mom's sister go

1291
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,440
Friends, there's also here

1292
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,720
that song inside the doll

1293
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,240
There's that song again

1294
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,120
Written by Teacher Lou

1295
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,760
Where was it played?

1296
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,280
Is it like this?

1297
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,880
Play it here

1298
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,520
Last time with the doll

1299
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,480
He said he heard that music here

1300
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,040
So we put that into the doll

1301
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,440
I occasionally hear it

1302
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,400
in the apartment

1303
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
this music

1304
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,480
I think this music is quite ominous

1305
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,720
It's very suitable

1306
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,920
for reminding them

1307
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,720
that they will soon "die"

1308
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,680
He's a piano teacher

1309
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,960
so it's very likely he composed it

1310
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,400
Right

1311
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,600
Play it, come on

1312
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,360
You think too highly of us

1313
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,560
Show off a bit, come on

1314
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,240
I'm not

1315
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,040
You've recorded so many variety shows

1316
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,960
and acted in so many dramas

1317
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,840
Don't you know how it works?

1318
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,200
Now this impromptu playing

1319
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,840
Isn't it a bit

1320
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,480
I didn't study piano

1321
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,560
I'm a singer

1322
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,720
If you won't do it, I'll show off this part

1323
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,360
I can't

1324
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,600
This is the highlight

1325
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,520
of this episode

1326
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,240
Come on

1327
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,080
Is what you're playing even remotely related to the score?

1328
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,400
Is what you're playing even remotely related to the score?

1329
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,280
It has nothing to do with this song.

1330
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,200
Let's start over, sorry.

1331
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,240
I only know one piano piece.

1332
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:27,960
Show it off.

1333
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,400
Okay.

1334
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,400
Sunshine.

1335
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,160
You make me happy.

1336
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,560
What's going on?

1337
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,960
Could it possibly be like this?

1338
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,680
Like me pretending to be playing there.

1339
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,320
Add it in post-production.

1340
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:48,800
Sure.

1341
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,720
If the hand positions don't match, it'll be even more awkward.

1342
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,200
Really?

1343
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,000
Just watch like this.

1344
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,360
Keep watching like this, wait a moment.

1345
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,960
We'll do it like this.

1346
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,080
Keep doing this with his hands.

1347
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,400
Everyone's surrounding you.

1348
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,360
All surrounding.

1349
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
Add it in post-production.

1350
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,520
Ready, go!

1351
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,080
Doesn't this melody sound familiar?

1352
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,800
Yeah.

1353
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,320
It's from that creepy doll's melody.

1354
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,800
The creepy doll...

1355
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,760
So terrifying.

1356
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,440
Is it really okay for us to be so engrossed?

1357
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,680
I found a suitcase.

1358
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,080
What is it?

1359
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,960
This suitcase

1360
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,400
Looks like someone has already packed up.

1361
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,720
Seems like they're about to go out.

1362
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,480
These are all men's items, right?

1363
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:23,960
These are all men's belongings.

1364
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,360
These are all men's

1365
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,720
All are men's

1366
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:30,920
Lou

1367
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,600
Teacher Lou's

1368
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,200
bag

1369
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:32,600
Bag

1370
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,400
See if there's anything special

1371
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,360
Probably piano teaching materials

1372
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,200
So is he about to leave?

1373
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,560
That's why he left so many notes

1374
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,960
to tell his mother

1375
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,200
Like

1376
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,360
he might be going out

1377
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,560
or possibly preparing to leave

1378
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,480
Right, giving instructions to mom

1379
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,160
And in the end, wasn't it his "suicide"?

1380
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,760
There's a password here

1381
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,200
Is it his birthday?

1382
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,080
Try "Xiaolou"

1383
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,600
Xiaolou

1384
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,840
This is clearly a little boy

1385
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,720
Xiaolou

1386
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,240
Xiaolou

1387
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,240
Xiaolou

1388
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,000
Really

1389
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,680
Handsome

1390
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,280
There's something inside

1391
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,480
Let me check the chat history

1392
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,120
Sister Lou

1393
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,440
Sister

1394
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,400
You left us during your second year of high school

1395
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,440
Ten years have passed in the blink of an eye

1396
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,400
We miss you so much

1397
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,560
Mom's memory has been getting worse recently

1398
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,760
She always holds that photo of you

1399
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,240
wearing your high school uniform before the accident

1400
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:39,960
and stares blankly

1401
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,800
I took her to the hospital today

1402
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,680
The doctor said it's

1403
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,760
Alzheimer's disease

1404
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,320
This was posted on June 1, 2015

1405
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:49,760
(posted)

1406
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,880
Meaning his sister

1407
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,960
passed away in 2005

1408
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,400
Right

1409
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,920
Sister

1410
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,440
Recently, Mom

1411
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,560
doesn't even know how to get home

1412
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,680
She's gotten lost several times

1413
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,640
I had to install fences at home

1414
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,240
So that

1415
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,040
I can remind her not to go out randomly

1416
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,200
But she always wants to go out looking for you

1417
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,160
Worrying about you

1418
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,680
"Why aren't you home from school yet?"

1419
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,480
Now Mom doesn't even recognize me

1420
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,120
He only remembers having you as his daughter now.

1421
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,240
He keeps talking about it every day.

1422
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,840
He bought you a dress from your high school days.

1423
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,640
Waiting to surprise you when you come home.

1424
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,520
But you can't return.

1425
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,440
What should your younger brother do?

1426
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,040
Then in June

1427
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,600
Sister

1428
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,560
To make mom a little happier

1429
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,400
I had to come home every day

1430
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,920
In the basement bathroom of the apartment

1431
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,000
Put on your clothes

1432
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,800
Wear a wig

1433
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,200
And pretend to be you when coming home

1434
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,560
To accompany mom and cheer her up

1435
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,840
None of us are good people

1436
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,280
Wear a wig and pretend to be you when coming home

1437
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,160
Zhou Keke, look what you've done

1438
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,120
Yes

1439
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,560
He changed clothes downstairs

1440
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,480
Don't blame him

1441
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,400
He might "commit suicide"

1442
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:56,880
Have you forgotten

1443
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,280
Right

1444
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,560
It's okay

1445
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,960
It doesn't matter

1446
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,840
This isn't your fault

1447
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,120
It's fine

1448
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,320
He might jump off the building

1449
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,120
This isn't your fault

1450
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,480
Guilt

1451
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,240
This isn't your fault

1452
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,640
I'm going to the 9th floor

1453
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,280
This is violence, cyberbullying

1454
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:13,800
Yes

1455
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,120
My own clothes

1456
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,240
were carefully stored in a box

1457
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,600
to prevent mother from finding them and getting upset

1458
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,880
Though others see me as a "pervert"

1459
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,960
as long as mother is happy

1460
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,080
August 5, 2019

1461
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,480
There are always those ignorant fools

1462
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,320
who claim to hold

1463
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,280
the so-called "truth"

1464
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,360
when in fact they can't see the truth at all

1465
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,480
They've never truly

1466
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,720
desired the truth

1467
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,240
but only indulge in

1468
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,920
their fabricated fantasies

1469
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,080
just wanting to watch the spectacle

1470
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,040
Even fabricating rumors

1471
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,800
for attention

1472
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,480
spreading misinformation

1473
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,720
exaggerating details

1474
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,960
until suspicions become "confirmed facts"

1475
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,280
Before clickbait and money

1476
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,720
truth and conscience become worthless

1477
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,560
Sister, you've been gone ten years now

1478
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,840
Mother left me too in the early morning

1479
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,440
It's time I join you both

1480
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,160
After playing this melody

1481
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,920
you taught me one last time

1482
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,520
I'll bid farewell

1483
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,160
to this hopeless world

1484
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,880
The day Xiao Jing "passed away"

1485
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,080
She didn't come to my house for tutoring

1486
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,840
He clarified for himself

1487
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,560
Teacher Lou, something came up today

1488
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,600
Teacher Lou, I have something urgent today

1489
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,880
So I won't come for tutoring

1490
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,080
The final exams are coming up

1491
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,080
Xiao Jing

1492
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,040
Did come to my house every Tuesday for tutoring

1493
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,120
But on July 30th

1494
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,000
She really didn't come

1495
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,480
This is the leave message she sent me

1496
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,320
I was at home that night

1497
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,920
I really didn't go to the grove

1498
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,720
Also, about me wearing women's clothing

1499
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,120
It was for my family

1500
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,040
Please believe me

1501
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:47,640
I will cooperate with

1502
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,480
all investigations by relevant authorities

1503
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,560
The investigation is still ongoing

1504
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,320
The "deceased's" information hasn't been released

1505
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,280
Please trust the relevant authorities

1506
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,760
Then the comments below said

1507
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,760
How dare you post such a fake image

1508
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,920
Even my three-year-old could edit this

1509
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,080
The authorities are investigating

1510
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:01,640
I see

1511
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,520
Speaking with such confidence

1512
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,680
You must have connections

1513
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,720
Only fools would believe this

1514
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,280
Everyone

1515
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,120
This scumbag

1516
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,240
Are we really supposed to believe

1517
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,320
such clumsy fake evidence?

1518
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:10,640
Look

1519
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,000
He admitted to cross-dressing himself

1520
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,960
Claiming he had no choice

1521
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,880
I say he's just a pervert

1522
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,680
Someone do a female voice version

1523
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
The authorities haven't released results yet

1524
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,800
Maybe we should wait and see

1525
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,640
Is this supposed to be a female voice?

1526
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,920
Trying to cancel Teacher Lou already?

1527
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,400
Isn't this too rash?

1528
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,640
Stop whitewashing, commenter above

1529
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,080
You're obviously a paid shill by the second commenter

1530
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:26,880
Teacher Lou said

1531
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,200
I won't explain myself

1532
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,560
Do you really care about the truth?

1533
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,960
You only believe what feels right

1534
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,120
Only willing to hear

1535
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,160
And see

1536
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,200
What you want to hear and see

1537
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,040
He tried to clear his name, but no one believed him

1538
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,240
Can you zoom in on this?

1539
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,960
I want to see what time Xiaojing posted it.

1540
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,000
July 30, 2019.

1541
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,280
5:24 AM.

1542
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,360
I robbed her at 8 o'clock.

1543
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,840
On July 30th,

1544
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,880
I stole a three-piece jade set.

1545
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,600
She didn't go to class.

1546
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,840
Didn't attend class.

1547
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,200
But she went to Apartment 11.

1548
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,720
She's in apartment number 11.

1549
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,680
But she hasn't come to Teacher Lou's place.

1550
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,200
Mom also left me in the early morning.

1551
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,320
I should go join you all now.

1552
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,880
He disguised himself as Xiao Jing and went

1553
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,720
to Teacher Lou's house.

1554
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,240
Could it be that you "caused" his mother's death?

1555
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,040
Because when you arrived at the scene,

1556
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,360
an elderly woman fell down.

1557
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,600
That's right.

1558
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,520
After you scared her,

1559
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,320
she just

1560
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,160
"died" from fright.

1561
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,760
So you think she's strange, right?

1562
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,280
Because she was already sick.

1563
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,280
What date did you arrive?

1564
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,280
What date did I arrive?

1565
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,120
I came on the 4th.

1566
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,200
You "killed" her.

1567
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:04,760
You...

1568
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,040
No, I really didn't know about this.

1569
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,200
His mother might have really

1570
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,760
"passed away" because of this.

1571
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,360
His mother might have been

1572
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,840
"scared to death" by me.

1573
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,520
Possibly.

1574
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,440
No, it's pitch black there

1575
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,080
I'd be scared too if an old lady suddenly appeared

1576
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,080
And his mother is very sensitive about women's clothing

1577
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,840
Right

1578
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,680
She probably thought her daughter...

1579
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:26,920
Exactly

1580
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,240
Because I dressed up to look like Xiaojing

1581
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,080
And she couldn't see clearly

1582
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,600
She thought her daughter had returned

1583
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,080
Yes

1584
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:34,920
So she chased you

1585
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,640
Correct

1586
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,240
Guo Baoyou

1587
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,240
You're cyberbullying right now

1588
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,120
This is literally cyberbullying

1589
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,080
We're actually physically bullying you

1590
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,520
I genuinely didn't know about this

1591
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,680
We took this malice

1592
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,680
and treated it as justice

1593
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,400
to accuse you

1594
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,160
Xiao He

1595
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,440
What? What did he say?

1596
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,000
Xiao He

1597
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,600
Who is this?

1598
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,680
This is Hao Baojie.

1599
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,320
I found that pile of trash.

1600
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,600
Come and get it.

1601
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,600
Hao Baojie

1602
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,200
I'll go—I'll go get it.

1603
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,240
Okay.

1604
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,080
I'm on my way.

1605
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,000
Let me go get it.

1606
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,440
Trash bag.

1607
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,600
This is awful, Teacher Lou.

1608
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,480
Unbelievable.

1609
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,840
We're all "murderers."

1610
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,440
Come in

1611
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,080
This is the trash Hao Baojie gave me

1612
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,240
Why are you

1613
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:29,720
looking for it?

1614
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,960
Because we like collecting trash

1615
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,560
Come on, let's open it and see

1616
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,680
A piece of paper

1617
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,520
"Sleepy Dust"

1618
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,320
Instructions

1619
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,360
After inhaling,

1620
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,600
you'll fall into deep sleep for twenty hours

1621
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,400
without shedding a drop of "blood"

1622
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,160
Super upgraded version

1623
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,760
"Sleepy Dust" super upgraded version

1624
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,920
Twenty hours

1625
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,880
Twenty hours

1626
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,680
What did you tear up?

1627
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,080
This is Xiao Jing

1628
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,920
I could recognize her just by a strand of her hair

1629
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,640
How dare you

1630
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,600
Yes, right, yes

1631
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,000
Really

1632
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,560
It's my Jing

1633
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,840
Let me piece it together

1634
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,840
Torn so small—look, Xiao Jing

1635
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,320
Why circle the mouth?

1636
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,480
What is this?

1637
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,840
Why suddenly bring up something from three years ago?

1638
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,200
the details of the "corpse burning" case in the grove

1639
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,080
Because the grove

1640
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,000
is near Apartment No. 11

1641
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,840
As the security guard of the apartment,

1642
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,640
I was the first to arrive at the crime scene,

1643
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,400
and even put out the fire.

1644
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,320
Before that girl "died,"

1645
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,600
she must have had a conflict with someone—

1646
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,720
her canine tooth was knocked out.

1647
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,720
Her canine tooth was knocked out.

1648
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,000
She doesn't have canine teeth, my Jingjing.

1649
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,200
You and her

1650
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,040
have been in a relationship for so long

1651
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,800
You have no idea

1652
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,240
Wait a second

1653
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,200
Read that part again

1654
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,200
Why are you suddenly asking about

1655
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,880
the details of the

1656
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,240
"burned corpse" case from three years ago in the grove?

1657
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,360
Before that girl "died,"

1658
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,240
she must have had a conflict with someone.

1659
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,760
When I arrived, her canine tooth was already knocked out.

1660
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,080
The old security guard from Apartment 11

1661
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,440
Then it wasn't Xiao Jing who "died"

1662
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,600
Xiao Nao is Kai's girlfriend.

1663
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,760
His girlfriend has fangs.

1664
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,640
Damn it, the one who "died" was Xiao Nao.

1665
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,320
But we can't

1666
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:04,840
If

1667
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,440
it's not

1668
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,080
If his girlfriend were in danger

1669
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,440
Xiaokai definitely wouldn't be waiting there for me

1670
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,880
Could Xiaokai be the one who did it?

1671
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,360
Xiao Nao left first.

1672
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,440
When she left,

1673
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,240
she was just walking normally.

1674
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,240
But the victim might be Xiao Nao.

1675
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,840
That's stating the obvious.

1676
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,000
No,

1677
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,880
you mean it wasn't Xiao Kai.

1678
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,520
You're saying Xiao Kai didn't do it.

1679
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,200
Someone else did it.

1680
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,840
Xiao Kai might not even know about this.

1681
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,080
Even we two didn't know.

1682
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,640
Xiao Kai's own girlfriend "died."

1683
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,680
How could he not know?

1684
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,080
Right, how could he not know?

1685
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,120
What is this rubbing of?

1686
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:03,600
The first one is

1687
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,240
I know who you're with now, the person you love most

1688
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,080
Who was it again?

1689
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:06,520
Me

1690
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,440
Several pages have been torn out here.

1691
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,800
Two pages have been ripped out.

1692
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,720
That means there's still one page left.

1693
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,680
This is someone's copy of Teng Zhongjie's

1694
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,640
invitation note.

1695
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,160
But counting them, there seem to be nine people.

1696
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,600
Besides us,

1697
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,160
he also wrote notes to others.

1698
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,280
The first time is 6:30, right?

1699
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,200
6:30 is me.

1700
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,400
6:30,

1701
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,040
7:30,

1702
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,560
then 8:30,

1703
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,920
9:30,

1704
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,000
10:30,

1705
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,880
11:30.

1706
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:44,600
Tilt it a bit.

1707
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,120
There's also 12:30.

1708
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:47,760
Who's at 12:30?

1709
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,160
I know your big secret from three years ago.

1710
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,320
July 29th,

1711
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,080
12:30.

1712
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,200
Come to Room 205 to discuss.

1713
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:55,840
Who is this?

1714
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,800
July 29th.

1715
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,240
Wait, isn't ours the 28th?

1716
00:56:59,240 --> 00:56:59,840
We're the 28th.

1717
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,880
His is early morning on the 29th.

1718
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,280
Then the next one.

1719
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,800
I know your big secret from three years ago.

1720
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,400
July 29th, 1:30 AM.

1721
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,440
Come to Room 205 to discuss.

1722
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,000
There's one more.

1723
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,280
I know your big secret from three years ago.

1724
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,600
July 29th, 2:30 AM.

1725
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,680
Come to Room 205.

1726
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,960
So who are the other three people?

1727
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,440
Then who made this rubbing of the note?

1728
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,640
What is this

1729
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,040
Don't know

1730
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:30,880
This too

1731
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,800
A string of unknown numbers

1732
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,440
Probably useful later

1733
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,160
Written by Teng Zhongjie

1734
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,040
A string of numbers

1735
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,800
B10140106

1736
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,480
Doesn't look like an ID number

1737
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,560
ID numbers have a date

1738
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,120
This doesn't

1739
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,920
Is this the room number?

1740
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,440
401 is Liu Xialai

1741
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:56,880
Right

1742
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,120
602 is Lao Bai

1743
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,000
702

1744
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,760
702 is me

1745
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,160
You

1746
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,600
Excluding our own

1747
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,000
The remaining ones are

1748
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,640
Exactly those three (people)

1749
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,520
Don't write on the evidence

1750
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,120
Copy it down

1751
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,280
Don't write on the evidence

1752
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,960
How many

1753
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,840
B101

1754
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,600
101

1755
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,720
401

1756
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,680
066

1757
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,760
020

1758
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,840
508

1759
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,720
702

1760
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,400
702

1761
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,000
03

1762
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,400
03

1763
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,320
03

1764
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,800
There's a 602 here, right?

1765
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,840
Who is 602?

1766
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,360
Me

1767
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:27,680
Lao Bai

1768
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,720
Cross out 602

1769
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,000
Then

1770
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,960
702 is me

1771
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,280
702 is

1772
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,760
Not me, I'm 608

1773
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,320
Who is 508?

1774
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:33,840
Who is 508?

1775
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,600
Who is 508?

1776
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,240
This is

1777
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,360
This is 508

1778
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,720
508 is

1779
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,280
Building

1780
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:38,720
Building

1781
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,120
No, this is 509

1782
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:41,800
This is 509

1783
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,880
This is 509

1784
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,800
Then who is 508?

1785
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:47,840
602

1786
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,160
401 is correct, I'm right

1787
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,920
Keke, 702 is correct

1788
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,160
Just write Liu Xialai here, Liu

1789
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:53,920
Who's still missing?

1790
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,560
The three of us are missing

1791
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:56,920
What's your 40-something number?

1792
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,480
406

1793
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,360
Look, he's 406

1794
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,320
406

1795
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,840
401, 406

1796
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,520
Right

1797
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,320
If you calculate it this way

1798
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,520
Let's force a complete set first

1799
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,160
Then see who's left

1800
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,320
Let's try forcing a combination first

1801
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,720
Could it be that he states the floor first

1802
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,720
Then follows with the room number?

1803
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,920
For example, B1

1804
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,040
Right

1805
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,640
4th floor, 0106

1806
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,520
It's here

1807
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:18,960
Look

1808
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,560
4th floor is 01, 06

1809
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,600
6th floor is 02, 05, 08

1810
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,240
The three of us

1811
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,520
7th floor, 02, 03

1812
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:25,880
Right

1813
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,640
Okay, so now it's B101

1814
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,040
and

1815
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:29,760
703

1816
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,320
Think again, who is 703?

1817
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,640
703

1818
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,920
That was my former home.

1819
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,440
The Cao family.

1820
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,320
I was adopted by the Cao family as a child.

1821
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,200
But there's still one missing.

1822
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,800
He wrote down three extra people.

1823
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,720
Three people.

1824
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,440
A note with three extra names.

1825
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,080
Now how many extra room numbers are there?

1826
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:56,680
Two.

1827
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:57,800
No.

1828
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,440
It's possible two people share one room.

1829
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,200
That could be it.

1830
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,400
For example, Xiaokai and his girlfriend.

1831
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,600
Something like that.

1832
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:03,720
Yes, exactly.

1833
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,480
But I remember B101.

1834
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,240
Wasn't that Old Man Li back then?

1835
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:07,680
Was it him?

1836
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,280
Let's go check out B101 first.

1837
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,160
You did great today.

1838
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,480
What does "biangbiang" mean?

1839
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,640
Biangbiang noodles.

1840
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,080
Where is B101?

1841
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:30,720
Right here.

1842
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,560
B101 Da Kai Yan Street.

1843
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,080
Uncle Li's birthday.

1844
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,760
0702.

1845
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,360
Your brain works really well.

1846
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,080
Changed

1847
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,000
The person has been replaced

1848
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,080
This is a gangster now

1849
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,960
Before, it was Andy Lau and Stephen Chow

1850
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,760
Here's one

1851
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,160
A photo of my dad

1852
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,640
What exactly does "Meet You with Pomelo" mean

1853
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,400
What is this thing?

1854
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,080
So rebellious

1855
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,000
Look, what's this chain thing?

1856
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:27,960
All punk-style stuff

1857
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,200
Isn't this some kind of collar?

1858
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:31,760
Collar

1859
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,520
But his neck is so thin

1860
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:32,880
No

1861
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,320
This is for the wrist

1862
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,720
Wait a minute

1863
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,640
Xiao Kai, the apartment security guard

1864
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,240
Xiao Kai

1865
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,040
This is Xiao Kai's room

1866
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,360
Your friend

1867
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,200
Xiao Kai lives here

1868
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,880
Really? No way

1869
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,920
It's him

1870
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:54,520
Xiao Kai

1871
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,080
Kai Kai

1872
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,480
Let's search around more first

1873
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,200
I know your big secret from three years ago

1874
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,800
July 29th, 2:30 PM

1875
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,800
Come to room 205 to discuss

1876
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,360
I knew he would contact him

1877
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,840
He must have contacted Xiao Nao too

1878
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:16,760
The last one

1879
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,520
He's the last one

1880
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,160
Last one

1881
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:23,880
Wait

1882
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,360
This

1883
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,200
There's a protective charm under his pillow

1884
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,360
Darling, I'm sorry

1885
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,920
I didn't mean to "cause your death"

1886
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,360
Every day after you "died"

1887
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,280
I've been filled with guilt

1888
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,360
And remorse

1889
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,600
Every year on July 30th

1890
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,680
The anniversary of your passing

1891
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,640
I offer you

1892
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,760
Your favorite tulips

1893
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,400
And pray for you

1894
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,960
Isn't this written for his girlfriend?

1895
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:51,600
Yes

1896
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,280
Darling

1897
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,600
Yes, darling

1898
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:53,960
Let me tell you

1899
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:54,840
It's possible that the one who "died" that day

1900
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,560
Was that...

1901
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,200
Xiao Nao

1902
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:56,800
Xiao Nao

1903
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,600
Where did Xiaojing go then?

1904
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,160
Isn't this Xiao Kai?

1905
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,360
Isn't this Xiao Kai?

1906
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,200
Get him

1907
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:29,720
Catch him

1908
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,280
Grab him

1909
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:33,400
Don't

1910
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,000
Bro

1911
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,480
Wait

1912
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,640
Who are you?

1913
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,200
Kaikai

1914
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,080
Me

1915
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,320
Kuku

1916
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:40,720
I

1917
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,000
Kuku

1918
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:42,640
Hold on

1919
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:42,960
Wait a sec

1920
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,320
Stop

1921
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,200
Close this

1922
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,240
My buddy

1923
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,000
Bro

1924
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,720
We're all buddies

1925
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,320
Lao Liu's quick today

1926
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,560
So fierce

1927
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,800
When Lao Liu turned around

1928
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,520
He immediately charged out

1929
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:55,560
What?

1930
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,200
Coming

1931
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,280
Why did he push me?

1932
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,560
He punched me.

1933
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,560
There's a hidden passage here.

1934
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,920
He punched me.

1935
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,040
Bro

1936
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,200
Where are you running? Why are you running?

1937
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,280
I'm not doing anything

1938
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,200
Then why are you running?

1939
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,320
Why are you chasing me?

1940
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,240
You ran first, so we chased

1941
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,760
You chased first, then I ran

1942
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:31,880
You run first, you sit first

1943
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,320
Don't run

1944
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,240
Why are you running?

1945
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:34,800
Me? Why are you running?

1946
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,320
Kuku

1947
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,600
Haven't seen you in so long

1948
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,040
Sit

1949
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:38,440
Don't run

1950
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,760
You sit first

1951
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:40,040
Come

1952
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:40,360
Let's go back

1953
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,240
Going back

1954
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,280
You ran way too hard

1955
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,480
We even "time traveled"

1956
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:45,560
You run

1957
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,960
How did we end up in 1988?

1958
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,520
Stand there

1959
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,200
Don't move

1960
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:48,920
You stand there

1961
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:49,680
You punched her

1962
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,640
You punched me

1963
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,040
Sorry

1964
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,160
I have to hit you

1965
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,360
My nail art got broken from hitting you

1966
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,360
He can run too well

1967
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,480
Let's go back first

1968
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,520
We need to get something to eat right now

1969
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,280
Get some sunflower seeds for Brother Bai

1970
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,280
I'll do it myself

1971
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,560
Brother Bai, come

1972
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,880
This preserved plum is quite good.

1973
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,800
Take this box.

1974
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,880
Take this box, let's eat.

1975
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,320
Let me tell you, this is a den of thieves.

1976
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,560
They got what they deserved, right?

1977
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,160
Yes, exactly.

1978
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,080
We can take all these things freely.

1979
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,280
Really, these scammers.

1980
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,040
Yeah.

1981
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:21,840
Truly.

1982
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,080
We're just giving them some...

1983
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:24,680
Payback.

1984
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,240
Come on, brother.

1985
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:29,680
Come on, come inside.

1986
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,600
Let's have a proper talk.

1987
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,360
Where have you been working lately?

1988
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,320
Why is this reunion so awkward between you brothers?

1989
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,400
No, not awkward.

1990
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,240
What about us?

1991
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,080
We're brothers.

1992
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:39,680
Brothers for life.

1993
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,200
Brothers for life.

1994
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,040
Brothers for life.

1995
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:41,800
This...

1996
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,600
Can you two connect?

1997
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,200
For life, come on.

1998
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,880
We're brothers for life, right?

1999
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:46,480
Right.

2000
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,200
Remember?

2001
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,440
Yes.

2002
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,080
There's this...

2003
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,160
Back when we roamed the world.

2004
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:53,600
Right?

2005
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,720
Not matching at all.

2006
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,440
Bro, I won't run, I really won't run anymore.

2007
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:03,760
Have a seat.

2008
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,480
I know you won't run, sit down.

2009
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,240
I'll snack on some sunflower seeds.

2010
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,280
Sit.

2011
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:07,840
Kai.

2012
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,080
I need to have a serious talk with you.

2013
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,080
Why haven't we met in three years?

2014
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,760
Didn't we promise to be brothers for life?

2015
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,520
Even though we haven't met,

2016
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,720
I've still been keeping up with you.

2017
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,440
How have you been keeping up with me?

2018
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:21,320
By voting for you.

2019
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,160
Brothers for life.

2020
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,600
Brothers for life.

2021
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,120
Brothers for life.

2022
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,320
I asked you what happened later that night

2023
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,080
What happened afterwards?

2024
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,600
Where did Xiao Nao go?

2025
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,200
Didn't we

2026
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,760
agree on that

2027
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:59,480
robbery plan?

2028
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,160
After we let Xiaojing go,

2029
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,280
Kuku got too nervous

2030
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,720
and said he needed the bathroom

2031
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,920
so Xiaonao and I divided the loot on the spot

2032
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:12,960
At that time,

2033
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,120
Xiao Nao

2034
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,640
took a fancy to that pair of jade pieces

2035
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,040
Give them to me

2036
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,280
Here, take them

2037
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,400
These were stolen, how can I give them to you?

2038
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:21,800
Give them to me!

2039
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,360
What's wrong with taking a pair of earrings?

2040
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,200
You've never given me any gifts all these years

2041
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,680
I thought it wouldn't work

2042
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,120
Our first robbery

2043
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,920
Keeping these would be like leaving evidence

2044
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:31,640
Such an expensive item

2045
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,240
The owners would definitely notice

2046
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,520
But she thought

2047
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,360
As a girl

2048
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,040
she just found them beautiful

2049
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,440
and had to have them

2050
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,320
I insisted

2051
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:39,720
on not giving them to her

2052
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,600
So she tried to snatch them from me

2053
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,360
Give them to me!

2054
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,600
If they suit me, they should be mine

2055
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,080
Stolen goods must be sold

2056
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,320
I accidentally pushed her

2057
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,200
Her head

2058
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,600
hit a rock

2059
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,840
On the spot

2060
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,280
she "died"

2061
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,520
You "killed" Xiao Nao

2062
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,960
At that time

2063
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:06,960
I really didn't mean to

2064
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,120
I didn't know

2065
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,800
I was extremely

2066
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,240
just extremely panicked

2067
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:12,920
I didn't want anyone to discover

2068
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,480
that I had "killed" someone

2069
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,640
Then I thought

2070
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,240
Xiao Nao

2071
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,080
had no family

2072
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:19,920
and no one would come looking for her

2073
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,520
So by the roadside

2074
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:23,680
I siphoned gas from a car

2075
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:25,960
and burned her body

2076
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,760
I have a question

2077
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,520
Great question

2078
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:43,680
Why would people think

2079
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,760
the one who "died" is

2080
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,479
Xiao Jing

2081
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,399
Have you seen Xiaojing since then?

2082
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:53,080
No, I haven't.

2083
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:53,760
Never saw her again.

2084
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,840
After that night,

2085
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,840
I was terrified at the time.

2086
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,920
I just stayed home and didn't go out.

2087
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,200
Then I saw the news saying

2088
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,120
that Xiaojing had "died."

2089
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:01,720
Yes.

2090
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,880
The one who "died" was Xiaojing.

2091
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,479
I was very surprised.

2092
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,800
Xiaonao had buck teeth, right?

2093
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,200
Yes.

2094
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,279
Two people "died" that day.

2095
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:16,439
Xiaonao and Xiaojing.

2096
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,399
Is it possible Xiaojing didn't actually "die"?

2097
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:21,680
Then how could Xiaojing not see such big news?

2098
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:23,439
Maybe...

2099
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,560
Perhaps Xiaojing was behind this incident.

2100
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,720
Maybe Xiaojing just doesn't want to be with him anymore

2101
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,160
and took the chance to run away

2102
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,319
Confess

2103
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,040
What's really going on with you?

2104
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:39,800
It had to be you

2105
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,479
Wasn't it you after all?

2106
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,760
Just tell us already

2107
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,000
Actually, I also have a "cross-dressing fetish"

2108
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,080
Let me show you my high heels

2109
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,560
I'll take out my high heels

2110
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,479
Just take a look

2111
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:52,399
I'm getting my high heels out

2112
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,000
Have a quick look

2113
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,800
What a strange first reaction

2114
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:54,080
Right

2115
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:54,800
You'd never tell from normal interactions

2116
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:55,520
Where are my high heels?

2117
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,920
What? That's completely irrelevant

2118
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,200
The fact that Xiaojing hasn't spoken up

2119
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:01,760
is really strange

2120
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,360
Yes, Xiaojing still hasn't said anything

2121
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,440
That wasn't her

2122
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,200
It's possible someone has taken control of Xiaojing again

2123
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,080
For example, by kidnapping Xiaojing

2124
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,040
and taking her away

2125
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,040
Then making others believe

2126
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,160
that Xiaojing has "died"

2127
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,400
And conveniently

2128
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:39,600
Isn't this that thing?

2129
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,440
Cao Yangguang

2130
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,280
Who let you into my house?

2131
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,720
Then call the police.

2132
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,320
I've already...

2133
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,080
told you the answer to the riddle.

2134
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,160
What more are you inferring?

2135
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,920
Who do you think you are?

2136
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,360
He really deserves to "die," this person.

2137
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:51,960
"Pervert."

2138
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,480
He "committed crimes," he "robbed."

2139
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,160
What evidence do you have?

2140
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,360
to prove I've seen this?

2141
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,080
What evidence do you have that you didn't see it?

2142
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,600
Meaning he was already knocked out.

2143
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,360
Then who was talking to us?

2144
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,360
I think it was Cao Yangguang.

2145
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,960
What evidence do you have?

2146
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,440
We need to see evidence.

2147
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,080
What was that sound?
