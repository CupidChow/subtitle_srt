1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,840
It took us back to 1988.

2
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,840
We didn't actually "time travel."

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,000
This is 2022.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,800
I think the one who "died" should be

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,560
Old Wang (Little Wang).

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,480
missing a finger.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,240
Dad.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,400
Isn't this Zhou Keke's "Biebie"?

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,160
This profile picture.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,200
He's highly suspicious.

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,880
Back in the warehouse again

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,560
Why are we back in the warehouse?

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,920
Warehouse again

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,040
I'm exhausted

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,440
Here we are, back in this yard again

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,440
What are you doing?

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:14,840
Open it.

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,120
Then where should we go?

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,000
What should we do?

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,800
Open it.

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,520
Open it.

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,360
Open it.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:24,960
Open it.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,040
Open the door.

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,520
Open it.

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,240
Come on, hurry.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,040
Hurry.

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,160
[Proper names - untranslated] Bai Song, Guo Zhou, Liu Ku

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,640
The key.

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,000
No key.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,480
What should we do?

32
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,840
Didn't bring the key.

33
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,520
The key.

34
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,880
Didn't bring the key.

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,560
The key.

36
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,760
Wanna play chess, bro?

37
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,920
Finally had a smart idea.

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,120
Kicking the door, really kicking it now.

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,520
Alright, I'll do it.

40
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,360
I might not be able to kick it open.

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,880
Let me try.

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,840
So heroic

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,480
So handsome

44
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,720
So foolish

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,680
We forgot the keys

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,040
We didn't bring the keys

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:30,960
So stupid

48
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,920
We're so stupid

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,960
So dumb

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,280
Forgot the keys

51
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,160
Bai Sanwan, I've learned your trick

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,760
What trick?

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,480
Door kicking

54
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,800
Hello there

55
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't let me catch you

56
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,240
Open it

57
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,640
Help! Someone escaped

58
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,120
Help!

59
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,600
Open the door

60
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,520
Didn't expect that, did you?

61
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,240
Right

62
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,640
I'll go open that now

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,760
Where did you find this key?

64
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,480
This key was just among that bunch

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
Opened it. What?

66
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,920
Firecrackers

67
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,880
A bundle of firecrackers burns for five minutes

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,440
The firecrackers have all been removed

69
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,560
The firecracker to that gasoline bottle

70
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,160
ignited it

71
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,720
Right?

72
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Alright, the dance hall

73
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,520
Then we'll enter our

74
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
Is Sister Hua here?

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,280
Yes

76
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,800
Inside the spittoon

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,920
First, check the spittoon

78
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,400
Old Wang (Little Wang) and Little Xiao Wang

79
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,720
See how their faces are scratched?

80
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,680
This shows deep hatred

81
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,000
You two traitors who betrayed the boss

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,760
I want to stay here forever with my soulmate Zengzeng

83
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,000
Stay here forever

84
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,040
Who wrote these words?

85
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,920
Sister Hua?

86
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,400
Rare as perfect musical harmony, true friendship is hard to find.

87
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,520
Is this Elder Zeng actually Zengzeng?

88
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,480
He is Zengzeng.

89
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,360
My uncle.

90
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,880
Welcome, Dance King Elder Zeng!

91
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,079
Dance Queen Sister Hua.

92
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,360
Your aunt.

93
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,480
Auntie Zhou.

94
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,240
And your uncle Zhou Zengzeng.

95
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,320
Believed I pushed your mother off the cliff.

96
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,120
My uncle.

97
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,040
What do you mean "my karaoke bar is back"?

98
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,960
You two traitors who betrayed the boss!

99
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,480
I want to stay here forever with my soulmate Zengzeng.

100
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,440
Stay here forever.

101
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,360
Wait a minute.

102
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,920
So that means...

103
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,160
Besides Old Wang (or Little Wang) here...

104
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,400
There's an even bigger boss.

105
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,000
Right.

106
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,320
It seems Sister Hua and your uncle...

107
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,720
Along with Old Wang (Little Wang) and Little Little Wang...

108
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,240
All work for the same boss.

109
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,520
Correct.

110
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
There should be an even bigger boss.

111
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,760
It's not you, is it?

112
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,880
No! I'm really not!

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,000
Dad, believe me.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,640
I believe you.

115
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,680
You're not the boss, are you?

116
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,760
No.

117
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,600
Definitely not.

118
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,160
He couldn't be.

119
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,200
What do you do?

120
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm a writer.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,280
You have nothing to do with this.

122
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,080
No connection.

123
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,280
Unrelated to the case.

124
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Search the bag.

125
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,600
Search the bag, everyone.

126
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,320
That bag might be suspicious.

127
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,000
After searching through so many, not a single one was found.

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,800
Power on.

129
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,760
An Hong

130
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,720
I miss you

131
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,200
I miss you

132
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,840
An Hong, I miss you

133
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,160
An Hong, I miss you

134
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,400
I miss you so much I can't sleep

135
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,320
How come it's so authentic?

136
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,040
He's from there, of course it's authentic

137
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,280
There's a big box here

138
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,360
Come on, let's move it out

139
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,760
Probably nothing inside

140
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,520
No need to open it

141
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,880
No, I think there's something

142
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,280
Let's make a bet

143
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,840
If I win, you call me "sis" from now on

144
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,360
If I lose, I'll still call you "bro"

145
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,960
You call me "dad"

146
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,600
What?

147
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,560
I just made a bet with her.

148
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,360
I said if I lose,

149
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,720
you'd have to call her "older sister" from now on.

150
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,280
And then I lost.

151
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,720
Now you have to call her "older sister."

152
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,640
What does that have to do with me?

153
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,200
Uncle Zeng

154
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,480
Inside Uncle Zeng's suitcase

155
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
His sister?

156
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,560
Yes, Zhou Zengzeng, Auntie Zhou

157
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,120
This is you

158
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,680
This is me

159
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,240
Uncle Zeng has been looking for me

160
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,600
Your smile is like a little sun

161
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,840
Smile for me, let me see if it's like a little sun

162
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Check if it's in the pocket

163
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,400
Right

164
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,320
Impressive, huh?

165
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,400
Experience beats youth

166
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,080
After our agency's months-long investigation

167
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,480
We found

168
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,280
photos of Aunt Zhou falling off the cliff

169
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,520
When Aunt Zhou fell off the cliff

170
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,760
there were two men behind her

171
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,160
who could be suspects

172
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,000
One has a large mole on his neck

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,240
That's the one I called "Little Wang"

174
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,680
The other is missing his left middle finger

175
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,160
Old Wang (or Xiao Wang)

176
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,080
So it's Old Wang and Little Wang

177
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,760
Old Wang and Little Wang

178
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,120
What are you doing?

179
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,760
Hello

180
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,400
Hello

181
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,040
Who said you could go through my bag?

182
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,120
Your uncle is here.

183
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,840
Quick, you handle this.

184
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,480
You talk to him.

185
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
This is your uncle.

186
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Go acknowledge him as family.

187
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Take the photo and talk to him.

188
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,840
Take a look at me.

189
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,600
Do I look familiar?

190
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,440
Uncle.

191
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,760
When I smile, I look like the sun.

192
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,080
Now it's an eclipse.

193
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,840
Uncle

194
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,720
Look at me

195
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,800
Little Messy

196
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
So very messy indeed

197
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,400
Is it you?

198
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,000
I never knew

199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,200
So you've been looking for me all along

200
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,480
We, the Zhou family

201
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,240
one generation sings bass

202
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,720
the next generation sings tenor

203
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,480
Right

204
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,880
Let me verify this

205
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,360
My previous generation should be bass, right?

206
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,480
My generation sings bass

207
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,600
Then you should sing tenor

208
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:17,960
Correct

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,840
No need to pretend

210
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,800
You've grown so tall

211
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,040
You've given me such a hard time searching for you

212
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,920
Great-uncle

213
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,320
For this generation, it's time for the bass again

214
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,920
This is your nephew, so it's bass again

215
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,360
Look at my nephew

216
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,640
Listen to my nephew

217
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,560
Come on, let's do it again

218
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,520
We'll take turns

219
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,760
Am I bass or treble?

220
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,360
Bass

221
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,120
Your turn

222
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,200
Stop vomiting

223
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,520
I'm so afraid you'll vomit

224
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
We're family

225
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,680
I'm not on the same side as you

226
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,400
Yes, I'm on this side

227
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,120
Uncle

228
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,120
Look at this

229
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,880
You

230
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,320
Eat some fruit

231
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,880
You coward

232
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,840
My eldest sister

233
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,520
You're still eating?

234
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,640
You irresponsible person

235
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,680
My eldest sister

236
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Are you worthy of my eldest sister?

237
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,600
Stop fighting

238
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,240
Enough

239
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,840
Don't fight

240
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,760
Great-uncle

241
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,440
Don't fight

242
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,040
Great-uncle

243
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,600
Aren't you going to intervene?

244
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,320
He's your father

245
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,120
He's your grandfather

246
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,720
He's my grandfather

247
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,520
He's your grandfather

248
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,280
Family drama

249
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,200
Let's talk inside

250
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,160
Let's talk inside

251
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,600
Back in 1988,

252
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,880
my eldest sister received a letter for me

253
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,440
saying that father

254
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,200
and uncle

255
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Was "killed" by someone

256
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,040
Yes

257
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,360
Why did you run away back then?

258
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,880
I ran away to investigate

259
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,600
who

260
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,640
really "killed" your father and uncle

261
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,680
and why they framed me for it

262
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,720
Later

263
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,520
I discovered this issue

264
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,760
Xiao Wang (Old Wang)

265
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,480
He tampered with my family's clock

266
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,440
by moving it one hour ahead

267
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:38,960
But

268
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,280
I didn't know at the time

269
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,480
I couldn't defend myself

270
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
So I ran away

271
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Alright

272
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,160
I'll believe you for now

273
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,160
But then I don't know why

274
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,760
you managed to deceive my eldest sister

275
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,560
Moreover

276
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,960
When my eldest sister was investigating this matter

277
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,120
and just starting to make progress

278
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,680
she fell off a cliff

279
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,080
Since childhood, my eldest sister

280
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,440
carried me on her back through rugged mountain paths

281
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,040
as if walking on flat ground

282
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,520
fell off a cliff

283
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,680
This is too strange

284
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,800
So you and your second sister believe

285
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,120
that I was the one who

286
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,840
drove your eldest sister to her "death"

287
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,720
Drove her to "death"

288
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,680
But this photo

289
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,040
has already proven it wasn't me

290
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,360
Yes

291
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,440
There are two people in it

292
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,120
Later, at this detective agency

293
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,160
I obtained the only clue given to me

294
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,240
Didn't you notice the one missing a middle finger

295
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,080
and with a large mole on his neck?

296
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,120
No, I've been searching until now

297
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,200
without any leads

298
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,800
I was about to give up

299
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,200
Do you know Xiao Wang (Old Wang) and Xiao Xiao Wang?

300
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,280
Who's Xiao Xiao Wang?

301
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,560
How could you not know them?

302
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,920
They live right next to you

303
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,680
No, I've never seen them

304
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,320
Xiao Wang (Old Wang)

305
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,760
is the one missing a middle finger

306
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,720
who "killed" my eldest sister

307
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,120
Exactly

308
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,840
Then do you know those who "died" today

309
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,720
were those two?

310
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,960
They were burned to "death" today

311
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,880
Heaven has eyes indeed

312
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,760
I'd like to ask

313
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,360
why you work here?

314
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,640
Right

315
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Six months ago

316
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,880
I saw Huahua at the central square of our Tuishi city

317
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,680
I met Huahua

318
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,760
She was doing square dancing

319
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,160
Dancing to the hottest song

320
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,040
"Above the Moon"

321
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,600
She was singing while dancing

322
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,480
"I'm looking up"

323
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,760
"Above the moon"

324
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,960
"The sound of horse hooves rises"

325
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,120
"The sound of horse hooves falls"

326
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,800
Yes, just like you

327
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,520
I also joined in

328
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,280
We never rehearsed

329
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,480
But we had this natural chemistry

330
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,840
Perfectly in sync

331
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,120
That feeling of kindred spirits

332
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,600
So one day

333
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,120
She suddenly

334
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,600
Brought out a flyer saying

335
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,920
"If just two people"

336
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,400
"Pay 99,800 yuan"

337
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,880
"You can go back to 1988"

338
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,640
I actually thought it was fake

339
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,520
But

340
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,560
As her kindred spirit

341
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,360
As long as she liked it

342
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,960
I was willing to accompany her forever

343
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,600
So did you know Sister Hua

344
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,280
Knew Xiao Wang (Old Wang) and Xiao Xiao Wang?

345
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,200
I didn't know

346
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,800
You didn't know?

347
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,360
Then why is there

348
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,160
this photo in your place?

349
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,640
This is Sister Hua's room

350
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,160
But they should be living together

351
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,760
Aren't their shoes all here?

352
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,040
We were just kindred spirits

353
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,080
It's just that now

354
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,240
We're running this dance hall together

355
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,680
You must have been surprised

356
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,920
when you saw this photo

357
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,120
You two are the traitors who betrayed the boss.

358
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,240
She also mentioned you.

359
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,640
She wants to stay here with you forever.

360
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,520
What do you think about that?

361
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,040
Right.

362
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,800
Actually, she was also part of the 1988 scheme.

363
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,600
A member of it.

364
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,960
She wasn't deceived.

365
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,640
Why only 98,800?

366
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,520
Because only your money was taken.

367
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,160
Just your money alone.

368
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,280
Because she didn't have to pay.

369
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,080
Because...

370
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,520
You were scammed.

371
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
It was your money being spent.

372
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,360
You were tricked into this.

373
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,200
And it's obvious that she...

374
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,880
This photo proves...

375
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,520
Sister Hua, Xiao Wang (Old Wang), and Xiao Xiao Wang...

376
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,720
all know each other.

377
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,480
And behind them, there's another boss.

378
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,840
Which means Sister Hua and Xiao Xiao Wang...

379
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,320
and Xiao Wang (Old Wang)...

380
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,720
are on the same level of awareness.

381
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,920
They share the same information.

382
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,920
So I suspect she knew everything

383
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,960
about the 1988 "murder"

384
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,280
of your father

385
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,800
uncle

386
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,400
and even eldest sister's

387
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,320
Sister Hua is the most informed person

388
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,360
Yes

389
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,120
Is Sister Hua the most informed?

390
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,320
I think... (not necessarily).

391
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,880
Sister Hua might not...

392
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,760
"kill" Old Wang (or Xiao Wang) and Little Xiao Wang.

393
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,040
Her "murder" motive isn't that strong.

394
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
She might kill...

395
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,560
because these two are already traitors.

396
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,880
Please try to talk some sense into her for me

397
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,680
Don't let her persist in this misguided path

398
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,200
Okay

399
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,560
Alright

400
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,520
Huahua is my

401
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,440
true destined goddess

402
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,160
I'll go get that bag.

403
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Flower

404
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,080
Sister Hua is back

405
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,560
Good, I knew it

406
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,080
You little brats

407
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,000
causing trouble here

408
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,840
None of you are getting out

409
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,400
Sister Hua is back

410
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,040
Sister Hua is here

411
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,520
Come

412
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,920
Don't you have questions for her?

413
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,160
Help me talk some sense into her

414
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,520
Alright

415
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,160
Sister Hua locked the door

416
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,120
She won't let us leave

417
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,320
Is Sister Hua planning to fight us all alone?

418
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,480
One against ten

419
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,520
You scared me "to death"

420
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,160
You all have a certain

421
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,840
way of making me uncomfortable

422
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,320
What's wrong with us?

423
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
I feel like I'm being

424
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,720
interrogated by you

425
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,960
The interrogation hasn't even started yet

426
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,920
and you're already uncomfortable?

427
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,800
It hasn't even begun

428
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,119
I feel nervous

429
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,960
No need

430
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,720
Relax

431
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,119
Come on

432
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,839
Just relax

433
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,599
Sit down first

434
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,119
Relax

435
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,839
First, calm down

436
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,800
Relax

437
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,040
Now that's much better

438
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,160
Sitting here alone

439
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,079
Yes

440
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,160
This is the first time in my life

441
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,079
I've been questioned

442
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,920
It's okay

443
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,760
I'll stay with you

444
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,480
Come on

445
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,920
Let's sit on the sofa

446
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,000
Aren't you leaving?

447
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,080
I won't leave, I have to stay with you

448
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,280
Then we'll play off each other

449
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,240
Let's ask Sister Hua

450
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,880
Come on, Sister Hua

451
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,120
First I'd like to ask you, Sister Hua

452
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,560
From that room

453
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,240
Later

454
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,400
Let's quiet down a bit

455
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
After we listen together

456
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
Understood

457
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,200
Alright, 3-2-1, ask now

458
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,000
Quick, you guys start

459
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,320
Come on

460
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,200
So nervous

461
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,640
Don't be nervous, I'm with you

462
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,600
This was found in your room

463
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,320
a photo we found

464
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,640
In my room?

465
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,320
Yes, in your

466
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,840
spittoon

467
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,200
inside the spittoon

468
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,840
Does it look familiar?

469
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,800
Do you remember?

470
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,240
These are words you wrote

471
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,760
I was really angry at that time.

472
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,040
Why?

473
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,640
I felt they were

474
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,240
trying to ruin my beautiful dream.

475
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,960
What do you mean?

476
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,440
What I wrote was

477
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,120
What is this?

478
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,120
You two who betrayed the boss

479
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,880
Traitors!

480
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,440
Traitors!

481
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,680
I want to stay here forever with my soulmate Zengzeng

482
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,920
stay here forever

483
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,720
Because I don't want to go back

484
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,800
At that time

485
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,520
Do you know what happened?

486
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,160
What?

487
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,520
It was around 10pm

488
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,720
when I happened to pass by Xiao Wang's store

489
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,240
I heard inside

490
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,120
Little Xiao Wang

491
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,160
and Old Wang (Xiao Wang) talking

492
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
"We must expose

493
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,760
the truth of Chuyang Lane"

494
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,120
"Destroy this place"

495
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,280
And they said

496
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,600
"we must reveal

497
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,160
the boss's true face"

498
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,280
"Dig it out"

499
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,600
Little Xiao Wang and Old Wang (Xiao Wang)

500
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,600
I thought this won't do

501
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,880
We worked so hard to come here

502
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,480
Just right

503
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,440
We have our happy life

504
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,400
Here I've

505
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,880
found my soulmate Zengzeng

506
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,720
We have this wonderful dance hall

507
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,760
where we sisters can

508
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,280
dance together

509
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,960
and live so happily

510
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,520
Of course

511
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,480
there's also our

512
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,240
Zengzeng's

513
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,480
wish

514
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,400
Said it three times

515
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,880
Wish

516
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,840
Wish? What wish does he have?

517
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,800
Wish

518
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,520
Yes

519
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,680
What is Zengzeng's wish?

520
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,720
I'm embarrassed to say his wish

521
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,200
Because I'm also his confidant

522
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,800
Eat oranges

523
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,560
My wish is for your happiness

524
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,800
I'll stay with you till we grow old

525
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,960
He knows I don't want to leave

526
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,640
So he also wants to stay
with me

527
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,600
and remain here forever

528
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,080
Accommodating you

529
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,680
Because I truly don't want

530
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,960
to return to real life

531
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,240
Because you think

532
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,880
The children at home have all grown up

533
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,280
They don't communicate with you

534
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,560
They just play with their own

535
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,440
electronic devices

536
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,280
We really don't understand

537
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,680
and can't figure it out

538
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,960
So living becomes

539
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,080
not even having someone to talk to

540
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,880
You feel that coming here

541
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,680
there are people who can accompany you, right?

542
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,120
Yes

543
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,080
Companionship is needed

544
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,720
It's just that

545
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,160
It brings me back to my youth

546
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,040
In 1988

547
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,680
I was twenty-one years old

548
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,520
I was practically

549
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,200
the nightingale of our alley

550
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,920
Wait, no

551
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,520
Not that

552
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,800
Wait a moment

553
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,440
No, I was more beautiful than flowers

554
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,640
I'm more beautiful than flowers

555
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,400
And my singing is sweeter than flowers

556
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,640
I was like a lark

557
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,200
So sweet

558
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,360
Back in those days

559
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,480
I was the beauty

560
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,440
of our entire alley

561
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,000
The fashion icon

562
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,040
Still am

563
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,960
Always have been

564
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,880
That vibrant lifestyle

565
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,480
Listening to disco

566
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,560
You know, wearing bell-bottoms

567
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,400
With big permed curls

568
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,760
Big waves

569
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,080
Big waves

570
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,960
That Beijing style

571
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,440
Big waves

572
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,000
So whenever I remember my youth

573
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,040
I just

574
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,360
Get flooded with memories

575
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,920
Then a few years passed

576
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,600
I got older

577
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,240
Under my parents' pressure

578
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,800
They arranged a match for me

579
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,880
And so I got married

580
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,120
Married

581
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,680
Yes

582
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,640
From that point on

583
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,600
I gradually became

584
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,520
A full-fledged housewife

585
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,000
Raising children

586
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,720
Serving my husband

587
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,440
Made many sacrifices

588
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,240
Though my husband treated me well

589
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,320
But

590
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,080
We had little in common

591
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,400
Just lived an ordinary

592
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,920
Plain life

593
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,200
Until now

594
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,400
My husband has passed away

595
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,840
Children have grown up

596
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,360
Married with their own families

597
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,080
Don't communicate much with me

598
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,960
So I'm all alone

599
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,760
Living unhappily

600
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,360
That's why I don't want to go back

601
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,480
You know this isn't 1988 anymore

602
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,360
I know

603
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,240
it's fake

604
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,640
But I feel this dream

605
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,400
has been so good that I don't want to wake up

606
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,080
Okay

607
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
So you "killed"

608
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,680
Xiaoxiao Wang and Old Wang (Little Wang)

609
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,320
I didn't

610
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,080
So my main point is

611
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,000
I wanted to stop them

612
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,240
Two days ago

613
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,720
while they were away

614
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,320
I took a

615
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,880
stinky dance shoe

616
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,080
and a broken wig

617
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,440
Intimidate him

618
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,360
How could you open someone else's cabinet?

619
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,640
The cabinet was open

620
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,200
It was open

621
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,160
Then you went and locked it

622
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,880
I entered the room

623
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,960
I saw no one was there

624
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,520
I wondered where to put this

625
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,320
There was a cabinet nearby

626
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,000
When I opened it

627
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,360
There was another cabinet inside

628
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,240
It wasn't locked so I put the things inside

629
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,320
I didn't lock it either

630
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,760
You didn't lock it too

631
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,480
Not locked

632
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,400
Just closed

633
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,160
Then I left

634
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,520
We saw the threatening letter you wrote

635
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,360
This one

636
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,080
Yes, exactly this one

637
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,440
Didn't you see this paper at the time?

638
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,000
No

639
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,600
At that time it was just this paper

640
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,800
Nothing behind it

641
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,320
Just this

642
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,920
Does that mean she opened that box?

643
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,640
She did open the box

644
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,120
So she might have seen that paper

645
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,040
But that box was already open

646
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,680
If you were the "murderer"

647
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,920
You could be lying, so...

648
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,240
Because at that time

649
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,120
I couldn't think of a better way

650
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,640
First, give them a warning

651
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,600
to stop them from doing this

652
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,440
There's a question

653
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,560
You said who's your boss?

654
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,280
My boss

655
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,080
Is the one written on this paper

656
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,040
Isn't it written on the paper?

657
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,200
You two have betrayed the boss

658
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
What are you talking about?

659
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,440
I spent over 90,000 to come here

660
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,840
Then spent more money to take over this place

661
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,280
Doesn't that make me the boss here?

662
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,080
There's another boss

663
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,440
Yes

664
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,800
The boss of the entire block

665
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,160
The boss of the entire Chuyang Alley

666
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,040
Right

667
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,320
This boss is the one who funded

668
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,720
the construction of Chuyang Alley

669
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,160
The one behind

670
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,640
A good person

671
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,000
Actually you don't know him either, do you?

672
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,480
No, I don't

673
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,880
I think she misunderstood

674
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,320
Yes, actually this boss is

675
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,040
Old Wang (Little Wang)

676
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,360
Right

677
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,080
Did you know?

678
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,880
Old Wang (Little Wang) isn't

679
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,200
the boss of Little Wang's shop?

680
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,520
Yes, because that night

681
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,920
Probably Little Little Wang and Old Li were chatting

682
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,080
Then Sister Hua passed by

683
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,960
Heard them talking about making this place disappear

684
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,160
About "killing" the boss

685
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,800
She thought there was another boss

686
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,680
But what she heard that day

687
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,880
probably wasn't Old Wang's (or Xiao Wang's) voice

688
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,240
Sister Hua

689
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,120
Do you know that in 1988 at Chuyang Lane

690
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,120
there was a murder case?

691
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,520
And two people "died"

692
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,480
I didn't know about that

693
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,360
So this afternoon, what were you all

694
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,880
doing approximately?

695
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,280
The two of us were here

696
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,720
tidying up and decorating

697
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,640
Then we opened at 4:40

698
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,920
Announcement

699
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,160
The 2nd Chuyang Lane

700
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,480
Karaoke Party

701
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,000
is about to begin

702
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,400
All neighbors

703
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,600
please gather in the dance hall

704
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,680
Didn't you all come in to watch?

705
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,080
We sang together

706
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,400
"Winter Fire"

707
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,240
This is related to that case

708
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,680
Why are you still here?

709
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,560
Why are you still here?

710
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,920
What's wrong now?

711
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,680
Uh...

712
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,920
It seems there's a fire

713
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,640
How did it catch fire again?

714
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,920
Is there another fire?

715
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,760
Yes, Sister Cai told me about it

716
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,520
Then let's hurry and leave

717
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,600
Here, take this towel

718
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,200
How did it catch fire again?

719
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,080
Another fire

720
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,320
Yes, I just evacuated the elderly

721
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,320
when I was evacuating them

722
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,480
I discovered the fire

723
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
How did it catch fire again?

724
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,200
Run, brothers!

725
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,640
Come on

726
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,280
Get down

727
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Get down

728
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,160
Come

729
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,840
Yes, get down

730
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,560
Quick

731
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,200
This way

732
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,160
Go this way

733
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:40,920
Here

734
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,760
Go

735
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,520
Move

736
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,920
Hurry

737
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,160
Is everyone here?

738
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,040
All present

739
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,440
You guys go wait at that restaurant

740
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,720
Then I'll take the boss and madam

741
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,640
to the infirmary first

742
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,600
I'm really so grateful to all of you just now.

743
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,200
We actually caught

744
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,760
a criminal gang in our apartment.

745
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,120
And thanks to Sister Cai,

746
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,760
Xiao He,

747
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,120
I went to a photo studio.

748
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,400
They told me that by spending some money -

749
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,480
100,000 yuan -

750
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,280
they could send me back to 1988.

751
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,320
How could he use such an excuse

752
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,200
to deceive you all?

753
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,480
How would I know?

754
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,640
I'll immediately

755
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,880
report this to the relevant authorities for handling.

756
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,760
Then I quickly found some people

757
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,880
to look for you.

758
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,680
While searching for you,

759
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,240
I actually ran into a group of strong men

760
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,520
at that Dakaijie Street.

761
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,280
It was really...

762
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,600
When they failed to catch you,

763
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,120
they thought their scheme would be exposed.

764
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,720
The scheme has already been exposed.

765
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,120
Let's just burn this place down

766
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,880
to destroy the evidence.

767
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
So they set Chuyang Alley on fire

768
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,880
to destroy evidence and escape.

769
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,720
Follow them!

770
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,400
Hurry up!

771
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,720
Catch them!

772
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,240
We've already sent people

773
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,080
to keep watch on them.

774
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,280
Then I also discovered

775
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,520
they had nailed wooden boards

776
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,120
over all the exits to block them.

777
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,680
So I quickly removed these boards.

778
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,640
Rushed in

779
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,160
And then found this

780
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,000
This place that Sister Cai mentioned

781
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,960
Chuyang Alley

782
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,280
Then I discovered a group of

783
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,200
elderly people trapped here

784
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,920
So I quickly evacuated them first

785
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,160
Now the fire over there

786
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,040
has been brought under control

787
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,880
Good, excellent

788
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,200
As for today's case

789
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,840
we still need to investigate

790
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,160
who exactly is the "culprit"

791
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,880
Then I'll share everyone's findings

792
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,920
with the relevant departments

793
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,440
I'll go attend to my duties now

794
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,160
Go ahead with your work

795
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,360
Okay

796
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,560
We already agreed among ourselves

797
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,800
not to invite each other out anymore

798
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,360
See? We go to an escape room and something happens

799
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,400
Go see a play and something happens

800
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,840
Right, and we have to take him to meet relatives

801
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,280
Seriously

802
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,360
Yes, accompany him to meet relatives

803
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,880
Then go to his place to play - play what?

804
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,800
I hope next week

805
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,440
you won't call us out, okay?

806
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,200
If you call us next week

807
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,760
we definitely won't come

808
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,560
Don't call us next week

809
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
We certainly won't come

810
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,480
You guys

811
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,360
are really unfriendly

812
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,080
Why bully me, a girl?

813
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,480
You bullied us first

814
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,600
Getting back to the main point,

815
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,680
When we started today,

816
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,480
we were in the restaurant,

817
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
in the middle of making chocolate,

818
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,120
when we suddenly received a strange message.

819
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,160
It alerted us

820
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,840
that in 1988,

821
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,040
there was a "murder" case in Chuyang Alley,

822
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,920
and it would happen again.

823
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,680
Then it directed us

824
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,440
to go to Youth Photo Studio.

825
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,200
After going there,

826
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,360
we felt like we had "time traveled,"

827
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,720
but actually it was

828
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,280
an illusion.

829
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,760
Right.

830
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,440
However,

831
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,240
around July 2, 1988,

832
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
the case truly reoccurred.

833
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,600
A fire broke out,

834
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,200
and people inside had "died."

835
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,760
The victim was crushed.

836
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,840
In 1998, it was Old Cang and Old Ku,

837
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,120
while today's victims are

838
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,040
Old Wang (or Young Wang) and Little Wang.

839
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,120
Little Wang,

840
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,120
who was seriously ill,

841
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,160
after coming to his senses,

842
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,360
decided to use the same method from back then

843
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,480
to "kill" this Old Wang (or Young Wang)

844
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,760
and clear Old Li's name,

845
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,160
while also exposing

846
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,960
the deception in Chuyang Alley.

847
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,600
But through our own investigation,

848
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,840
we discovered something:

849
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,240
Old Li and Little Wang

850
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,120
had agreed to strike the temple,

851
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,560
but we found

852
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,160
the "corpse" was hit on the back of the head.

853
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,720
So this might be

854
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,080
one of the biggest inconsistencies.

855
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,640
<summaryThe speaker recounts receiving a mysterious message about a 1988 murder case in Chuyang Alley that would reoccur, leading them to investigate and uncover a complex deception involving multiple victims across different time periods.

856
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,200
Moreover, we also discovered

857
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,160
Xiaoxiao Wang's cabinet had been opened by someone

858
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,640
Yes, it was pried open

859
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,200
Someone must have seen this plan

860
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,640
After learning about this plan

861
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,920
they took advantage of it

862
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,520
to "kill off" Xiaoxiao Wang and Old Wang (Xiao Wang)

863
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,400
<summaryCharacters discuss discovering that someone had accessed Xiaoxiao Wang's cabinet and used the information to frame both Xiaoxiao Wang and Old Wang.

864
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,240
At present,

865
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,480
the suspects in this case

866
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,640
The first one is,

867
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,360
Zeng Shunxi, no, Old Man Zeng.

868
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,880
Zeng Shunxi.

869
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,080
And the second one is?

870
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,680
Sister Hua.

871
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,360
Sister Hua, right?

872
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,760
The third is Old Man Li.

873
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,160
who is Zhou Keke's

874
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,880
biological father.

875
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,720
The fourth is Zhou Keke himself.

876
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,000
Zhou Keke is Bai Sanwan's uncle.

877
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,800
The fifth one is today's

878
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,960
Sister Cai.

879
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,200
who is Bai Sanwan's mother.

880
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,960
Grandma.

881
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,280
Speaking of "murder" motives,

882
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,240
they all have them.

883
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,240
No,

884
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,800
wait a minute.

885
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,280
The suspect must simultaneously have

886
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,040
a "murder" motive against two people.

887
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,760
Sister Cai

888
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,600
doesn't have that strong of a

889
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,720
"murder" motive

890
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,440
against (Xiaoxiao) Wang.

891
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,240
Exactly.

892
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,360
I think so too.

893
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,960
Because she was just deceived,

894
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,240
I wouldn't want to "kill" you

895
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,160
just because you deceived me.

896
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,600
She wants to clear her husband's name.

897
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,560
To reconstruct the crime scene where two people "died,"

898
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,880
doesn't that mean two people had to "die"?

899
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
Next

900
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,480
What was Zhou's motive?

901
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
"Killing" his mother

902
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,720
Both of them were there

903
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,480
Old Wang (Little Wang) and Little Little Wang

904
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,720
They were both watching from the mountain

905
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,680
Right

906
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,480
But I didn't even know

907
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,080
who the other person was

908
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,240
You only knew about Little Little Wang

909
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,720
Yes

910
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,120
Someone gave me a photo

911
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,400
of the place where my mother "died"

912
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
There were two people

913
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,560
But I could only see

914
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,440
that in the photo there was a person

915
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,680
with a black mole on their neck

916
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,320
and another one missing a finger

917
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,960
That one I don't know

918
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,080
Why is the hand so obvious

919
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,480
You just didn't see it

920
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,000
If he says he didn't see it, then he didn't see it

921
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,200
The "killer" is starting to lie

922
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,000
Of course, the "killer" would lie

923
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,080
There's one problem—I had no idea

924
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,200
about this place called Chuyang Alley

925
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,360
You have a tracker

926
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,480
How could you not know?

927
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,840
You do know this place

928
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,440
But you've never been there, that's possible

929
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,520
You say you don't know

930
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,440
I don't know

931
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,840
Look, on the 25th

932
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,440
I discovered Xiao Xiaowang, right?

933
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,720
Found that black mole

934
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,440
On the 26th I secretly followed him

935
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,120
Entered his home

936
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,800
And then planted a tracker

937
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,840
But while I was tracking him

938
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,440
On the 27th I found it stopped moving

939
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,920
And all these things happened

940
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,560
On July 1st and July 2nd

941
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,640
Moreover, I had no idea

942
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,440
what kind of place

943
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,520
Youth Photo Studio was

944
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,240
Then why did you let Sister Cai

945
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,000
Because I saw

946
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,280
It said it was a place that could make elderly people

947
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
happy

948
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,120
So I saw that

949
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,440
Recently Sister Cai was very unhappy

950
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,000
So I gave her this flyer

951
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,080
Alright, Sister Hua

952
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,640
The "motive for murder" isn't that strong

953
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,840
Actually, it's very strong

954
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,080
Why?

955
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,720
Her dream is about to be destroyed

956
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,640
But now I have a question

957
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,480
Sister Hua said when she arrived

958
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,200
The box was completely unlocked

959
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,600
The box was open

960
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,440
How could it possibly be completely unlocked?

961
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,600
Even if this person could

962
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,920
Pry open the lock

963
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,200
Alright, after looking through these things

964
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,400
He would definitely have to relock it

965
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
He couldn't just leave it

966
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,200
Yes, if I were

967
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,480
If I had the awareness to lock it

968
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,680
I wouldn't leave it unlocked

969
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,280
This is unlikely - she's lying

970
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,040
So

971
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,600
Sister Hua

972
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,040
Can't be ruled out now, right?

973
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,200
Right, can't be ruled out

974
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,840
Alright

975
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,480
This Old Man Li

976
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,800
Must have known about the plan

977
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,240
Right

978
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,600
Old Man Li had no need to "kill"

979
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,120
Because he knew that person was going to "die"

980
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,840
Was going to "commit suicide"

981
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,200
He had no reason, absolutely no reason

982
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,480
Thinking this way, Brother Zeng is highly suspicious.

983
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,880
Brother Zeng is very suspicious.

984
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,720
Brother Zeng currently...

985
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,840
I think he's the most suspicious.

986
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,400
What's Brother Zeng's motive?

987
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,000
He investigated these two for "killing" his sister.

988
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,360
And to avenge his father.

989
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,240
I have one question.

990
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,040
How did the killer know

991
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,960
about the murder plan?

992
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,320
Did he open the box

993
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,960
and learn the plan's procedure?

994
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,760
He knew all the methods.

995
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,880
About the "time of death" -

996
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,040
there was a note.

997
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,440
Xiao Xiao Wang didn't make an appointment with him,

998
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,720
but with Old Wang (Xiao Wang).

999
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,440
At 3:30 PM

1000
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,960
meeting at the warehouse entrance.

1001
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,000
The arson worked like this:

1002
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,160
The bottom note stated

1003
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,280
one bundle of firecrackers burns for five minutes,

1004
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,080
but there were two bundles,

1005
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,200
so ten minutes total.

1006
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,960
The killer probably

1007
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,080
around 4:50

1008
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,920
lit the fuse,

1009
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,200
and the fire started at 5:00.

1010
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,520
Right.

1011
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,040
At 5:00,

1012
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,320
the fire broke out.

1013
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,640
I rushed to put it out.

1014
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,080
That's the logic.

1015
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,800
Only during this time

1016
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,960
Old Li couldn't have been there,

1017
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,440
because remember

1018
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,560
when we checked the surveillance?

1019
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,400
It showed six

1020
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,920
unidentified intruders.

1021
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,640
This is the monitoring room -

1022
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,800
detected six unregistered intruders.

1023
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,120
That was us six.

1024
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,920
Yes, us six.

1025
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,000
So he wasn't among them.

1026
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,520
Meaning during the crime,

1027
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,880
Old Li wasn't in that area.

1028
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,679
So through timing

1029
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,080
we can eliminate him.

1030
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,400
Is Sister Cai possible?

1031
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,440
Not very likely.

1032
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,320
Does Sister Cai fit this timeline?

1033
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,920
She's been locked inside the whole time.

1034
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,800
He might have locked us up first,

1035
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,639
then that big guy locked up Sister Cai.

1036
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,600
Yesterday we waited until 6 PM,

1037
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,719
after they locked us up,

1038
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,280
then they

1039
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,239
locked Sister Cai up.

1040
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:34,960
They locked Sister Cai up.

1041
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,239
They could have locked Sister Cai up

1042
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,480
before locking us up.

1043
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,800
That's possible.

1044
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,040
Both scenarios are possible.

1045
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,400
But when we entered the dance hall,

1046
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,560
Zhou Keke didn't come in.

1047
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,840
He only came in after Zengzeng and Sister Hua had already entered

1048
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,239
and the singing had started.

1049
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,400
You're suspicious.

1050
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:54,880
That's me.

1051
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,120
After all of you went inside,

1052
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,200
I looked around outside.

1053
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,480
Because I was looking for Sister Cai.

1054
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,720
Later I even went out with you,

1055
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,040
and gathered a group of people.

1056
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,840
No.

1057
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,520
No.

1058
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

1059
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,120
You're pretending.

1060
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,160
You're family now,

1061
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,480
you can't turn against each other.

1062
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,160
"Killer" Zhou Keke.

1063
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,320
Why are you so speechless?

1064
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,320
Nephew.

1065
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,560
I just remembered,

1066
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,040
I was eating stinky tofu at the entrance

1067
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,240
when suddenly he came over

1068
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,960
returning from outside

1069
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,320
and told me:

1070
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,400
"Look, there are two people outside who haven't come in."

1071
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,520
"Let's call them in."

1072
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,600
"Let them join the fun, okay?"

1073
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,080
"Come in and dance together."

1074
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,400
"Want to come in and dance together, sir?"

1075
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,160
"You go ahead first."

1076
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,000
Was it wrong for me to be polite?

1077
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,360
"Killing" is your problem.

1078
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,080
That's a bit far-fetched.

1079
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,120
Let's vote.

1080
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,120
We saw Zengzeng first.

1081
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,640
Don't cry.

1082
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,520
Then,

1083
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,800
I just looked around

1084
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,520
to see if Sister Cai was there.

1085
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,720
When she wasn't, I went inside.

1086
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,560
Inside, I noticed

1087
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,360
there were still two people outside.

1088
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,240
So I told Bai Sanwan:

1089
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,640
"This person's using the 'self-injury scheme'."

1090
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,880
"Should we call them

1091
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,160
to come dance with us?"

1092
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,000
The important thing is,

1093
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,960
before I went out,

1094
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,160
what were you doing outside alone?

1095
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,400
Just took a quick look at the door

1096
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,800
Lit a cigarette

1097
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,240
No

1098
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,520
He was outside for quite a while

1099
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,320
Is five seconds a long time in your life?

1100
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,440
Those were the longest five seconds of my life

1101
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,920
I just took a look and went back in

1102
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,280
Alright, I'll believe you for now

1103
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,080
Let's check on others first

1104
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,160
Zengzeng and Huahua

1105
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
According to Zengzeng

1106
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,080
He opened the door at 4:40

1107
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,040
Then we opened the door at 4:40

1108
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,200
Wait a minute

1109
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,320
Did you see Zengzeng outside

1110
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,200
Or did you see him after he opened the door?

1111
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,280
He came out through the door

1112
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,600
Announcement

1113
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,880
The 2nd Chuyang Lane

1114
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,120
Karaoke Party

1115
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,680
Will begin shortly

1116
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,640
Madam over there, come here

1117
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,240
And that uncle

1118
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,840
When we first entered, we were with those

1119
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,360
elderly people dancing together

1120
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,680
but those two weren't there

1121
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,320
Come on

1122
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,440
This is my first time coming to this apartment

1123
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,520
and such a bizarre case occurred

1124
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,040
The "victims" are

1125
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,880
Old Wang (Little Wang) and Xiao Xiao Wang

1126
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,760
The perpetrator used

1127
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,800
a rather ingenious method

1128
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,400
He created a very solid

1129
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,040
alibi

1130
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,480
The "killer" is likely

1131
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,920
Old Man Zeng

1132
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,120
How could you not know him?

1133
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,720
He lives right next to you

1134
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,600
The suspect

1135
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,240
must have motives against both

1136
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,160
individuals to "kill" them

1137
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,360
Now I finally understand why Miaomiao

1138
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,120
only hugs Zhou Keke and Bai Sanwan

1139
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,760
I never expected he'd actually be my grandfather

1140
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,280
Zhou Keke's father

1141
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,600
And this Zhou Keke is also my uncle

1142
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,840
Who would've thought

1143
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,320
I'd have such a grown-up nephew

1144
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,160
But there's one thing I'm still curious about

1145
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,880
Little Wang

1146
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,000
why he also has that prophecy doll

1147
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,560
The person who gave these prophecy dolls

1148
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,920
who could they really be?

1149
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,040
Among our five cases

1150
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,120
the last four all had them

1151
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,640
only the first Zhenzhen case didn't

1152
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,480
Don't you think that's strange?

1153
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,560
So far we've seen four dolls in total

1154
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,360
But do you all remember

1155
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,680
Deputy Manager Fu's doll

1156
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,400
and the truth about his "death"

1157
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,480
are actually different matters?

1158
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,720
Could it be that the person who sent the doll

1159
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,240
only knew superficial details about the case?

1160
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,560
Zhou Biaobiao

1161
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
By the way, Guo Baoyou

1162
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,840
did you ask your dad why he took action?

1163
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,240
I heard from Kudi

1164
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,760
that he clearly had no "murder" motive

1165
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,720
but still acted anyway

1166
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,520
Why?

1167
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,880
Don't look at me

1168
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,760
I think your brother voted for my dad

1169
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,320
I think this matter

1170
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,280
is quite strange too

1171
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,760
Ju Yangsheng

1172
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,840
There's basically no evidence, right?

1173
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,760
And no motive either

1174
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,720
In that case

1175
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,280
when you get the chance

1176
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,760
I'll introduce you to my dad

1177
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
You can ask him yourself

1178
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,320
By the way

1179
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,520
you could also ask him

1180
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,240
about your dad's

1181
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,080
"suicide" intervention team

1182
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,360
Because I remember

1183
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,840
today my dad mentioned

1184
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,480
there was someone very important to him

1185
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,840
who "committed suicide" by jumping off a building

1186
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,280
But I remember

1187
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,720
Zhou's mom "died" from falling off a cliff

1188
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,240
So there are other important people to him

1189
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,920
Xiaoxiao Wang is also using that symbolic gas

1190
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,440
Forget it

1191
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,920
Stop overthinking and go get your beauty sleep

1192
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,720
I'm tired

1193
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Welcome everyone

1194
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,560
to Tencent Video

1195
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,760
Sponsored by the delightful blend

1196
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,040
of tea fragrance and fruit pieces

1197
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,760
Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Tea

1198
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,200
exclusively presenting

1199
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,480
the immersive mystery reality show

1200
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,200
"Let's Begin Deduction"

1201
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,280
This

1202
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,160
is the case review hall

1203
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,360
Come on

1204
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,040
The moment of revelation

1205
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,120
Did we all vote the same today

1206
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,320
or did someone vote differently?

1207
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,760
Right

1208
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,800
Someone definitely voted differently

1209
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,400
He must have voted for Old Man Zeng

1210
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,600
I voted for Old Man Zeng

1211
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,160
Let's go

1212
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,440
The delightful blend

1213
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,480
of tea and fruit pieces

1214
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,360
Congratulations to us all

1215
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,920
for completing this deduction challenge

1216
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,200
Let's raise our glasses

1217
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,320
of the delicious Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Tea

1218
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,960
new flavor

1219
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,880
Let's toast together

1220
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,160
and reveal the truth

1221
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,000
Cheers!

1222
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,400
Next,

1223
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,280
we will reveal the truth of this case.

1224
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,200
In today's case,

1225
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,480
the suspects identified by all players are:

1226
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,520
Sister Cai,

1227
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,720
Grandpa Li,

1228
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:25,880
Grandpa Li,

1229
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,680
Grandpa Zeng,

1230
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,680
Sister Hua,

1231
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,600
Zhou Keke.

1232
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,120
After investigation and deduction,

1233
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,160
the "culprit" voted by everyone is:

1234
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,960
Uncle Zeng

1235
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,080
He received a total of six votes

1236
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,400
Trustworthy

1237
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,360
Put our bond to the test

1238
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,680
We might all fail completely

1239
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,400
Why are you applauding?

1240
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,200
You guys are really...

1241
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,040
But at least our spirit

1242
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,120
is united in purpose

1243
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,040
We're equally unskilled together

1244
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,320
It's okay

1245
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,520
Will you win together

1246
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,920
or

1247
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,720
fail completely?

1248
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,200
This episode's case

1249
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,560
Everyone

1250
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,720
voted successfully

1251
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,560
to bring the "killer" to justice

1252
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,240
to justice

1253
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,400
Did we miss any

1254
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,720
crucial evidence?

1255
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,320
In today's deduction and investigation

1256
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,880
everyone found all the evidence

1257
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,400
In the end, we were still hesitating between Sister Cai

1258
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,280
or (Old Man Zeng)

1259
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,960
I feel like

1260
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,000
the production team was being considerate of us

1261
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,120
maybe we drank too much Zhenguoli Hongyou Sijichun tea

1262
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,200
and our IQ improved

1263
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,240
Everyone can use logic

1264
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,600
to eliminate other suspects

1265
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,840
If Zhou Keke was the perpetrator

1266
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,480
he could have bought

1267
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,960
a 10-minute fuse outside Chuyang Alley

1268
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,200
There was no need to use

1269
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,440
the two fuses found at the scene and splice them

1270
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,120
Old Man Li didn't enter Chuyang Alley today

1271
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,320
Sister Hua

1272
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,240
discovered someone wanted to

1273
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,960
"kill" the boss in the warehouse

1274
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,560
She could have waited outside the warehouse

1275
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
for the boss

1276
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,000
and warned him about the impending danger

1277
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,640
No need to "kill" for this reason

1278
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,800
She could have just told him

1279
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,480
Right

1280
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,560
If Sister Cai saw the crime plan

1281
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,360
Since she perfectly preserved

1282
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,120
Old Man Li's guard diary

1283
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,400
she's very familiar with his handwriting

1284
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,160
So upon recognizing the planner

1285
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,640
was Old Man Li

1286
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,440
she wouldn't

1287
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,920
use this plan to "kill"

1288
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,560
But actually we didn't consider

1289
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,240
the handwriting aspect that deeply

1290
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,400
Just Sister Cai

1291
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,640
if she knew it was her husband then...

1292
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,840
Okay, sorry, let's continue

1293
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,120
After eliminating these four people

1294
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,360
we can identify

1295
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,880
the only "real culprit"

1296
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,040
Old Man Zeng

1297
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,160
Chuyang Alley was created by Old Wang (or Little Wang) as a money-making scheme

1298
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,320
to replicate a 1988-style street.

1299
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,280
Elderly people pay money

1300
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,520
to experience "time travel"

1301
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,800
and "return to 1988" in Chuyang Alley.

1302
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,760
Elders entering Chuyang Alley

1303
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,320
are prohibited from bringing electronic devices

1304
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,600
and can only use cash.

1305
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,360
More and more elderly visitors

1306
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,080
come attracted by its reputation.

1307
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,600
Among them is

1308
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,880
Uncle Zeng, now in his fifties.

1309
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,560
Uncle Zeng has been carrying the pain

1310
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,200
of his family members passing away one after another.

1311
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,520
His father and uncles Zhou Cangcang and Zhou Kuku

1312
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,880
died under suspicious circumstances.

1313
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,200
His sister Auntie Zhou was then

1314
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,440
pushed off a cliff

1315
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,880
by two distinctive-looking men

1316
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,680
while investigating their "deaths."

1317
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,200
This incident has haunted him ever since.

1318
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,720
During his search for the "real culprits,"

1319
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,480
Uncle Zeng met

1320
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,120
his confidante, Sister Hua.

1321
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,000
Sister Hua persuaded Uncle Zeng

1322
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,600
to join this

1323
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,520
"time travel to 1988" project.

1324
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,080
After paying a large sum of money,

1325
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,040
they successfully "returned to 1988."

1326
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,600
Though life there was happy and simple,

1327
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,520
Uncle Zeng noticed

1328
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,360
that in the "1988" version of Chuyang Alley,

1329
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,160
his father and uncles were absent,

1330
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,640
exposing the "time travel" as a lie.

1331
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,800
But to fulfill Sister Hua's wish,

1332
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,960
he stayed without mentioning it.

1333
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,040
Ten days ago

1334
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,120
June 22nd

1335
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,960
Old Man Zeng was at Xiao Wang's Store

1336
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,840
where he encountered a man who claimed

1337
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,040
to be the owner, Lao Wang (Xiao Wang)

1338
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,680
His left hand was missing a middle finger

1339
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,520
This reminded him

1340
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,200
of the two men who pushed Auntie Zhou

1341
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,040
off the cliff years ago

1342
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,600
One of them also lacked a middle finger on his left hand

1343
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,000
Then he noticed

1344
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,720
the usually overlooked

1345
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,360
store clerk, Xiao Xiao Wang

1346
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,400
who had a large mole on his neck

1347
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,280
matching the other man's description

1348
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,640
This confirmed to him that Lao Wang (Xiao Wang) and Xiao Xiao Wang

1349
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,760
were the "culprits" who pushed

1350
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,600
Auntie Zhou off the cliff

1351
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,560
But he wasn’t sure if these two

1352
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,480
also "killed"

1353
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,920
his father and uncle

1354
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,960
So he decided to take advantage when the store was empty

1355
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,440
to sneak in and investigate Lao Wang (Xiao Wang) and Xiao Xiao Wang

1356
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,320
Two days ago

1357
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,680
June 30th

1358
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,000
He found his opportunity

1359
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,960
After sneaking into the store

1360
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,760
he saw in Xiaoxiao Wang's special cabinet

1361
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,400
a locked box

1362
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,280
He found a wire and picked the lock

1363
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,480
Inside was a bundle of knockout smoke

1364
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,800
and several bottles of gasoline

1365
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,840
along with a detailed plan

1366
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,080
This confirmed to Old Man Zeng

1367
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,360
that Xiaoxiao Wang and Old Wang

1368
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,080
were indeed the "murderers" of his father and uncle

1369
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,880
Otherwise

1370
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,560
they wouldn't have

1371
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,440
the complete crime plan from 1988

1372
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,360
(already translated in previous line)

1373
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,040
nor plans to jointly "murder"

1374
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,600
the elder sister investigating this matter

1375
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,880
with methods to "kill" someone outside

1376
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,840
even when both doors are locked

1377
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,600
Old Man Zeng stole

1378
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,280
a smoke bomb and a bottle of gasoline

1379
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:50,920
planning to use

1380
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,960
the same "murder" plan that killed father and uncle

1381
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,640
to "kill" Old Wang (Little Wang) and Little Wang

1382
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,920
He searched in Chuyang Alley

1383
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,360
looking for

1384
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,120
tools to execute this plan

1385
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,200
In the back alley, he found

1386
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,480
a blue inflatable mattress

1387
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,720
July 1st

1388
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,640
Taking advantage of warehouse repainting

1389
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,680
when access was unrestricted

1390
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,760
he sneaked into the warehouse

1391
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,400
to set up the inflatable mattress in advance

1392
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,760
Unexpectedly, under the sheets

1393
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,560
there was already a blue mattress placed

1394
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,400
Old Man Zeng folded

1395
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,000
the mattress he found

1396
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,440
and hid it back in the alley

1397
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,920
On the day of the incident

1398
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,720
July 2nd

1399
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,360
Old Man Zeng kept trying

1400
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,040
to find an opportunity

1401
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,280
to lure Old Wang and Little Wang to the warehouse

1402
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,440
In the store

1403
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,680
he accidentally saw the note Old Wang received

1404
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,080
and discovered Little Wang and Old Wang

1405
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,960
would go to the warehouse at 3:30 pm

1406
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,680
This was exactly

1407
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,680
the perfect time to execute the "murder" plan

1408
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,040
So Old Man Zeng prepared

1409
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,640
an alarm clock set for 3:30

1410
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,960
planning to act in the afternoon

1411
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,200
3:00 pm

1412
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:36,640
3:00 pm

1413
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,360
Old Man Zeng came to the alley early

1414
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,440
Old Man Zeng came to the alley early

1415
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,080
used wooden crates to make a ladder

1416
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,040
climbed near the transom window

1417
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,880
threw the alarm clock against the wall inside

1418
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,760
then waited for Old Wang and Little Wang to arrive

1419
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,560
At 3:30, Old Wang (Little Wang) and Little Wang

1420
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,440
arrived at the warehouse.

1421
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,200
Under Little Wang's guidance,

1422
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,560
Old Wang (Little Wang) locked the courtyard gate

1423
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,400
and the warehouse door.

1424
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,520
Just then, the alarm clock rang.

1425
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,160
Little Wang and Old Wang (Little Wang) went to the bed and peered

1426
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,800
into the deepest part of the bed.

1427
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,480
Old Zeng quickly lit knockout smoke and rendered them unconscious.

1428
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,560
As expected,

1429
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,040
the two immediately fell face down

1430
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,600
onto the mattress, knocked out.

1431
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,520
Then Old Zeng took the air pump

1432
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,400
from the inflatable arch near the warehouse.

1433
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,200
Using the thin wire he had prepared yesterday

1434
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,440
connected to the mattress's air valve,

1435
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,920
he pulled up the special air mattress's valve

1436
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,000
and connected it to the air pump.

1437
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,440
After about twenty minutes,

1438
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,480
at 4 PM,

1439
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,720
when the air mattress was fully inflated,

1440
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,040
their heads reached the vent position.

1441
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,760
Old Zeng picked up a brick

1442
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,800
and struck the back of their heads,

1443
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,520
"killing" them.

1444
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,760
Then Old Zeng threw the brick into the warehouse,

1445
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,040
returned the air pump near the inflatable arch,

1446
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,640
poured gasoline inside,

1447
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,920
and threw in the gasoline bottle too.

1448
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,040
He then reconnected the fuse

1449
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,640
from two bundles of firecrackers he bought earlier,

1450
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,680
waiting for a chance to light it later.

1451
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,240
This would give him ten minutes

1452
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,960
to leave the crime scene.

1453
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,720
After completing all this,

1454
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,360
Old Zeng returned to the dance hall,

1455
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,200
and with Sister Hua, prepared for

1456
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,280
the karaoke competition.

1457
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,600
At 4:40,

1458
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,720
Old Zeng and Sister Hua opened the dance hall doors

1459
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,600
to attract people inside to sing and dance.

1460
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,000
At 4:50,

1461
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,320
taking advantage of the crowd,

1462
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,720
Old Zeng quickly went to the back alley,

1463
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,920
lit the fuse, then returned to the dance hall

1464
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,160
to sing with everyone,

1465
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,840
creating an alibi for himself.

1466
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,200
Five o'clock

1467
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,520
A fire broke out

1468
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,320
At this point

1469
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,320
Old Man Zeng's plan was fully accomplished

1470
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,880
During the warehouse fire,

1471
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,160
Xiaoxiao Wang had hidden another

1472
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,080
gasoline can in the warehouse.

1473
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,520
Since the cap wasn't unscrewed,

1474
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,800
the bottom of the can was blown out.

1475
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:35,760
Later,

1476
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,360
Old Man Pi kicked open the warehouse door

1477
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,880
and quickly extinguished the fire,

1478
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,320
preventing it from causing

1479
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,440
a greater disaster.

1480
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,120
Now,

1481
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,240
all six players please

1482
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,760
collect your golden keys

1483
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,120
from the grid building behind you.

1484
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,760
Thank you

1485
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:52,720
Here, let me award it to you

1486
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,680
How about you award it to me instead?

1487
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,480
Thank you

1488
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,720
What are you thanking me for?

1489
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,200
You go

1490
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,840
You've been my uncle for one episode

1491
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,040
Think about it - Guo Baoyou has three fathers

1492
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,680
First, congratulations to all of us

1493
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,120
We've all successfully caught

1494
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,520
the "murderer"

1495
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,800
This is worth celebrating

1496
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,400
Awesome

1497
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,600
Moreover, in this case

1498
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,720
there are actually many issues concerning the elderly

1499
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,160
Right

1500
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,760
So let's still give a round of applause

1501
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,080
Please welcome our old friend

1502
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,240
from China University of Political Science and Law

1503
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,920
Professor of Criminal Psychology

1504
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,560
Professor Ma Ai

1505
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,640
to discuss with us

1506
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,120
Hello professor

1507
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:28,560
Hello

1508
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,320
Hello professor

1509
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,280
Hello

1510
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:30,920
Long time no see

1511
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,920
Hello, long time no see

1512
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,680
Long time no see

1513
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:35,600
Professor Ma

1514
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,320
In our current case,

1515
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,800
there's Old Man Li and Xiao Wang

1516
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,680
who actually planned

1517
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,920
to recreate

1518
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,200
the original crime method

1519
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,480
and then "commit suicide"

1520
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,560
This kind of plan

1521
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,720
If their plan

1522
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,960
had succeeded,

1523
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,880
would they have violated the law?

1524
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,640
If Old Man Li

1525
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,720
would he because of this

1526
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,040
actually reopen his own case?

1527
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,040
His purpose

1528
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,960
was actually to reconstruct the original case

1529
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,880
to help police find a breakthrough

1530
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,120
in the original case.

1531
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,720
But

1532
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,680
after all in this case,

1533
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,440
if he "killed" someone,

1534
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,720
he must bear

1535
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,240
the criminal consequences of "murder."

1536
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,000
Even if your motives are good

1537
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,160
and your goals are noble,

1538
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,320
if your methods

1539
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,400
violate the law,

1540
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,840
you'll still face legal punishment.

1541
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,000
In reality,

1542
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,280
if you have new evidence

1543
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,440
or if you have

1544
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,600
information about these past events,

1545
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,840
you can

1546
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,840
report it to the public security authorities.

1547
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,880
Don't worry too much

1548
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,840
about statute of limitations.

1549
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,400
If you report to

1550
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,000
the public security or procuratorial authorities

1551
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,320
and we determine

1552
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,840
that further investigation

1553
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,400
is necessary,

1554
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,040
we can also request

1555
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,200
the Supreme People's Procuratorate

1556
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,720
to review the case.

1557
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,880
As long as the other party

1558
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,400
takes counter-investigation actions,

1559
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,760
there's no time limit for prosecution.

1560
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,680
Teacher, I also have a question I'd like to ask.

1561
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,320
Well,

1562
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,400
When we first

1563
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,880
met Sister Cai today,

1564
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,960
she was actually locked up in a place.

1565
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,960
We later learned

1566
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,240
that this gang forcibly

1567
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,320
restricted her personal freedom.

1568
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,280
So doesn't this mean they're also involved in

1569
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,480
many cases of elder abuse

1570
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,360
or

1571
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,720
this constitutes unlawful detention?

1572
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,840
In this case,

1573
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,280
when you reach old age,

1574
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,480
what you'll likely remember most

1575
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,200
is this very stage.

1576
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:32,480
Yes,

1577
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,480
because during this stage,

1578
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,040
you gain more self-respect,

1579
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,320
make more friends,

1580
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,440
and feel truly valuable.

1581
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,840
So when you become elderly,

1582
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,680
the most prominent need becomes emotional fulfillment.

1583
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:44,920
Often times,

1584
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,720
when we talk about emotional needs,

1585
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,720
whether it's having a son

1586
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,040
or a filial grandson,

1587
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,080
that brings you fulfillment.

1588
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,520
That's one aspect.

1589
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,640
Another aspect

1590
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,040
of emotional needs

1591
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,280
comes from societal recognition

1592
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,280
and their own

1593
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,680
sense of self-worth.

1594
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,520
It's about maintaining

1595
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,160
their former dignity.

1596
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,520
Teacher, may I ask another question?

1597
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,040
About that "Flower Lady" today

1598
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,480
in our group,

1599
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,000
she clearly knew the situation,

1600
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,840
yet chose to stay.

1601
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,120
Is her mentality

1602
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,560
similar to what we just discussed?

1603
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,680
Actually, this is

1604
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,240
what we call

1605
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,720
positive-effect nostalgia

1606
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,840
at play.

1607
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,960
Because only in this environment

1608
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,080
can she experience

1609
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,880
so-called self-worth

1610
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,680
and feel that

1611
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,200
warmth from memories.

1612
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,800
Simply put,

1613
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,280
no matter what environment you choose,

1614
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,200
you need to compare:

1615
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,000
"In this environment

1616
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,720
versus that environment,

1617
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,600
which feels more comfortable?"

1618
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,440
That becomes my priority.

1619
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:50,960
Professor Ma,

1620
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,320
so for our generation of youth...

1621
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,200
we should be more patient

1622
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,760
to pay attention to the elderly at home's

1623
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,400
spiritual needs

1624
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,880
patiently communicate more with them

1625
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,560
what's actually best is

1626
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,640
to get the elderly interested

1627
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,600
square dancing

1628
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,320
playing chess in the streets

1629
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,400
they can enter into a

1630
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,720
where they can feel

1631
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,480
happy

1632
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,320
and balanced state

1633
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,360
whether you children are around or not

1634
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,560
isn't the most important anymore

1635
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,400
therefore

1636
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,440
when we enter old age

1637
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,080
what we need first is self-affirmation

1638
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,640
this is something the elderly can achieve

1639
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,920
secondly

1640
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,360
group affirmation

1641
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,800
meaning people around them

1642
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,920
thirdly

1643
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,480
children's affirmation

1644
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,160
take a little time

1645
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,640
to check in with your parents

1646
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,480
see what their greatest needs are

1647
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,760
once you meet their greatest needs

1648
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,280
other things become less important

1649
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,000
I understand

1650
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,760
Good, thank you Professor Ma

1651
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,480
for giving us perspectives from

1652
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,080
various levels and age groups

1653
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,680
Yes, we've learned a lot

1654
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,760
Thank you Professor Ma

1655
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,200
Thank you

1656
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,040
Thank you

1657
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,600
"Let's Start Reasoning"

1658
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,920
See you next time

1659
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,880
There is a terrifying prophecy here

1660
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:08,880
Doll Museum

1661
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,080
People can turn into dolls

1662
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,720
The dolls "killed" people

1663
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,480
The dolls "killed" people

1664
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,200
I transformed the puppeteer onto the stage

1665
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,640
I'm free now

1666
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,400
This door is locked

1667
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,440
I want to get out

1668
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,080
Damn it, two people are missing

1669
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,440
Be wary of companions you've been separated from

1670
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,240
What's wrong with you?

1671
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:35,920
They've turned into...

1672
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,840
Turned into puppets

1673
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,120
You're just like me

1674
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,400
All just dolls

1675
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,040
A pre-planned life

1676
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,000
Song Piaoliang

1677
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,440
Are you two puppets?

1678
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,520
This is the life he designed for me

1679
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,360
He changed my life

1680
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,560
Some things once lost

1681
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,600
can never be regained

1682
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,720
He "died" well

1683
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,320
This is the one at every crime scene

1684
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,240
The doll that appears at the scene

1685
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,240
Did you send them there?

1686
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,600
He's been guiding us all along

1687
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,720
Making us do everything

1688
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,000
Then let's play along with his scheme

1689
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,800
I just have that hallucination

1690
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,640
I've seen him

1691
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,840
That's her delusion

1692
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,880
The people around me

1693
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,680
I don't remember Song Piaoliang

1694
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,000
Everyone says they don't know her

1695
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,120
They all have this same hallucination

1696
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:20,760
Parallel dimensions

1697
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,120
He's the one who jumped off the building

1698
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,480
There's some kind of signal interference in this building

1699
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,800
We came here to save you

1700
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,280
If we fail to save you

1701
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,040
We'll all lose our memories and start over

1702
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,640
An endless loop

1703
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,400
An even greater mystery

1704
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,880
We were manipulated into living here

1705
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:56,040
Looking forward to taking a "Home with Kids" style photo with you all.

1706
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,680
When I was five years old,

1707
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,600
when mother went to look for cocoa beans.

1708
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,840
Then he "accidentally fell to his death"

1709
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,000
My father didn't say anything

1710
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,440
He just left a note

1711
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,800
I can no longer take care of you

1712
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,760
and then left me

1713
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,400
Only Zhou Niaoniao can stay with me forever

1714
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,840
I made it together with Zhou's mother

1715
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,920
the first chocolate pot

1716
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,280
But then

1717
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,040
after mother left Zhou Keke

1718
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,120
she told me

1719
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,200
that I must protect Zhou Keke well

1720
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,720
Your mother

1721
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,520
I'm your (maternal uncle)

1722
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:43,880
Nephew (brother's son)

1723
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,400
You're my uncle

1724
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,000
Nephew (sister's son)

1725
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,000
So that means you're my grandson (daughter's son)

1726
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,920
I can only watch you from afar

1727
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,240
But having hugged you

1728
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,240
I'm already very happy

1729
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,040
He only hugged you (Zhou Keke) and him (Bai Sanwan)

1730
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,720
Grandpa

1731
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,160
Yes

1732
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,520
Dad

1733
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,440
Dad

1734
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,760
This Uncle Zeng

1735
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,640
Is this Zeng Zeng?

1736
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,680
He is Zeng Zeng

1737
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,680
My uncle

1738
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,360
Uncle

1739
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,360
Look at me

1740
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,800
Is this you?

1741
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,480
Uncle

1742
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,400
I never knew

1743
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,800
That you were also always

1744
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,680
Looking for me

1745
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,240
