1
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,280
On my first day at work, I run into something like this

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,120
Exciting?

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,720
Too exciting

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,920
Is this even human?

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,000
What kind of thing is that to say?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,160
*Creak*

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,960
*Creak*

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,720
This one's already laughing

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,720
This one's started laughing

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,600
Look, she moved

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
There's nothing

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,400
In the pocket

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,080
What is this?

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,640
What is this?

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,680
Can't be his

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
Oil-blotting sheets

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,720
What do we do? So awkward

18
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,760
Stuff it back in

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
You'll have to pay for this

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,520
Aren't you going to compensate?

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,880
You're over 1.8 meters tall

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
While it's probably just 50 centimeters

23
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,760
And you just sat on it like this

24
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,280
Lift

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,200
Lift

26
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,040
Lift

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,319
Back

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,880
Back

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,920
Back

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,000
Back

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,000
Welcome everyone to our

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,960
Apartment 11

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,880
While resting here

34
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,960
let's play together

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
6218

36
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,760
3a

37
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,800
6248

38
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,280
3a

39
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,480
6258

40
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,040
The result of 6258 is

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,160
Wait a moment, slow down

42
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,400
Match point

43
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,720
My heart rate is 280 now

44
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,960
Starting to check my own pulse

45
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,200
I encountered something like this on my first day at work.

46
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,040
Exciting, isn't it?

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,720
Way too exciting.

48
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,880
There's another door here.

49
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,360
Let's check it out.

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,240
Let's go.

51
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,920
Wait a moment

52
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,600
This place is a track

53
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,680
You can also push it

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,520
This is a track

55
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,920
This should be pushed back

56
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,920
Is this a person?

57
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,400
This should be a person

58
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,720
Why does it look a bit like Teng Zhongjie?

59
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,600
It does resemble him

60
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,880
There’s another person here

61
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
There’s one more here

62
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,560
Should we call 120 first?

63
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,920
It's my first day at work

64
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,880
and I run into this situation

65
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,640
Exciting?

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,200
Too exciting

67
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,080
There's another one here

68
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,080
There's another one here

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,600
Hello

70
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,240
This one is already smiling

71
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
This one has started smiling

72
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,360
Look, she moved

73
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,200
She seems to be waking up

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,040
She's already...

75
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,320
She seems to be waking up

76
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Is this a person?

77
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,120
What kind of question is that?

78
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,800
No

79
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,040
This is a real person

80
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,760
Is this a person?

81
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,600
What else could it be?

82
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,040
She's kind of pretty

83
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,800
Guo Baoyou

84
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,520
Isn't this your sister?

85
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,040
Guo Baoyou

86
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,920
Your sister

87
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,600
Your sister

88
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,320
Guo Baoyou

89
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,760
Who?

90
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,440
Your sister

91
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,560
Ju Xingyun

92
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,440
Isn't this Ju Xingyun?

93
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,240
Sister

94
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,800
What kind of brother are you?

95
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,440
I...

96
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,600
Sister

97
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,080
Giggle

98
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,880
Giggle

99
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
Giggle

100
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,440
Wait, don't...

101
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,080
That's not...

102
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,600
They probably won't wake up now

103
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,040
Really?

104
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,760
None of them woke up?

105
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,240
I don't believe it

106
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,600
Go get a basin of water, Xiao Wen

107
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,520
Ready, go

108
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,000
Three two one

109
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,480
How was this action designed?

110
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,240
Lying here like this.

111
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,320
There's a spider near her, did you see it?

112
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,240
Crawling towards her.

113
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,200
There is indeed a small bug.

114
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,800
It started flying.

115
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,480
It bit her.

116
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,160
Quick, let's search them.

117
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,880
Search them one by one.

118
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,800
Let's go check first.

119
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,640
See what they've found.

120
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,800
This is that...

121
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,440
Friend, let me see.

122
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,800
My apologies.

123
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,480
Sorry.

124
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,440
He has nothing in his hands.

125
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,560
In the pocket.

126
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,240
Seems like in the pocket...

127
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,920
It appears to be...

128
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,800
There's something.

129
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,480
What is this?

130
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:09,880
What is this?

131
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,800
What is this?

132
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,120
This can't be his

133
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,360
Oil-absorbing sheets

134
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,000
Really?

135
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,120
Sorry

136
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,880
Excuse me

137
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,680
My apologies

138
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,840
What should we do?

139
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,480
This is so awkward

140
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,520
Just stuff it back in

141
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,040
I'm sorry

142
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,360
Nothing happened here

143
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,360
Whose clues haven't we found yet?

144
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,880
Actually we didn't find anything on him either

145
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,640
We searched

146
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,160
Nothing left on him

147
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,920
Check the pockets

148
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,520
That's not it

149
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,240
What's this now?

150
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
Still this one

151
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,320
These are oil-absorbing sheets

152
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,240
This isn't it

153
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,120
So sorry about this

154
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,040
Let me put this back for you

155
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,440
What's this? Wait a minute

156
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,720
These are someone else's oil-absorbing sheets

157
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,840
We're done for

158
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,920
Now the whole world will know

159
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,840
I'm so sorry

160
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
I wish I hadn't come to play

161
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,040
Don't cry

162
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,920
What?

163
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,720
Got electrocuted

164
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,200
I'm Pikachu

165
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,440
I'm Pikachu

166
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,280
How do we handle this?

167
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,240
What should we do about this?

168
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,320
Can't we just take this off?

169
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,560
This can't be removed

170
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,040
We have to leave it like this

171
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,000
No violence allowed

172
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,960
What are you guys doing now?

173
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,080
We're not being violent

174
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,960
No violence here

175
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,760
Nope

176
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,520
Just a little irritable, right?

177
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,160
Not at all

178
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,240
After recording this long

179
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,200
Everyone's getting a bit irritable

180
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,680
Everyone's a little on edge

181
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,320
Scared to "death"

182
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,160
What's that sound?

183
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,280
What's wrong?

184
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,640
You go talk to your sister

185
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,680
I'll talk to my sister

186
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,520
Why did you come here?

187
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,400
Surprise!

188
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,360
What's with your eyes?

189
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,800
What is it?

190
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,680
Melancholy blue, can't you tell?

191
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,760
Melancholy blue

192
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,080
What's the matter?

193
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,720
What's she...

194
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,160
Hello

195
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,840
Hello

196
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,440
What event are you attending?

197
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,400
Help your sister up first

198
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,280
Get up

199
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,120
Should we sit for a while?

200
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,480
Should we get up?

201
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,720
No problem

202
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,760
Can get up

203
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,320
She's awake

204
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,360
Pet pet

205
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,320
After petting for a while, it came back

206
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,760
If you're not feeling well

207
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,160
Let me take you to the infirmary first

208
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,760
Come on

209
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,160
You take them first

210
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,560
Okay

211
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,240
Are you okay?

212
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm feeling a bit dizzy too

213
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,080
My foot's numb

214
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,880
Are your legs numb too?

215
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,760
My leg is numb too

216
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,600
I've had my leg bent this whole time

217
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,240
Foot's numb

218
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Really numb

219
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,920
My back is all cramped up

220
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,680
Come on, let's rest over here first

221
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,280
Alright

222
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,880
I heard you brought oil blotting sheets

223
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,400
Yes, I did

224
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,240
My older sister gave them to me

225
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,640
Then they found out

226
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,960
I couldn't help it

227
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,400
I kept...

228
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,280
Took my oil-absorbing sheets

229
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,440
Took them several times, you know

230
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,520
Thought it was some kind of clue, right?

231
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,920
Let's go look at his paintings

232
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,360
Let's go

233
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,560
Nephew, are you this sad?

234
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,240
Yes

235
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,040
Why are you so sad?

236
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,040
This sad

237
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,000
Because the painter "died"

238
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,120
I'm extremely sad

239
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,880
This pun of yours makes me want to swear

240
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,960
I'm extremely sad

241
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,160
Who pulled out her hair?

242
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
It was pulled out from the beginning

243
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,680
Who did it?

244
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,520
I forgot

245
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,400
Probably Old Liu

246
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,920
No

247
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,280
Why is this thing placed here?

248
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,960
I don't understand

249
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,080
Why are you pulling someone's hair?

250
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,960
Don't cry

251
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,360
AK

252
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,600
M

253
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,480
He's so handsome

254
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,240
Really handsome

255
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,520
Let me tell you

256
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,360
You'll have to pay for this

257
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,840
It's fine, go ahead and sit

258
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,280
For real?

259
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,120
Sit down, it's fine

260
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,760
Scared now?

261
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,560
Just sit

262
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
It won't break

263
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,240
Go on, rock it

264
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,560
See? What did I tell you?

265
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,440
You'll have to pay for this.

266
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,960
Aren't you going to compensate?

267
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,440
You broke its tail off.

268
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,000
You're over six feet tall,

269
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
while it's probably just fifty centimeters.

270
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,200
And you just sat like that?

271
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,800
What's wrong with this?

272
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,480
Bai Sanwan broke it.

273
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,440
It's not my fault.

274
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,960
You're the one who broke it, right?

275
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,040
No.

276
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,200
Yes.

277
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,640
Guo Baoyou.

278
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,560
You really...

279
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,680
Don't you need to pay for this?

280
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
You have to pay for it.

281
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
There's a projector.

282
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,720
This goes in, right? Just plug it in?

283
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,680
Here.

284
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,560
Right.

285
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,000
This won't move.

286
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,480
Let's try projecting it.

287
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,120
Bring the machine over.

288
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,680
Alright

289
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,560
Yes

290
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,040
Got a face now

291
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,640
Aligned properly

292
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,000
Yellow roses symbolize forgiveness

293
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,200
Where it falls

294
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,160
It's drifting this way

295
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,480
Here?

296
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,320
Is this it?

297
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,680
Wait a moment

298
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,840
There should be something behind this

299
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,160
Yes, feels like it might work

300
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,960
Hold on

301
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,800
Let's just lay it down, maybe

302
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,360
Lay it down

303
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,400
Just lay it down directly

304
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,200
Slowly

305
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,960
Don't let our Keke do it

306
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,440
Keke might be...

307
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,080
What do you mean?

308
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,600
No

309
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,720
You're the brains of the operation

310
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Let me hold this for you

311
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,080
Come

312
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,320
Lift

313
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,080
Lift

314
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,440
Lift

315
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,000
Lift

316
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,600
Lift, good

317
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,600
Coco

318
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,520
Later you shout "retreat"

319
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,440
Retreat

320
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,480
Retreat

321
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,320
Retreat

322
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,440
Retreat

323
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,800
Retreat

324
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,800
Let's get it half-standing

325
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,360
Right

326
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,920
We need to find a way to power it

327
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,680
I'll go back and get it

328
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,400
Little brother has already climbed

329
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,800
Little brother has taken the lead

330
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,920
Great

331
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,800
Already charging

332
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,440
Thanks for your effort

333
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,160
Okay

334
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,160
Can we block this opening for him?

335
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,720
Let's scare him

336
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,360
Let's turn off the lights

337
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,800
Let's turn off the lights

338
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,880
Is it a person?

339
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,000
Not a person

340
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,040
That's too mean

341
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,560
We should do it like this

342
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,080
Everyone's head waits at that exit

343
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,800
You're awake

344
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,080
Once he comes in

345
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
You're back

346
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,760
You're here to "poop", right?

347
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,800
You're here to "poop", right?

348
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,000
Let me try

349
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,920
Who exactly are you trying to scare?

350
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,880
Try it

351
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,960
Old Liu

352
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,240
Give it a try

353
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,800
We're all easily frightened

354
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,280
Let's create some scary atmosphere ourselves

355
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,960
Was this just taken out from inside?

356
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,040
Take a look at this without getting upset.

357
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,680
Shouldn't we check that serial number?

358
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,560
Let's go.

359
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,360
Let's go back again.

360
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,120
Let's go.

361
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,360
After you.

362
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,040
After you, Lao Liu.

363
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,680
You first.

364
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,400
I'm in no hurry.

365
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,760
There must be someone waiting for you inside.

366
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,280
There's someone waiting for you inside.

367
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,200
Come on, Zhou Keke.

368
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,080
Let's be brave.

369
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,600
Are you human?

370
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:47,960
Truly brave.

371
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,360
Watch your head.

372
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,800
Why is it that we've been here so many times,

373
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,640
yet we still feel afraid?

374
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,960
It's just that towards the production team, we still feel...

375
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,000
Yes, a sense of awe.

376
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,200
Look at Old Liu.

377
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,960
It's quite a hassle

378
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,760
Let me see

379
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,840
Long limbs

380
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,480
Sometimes it's annoying

381
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,200
Right

382
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,880
Come on, let's go

383
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,760
Every time passing through places like this

384
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,720
I feel particularly at ease

385
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,400
What's wrong?

386
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,120
Let's use that light to take a look

387
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,760
Check the serial number

388
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,880
Because when purchasing this

389
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,800
each one has its own serial number

390
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,800
Bai Sanwan

391
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,720
Thought it was oxygen

392
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,600
But actually inhaled that

393
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,280
Bai Sanwan

394
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,400
Sanwan

395
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,400
Bai Sanwan

396
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,680
How boring can you be, seriously?

397
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,440
I knew he would try to scare us.

398
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,960
That's why I didn't dare to approach him.

399
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,920
I feel like giving Old Bai a beating.

400
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,080
How about we team up to get back at him?

401
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,160
Would that work?

402
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,080
Just give him a good thrashing.

403
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,440
Since he's your brother,

404
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,280
you just stay out of it.

405
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,480
You're perfect as you are.

406
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Alright, welcome everyone to our

407
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,160
Apartment No. 11.

408
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,600
I've tried some new games

409
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
and I plan to

410
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,680
while we're resting here,

411
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,080
play them together with you all.

412
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,840
How about it?

413
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,040
Okay.

414
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,000
Is it fun?

415
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Super fun.

416
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,840
Really simple too.

417
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,600
First, let's divide into teams.

418
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,960
Physical or mental -

419
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,560
it's a mental game.

420
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,000
Your brain...

421
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,680
What do you mean?

422
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,720
Is it working properly?

423
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
What do you mean?

424
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,520
Space...

425
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,800
Listen... listen to the sound... space.

426
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,280
Rock-paper-scissors

427
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,160
Let's do rock-paper-scissors

428
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,120
To be fair

429
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,600
Rock-paper-scissors

430
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,720
Now our teams are decided

431
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,280
Let me introduce the first game

432
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,080
The first game is called "Guess the Beans"

433
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,000
How does it work?

434
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,680
Guess the Beans

435
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,880
Each team gets a bag of beans

436
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,000
In three rounds of competition

437
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,640
Put a certain number of beans into the box

438
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
The team with more beans wins

439
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,599
Keep your bean count hidden

440
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,880
The losing team reveals their bean count

441
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,480
Best two out of three

442
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,359
After you've decided

443
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,760
Secretly place them in here

444
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,119
I'll check inside here

445
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,119
Is this okay for the first round?

446
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,520
Just show it to him

447
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,480
Okay

448
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,520
I'm sorry

449
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,960
Thank you, thank you

450
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,599
I really should have chosen her

451
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,840
That was my mistake

452
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,000
You can find another place

453
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,960
to discuss

454
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,520
Go to the bar

455
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,520
I think we should play it safe in the first round

456
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,800
Put out about three to four

457
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,520
Okay

458
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,560
Tian Ji's horse racing strategy

459
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,680
Put ten in the first round

460
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,320
Why?

461
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,720
I think

462
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,600
They'll probably put less than ten

463
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,440
Putting a round number like that is...

464
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,960
If they put

465
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,440
eleven in the first round

466
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,120
Keep your voice down

467
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,920
They might hear us

468
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,160
We were indeed quite loud

469
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,680
Did you hear that?

470
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,080
No

471
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,840
No

472
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,680
We really didn't hear

473
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,720
I really won't tell you

474
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,640
what we heard

475
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,440
We're just lip-reading

476
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,640
So your strategy is

477
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,880
to watch them discuss?

478
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,720
We're practicing lip-reading

479
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,600
Really want to

480
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,400
know what they're saying

481
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,400
Keep your voice down

482
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,960
We need to turn around

483
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,760
Turn around to talk with them

484
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,880
Okay, we're done

485
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,920
Slow down a bit

486
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,840
Can't let them figure it out

487
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,640
How many are inside?

488
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,280
Yes

489
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,080
Be more careful

490
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,680
Right, be more careful

491
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,920
Or else it'll make clinking sounds inside

492
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,600
It would give us away

493
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,920
Exciting, right?

494
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,160
Put one more in

495
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,400
Want to know?

496
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,320
Want to know how many I'm putting in?

497
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,440
Please hand me both boxes

498
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,000
Be careful

499
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,480
Let me check them

500
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,960
I feel like you guys put in a lot

501
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,520
all-in

502
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,000
I already know the results of the first round.

503
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,880
The winner of the first round is...

504
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
this side.

505
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,120
Congratulations to you.

506
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,080
In this round, they placed...

507
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,600
a total number of beans equal to...

508
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,840
zero.

509
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,160
This time we can choose not to place...

510
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,080
and trick them out of their beans.

511
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,480
That's what I thought at first too

512
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,800
No wonder we're family

513
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,280
No problem, we carried it out

514
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,520
You can discuss it now

515
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,680
How many to put in the second round

516
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,360
Let's go then, we're satisfied

517
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,200
Otherwise, just release them all.

518
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,040
Fall

519
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,640
Only two rounds left

520
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,360
How many in total

521
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,120
Twenty

522
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,520
Twenty pieces

523
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,440
No matter what, we'll win

524
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:15,880
Go for it

525
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,560
We've already discussed it

526
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,080
That fast?

527
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,520
Victory is assured

528
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,680
Not bad

529
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,320
Not really

530
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,440
Are you guys done?

531
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:27,960
We're done

532
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,680
Let's do one final check

533
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,080
Confirmed

534
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,880
Any more changes needed?

535
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,320
No more changes

536
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,160
No changes

537
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,240
Okay, no changes - I'll review it now

538
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,040
Okay

539
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,000
So the winner of this round is

540
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,080
the winning team

541
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,080
Then for the side without victory

542
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,240
how many beans are there?

543
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,560
Take a guess

544
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,760
Zero

545
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,480
It's zero

546
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,440
Would it be more than ours?

547
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:14,960
Yes

548
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,520
So the outcome is actually already clear

549
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,400
They guessed it right, we are...

550
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,280
I think in the second round

551
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,600
they must have bet heavily

552
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,080
to win

553
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,400
Otherwise not

554
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,960
Right

555
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,840
Alright

556
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,760
They want to go all-in one last time

557
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,560
All-in

558
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,960
Then one more time

559
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,280
Okay, one more time

560
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,680
Okay

561
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,520
Do we really have to "bully" them

562
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,080
Thanks

563
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,320
Do we really have to "bully" them

564
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,400
Do we really have to "bully" them?

565
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,000
The last round is crucial, right?

566
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,480
Right

567
00:21:59,480 --> 00:21:59,800
Right

568
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,600
Extremely crucial

569
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,200
Then let's do it, go straight for it

570
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,760
Start your show

571
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,480
All in

572
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,360
How many should we put in, exactly?

573
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:09,760
You tell me

574
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,920
This is so frustrating

575
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,240
Alright, I'll follow your lead

576
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,880
Still pretending, huh?

577
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,040
He's over there cutting

578
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,920
Why don't you try biting it?

579
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,840
Can you bite it open?

580
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,080
Biting might cost you two more teeth, right?

581
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,040
Or maybe three

582
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,080
Both upper and lower teeth falling out together

583
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,960
If you can really break it open

584
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,880
I'll count it as two for you

585
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,800
Then you can win, right?

586
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,920
Watch your teeth

587
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,000
Fine

588
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,880
Don't

589
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,640
Just a game

590
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,320
Extremely close

591
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,720
Just one move away

592
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,400
Congratulations to this side

593
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,080
It was truly full of suspense

594
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,560
Next, we will

595
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,200
proceed with our second game

596
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,240
Number Guessing

597
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,560
Number Guessing Game

598
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,960
The host randomly writes down a 4-digit number

599
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,760
with no repeating digits

600
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,440
Two teams take turns guessing the number

601
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:14,800
Host

602
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,960
responds to each guess by indicating

603
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,720
xAyB

604
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,640
where A means correct digit

605
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,480
in correct position

606
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,240
and B means correct digit

607
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,320
but wrong position

608
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
The team that guesses correctly wins

609
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,760
Because normally

610
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,800
I would tell you

611
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,040
x A's and y B's

612
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,880
that's what it means

613
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,800
The basic structure

614
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,360
always works this way

615
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,760
If all four digits are correct

616
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,280
x plus y must equal four

617
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,720
If it's less than four

618
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,160
that means

619
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,400
you haven't guessed all digits yet

620
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,320
My CPU can't handle this

621
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,200
I'm overheating already

622
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,760
Understand?

623
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,200
What should I do? I'm so confused

624
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,920
Yes? Any questions?

625
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,720
Then you can ask again

626
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,080
I've already...

627
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,720
Do you smell that?

628
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,120
Something's burning

629
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,800
It's already fried

630
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,440
Let's do a practice round first

631
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,400
Let's practice first

632
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,160
Maybe burning it out will help

633
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,200
Two negatives make a positive, right?

634
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,120
Right

635
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
Let's do a trial run first

636
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,680
Okay

637
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,440
This number is...

638
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,280
Looks like many strokes

639
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,800
Go ahead, guess anything

640
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Is there a pattern

641
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,400
or completely random?

642
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
We're in Q&A mode now

643
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,120
I'll only tell you x A's and y B's

644
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,800
Write any number

645
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,760
It doesn't really matter

646
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,280
Okay

647
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,120
2345

648
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,440
Okay, so the feedback I'm giving you is

649
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,720
0a1b

650
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,920
2345

651
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,360
1b

652
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,760
I think it's correct

653
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,400
Because

654
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,480
Because people really like writing this number

655
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,160
I think 4

656
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,520
Right

657
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,720
Then let's go with 2 and 4

658
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,240
Cross out 3 and 5

659
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,600
Then I think you're right

660
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,600
Okay, you've just finished discussing

661
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,720
Now it's your turn

662
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,280
If we show it to him

663
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,080
After he tells us the result

664
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
We'll know

665
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,240
Whether these two are correct

666
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,840
7142

667
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
7142, right?

668
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,360
0a0b

669
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,880
How could it be 0b?

670
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,880
Remove both 4 and 2

671
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,160
Right

672
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,800
Only 3 and 5 remain

673
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,200
3658

674
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,200
The feedback for 3658 is

675
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,080
3a

676
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,600
3a

677
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,800
3a

678
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,720
3658

679
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,280
Both the positions and numbers are correct

680
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,560
9 or 1

681
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,320
1 isn't there

682
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,000
Then it must be 9

683
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,640
We've figured it out

684
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,840
We guessed correctly

685
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,640
Come on, quick answer

686
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,440
3659

687
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,560
The result for 3659 is 2a1b

688
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,360
Three positions here are correct

689
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,440
Right, so what I'm saying is

690
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,040
This one

691
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,800
And this one

692
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,720
So now it's

693
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,760
3698

694
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,400
Correct

695
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,200
That's right

696
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,080
What?

697
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,880
369

698
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,960
What did you say?

699
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,720
3698

700
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,600
3698

701
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,440
How did you know?

702
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,680
I don't know, I guessed

703
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,120
You saw the number in my mind

704
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,160
The essence of the game

705
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,320
Extremely lucky

706
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,520
Lucky

707
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,040
Let's go

708
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,320
Okay, we're officially starting now

709
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,440
Xiao He, why don't you move your arm when writing?

710
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,400
How do you...

711
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,040
He doesn't move here, he just does it like this.

712
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,920
It's hard to see his pen strokes.

713
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,760
I only move my wrist.

714
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,640
I'm not writing calligraphy.

715
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,080
He's being sneaky.

716
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,920
Okay, I've now written down

717
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,120
these four numbers in my mind.

718
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,960
Now, first I'll ask you

719
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,440
to give me four numbers.

720
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,640
6482

721
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,320
What feedback will I give you?

722
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,120
Right.

723
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,240
4a

724
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,800
That would be too easy to guess.

725
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,880
Then you're really going easy on us.

726
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,920
1a2b

727
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,400
2b

728
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,720
2b means

729
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,920
correct position.

730
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,440
2b means these two numbers are correct

731
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,720
but in the wrong positions.

732
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,520
Which two numbers are they?

733
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,200
Can I tell you that?

734
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,880
Might as well have him recite his ID number.

735
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,320
Why don't you come take a look?

736
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
Want to give it a try?

737
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,840
Okay

738
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,360
Garbled code

739
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,680
Let's pick 8463

740
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,320
8463

741
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,040
Alright, let me check

742
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,720
2b

743
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,400
Two correct

744
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,840
6428

745
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,600
Are you sure?

746
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,320
Confirmed

747
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,960
You sure?

748
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,720
Positive

749
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,960
So we shouldn't change the numbers

750
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,600
Let's get the sequence right first

751
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,120
Just the sequence

752
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,800
The result for 6428 is

753
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,800
2a1b

754
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,960
2a

755
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,680
Let's change it

756
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,000
Then randomly change one

757
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,600
Change one

758
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,080
Never tried this before

759
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,800
Okay

760
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
5268

761
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,280
5268

762
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,920
2a1b

763
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,440
Congratulations, you're one step closer to success

764
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,520
No

765
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,640
Wrong

766
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,680
It's missing a 2

767
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,560
This 2 is correct

768
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,800
8426

769
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,080
Isn't this it?

770
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,040
This is exactly what I was saying earlier

771
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,000
Let's go with this one

772
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,040
8426

773
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,000
3b

774
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,760
3b

775
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,200
Correct

776
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
These two are absolutely correct

777
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,040
Changed

778
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
The puzzle is revealed

779
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,960
1268

780
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,400
The result of 1268 is

781
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,160
2a

782
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,440
So

783
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,320
These three digits are correct

784
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,480
We're on the right track now

785
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,560
Then let's make a blind guess

786
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,600
Okay

787
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,280
Come on

788
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,800
That one

789
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,560
Getting close

790
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,520
4268

791
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,400
The result for 4268 is

792
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,680
2a

793
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,600
2a1b

794
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:07,960
Right

795
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,640
Between these two

796
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,720
one is in the wrong position

797
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,680
2a1b

798
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,760
Let's try it

799
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,720
Then let's replace this one

800
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,480
Which one haven't we tried?

801
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,600
This one

802
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,800
Alright, let's try

803
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,000
6238

804
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,800
The result for 6238 is

805
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,360
3a

806
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,320
It's 3a

807
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:29,720
This

808
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,480
6248

809
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,280
3a

810
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,000
6258

811
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
The result for 6258 is

812
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,880
Wait, slow down

813
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,960
I already forgot which one was 3a

814
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,640
3a

815
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
No

816
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,480
Bad luck

817
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,000
Like this

818
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,360
Let's erase everything now

819
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,920
Erase it all

820
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,080
6258

821
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,400
If we erase everything, what about the previous attempts?

822
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,680
6258 wasn't used before

823
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,840
Let's say

824
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,120
Right?

825
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,920
3a

826
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,880
Then

827
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,960
My heart started racing

828
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,440
Hurry up

829
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,560
The CPU is overheating

830
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,160
Almost there

831
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,080
It's over

832
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,800
You wiped it all

833
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,520
No

834
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,120
When there's no space left

835
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,880
It'll make my mind even messier

836
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,440
My heart rate's at 280 now

837
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,480
Are you all extremely eager

838
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,400
to call out numbers now?

839
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,880
One number is wrong

840
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,720
Right

841
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,840
If the numbers are correct, the position will be right

842
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,160
Match point

843
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,920
Now checking my own pulse

844
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,000
Did we say 6238 before?

845
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,680
No

846
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,320
How could you ask that?

847
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,560
6238

848
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,200
Have you decided?

849
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,080
We've decided

850
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,240
3a

851
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,920
Because we did say it

852
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,880
6278

853
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,000
Why didn't you say it earlier?

854
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,360
Congratulations

855
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,480
Finally got it right

856
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,440
That was so difficult

857
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,480
Thank you so much

858
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,280
Really

859
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,760
My brain hurts

860
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,160
She just said

861
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,880
"Did we say 6238?"

862
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
I said you hadn't said it

863
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,240
But we did say it

864
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,600
We did say it

865
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,080
6238

866
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,440
3a

867
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:01,840
But

868
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,200
I didn't finish my sentence

869
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,480
I was just quietly laughing to myself

870
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,360
Then I wanted you all

871
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,880
to make your own choice

872
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,000
After playing these two games

873
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,160
I imagine everyone's brains

874
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,440
are already firing on all cylinders

875
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,640
Wide awake now, right?

876
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,320
Want to sleep

877
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,480
Now even more confused

878
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,120
Not dizzy anymore?

879
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,320
Now extremely confused

880
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,520
Now super confused again

881
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,760
How about a few more games?

882
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,200
Now awake

883
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,720
Okay, fine

884
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
That's good then

885
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,120
Alright

886
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,520
We'll set off at dawn

887
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,320
We'll set off at dawn

888
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,880
Those two have gone "mad"

889
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
The dream has awakened

890
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,920
The dream has awakened

891
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,240
The heart won't fear

892
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,600
"Gone mad"

893
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,440
There is a place

894
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,400
The heart won't fear

895
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,320
Everything I have is just to find it

896
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,400
Even at the cost of sorrow

897
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,720
The cost of sorrow

898
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,920
You bunch of "lunatics"
