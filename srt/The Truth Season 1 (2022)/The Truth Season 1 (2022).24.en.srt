1
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,080
The puppeteer here can turn people into dolls.

2
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,720
You're all dolls just like me.

3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,960
How could I possibly have

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,240
memories of someone

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,200
I've never even met?

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,520
We were manipulated

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,560
into living here.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,280
Enter the painting number to open the door.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,280
If you enter it wrong,

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,640
the painting will be permanently sealed.

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,360
Right, so it's 08, isn't it?

12
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,160
Mirror

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Such a large mirror

14
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,520
Who is this?

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,440
This one is wearing the same clothes

16
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,320
as that "deceased person."

17
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,120
That's a dummy.

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,160
Wait a moment

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,200
I got it

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,200
After closing this

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,320
The person we saw there

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,560
is someone from inside

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,880
He was here at that time.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,840
Let me take a look.

25
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,080
Can you see me?

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,640
You're over there

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,280
Of course we can see you

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,919
If you can see me, I can see you

29
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,720
Is it the right side?

30
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,039
Yes, the painting's right side

31
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,800
No

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,680
The painting's left

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,720
What if you kneel there?

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,280
You're kneeling there

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,600
Yes

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,120
How about like this?

37
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Yes

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,720
So that's a dummy

39
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,920
No

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,840
This is a robot vacuum

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,320
It doesn't need anyone around

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,160
The robot vacuum can move by itself

43
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,720
Yes, you can control it remotely

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,640
Look, it can stand like this

45
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,160
Making us think it's still alive

46
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,200
It was moving at the time

47
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,320
Dummy

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,320
I think this way

49
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,120
Should we first enter

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Assistant Yang's office

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,320
Come on

52
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,840
Xiao Yang, I have something to attend to and will be away for a few days

53
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,840
I'll be back early on the 8th for the press conference

54
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,760
He left on the 5th

55
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,040
Before that

56
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,880
The dolls weren't here when I came the other day

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,800
Wait a minute

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,600
That doesn't add up

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,520
It says here

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,320
Look

61
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,080
The formal suit he ordered includes a top hat

62
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,280
Height is 1.7 meters

63
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,680
But her boyfriend's medical report

64
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,400
shows 97

65
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,200
1.83 meters I think

66
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,160
1.83 meters, right?

67
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,080
He is 1.83 meters tall,

68
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,600
so

69
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,640
therefore

70
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,680
the clothes he ordered were for Assistant Yang

71
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,280
the one wearing the clothes wasn't Lai Wan'ou

72
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,200
it was Assistant Yang

73
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,680
right?

74
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
the one who "died" might not be Lai Wan'ou

75
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,720
it's possible Lai Wan'ou didn't die

76
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,240
isn't that right?

77
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,760
it's highly likely it was Assistant Yang

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,920
There's a locked safe here.

79
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,560
What's the deal?

80
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,800
Not sure, there's a combination safe here.

81
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,720
There's a computer here.

82
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,280
But it needs Assistant Yang's birthday as the password.

83
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,320
Is there a document folder here?

84
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,280
Is there?

85
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,400
There's a document folder here.

86
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,440
Creative Purchase Agreement

87
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,960
Contract between Lai Wanou and Assistant Yang

88
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,560
Party A is Lai Wanou

89
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,680
Party B is Assistant Yang

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,840
Through friendly negotiations between both parties

91
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,760
Party A shall pay 200,000 RMB

92
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,360
to acquire Party B's

93
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,720
"Human-skin-like Doll Manufacturing Technology"

94
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,120
After reaching this agreement

95
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,840
Party B will serve as Party A's lifelong assistant

96
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,480
to develop new dolls for Party A

97
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,760
200,000 to purchase it

98
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,800
Look, there's a problem

99
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,200
You see Party B's signature

100
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,880
This is

101
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,040
This is the signature of all doll parties

102
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,000
Actually it's (Assistant) Yang

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,160
We've been saying it's Lai (Wanou)

104
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,640
Right

105
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,040
So

106
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,040
The life designed for me by Lai Wanou

107
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,920
All our life manipulations and such

108
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,200
were all

109
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,600
by (Assistant) Yang

110
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,480
There's also one more thing here

111
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,880
A letter from Lai Wanou to Xiao Yang

112
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,560
What does it say?

113
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,360
Xiao Yang, you're just a small assistant

114
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,440
How could anyone believe

115
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,000
that these skin-like dolls were your creation?

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,720
As long as you sell me the production techniques and works

117
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,640
I'll immediately give you

118
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,120
200,000 yuan

119
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,200
Don't you urgently need money for your father's car accident?

120
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,760
Once these works are sold

121
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,920
I promise you

122
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,320
I'll give you 1% of the profits

123
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,040
One percent profit

124
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,240
The 2016 incident

125
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,320
Lai Wan'ou took credit under Assistant Yang's name

126
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,080
But only gave him one percent profit

127
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,040
Is there anything else?

128
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,000
Who is this?

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,760
These are his manuscripts

130
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,080
These all belong to Assistant Yang

131
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,640
Yes, Assistant Yang's

132
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,200
So beautiful

133
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
So he wanted to "eliminate" Lai Wan'ou

134
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,320
He wanted to "kill" Lai Wan'ou

135
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,080
Or he wanted to prove it was his own work

136
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,480
Right, he might have wanted to take advantage

137
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,000
When Lai Wan'ou was about to go on a business trip

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,520
He wanted to do something

139
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,080
Then wanted to prove

140
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
That he drew it himself

141
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,320
Lai Wan'ou might have found out

142
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,560
So he might have "killed" him

143
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,400
After "killing" him, he could take full credit

144
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,080
Yes, just took it directly

145
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,240
Then there would be no threat

146
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,800
That's possible too

147
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,760
There's another question

148
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,720
It's also possible

149
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
That it was Assistant Yang who "died"

150
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,040
But Lai Wan'ou didn't "kill" him

151
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,840
Look more carefully on the table

152
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,680
There's a phone here

153
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,280
Let me see

154
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,600
Assistant Yang's phone

155
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,800
Why are you so useless?

156
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,400
When we were learning to paint together at age five

157
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,160
Others painted mountains, you painted the number three

158
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,600
At no age could you compare to Lai Wan'ou

159
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,440
How did I give birth to such a failure?

160
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,480
Mom, actually I...

161
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,400
Don't make excuses for me

162
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,240
Let me tell you

163
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,720
I will definitely stand on that stage

164
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,240
And prove myself to everyone

165
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,680
Take back what rightfully belongs to me

166
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,640
Just the day after tomorrow

167
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,800
My big day

168
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,920
Just wait and see

169
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,320
The day after tomorrow

170
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,560
That would be the 6th, 7th, or 8th

171
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,080
It's the 8th

172
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,680
So what Assistant Yang is wearing today

173
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,880
Must be the outfit he wanted to showcase

174
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,200
The new doll's costume

175
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,640
The magician's outfit

176
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,280
Actually he wanted to impersonate Lai Wan'ou

177
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,000
He wanted to replace Lai Wan'ou

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,320
And win everyone's applause

179
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
Wearer

180
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,560
Assistant Yang

181
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,160
The pacemaker is within a 20-meter range

182
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,080
Within 20 meters

183
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,360
As long as it's within the theater premises

184
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,920
Call log

185
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,040
Member customer

186
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,000
One two three

187
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,200
Called but no answer

188
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,960
After 10:30

189
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,880
No more calls were answered

190
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,120
So he was already "dead" by 10:30

191
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,760
Assistant Yang is "dead"

192
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,480
Right? Look

193
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,160
Worn by Assistant Yang

194
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,160
Yes, the "deceased" should be him

195
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,840
Let's go check

196
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,960
Just look at that suit

197
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,400
This is size 180

198
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,120
This one is size 180

199
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,320
So this is your boyfriend's clothes

200
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,200
Come, let's verify together

201
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,400
Come

202
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,440
This design is cool

203
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,960
It's the principle of refraction

204
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,360
This person is quite clever

205
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,840
Of course

206
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,800
Check what size his clothes are

207
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,600
Here

208
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,520
Pull it up

209
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,440
Lift both hands to take it off

210
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,200
When I used to sell clothes

211
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,600
I changed clothes for models like this

212
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,200
What size?

213
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,400
170

214
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,080
Then the "dead" one is Assistant Yang

215
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,560
Assistant Yang

216
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,400
Assistant Yang

217
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,960
The doll is 183cm

218
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
He's 170cm

219
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,559
Then someone "killed" him

220
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,320
Right

221
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,120
Let's go back

222
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,159
We still have a locked box

223
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,480
What's on this? Numbers?

224
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,360
Try it

225
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,640
Where are the numbered items?

226
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,640
Is there anything written in his phone?

227
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,080
I've opened it.

228
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,680
What's the password?

229
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,720
0708.

230
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,520
Why 0708?

231
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,880
Because today is his big day.

232
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,120
Because today is his important day.

233
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,720
July 8th.

234
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,480
Which is today.

235
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,960
Alright, Old Liu now

236
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,040
Old Liu is a locksmith expert

237
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,320
I've discovered

238
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,400
Assistant Yang

239
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
I've opened it

240
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,600
0708

241
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,640
Not bad, Old Liu now

242
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,760
I'm just guessing blindly

243
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,600
I'm telling you, pure guesswork

244
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,280
Walkie-talkie

245
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,680
Can you contact him?

246
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,160
Tell me

247
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,080
Hello

248
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,920
Hello

249
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,800
Received, go ahead

250
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,920
I hear an echo

251
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,720
Quick

252
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,280
Over here

253
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,480
Need help

254
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,160
Come on, Da Liu, you do it

255
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,280
Liu, you say it again

256
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,200
Received, go ahead

257
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,320
Inside here

258
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,240
Received, go ahead.

259
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,000
Inside this thing.

260
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,280
I'm Lai Wan'ou.

261
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,840
What did you say?

262
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,400
Who are you?

263
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,240
He's Lai Wan'ou.

264
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
I am Lai Wan'ou.

265
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Hurry!

266
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,040
I've been locked in for a day, come save me!

267
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,480
Locked in for a day.

268
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,720
Lai Wan'ou is inside.

269
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,480
Your husband is coming.

270
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,560
No, your boyfriend is coming.

271
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Boyfriend has appeared.

272
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,360
Lai Wan'ou has been locked in for a day.

273
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,680
What's the plan, guys?

274
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,920
Gonna kick it down again?

275
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,800
Desperate to rescue him.

276
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,080
Try 0708, come on.

277
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,560
Your password is...

278
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,640
8264.

279
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,760
48269.

280
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,640
Got the password.

281
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,400
No, 0826.

282
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,920
No, he said...

283
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,280
Say it again, your connection is bad.

284
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Say it again, buddy.

285
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,880
The password is...

286
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,160
8264.

287
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,760
8264.

288
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,120
48269.

289
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,720
8269.

290
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,080
8264.

291
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,200
8269.

292
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,080
82648269.

293
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,000
Maybe you should stay a bit longer.

294
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,960
He can't hold on much longer.

295
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,520
You're still fooling around.

296
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,360
We're really listening, we're not messing around.

297
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,640
Hang in there a bit longer, buddy.

298
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,280
What is it exactly?

299
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,600
Say it louder one more time.

300
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,520
8264.

301
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,800
48269.

302
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,120
We've saved you, brother.

303
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,840
You okay, buddy?

304
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,680
Are you okay?

305
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,280
I'm fine.

306
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,320
Sorry, my ears...

307
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,200
The signal is bad.

308
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,600
You know the password, why don't you come out?

309
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,200
He can't open it from inside.

310
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,040
Are you

311
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,640
a doll?

312
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,720
I am

313
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,440
Yes

314
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,800
your boyfriend

315
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,760
Beautiful, are you okay?

316
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,760
I

317
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,560
am fine

318
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,400
That's good

319
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,080
First, can we untie someone

320
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,800
Yes

321
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,960
I've been locked up for ages

322
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,360
What's he

323
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,760
Can't untie it, right?

324
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,960
The key is over in that corner

325
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,040
I can't reach it

326
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,840
Where?

327
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,200
Here

328
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,080
Don't untie him yet

329
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,400
Right

330
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
He's dangerous

331
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,600
Everyone sit

332
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,120
Sit

333
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,800
Let me see

334
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,360
Look

335
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,440
There's something here

336
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,280
Okay, open it, open

337
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,600
What is this? Tell me.

338
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,040
This was bought for Piaoliang.

339
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,360
This...

340
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,400
You all can leave.

341
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,280
I think...

342
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,280
You think it's worth considering, right?

343
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,520
Speak up, what exactly happened?

344
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,720
Who would dare lock you in your own territory?

345
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,960
It was Assistant Yang.

346
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
Assistant Yang?

347
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,520
When were you locked here?

348
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,520
At 8 o'clock this morning...

349
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,600
when I went to organize the dolls in the warehouse.

350
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,880
From the mirror's reflection,

351
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,120
I saw someone trying to hit me.

352
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,240
What do you mean, Assistant Yang?

353
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,000
What are you doing?

354
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,960
I fought back against him,

355
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,680
then he knocked me unconscious.

356
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,080
When I woke up,

357
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,560
I saw from the surveillance

358
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,960
that you had already entered the warehouse.

359
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,120
So I...

360
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,920
pressed the buttons on the control panel.

361
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,800
Pressed the buttons on the control panel.

362
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,720
"Let's play hide-and-seek together."

363
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
I wanted to use those lights and sounds

364
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,160
to guide you to rescue me.

365
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,200
Do you have any issues with Assistant Yang?

366
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,720
Are you two on bad terms?

367
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,520
I've been good to him,

368
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
so I don't know why

369
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
he would attack me.

370
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,080
But...

371
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,640
There's a lot of evidence in his room.

372
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,560
You bought his manuscripts, didn't you?

373
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,240
Did you plagiarize his work?

374
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,320
How could that be?

375
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,280
I made all those dolls myself.

376
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,040
Every manuscript

377
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,280
was drawn by my own hand.

378
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,400
And those techniques were my original creations.

379
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,920
The contracts you both signed are all there.

380
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,600
What contracts?

381
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,840
See for yourself.

382
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,280
You're completely useless.

383
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,880
You don't know how to do anything.

384
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,200
These were all designed by Assistant Yang.

385
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,080
Right.

386
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,200
It's all there in black and white.

387
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,920
This definitely isn't me.

388
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,200
This is your own handwriting.

389
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,720
And your fingerprint.

390
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,520
That's not my handwriting.

391
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,280
I really didn't write this.

392
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,440
He forged it.

393
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,200
How can a fingerprint be forged?

394
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,360
This isn't my fingerprint.

395
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,440
It's really not my fingerprint.

396
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,080
Let's take a look.

397
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,160
It's clearly his fingerprint.

398
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,240
It's really not my fingerprint.

399
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,920
You think it's all forged.

400
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,400
No, I've never done anything like this.

401
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,840
He can deny it.

402
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,320
If he's the "culprit,"

403
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,160
he can deny it.

404
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,640
He won't admit to any of this evidence.

405
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,400
Can we call the police?

406
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,120
Yes.

407
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,080
Call 110 (China's emergency number).

408
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,080
No, wait.

409
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,920
Actually, our Keke has a special ability.

410
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,040
She can directly compare DNA.

411
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,360
Check if it's him.

412
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,360
Match successful

413
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,240
Look

414
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,000
Because he doesn't usually talk like this

415
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,120
Extremely high-tech

416
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
I actually believed it

417
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,840
This is your own voice

418
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,120
Not me, it's him

419
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,720
It's really not my fingerprint

420
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,160
Let me tell you about Assistant Yang

421
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,880
I've always treated him very well since childhood

422
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,200
I celebrate his birthday every year

423
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,520
Wait, so when is his birthday

424
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,640
Approximately when?

425
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,320
September 9th

426
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,360
Then his father got sick

427
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,640
I even transferred him 200,000 yuan

428
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,520
So you had conditions with him

429
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,960
I never asked for anything in return

430
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,840
I want to ask something

431
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,880
You're in this monitoring room

432
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,440
Can't you see the "dead body" from here?

433
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,880
Yes, I can see it

434
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,360
So I wanted to ask you

435
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Where did Assistant Yang go?

436
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,240
Have you seen him?

437
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,120
Because he's very suspicious

438
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,840
There's something wrong with him

439
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,320
No

440
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,680
Because Assistant Yang was right on this stage earlier

441
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,840
Right here

442
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,360
You're in this room

443
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
It's impossible you didn't notice all the equipment's

444
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,400
every movement

445
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,280
You're being too calm

446
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
Telling us about this

447
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,960
You're not even in a hurry to have us

448
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,640
unlock the door for you

449
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,280
When I came to

450
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,520
I kept pressing these buttons

451
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,160
And then

452
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,240
I wanted you to come save me

453
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,640
So he didn't see the "murder" happen

454
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,480
Freedom can't be found

455
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,920
I have a wonderful mother

456
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,600
I'll listen to you

457
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,600
30 years old

458
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,120
I'm outside the door of happiness

459
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,280
But can never enter

460
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
What is this thing? Speak up.

461
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,080
A butler that can "die".

462
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,000
Do not attend the family recognition banquet

463
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,200
Disobedience will lead to "death"

464
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,400
Disobedience will lead to "death"

465
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,240
Brothers

466
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,600
Song Huo who will "die"

467
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,280
Song Huo has "died"

468
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Do not approach the abandoned power distribution room

469
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,000
The butler who will "die"

470
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,680
Do not attend the family recognition banquet

471
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,720
The deputy manager who will "die"

472
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,960
The deputy manager has "died"

473
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,560
Xiao Xiao Wang who will "die"

474
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,160
Do not go to Chuyang Alley

475
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,480
And us

476
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,200
Everyone listed here will "die"

477
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,920
Those people who "died" before

478
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
The dolls that appeared at the scene

479
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,800
Were all sent by you

480
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,760
Did you send them?

481
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,600
Yes, I sent them

482
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,120
Since you made all those dolls

483
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,240
Then you must also know

484
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,680
Those dolls also include us

485
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,480
Dolls of each one of us

486
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes, all five of us are in the dolls

487
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,280
Why are all our dolls there?

488
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,800
Why did you make dolls of us?

489
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,480
So about five days ago, were you present

490
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,400
around my handicraft store?

491
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:38,880
Yes.

492
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,080
When I was passing through the commercial street,

493
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,760
I saw your store was open for business,

494
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,840
so I wanted to check how business was doing.

495
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,520
But then I suddenly noticed

496
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,400
the dolls I sent over

497
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
with "death" warnings

498
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,480
were all displayed in your store.

499
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,240
These were all previously

500
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,560
retrieved from the scene.

501
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,200
I found it very strange

502
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,360
why these dolls were with you.

503
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,880
But when I got home, I asked you

504
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,840
about these dolls,

505
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,000
and you said you didn't know.

506
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,880
This matter

507
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,240
I

508
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,920
don't really want to bring up.

509
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,440
What is this?

510
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,520
Musical staff

511
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,520
Sing it out

512
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
Inside that "death" doll of his

513
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,640
all the music

514
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,120
has always been this particular tune

515
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,720
What is this music?

516
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,400
I sometimes hear it

517
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
in the apartment

518
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,440
this music

519
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,080
I think this music

520
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,720
is quite ominous

521
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,000
It's very suitable

522
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,960
for warning them

523
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,880
about their impending "death"

524
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,680
He didn't compose this

525
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,800
He heard it in the building

526
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,760
Wait, then how would you know

527
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,120
who's going to "die"?

528
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,160
Actually...

529
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,840
I have the ability to predict the future

530
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,000
I accidentally discovered

531
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,400
what will happen to them in the future

532
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,680
Just like what you saw earlier in the room

533
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,440
that cup you saw

534
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,960
made with Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Tea

535
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,320
Ruby Grapefruit Honeydew Ice

536
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,120
I also knew

537
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,840
that Song Piaoliang would create it

538
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,680
I'll never forget

539
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,240
the taste of tea and fruit combined

540
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,640
Since you can foresee the future,

541
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,120
can you foresee

542
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,800
our futures?

543
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,200
I

544
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,920
can actually foresee your futures,

545
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,120
but I can't tell you.

546
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,960
Because

547
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,520
if I tell you,

548
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,640
it might cause some

549
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,360
uncontrollable consequences.

550
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,200
Heaven's secrets must not be revealed.

551
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,800
Divine mysteries cannot be disclosed.

552
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,000
Should we believe such far-fetched claims?

553
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,680
I don't know.

554
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm skeptical too.

555
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,880
There are several pages

556
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,000
recording everyone's life paths.

557
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,880
Did you write that?

558
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,640
Yes.

559
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,880
Because I foresaw your futures,

560
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,720
so I

561
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
recorded them in the manuscript.

562
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,880
Then I wanted to change some people's lives,

563
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,000
so I crossed them out

564
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,800
and wrote their new futures.

565
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,160
Wait,

566
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,680
why did you change Zhao Budao's

567
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,920
and Zhang Singer's fates?

568
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,280
Yes, those two.

569
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,520
What's their connection to you?

570
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,120
Because one day I accidentally gained

571
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,280
the ability to foresee the future.

572
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,120
Then I foresaw that

573
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,200
Song Piaoliang

574
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,480
would be my true love.

575
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,320
But Piaoliang

576
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,840
wouldn't be very happy in the future.

577
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,360
Right.

578
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,600
Because she had two friends

579
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,640
One was

580
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,320
Zhang Singer,

581
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,400
we were good friends.

582
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,680
And the other was

583
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,320
Zhao Budao.

584
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,960
They both had many problems

585
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,080
and constantly vented lots of

586
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,600
negativity to you.

587
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,560
Worries and negativity.

588
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,360
So you became depressed.

589
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,840
I wanted to change their fate

590
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,240
to keep them away from beauty

591
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
so they could live better lives

592
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,160
But in the end I realized

593
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,960
that it seems no one

594
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,720
is truly living that happily

595
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
So you just love her

596
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,640
You love her

597
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,680
and then what you do

598
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,000
is something like this

599
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,520
altering other people's lives

600
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:36,960
hurting others

601
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,560
loving her in this way

602
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,920
This isn't some roundabout way to save the situation

603
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,040
Just treat me well by my side

604
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,840
and fill my days with positivity

605
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,680
Wouldn't that be enough?

606
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,120
How did you change their fates?

607
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
What methods did you use?

608
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,040
I don't actually have the power to change fate

609
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,320
I just made some changes

610
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,960
using external forces

611
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,080
at crucial moments

612
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,800
Zhao Budao

613
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
I foresaw in advance

614
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,920
that you would transfer to Niubanjin Affiliated High School

615
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,200
and reunite with your mother

616
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
But

617
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,800
you kept complaining

618
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,960
about your mother forcing you to do things you disliked

619
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,480
You're adventurous

620
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,320
Yes, pursuing freedom

621
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,080
So I made you miss your mother

622
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,920
Delaying your reunion

623
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Did you know during high school

624
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,000
someone paid your tuition?

625
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,600
Are you saying it was you?

626
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,360
Yes, I paid it

627
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,000
To prevent her transfer

628
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,240
Solving the problem at its root beforehand

629
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,200
Right

630
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,280
But I never expected

631
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,240
you'd still be lonely

632
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,760
missing your mother

633
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,920
while she kept searching for you

634
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,800
Did you write those words at the back?

635
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,680
The words written in pencil at the back.

636
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,800
Pencil.

637
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,360
Yes.

638
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,280
That...

639
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,360
It was my precognition.

640
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,000
About singer Zhang's experiences.

641
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,200
She wasn't discovered until age 28.

642
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,000
She became very anxious.

643
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,520
She felt she was running out of time.

644
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,960
And would soon leave the group.

645
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,160
So...

646
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,760
I made her meet her discoverer

647
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,680
three years earlier.

648
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,760
But without those three years of

649
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,720
experience as a bar singer,

650
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,160
she couldn't write good songs anymore.

651
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:26,840
Nor could she

652
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,480
become as successful as she'd hoped.

653
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,280
But that last line in pencil...

654
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,360
Actually...

655
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,640
was just my own thought.

656
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,040
I wasn't certain about it.

657
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,720
Because of the uncertainty,

658
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,840
it was written in pencil.

659
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,480
That last line...

660
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,680
Just a draft, really.

661
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,880
For people whose memories you've altered,

662
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,400
or whose lives you've changed,

663
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,160
do their memories become inconsistent?

664
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,320
Like forgetting certain people,

665
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,000
not remembering others,

666
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,880
or not recognizing someone?

667
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,440
Yes.

668
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,480
Sometimes parallel universe memories

669
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,680
might surface, but I'm not sure.

670
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,840
Then why do you keep giving me medicine?

671
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,040
Because...

672
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,440
you keep telling me about

673
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,800
things we never experienced.

674
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,080
So I think your memory

675
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,200
might be confused.

676
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,960
Isn't that because of your medicine?

677
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,880
No.

678
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,640
Because your memories became confused

679
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,960
That's why I gave you the medicine

680
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,400
This medicine is called "Mind Clear"

681
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,320
No

682
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,080
Yes

683
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,160
But why can I clearly

684
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,640
Picture Zhang Wanou's face in my mind?

685
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,120
Zhang Wanou's face

686
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,480
Yes

687
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,240
I distinctly have this memory

688
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,680
I saw in the future

689
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,560
Piaoliang will meet a "scumbag"

690
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,360
That "scumbag" is Zhang Wanou

691
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,240
He's my subordinate

692
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,400
After being hurt by him

693
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,640
Piaoliang became even more depressed

694
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,280
Then two months later

695
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,240
you "committed suicide"

696
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,160
You were supposed to "commit suicide"

697
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,480
Did you jump to your death?

698
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,200
Yes

699
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,320
I jumped to my death

700
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,000
Yes

701
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,240
She's the one who jumped

702
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,480
But we saw this on May 6th

703
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,000
So,

704
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,840
I wanted to prevent that "scumbag" from meeting her,

705
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,240
so I paid to have him removed,

706
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,080
got him fired.

707
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,400
This way I could replace Zhang Doll

708
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,040
and keep staying by Song Pretty's side.

709
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,240
How touching.

710
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,080
He took the hit for me,

711
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,360
but I never expected

712
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,920
Pretty,

713
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,040
that missing that romantic experience

714
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,080
would change your outlook on life

715
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,160
and your views on love

716
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,120
so completely from mine.

717
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,800
This is good.

718
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,920
So the current you

719
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,720
doesn't like someone of my type.

720
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,200
What's wrong?

721
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,800
You've been avoiding me.

722
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,760
What's the matter?

723
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,880
You're not very happy.

724
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,280
Actually, going through all this,

725
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,600
I've come to realize

726
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
I shouldn't try to change others' lives,

727
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,680
because for every person,

728
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,080
the experiences they've had,

729
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,240
the people they've met,

730
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,600
the things they've done,

731
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
all shape who they are today -

732
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,720
an indispensable part.

733
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,240
I believe Zhang Singer,

734
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,600
with her three years of performing experience,

735
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,720
can definitely write better songs

736
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,320
and still become

737
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,480
an excellent singer-songwriter.

738
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
Zhao Budao,

739
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,080
you can still find your mother.

740
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,240
Dreams and family bonds

741
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,440
can be balanced properly.

742
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,240
And Song Pretty,

743
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,200
you can still

744
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,400
with Zhang Singer and Zhao Budao

745
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,600
remain good friends.

746
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,400
So we should be down-to-earth

747
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,240
and do everything properly,

748
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,760
not chase after society's timeline.

749
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,160
Right.

750
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
You scared me to "death"

751
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,080
Let him go now

752
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,400
What

753
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,120
Someone fainted

754
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,320
You need to take them to the infirmary quickly

755
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,520
Where are you?

756
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,640
We're at the puppet exhibit

757
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,480
We're in the office inside the puppet area

758
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,800
Okay, I'm coming right away

759
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,200
Xiao He, hurry!

760
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,920
Who fainted?

761
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,720
Here

762
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,760
What happened?

763
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,280
Xiao He, help him quickly! Save him!

764
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,160
I'll take him for medical help first

765
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,320
You've searched enough

766
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,720
Then come find me at the cafeteria

767
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,520
Okay

768
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,840
That's strange. He...

769
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,800
Is there any way...

770
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,240
to access his computer?

771
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,960
This computer is crucial.

772
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,120
Guys,

773
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,640
what's the password hint?

774
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,880
Happy birthday.

775
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,120
His birthday.

776
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,360
So his birthday is...

777
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,600
September 9th.

778
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,680
September 9th.

779
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,800
Right.

780
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,080
Assistant Yang's birthday is September 9th.

781
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,480
Correct.

782
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,200
0909.

783
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Okay, perfect.

784
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,120
Memo.

785
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
Solely responsible for doll museum security.

786
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,080
Second,

787
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,400
assist in organizing doll manuscripts.

788
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,120
Third, catalog and store dolls.

789
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,560
So these were Assistant Yang's tasks, right?

790
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:31,880
Yes.

791
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,560
His duties.

792
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,760
This is him as a child.

793
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,080
Look, there's a heart here.

794
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,640
There's a heart on his foot.

795
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,160
Assistant Yang...

796
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,680
"The deceased" is Assistant Yang.

797
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,000
"The deceased" is Assistant Yang.

798
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,080
Image editing software

799
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,960
Need to help him edit the photos

800
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,680
This is fabricated

801
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,840
Fake

802
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,440
Counterfeit

803
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,200
Forgery

804
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,960
If we had opened this earlier

805
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,520
We would have believed what he said

806
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:05,840
Right

807
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,440
I didn't write this

808
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,200
It's really not my handwriting

809
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,280
He forged it

810
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:13,960
So this person

811
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,160
Can actually predict the future

812
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
I have the ability to foresee the future

813
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,760
Two months from now

814
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,520
You will "commit suicide"

815
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,520
Song Piaoliang

816
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,720
She's the one who jumped off the building

817
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,320
I think so too

818
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,760
The one who jumped on our first day

819
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,480
Was Song Piaoliang

820
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,520
Endless loop

821
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
We came here to save you

822
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,720
If we don't rescue her

823
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,760
This incident will keep repeating

824
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,680
It will keep replaying

825
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,280
All this is to save her

826
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,240
If we fail

827
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,280
We'll all lose our memories and start over

828
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,680
Yes, it keeps repeating

829
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,720
We keep trying to save you over and over

830
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,200
Yes, save

831
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,480
Don't you think

832
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,120
It's terrible that I keep falling like that repeatedly

833
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,400
Song Piaoliang and her five useless men

834
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,920
Right

835
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,520
Here, this is the case report board.

836
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,760
Okay, thanks.

837
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,880
When we feel we've discussed enough later,

838
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,800
we can fill this out properly

839
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,480
and then go vote at the property management's monitoring room.

840
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,400
I'll submit all the relevant evidence

841
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,080
to the appropriate authorities.

842
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,960
Let's sort this out.

843
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,240
Today's "victim" is

844
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,440
Assistant Yang.

845
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,680
Because he has that

846
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,440
heart-shaped birthmark on his foot.

847
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,240
"Time of death" -

848
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,320
Do we have confirmation?

849
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,520
When he stopped answering calls

850
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,480
should actually be

851
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,720
the first call he missed,

852
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,240
which was at 10:30, right?

853
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,880
10:30.

854
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,720
Right.

855
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,000
So that means the cleaning robot at the end

856
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,120
was the "killer,"

857
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,520
used to cover up his "death,"

858
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,000
the timing

859
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,800
made it so we'd still see him moving

860
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,320
at 12 o'clock.

861
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,520
So the mirror's purpose was

862
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:12,880
Right,

863
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,520
to alter his "time of death,"

864
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,000
making us think he was still alive at noon.

865
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,720
Correct.

866
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,200
Who are the "suspects"?

867
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,680
"Suspects" first: Singer Zhang,

868
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,760
Auntie Zhao, Singer Zhang, Song Pretty.

869
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,480
Just these three.

870
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,920
Write "Song" bigger.

871
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,560
It's too small.

872
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,440
Stop talking, you all.

873
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,160
Why don't you just throw me in that box, huh?

874
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,640
A few of you can carry me over

875
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,160
and just dump me in.

876
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,240
Actually foreseeing her future,

877
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,640
the five of us

878
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,880
threw her off the building.

879
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,320
Zhang's motive was

880
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,160
she believed her life

881
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,480
was completely ruined by his writing

882
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,240
Right

883
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,280
So she wanted revenge

884
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,040
Correct

885
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,640
Auntie Zhao

886
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,240
wanted to save her daughter

887
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,400
from the doll's body

888
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,240
Song's "murder motive"

889
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,480
was believing her boyfriend

890
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,720
was "taken out" by him

891
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,600
Yes

892
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,840
"The killer" is you

893
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,640
You've also "gone crazy", sis

894
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,360
You've "gone crazy" too

895
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,680
Let's first sort out our old acquaintances

896
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,320
Alright?

897
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,200
Okay

898
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,360
Her mind couldn't have accomplished

899
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,760
this kind of "murder" method

900
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,600
Okay, eliminated

901
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
Okay, ruled out

902
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,240
Insufficient intelligence

903
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,800
IQ

904
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Very convincing

905
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,360
Too logical

906
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,480
Very persuasive

907
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,160
Our reasoning must be logical

908
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,200
Be reasonable

909
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,600
Right?

910
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,080
Song's motive doesn't seem that strong.

911
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,760
Or perhaps she's hiding something.

912
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,880
Mainly because she doesn't know enough.

913
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,440
Right now, everything about her

914
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,400
is confined to a romantic relationship.

915
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,280
It hasn't yet involved

916
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,320
her life being manipulated

917
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,280
or seeking revenge.

918
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,240
Alright, I trust you.

919
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,400
Let's talk about the process first, friends

920
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,639
Let's discuss

921
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,440
Just "strangle" him

922
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,840
Then put him on stage

923
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,600
Then lower that mirror down

924
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,280
Then follow us

925
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,239
After sneaking in together

926
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,880
secretly pressed those three buttons

927
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,320
But with familiarity of the stage setup

928
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,440
Which of these three people

929
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,320
do you think could do it?

930
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,440
Who could be so familiar with his stage?

931
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,080
What if we think one step further

932
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,280
Could it possibly be about dolls?

933
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,520
Yang, the assistant from "Kill"

934
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,360
Yang, the assistant from the doll "Kill"

935
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,840
I just feel that

936
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,920
the doll is

937
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
Why do you think it's him?

938
00:34:59,240 --> 00:34:59,720
Right.

939
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,680
The advantage of using dolls in the crime

940
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,960
There are plenty of resources to exploit.

941
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,040
His position

942
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,440
His control over Assistant Yang

943
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,560
The manipulation of this relationship

944
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,640
Understanding these people

945
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,720
including everything he knows

946
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,200
about everyone's lives

947
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,960
including those things in the control room

948
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,360
gives him a significant advantage

949
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,120
So he

950
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,720
couldn't be this straightforward

951
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,040
Wait, let's assume

952
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,720
Lai Wanou

953
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,400
truly has the ability to foresee the future

954
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,080
If he could foresee

955
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,640
that he would be "attacked"

956
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
he could plan a countermove

957
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,560
Right

958
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,640
Why paint his face

959
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,440
like that?

960
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,800
Just to make people mistake

961
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,720
him for Lai Wanou

962
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,840
Another possibility is

963
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,200
Assistant Yang painted it himself

964
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,920
Yes, because he was replacing him today

965
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,640
Right

966
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,840
Because the fabricated evidence was fake

967
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,720
But

968
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,120
Yang's chat with mom was real

969
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,680
Yang's hatred for Lai was real

970
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,760
If Lai knew about this

971
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,240
he could use it

972
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,720
To protect himself

973
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,800
he turned the tables

974
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,400
So he turned the tables

975
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,480
and "killed" Assistant Yang

976
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,280
He "killed" him

977
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,160
But objectively speaking

978
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,040
what I just said

979
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,200
only forms

980
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,360
Lai's "motive for murder"

981
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,720
Right

982
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,560
There's no way to prove

983
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,840
anything definitive

984
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,960
But there's one problem

985
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,280
The reason we could enter

986
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,240
that little nest inside

987
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,120
was because

988
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,600
he suggested we play hide-and-seek

989
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,160
"Let's play hide-and-seek together"

990
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,400
"Hide quickly"

991
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,480
So we were meant to go inside

992
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,120
This is just a movable container

993
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,440
It was because of hide-and-seek

994
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,240
that you two hid in the cabinet

995
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,920
Exactly

996
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,320
Right

997
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,440
He's been guiding us

998
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,920
through everything

999
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,440
Yes, he's been leading us

1000
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,560
I now believe

1001
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
that the puppet is good

1002
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,760
The "killer" designed this setup

1003
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,800
to tell us

1004
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,640
he's been with us

1005
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,800
He had no time to commit the crime

1006
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,200
Right

1007
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,160
Think about when we first passed by

1008
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,240
the mirror was there

1009
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,360
and never came out again

1010
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,600
The remote was also outside

1011
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,320
He must have

1012
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,080
when we went to the hallway

1013
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,440
pressed the remote

1014
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,360
and stuffed that thing into the cabinet

1015
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,560
Yes

1016
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,880
So the "killer" must be

1017
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,400
among our group

1018
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:41,720
Correct

1019
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,520
The ones who were with us at that time were

1020
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,160
Auntie Zhao

1021
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,080
Auntie Zhao and Zhang Ge (hand)

1022
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,920
When we discovered

1023
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,640
that the "corpse" was Assistant Yang's,

1024
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,840
there were two possibilities:

1025
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,240
The first being

1026
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,920
that Assistant Yang was the intended "victim,"

1027
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,960
but the other possibility is that the killer thought

1028
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,560
they were "killing" Lai Wanou,

1029
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:35,960
they were "killing" Lai Wanou.

1030
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,080
Doll Museum

1031
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,760
Security inside the museum is handled by designated personnel

1032
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Every day at 11 AM

1033
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,680
Designated personnel open the museum's verification gate

1034
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,120
Verification failed

1035
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,800
This Life Doll Museum

1036
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,680
Is opened by designated personnel at 11 AM daily

1037
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,200
They open the verification at the entrance

1038
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,280
Then members

1039
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,920
Enter first

1040
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,240
Right

1041
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,760
Because we can only enter at 12 PM

1042
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,120
Members get early access

1043
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,760
Assistant Yang

1044
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,000
He's the one specifically in charge of this

1045
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Because his computer records state

1046
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,480
He's the designated person in charge

1047
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
He ultimately let everyone in

1048
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,600
Which means at 11 AM

1049
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,680
It was opened on time

1050
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,080
If he "died" at 10:30

1051
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,440
He couldn't have opened it then, right

1052
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,840
Let's assume it was 10:30

1053
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,960
If he didn't answer the phone

1054
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,360
that would prove he was "dead"

1055
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,760
Then who opened the door at 11?

1056
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,880
Probably the "killer" opened it

1057
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,400
Meaning the "killer" knew

1058
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,120
the "victim" was Assistant Yang

1059
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,120
Only the "killer" would know

1060
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,280
that the "victim" was Assistant Yang

1061
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,480
and would open the door for him

1062
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,120
While Song Piaoliang might have

1063
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,000
a "motive to kill" the doll

1064
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,640
But towards Assistant Yang

1065
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,920
she had no "motive to kill"

1066
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,360
So Song Piaoliang is ruled out

1067
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,480
Singer Zhang mentioned something

1068
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,480
related to Assistant Yang, right?

1069
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,880
Assistant Yang invited her

1070
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,880
Zhang knew Yang

1071
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,160
and was aware of his existence

1072
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,200
Assistant Yang invited me to

1073
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,760
today's new product launch

1074
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,200
We knew each other before

1075
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,280
She saw that video

1076
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,520
In that video

1077
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,160
didn't it say he took

1078
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,520
the production method from Assistant Yang?

1079
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,760
Assistant Yang, come help quickly

1080
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,440
Did you take the doll production manuscript

1081
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,720
to your office to review?

1082
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,480
So might she think those words

1083
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,520
were added by Assistant Yang?

1084
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:26,560
were added by Assistant Yang?

1085
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,640
As for Mother Zhao, as long as

1086
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,400
she could save her child

1087
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,760
she didn't specifically target

1088
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,880
the doll or Assistant Yang

1089
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,960
Anyone who could control the doll

1090
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,840
could be "killed"

1091
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,200
So Assistant Yang

1092
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,560
was probably wearing

1093
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,720
the new doll outfit meant for display

1094
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,360
So Mother Zhao mistook

1095
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,200
the assistant for the doll's controller

1096
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,680
and "killed" him

1097
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,680
My mother has always been painting

1098
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,920
Back in 2010

1099
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,120
I was painting

1100
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,920
while making a living

1101
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,520
She kept painting and running her business

1102
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,840
So her understanding of spatial design

1103
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,840
and the concept of refraction

1104
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,240
might be more extensive

1105
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,680
That might be related

1106
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,760
Possibly

1107
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,000
Then at 10:30

1108
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,560
Who could be there? Who went?

1109
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,920
The front gate doesn't open until 11 o'clock.

1110
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,440
The front gate doesn't open until 11 o'clock.

1111
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,960
But the back door might be different?

1112
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,680
It's mainly about those two suspects.

1113
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,280
They kept going in and out repeatedly.

1114
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,560
But they claimed only twice.

1115
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,960
It's unlikely it was just twice.

1116
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,360
Right.

1117
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,320
"The killer" could be lying.

1118
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,920
Let's cast our votes first.

1119
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,960
Never thought

1120
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,720
that one day

1121
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,000
I would appear on this too.

1122
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,360
Let's analyze them one by one.

1123
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,720
First, I think

1124
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,560
Lai Wan'ou

1125
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,360
I do believe

1126
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,000
what he said.

1127
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,400
I think it holds up.

1128
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,840
That leaves only two suspects.

1129
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,920
One is Singer Zhang,

1130
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,760
and the other is Mother Zhao.

1131
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,960
One did it for their dream,

1132
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,800
while the other

1133
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,200
did it for their beloved daughter.

1134
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,400
Then there's Song Piaoliang.

1135
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,280
Song Piaoliang is

1136
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,080
a really good person.

1137
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,600
So I'll vote for

1138
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,640
Today's "murder" method

1139
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,920
was very complex.

1140
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,760
It required utilizing

1141
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,840
all the details and mechanisms of the doll museum.

1142
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,960
The only one who could know the museum so well

1143
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,200
would be its owner,

1144
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,840
Lai Wan'ou.

1145
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,200
Moreover, Lai Wanou is also very likely

1146
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,600
to have discovered

1147
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,600
in Assistant Yang's computer

1148
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,040
a plan to replace Lai Wanou

1149
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,000
with fabricated evidence.

1150
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,640
So I think

1151
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,760
the real culprit tonight

1152
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,080
should be

1153
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,920
Lai Wanou.

1154
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,040
Because this remote control was

1155
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,760
found at the scene.

1156
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,440
During this time period,

1157
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,400
Lai Wanou was locked in the control room.

1158
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,760
So there is a time discrepancy.

1159
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,320
Among them, the one with the strongest motive

1160
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,080
is Singer Zhang

1161
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,920
and my mother.

1162
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,920
But my mother has always made a living through painting,

1163
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,720
so she is very familiar with spatial design

1164
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,640
and concepts like refraction.

1165
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,040
She has a deep understanding of these.

1166
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,760
She has been in and out of this exhibition hall multiple times before,

1167
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,680
and is very familiar with the routes.

1168
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,760
So I choose my mother.

1169
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,920
The person who knows Assistant Yang is Assistant Yang

1170
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,120
is only one person.

1171
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,120
So I cast my vote for the "culprit" to

1172
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,520
"The perpetrator" can only be narrowed down to

1173
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,080
either Zhang Ge or Auntie Zhao.

1174
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,680
I think this reasoning holds up.

1175
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,720
The time when Auntie Zhao took her medicine

1176
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,360
was at 11:30.

1177
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,080
Which means before 11:30,

1178
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,280
she was in an extremely unstable state.

1179
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,840
I don't believe

1180
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,880
that in such an unstable condition

1181
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,800
she could have set up this entire series of arrangements.

1182
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,560
Therefore my conclusion is

1183
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,160
Zhang Ge.

1184
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,240
The "perpetrator" I've finally identified is

1185
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,280
Zhang Ge.

1186
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,600
Because I recalled that this afternoon

1187
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
when we were in the property management's surveillance room

1188
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,840
conducting interviews,

1189
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,240
you were all like me -

1190
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,720
just puppets.

1191
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,280
Only when the puppeteer "dies"

1192
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,880
do the puppets become uncontrollable.

1193
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,400
She kept

1194
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,760
trying to implant this notion in us:

1195
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,560
that

1196
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,160
"I'm a puppet, and you're all puppets too."

1197
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,320
But now we're human,

1198
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,880
because this person has "died."

1199
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,160
Doesn't this confirm

1200
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,640
that she was manipulating dummies in the verification hall

1201
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,680
precisely to prove

1202
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,520
that "puppets can kill"?

1203
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,200
That's why during the interviews

1204
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,080
she kept feeding

1205
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,040
the investigation team

1206
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,760
with this particular logic.

1207
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,480
That's why I ultimately chose

1208
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,520
Zhang Ge.

1209
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:51,920
Thank you.

1210
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,520
We've finally figured out

1211
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,200
who the prophecy doll belongs to.

1212
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,880
But I want to say

1213
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,840
why does the doll

1214
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,440
predict their "deaths"?

1215
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,120
Because he claims to predict

1216
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,640
"I have the ability to foresee the future."

1217
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,200
But why exactly does the doll

1218
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,720
possess prophetic abilities?

1219
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,480
How exactly does he do it?

1220
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,200
Also, another thing -

1221
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,640
Singer Zhang and Mother Zhao are strange too.

1222
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,600
Why do they have mismatched memories?

1223
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,200
Right, I'm sure it's not that simple.

1224
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,000
Why does the doll have a

1225
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,400
photo of Guo Ba and Old Man Li together?

1226
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,480
How do these three know each other?

1227
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,520
What's their connection?

1228
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,920
Yeah, I find it really strange too.

1229
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,120
This "You Meet" organization of theirs -

1230
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,120
we've seen it six times now.

1231
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,280
Why are they involved every time?

1232
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,880
Although this doll claims

1233
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,440
he has prevented

1234
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,480
Song Pretty and Zhang Doll from being together,

1235
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,680
why does Song Pretty still have

1236
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,600
memories about her and Zhang Doll?

1237
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,920
Forget it, don't overthink it.

1238
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,200
Let's get our beauty sleep.

1239
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:05,960
I'm exhausted.

1240
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,080
Don't forget this weekend

1241
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,640
we promised my brother we'd help him with work.

1242
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,840
Then clean the third-floor terrace.

1243
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,520
Especially remove the small ads on the third-floor terrace.

1244
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,440
Our building's so-called "Seaview Terrace"

1245
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,880
has turned into a small ad platform.

1246
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,480
And according to my brother,

1247
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,640
there are even missing daughter posters.

1248
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,200
It seems this Auntie Zhao previously

1249
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,320
had been putting up missing person notices

1250
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,680
on the observation deck.

1251
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,840
Alright, got it, no problem.

1252
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,760
No worries, let's go together.

1253
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,640
Many hands make light work.

1254
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,560
Don't worry.

1255
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,080
Our brother's business is our own business.

1256
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,040
See you tomorrow.

1257
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,720
Welcome everyone

1258
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,320

00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,440
Let's go

1269
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,160
Thank you

1270
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,560
Today I'm taking the lead

1271
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,640
Enough talk, thank you all

1272
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,240
Today's "killing"

1273
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:17,960
was quite enjoyable

1274
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,520
You did the "killing"

1275
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,520
What did you think I was invited for?

1276
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,320
To have you "kill"

1277
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,000
Is that something to be proud of?

1278
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Who would've thought

1279
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,360
She'll be locked up tomorrow

1280
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,920
Next episode she'll send her sister

1281
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,040
Song Meili

1282
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,400
Right?

1283
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,240
Okay

1284
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,240

First, let's toast to celebrate

1287
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,160
completing today's deduction plan

1288
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:39,800
Here

1289
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,240
Let's complete it

1290
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,680
Now let's take a sip

1291
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,000

Let's reveal the truth together

1294
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,480
Congratulations on completing today's deduction

1295
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,080
Next we'll announce

1296
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,840
the truth of this episode's case

1297
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,040
In today's case,

1298
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,800
the suspects identified by all players are:

1299
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,360
Auntie Zhao

1300
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,680
Singer Zhang

1301
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,280
Song Pretty

1302
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:07,880
Lai Wan'ou

1303
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,720
four individuals.

1304
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,480
After investigation and deduction,

1305
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,040
the "killer" voted by everyone

1306
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,880
received votes from three people.

1307
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,200
Three people.

1308
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:20,760
Lai Wan'ou

1309
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,400
Auntie Zhao

1310
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,120
Auntie Zhao

1311
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,960
Singer Zhang

1312
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,960
But the actual "killer" was Song Pretty.

1313
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,000
I told you it was her!

1314
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,680
The perfect criminal.

1315
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,080
The perfect criminal.

1316
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,320
Two people received the highest votes:

1317
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,520
namely

1318
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,920
Singer Zhang

1319
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,320
Auntie Zhao

1320
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,200
both receiving three votes each.

1321
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,880
Those who voted for Singer Zhang were:

1322
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,360
Ke Wuku

1323
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,200
Guo Baoyou

1324
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:47,880
and Liu Xialai.

1325
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,880
Those who voted for Auntie Zhao are

1326
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,200
Song Piaoliang

1327
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,680
Bai Sanwan

1328
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,040
and Zhao Budao

1329
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,360
She pulled off a move of righteous betrayal in the end

1330
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,560
and voted her own mother out

1331
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,000
Was your choice the right one?

1332
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,560
So what we've locked onto is

1333
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,200
today's case

1334
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,840
Today's case

1335
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,000
Tied vote

1336
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,480
Then there's no

1337
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,800
such thing as successful or failed deduction

1338
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,400
Right?

1339
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,960
Not necessarily, what if it's the doll

1340
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,840
Then we'd fail

1341
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,000
Understood

1342
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,760
The real "culprit" is

1343
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,440
Singer Zhang

1344
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,920
The "culprit" is

1345
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,880
Mother Zhao

1346
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,200
What was I saying

1347
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,680
Why did I exclude

1348
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,520
Auntie Zhao

1349
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,240
It's because

1350
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,680
After she committed the crime at 10:30

1351
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,680
Didn't we see her downstairs

1352
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,760
around 11 o'clock?

1353
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,360
Right

1354
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:58,800
I feel

1355
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,760
If I were the "killer"

1356
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,880
She'd need nerves of steel

1357
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,440
I mean

1358
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,480
Aren't you the detective team?

1359
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,480
I "killed someone"

1360
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,240
You come to

1361
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,800
the dollhouse

1362
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,320
Yes, I'm acting in front of you

1363
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,480
I'm "crazy"

1364
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,840
Right, come and see

1365
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,160
Then she has an alibi

1366
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,520
To be honest

1367
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,520
I didn't think that far

1368
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,720
Is there any crucial evidence?

1369
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,280
There's no physical evidence

1370
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:29,920
that everyone missed

1371
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:31,960
But

1372
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,920
there's logic pointing to Auntie Zhao

1373
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:37,960
Does everyone remember

1374
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,560
what Auntie Zhao said at the beginning?

1375
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,160
How come you still don't know her?

1376
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,880
You should know her by now.

1377
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,200
Zhao is gone

1378
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,600
She thought after "killing" someone

1379
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,680
you should be able to remember Zhao is gone

1380
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,200
and break free from control

1381
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,080
The key is Zhao's mother

1382
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,680
She's already in a delusional state

1383
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,360
She's not in a normal mental state

1384
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,480
Auntie Zhao indeed

1385
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,960
"killed" someone at 10:30

1386
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,560
After she "killed" that person

1387
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,200
she didn't know where Zhao Budao was

1388
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,760
But in her twisted logic

1389
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,840
Song Piaoliang was the closest to the dollhouse

1390
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,360
and the only person she could confirm

1391
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,680
So she came to find Song Piaoliang

1392
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,120
Zhao's mother

1393
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,280
When she saw her daughter

1394
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,080
Zhao Budao's doll

1395
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,560
she noticed on the tag

1396
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,120
there was a signature

1397
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,320
"Yang"

1398
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,800
She had seen the exact same signature

1399
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,760
in Assistant Yang's office

1400
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,280
For Zhao's mother

1401
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,400
the person she wanted to "kill"

1402
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,760
was the creator of this doll

1403
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,480
the signer

1404
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,920
She wanted to "kill" Yang

1405
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,600
Because after "killing" Yang

1406
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,800
she even did Yang's

1407
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,440
11 o'clock door-opening task

1408
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,080
Right, she needed to know Yang was Yang

1409
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,320
otherwise no one could enter

1410
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,240
Yes

1411
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,120
Moreover, Zhao's mother repeatedly showed everyone

1412
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,880
her pillbox

1413
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,600
"I have this"

1414
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,080
this

1415
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,560
"I took my medicine at 11:30 today"

1416
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,920
The button in the middle of her pillbox

1417
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,920
when pressed

1418
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,880
can set the timer for the pillbox

1419
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,840
So she might not have

1420
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,960
actually taken the medicine at that time

1421
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,000
She was just pretending to be "crazy"

1422
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,480
Yes, exactly

1423
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,400
We also asked her about that pillbox

1424
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,560
how many pills it actually contained

1425
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,320
but she didn't say

1426
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,560
Instead she turned it around

1427
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,680
She said "When you're sick,

1428
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,720
do you count your pills?"

1429
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,320
Putting them in

1430
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,320
Right, she turned it around

1431
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,440
The three who chose Zhao's mother

1432
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,840
were Zhao Budao,

1433
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,280
Song Piaoliang,

1434
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,600
and Bai Sanwan

1435
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,080
Alright

1436
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,280
The Qiao family descendants can really act

1437
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,680
Impressive

1438
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,560
Brilliant, impressive

1439
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,280
Zhao's mother is searching

1440
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,400
for her daughter Zhao Budao

1441
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,360
and discovers the existence of the Doll Museum

1442
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,280
Inside the Doll Museum

1443
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:40,840
she sees

1444
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,800
a doll identical to her daughter

1445
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,400
and hears the doll

1446
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,560
calling out "Mom"

1447
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,280
"I have a wonderful mom"

1448
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:46,960
"Mom"

1449
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,880
This causes Zhao's mother, already tormented

1450
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,400
by the guilt of losing her daughter over a decade ago

1451
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,320
to snap completely

1452
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,000
Her fragile nerves shatter

1453
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,120
Initially, Zhao's mother intended

1454
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,560
to steal her daughter's doll

1455
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,200
but upon hearing approaching footsteps

1456
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,200
she is forced to hide

1457
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,520
When she reappears

1458
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,920
she finds the display platform for Zhao Budao

1459
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,800
has been put away

1460
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,960
Zhao's mother searches frantically

1461
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,880
throughout the entire Doll Museum

1462
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,520
for a way to open the display platform

1463
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,080
At this point, she also notices

1464
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,320
the signature on Zhao Budao's doll case

1465
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,040
Later, in Assistant Yang's office

1466
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,720
she spots the same signature

1467
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,280
This leads her to believe

1468
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,240
that Assistant Yang is the creator of her daughter's doll

1469
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,880
Though it seems unbelievable,

1470
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,360
Zhao's mother had no choice but to accept

1471
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,160
that her daughter had been turned into a doll

1472
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,720
by the dollmaker, Assistant Yang,

1473
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,760
which caused everyone in this world

1474
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,240
to forget about Zhao Budao.

1475
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,400
To save her daughter,

1476
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,760
Zhao's mother became obsessed with the idea

1477
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,280
that if the dollmaker "died,"

1478
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,200
her daughter could break free from his control,

1479
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,480
turn back into a human,

1480
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,280
and return to her side.

1481
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,400
So she began plotting

1482
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,880
a perfect scheme

1483
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,240
to "kill" the dollmaker

1484
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,960
while clearing herself of suspicion,

1485
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,840
so she could continue to be with her daughter

1486
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,080
after she returned.

1487
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,480
To cover her tracks,

1488
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,760
she decided to use the doll museum's

1489
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,360
long-standing eerie legends

1490
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,520
to disguise the dollmaker's "death"

1491
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,120
as a supernatural incident

1492
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,440
of a doll "committing murder."

1493
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,120
While searching through the doll museum,

1494
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,200
Zhao's mother had familiarized herself

1495
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,360
with its layout

1496
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,440
and examined many of its props,

1497
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,040
all of which inspired

1498
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,120
her sinister plan.

1499
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,920
One day before the incident

1500
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,400
Auntie Zhao set the medicine box alarm to 10 o'clock

1501
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,840
10 AM on the day of the incident

1502
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,840
After taking her medicine with the box's reminder

1503
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,160
Auntie Zhao, now fully lucid

1504
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,720
went straight to the doll exhibition hall

1505
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,720
10:30 AM

1506
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,200
Auntie Zhao sneaked in through the back door

1507
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,640
and saw Assistant Yang, who had just changed clothes

1508
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,560
and was preparing for that day's

1509
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,280
new doll product launch event

1510
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,360
She rushed forward and "strangled" Assistant Yang

1511
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,160
then hid the "corpse" on the stage

1512
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,240
Afterward, Auntie Zhao carried out a series of disguises

1513
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,560
First step

1514
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,120
Use the mirror prop from backstage

1515
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,320
Tilt it at an angle to block the "corpse"

1516
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,200
The entire exhibition hall

1517
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,000
has dim lighting

1518
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,960
and the stage has

1519
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,720
narrowly spaced fabric partitions

1520
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,240
which can perfectly conceal the "corpse"

1521
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,520
creating the illusion

1522
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,040
of an empty stage

1523
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,280
Step Two

1524
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,640
After setting up the stage,

1525
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,840
to obscure the actual time of Assistant Yang's "death,"

1526
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,000
Mother Zhao then used the corridor

1527
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,240
adjacent to the puppet museum's reception window,

1528
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,080
which forms a 90-degree angle,

1529
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,480
utilizing a robotic vacuum cleaner,

1530
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,160
an easel,

1531
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,960
and an extra set of clothes

1532
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,040
previously seen in Assistant Yang's office

1533
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,440
to create a human silhouette.

1534
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,880
The long, floor-length cloak

1535
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,840
would get caught in the vacuum's rollers

1536
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,240
as it moved,

1537
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,400
creating the illusion of someone falling.

1538
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,880
Then she used a latch

1539
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,480
to lock the small door connecting the reception to the corridor,

1540
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,280
trapping all visitors

1541
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,400
in the reception area.

1542
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,880
This forced them to witness through the mirror behind the painting

1543
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,040
the robotic vacuum's disguised silhouette

1544
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,840
enter the lit area and collapse,

1545
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,160
making everyone believe

1546
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,080
the puppeteer was still alive at that time.

1547
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,120
Step Three

1548
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,320
The puppet museum's verification door

1549
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,840
could only be opened by Assistant Yang.

1550
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,240
Now that Assistant Yang was "dead,"

1551
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,320
no one could open the verification door,

1552
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,400
so Mother Zhao had to

1553
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,520
open it herself as Yang's substitute

1554
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,640
to proceed with her plan.

1555
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,560
Step Four

1556
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,600
She placed the new puppet scheduled for release today,

1557
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,600
the "Mischievous Magician,"

1558
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,280
along with a top hat prop in the corridor.

1559
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,080
After completing these preparations,

1560
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,680
Mother Zhao took

1561
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,360
the remote for the painting-mirror door,

1562
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,960
the prop reel remote,

1563
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,440
and the top hat prop's remote,

1564
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,880
and exited through the back door.

1565
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,680
Around 11 o'clock,

1566
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,600
Mother Zhao believed

1567
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,040
the puppeteer had "died,"

1568
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,440
so her daughter Zhao Budao should

1569
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,200
regain her freedom and humanity,

1570
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,880
and reappear in others' memories.

1571
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,680
In the dollhouse warehouse

1572
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,800
Zhao's mother couldn't find her daughter who should have turned back human

1573
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,480
Mother Zhao

1574
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,920
She could only go to the nearest person from the dollhouse

1575
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,080
Song Piaoliang

1576
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,280
to verify if she remembered Zhao Budao

1577
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,320
But to create her alibi

1578
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,360
before going there

1579
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,280
Mother Zhao set the medicine box time to 11:30

1580
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,120
and appeared before everyone

1581
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,600
acting "crazy"

1582
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,040
(already included in #1580)

1583
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,680
Do you know her?

1584
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,480
I don't know her

1585
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,600
How could you not know her?

1586
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,720
After receiving Song Piaoliang's negative response

1587
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,400
Mother Zhao desperately tried to hide her

1588
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,680
panic and shock

1589
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,600
She convinced herself it might need more time

1590
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,000
so she had to continue her scheme

1591
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,080
Maybe her daughter would return soon

1592
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,120
So before the detective team

1593
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,240
Mother Zhao didn't show any panic

1594
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,680
Instead she emphasized the dollhouse's

1595
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,200
horrifying legend of "dolls turning human"

1596
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,440
and humans turning into dolls

1597
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,120
wanting to plant in the detectives' minds

1598
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,800
the preposterous idea of

1599
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,040
"dolls committing murder"

1600
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,920
Afterwards, Mother Zhao changed her clothes.

1601
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,120
At twelve o'clock,

1602
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,600
she pretended to have just woken up

1603
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,600
and came to the Doll House.

1604
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,920
She didn't expect Song Piaoliang and others

1605
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,720
to also appear at the Doll House.

1606
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,680
But this didn't affect her plan.

1607
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,240
The cleaning robot,

1608
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,560
according to schedule, began moving.

1609
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,520
As planned,

1610
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,840
someone indeed spotted the doll maker's figure.

1611
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,360
They saw him collapse to the ground.

1612
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,160
Before she could remind them,

1613
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,400
everyone easily found the back door.

1614
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,840
When leaving the front desk,

1615
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,360
Mother Zhao pressed the remote control

1616
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,840
to close the painting-mirror door,

1617
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,000
also concealing the clues about the fake figure.

1618
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,600
When everyone entered the exhibition hall,

1619
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,480
the seemingly "empty" stage

1620
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,680
didn't arouse any suspicion.

1621
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,880
As everyone entered the corridor

1622
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,440
and left the exhibition hall,

1623
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,800
she pressed the remote to detonate the top hat

1624
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,000
while simultaneously activating the mirror prop's reel,

1625
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,280
removing the mirror to reveal the "corpse."

1626
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,680
This created the illusion that the doll maker

1627
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,000
was on this corridor

1628
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,280
when he was "strangled" by the mischievous

1629
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,320
magician's doll.

1630
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,280
The doll then made the doll maker's "corpse"

1631
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,440
teleport to the stage as a supernatural phenomenon.

1632
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,840
After completing all this,

1633
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,800
Mother Zhao, in the dim exhibition hall,

1634
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,280
secretly threw the three remote controls

1635
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,440
back into the display case

1636
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,520
and locked the door.

1637
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,720
Then she followed the crowd

1638
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,360
and left the Doll House.

1639
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,440
Next,

1640
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,480
Bai Sanwan and Song Piaoliang,

1641
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,880
please collect from behind

1642
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,840
what belongs to you -

1643
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,840
the golden keys.

1644
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,160
One day, the two of us will also

1645
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,320
make up for the regrets from our first episode

1646
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,120
Right

1647
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,760
I'm picking this up for Professor Zhao

1648
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,440
This is exactly what we need to

1649
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:32,720
This is precisely what we must

1650
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,320
value intellectual property rights

1651
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,080
For things you didn't create

1652
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,800
don't keep falsely putting your name on them

1653
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,080
Right, and in this case of ours

1654
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,840
there are actually many other noteworthy

1655
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,640
social issues worth discussing

1656
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,160
As everyone has witnessed

1657
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,560
the social clock phenomenon

1658
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,160
Yes

1659
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,320
Let's still give a warm welcome to

1660
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:46,960
our old friend

1661
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,280
from China University of Political Science and Law

1662
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,520
Professor of Criminal Psychology

1663
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,200
Professor Ma Ai

1664
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:51,720
Please welcome

1665
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,440
We meet again

1666
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,240
Hello Professor Ma

1667
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:54,800
Hello everyone

1668
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,760
Hello

1669
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,560
Today's case was truly complex

1670
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,480
The solving process went relatively smoothly

1671
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,160
Not very smoothly

1672
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:01,840
Very smoothly

1673
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,200
The right side went extremely smoothly

1674
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,160
Regarding what you mentioned about our case

1675
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,960
Assistant Yang saw these

1676
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,000
doll-related items

1677
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,800
He wanted to plagiarize

1678
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,160
He intended to fabricate an image himself

1679
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,040
claiming that these things

1680
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,240
were all designed by him

1681
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,560
What do you think were

1682
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,000
the mistakes he made in this matter?

1683
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,360
Let's discuss whether the design itself

1684
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,880
has been patented

1685
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,560
No

1686
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,480
If a patent is filed

1687
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,080
First

1688
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,080
it would violate patent law

1689
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,360
If the consequences are severe

1690
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,200
it could even breach our country's criminal law

1691
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,200
However

1692
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,720
if no patent is filed

1693
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,400
then it might only

1694
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,480
face moral condemnation

1695
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,200
In other words

1696
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,200
we must protect

1697
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:45,880
our intellectual property

1698
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,440
by filing patents

1699
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,200
This process

1700
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:48,920
should be delegated

1701
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,120
to let the law safeguard us

1702
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,520
Take portrait rights

1703
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,280
For your portrait rights

1704
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,080
you at least need a photo

1705
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,280
to prove it's you

1706
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,360
Therefore

1707
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,160
properly registering IP

1708
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,640
is a fundamental

1709
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,840
self-protection measure

1710
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,520
So actually, that also means

1711
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,200
Was it because he wasn't careful enough himself?

1712
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,120
Yes, he always had the final signature

1713
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,360
done by Assistant Yang

1714
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,640
He gave him too much authority

1715
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,840
He probably never thought to guard against this person

1716
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,520
This is what we call legal awareness

1717
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,200
Legal awareness

1718
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,240
Sometimes we always think

1719
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,560
the law is for punishing others

1720
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,000
No

1721
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,920
The primary purpose of law

1722
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,560
is to protect all of us

1723
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,080
Protection

1724
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,040
Teacher, I have a question

1725
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:24,480
Go ahead

1726
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,200
About a character like Song Piaoliang

1727
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,720
She feels that she

1728
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,640
must complete all the tasks

1729
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,760
expected of her age

1730
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,880
before turning thirty

1731
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,480
What kind of psychology is this?

1732
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,240
You see

1733
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,040
When we say at a certain age

1734
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,000
one should complete

1735
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,280
certain tasks

1736
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,480
This is actually following the social clock

1737
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,200
adjusting your own development

1738
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,200
Now the social clock

1739
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,160
is indeed a cultural phenomenon

1740
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,400
biological phenomenon

1741
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,000
and a socio-psychological phenomenon

1742
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,120
We often say farming seasons mustn't be missed

1743
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,360
Once missed

1744
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,920
your crops won't grow well

1745
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,400
People

1746
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,640
seem to be the same

1747
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,800
Therefore you'll see

1748
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,960
Song Piaoliang

1749
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,120
follows the social clock

1750
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,120
because she feels certain pressures

1751
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,880
The first type

1752
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,680
is called group pressure

1753
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,320
Everyone is doing this

1754
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,320
If I don't keep up, I'll feel pressure

1755
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,240
The second type

1756
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,640
is what we call self-esteem pressure

1757
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,120
I'm not worse than you

1758
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,760
Why can you achieve it

1759
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,280
while I haven't?

1760
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,960
Self-imposed pressure

1761
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,960
Furthermore

1762
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,240
there's future pressure

1763
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,040
She might think

1764
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,720
If I don't reach this stage

1765
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,000
does that make me a failure?

1766
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,720
These pressures at work

1767
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,400
are what cause her anxiety

1768
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,640
and tension

1769
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,760
making her rush to follow this timetable

1770
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,680
to dictate her own destiny

1771
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,680
Are there people who

1772
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,520
are particularly rebellious

1773
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,360
and want to go against the social clock?

1774
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,080
Who think that while everyone at this age

1775
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,280
does this, they won't?

1776
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,200
Do such people exist?

1777
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,640
Of course, you're one

1778
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,320
I'm not

1779
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,040
There are isolated cases like this

1780
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,480
We should call it independent thinking

1781
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,280
But

1782
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,960
their lifestyle itself

1783
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,680
must be supported by strong self-confidence

1784
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,120
"I feel perfectly fine living this way"

1785
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,000
Therefore

1786
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,640
when someone

1787
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,360
follows their own lifestyle

1788
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,360
as long as it's not illegal

1789
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,160
we should adopt

1790
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,640
what kind of attitude toward them?

1791
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:16,720
A tolerant attitude

1792
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,520
An inclusive attitude

1793
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,000
Or even a respectful attitude

1794
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,720
Right

1795
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,600
That's what's good for them

1796
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,720
and good for us too

1797
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:24,480
They don't interfere with me

1798
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,800
and I won't interfere with others

1799
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,880
Yes, mutual non-interference

1800
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,160
This is a fundamental right

1801
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,720
Of course

1802
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,520
The social clock

1803
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,400
Everyone should follow

1804
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,920
The entire social clock

1805
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,080
But it must also adapt to individuals, eras

1806
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,800
and changing circumstances

1807
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,200
One must maintain their individuality

1808
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,160
while keeping pace with the times

1809
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,600
The two must be balanced together

1810
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,400
While we don't advocate that everyone

1811
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,000
should follow a standardized model

1812
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,680
to live and construct their lives,

1813
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,360
this doesn't mean

1814
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,880
life requires no planning,

1815
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,280
or that one can grow recklessly without restraint,

1816
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,360
or adopt an escapist attitude of giving up.

1817
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,080
Finding goals and rhythms

1818
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,680
that match one's capabilities,

1819
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,640
and making proper life plans

1820
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,280
is what constitutes a responsible approach.

1821
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,680
As for the "social clock,"

1822
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,240
we can view it as

1823
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,000
a commonly accepted planning reference

1824
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,560
that has its positive aspects.

1825
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,320
We really shouldn't completely reject it.

1826
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:26,640
Okay

1827
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,000
Then let's all thank our

1828
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,800
Professor Ma

1829
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,360
Thank you

1830
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,720
Thank you, Teacher Ma

1831
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,320
"Let's Start Deduction"

1832
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,560
See you next time

1833
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,720
About the mindset of "must get married by 30"

1834
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,800
What do you think

1835
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,520
of this mentality?

1836
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,640
I think

1837
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,200
it's a normal mentality.

1838
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,920
At this stage, people might initially

1839
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,120
set such

1840
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,800
goals for themselves

1841
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,800
or make such resolutions.

1842
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,240
But it's not absolute.

1843
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,200
Changes will inevitably occur.

1844
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,320
I believe following conventions

1845
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,880
is a relatively ordinary way of life,

1846
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,520
but it has its own happiness too.

1847
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,840
If you ultimately

1848
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,040
don't follow conventions

1849
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,320
and live your own life

1850
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,480
with your own goals and ideals,

1851
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,600
being true to yourself,

1852
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,560
then that's also a valid life attitude.

1853
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,280
I don't have particularly strong

1854
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,600
views about what's absolutely right.

1855
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,440
Just go with the flow

1856
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,320
and accept

1857
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,480
the life that comes your way.

1858
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,200
But if you're not capable of getting married

1859
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,480
or haven't met someone you love

1860
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,760
and you force yourself to achieve this goal

1861
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:34,920
this choice might

1862
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,200
make you unhappy for life

1863
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,160
So I believe we should make our own decisions

1864
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,120
But actually, like before

1865
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:41,880
I myself

1866
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,760
when I was young also had goals like

1867
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,720
"By what age

1868
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,400
I should achieve certain goals"

1869
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,320
and "By then I should be living

1870
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,360
in a certain state"

1871
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,400
But actually because

1872
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,160
many years have passed

1873
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,800
since those goals were set

1874
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,000
I've come to realize

1875
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,680
that our ultimate life goal

1876
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,560
is actually to live happily and comfortably

1877
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,320
It would be better to

1878
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,240
during this period of time

1879
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,320
first choose what you want to do

1880
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,080
and what you believe

1881
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,640
even when looking back in the future

1882
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,360
you won't regret this decision

1883
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:14,720
This is

1884
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,360
a problem everyone faces

1885
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,600
Yes, everyone thinks

1886
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,520
they must marry by a certain age

1887
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,840
and after marrying at a certain age

1888
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,720
must have children

1889
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,760
I think often

1890
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,280
we need to maintain our own well-being

1891
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,400
and we need to have

1892
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,200
a very independent way of thinking

1893
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,160
realizing that making ourselves happy

1894
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:32,800
is most important

1895
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,760
rather than treating life

1896
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,680
like checking off milestones

1897
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,680
"Not married by 30"

1898
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,720
"Not successful in my 30s"

1899
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,560
and feeling anxious about it

1900
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,880
Do you have any thoughts on this?

1901
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,720
No anxiety

1902
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,000
I think first don't be anxious

1903
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,720
but you also can't

1904
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,840
completely give up on it

1905
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,520
You should still make efforts

1906
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,440
and go through the experiences

1907
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,240
Put in your own effort

1908
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,760
I believe no matter what the final outcome is

1909
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,840
we can face it with composure

1910
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,400
I think this matter

1911
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,920
can only be resolved by oneself

1912
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,280
The external world will pressure you

1913
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,840
but first of all

1914
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,200
you can't help but feel it

1915
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,480
yet you mustn't let the pressure defeat you

1916
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,080
Every person is

1917
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,000
placed on their own life path

1918
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,800
Move forward or fall behind

1919
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,000
As the old saying goes

1920
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,640
"One has no choice in the martial world"

1921
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,880
The martial world of old is today's society

1922
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,400
They mean the same thing

1923
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,440
But no one is

1924
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,680
perfect in every way

1925
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,040
You can't possibly achieve success

1926
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,640
in every single aspect

1927
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,840
But you must believe in yourself

1928
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,640
that you can succeed

1929
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,440
in at least one field

1930
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,240
So perhaps if

1931
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,520
you ask yourself more often

1932
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,400
the direction of your efforts

1933
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,320
the self you wish to become

1934
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,520
what you truly want

1935
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,680
might these questions bring you

1936
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,520
closer to your ideal self?

1937
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,120
We should exert all our strength

1938
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,960
use every ounce of our energy

1939
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,000
to move toward the version of ourselves

1940
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,760
that we truly admire

1941
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,520
Because each of us

1942
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,400
with our different experiences

1943
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,840
at different times and ages

1944
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,520
going through different events

1945
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,960
doing different things

1946
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,320
shapes that unique individual we become

1947
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,160
I can't possibly

1948
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,760
be good at everything I do

1949
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,320
And I can't possibly make everyone

1950
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,400
think well of me

1951
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,240
So why should I keep dwelling on this?

1952
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,400
If I'm not good at it,

1953
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,160
then I'll try something else.

1954
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,960
Life is so long,

1955
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,320
so within my capabilities,

1956
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,160
I'll strive to better demonstrate

1957
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,080
or showcase

1958
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,520
my own worth.

1959
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,320
That's enough.

1960
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,040
You will see with your own eyes

1961
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,720
The truth you once believed

1962
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,640
The sun rises over the hillside

1963
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,960
Then someone in a red hoodie falls down

1964
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:36,960
The "corpse" disappears again

1965
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,840
I really didn't see it

1966
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,080
What the doll has been doing all along

1967
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,920
Is trying to protect all those who are about to "die"

1968
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,880
Although we just met today

1969
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,480
We already share a deep bond

1970
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,040
Didn't she "die"?

1971
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,440
Time is running out

1972
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,920
Hurry, quickly

1973
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,600
You must come save me

1974
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,840
We're on the same side

1975
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,880
But what could we possibly have in common with Xiao Pamei?

1976
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,520
I just want to ask - are we still alive?

1977
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,240
Don't come any closer

1978
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,840
Pamei

1979
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,240
Is that a memorial tablet?

1980
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:09,840
It's very dangerous here now

1981
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,560
Listen to me

1982
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,520
Another "dead person"

1983
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,480
There's another person here

1984
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,480
Why are there so many people here?

1985
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,600
What are you doing?

1986
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,560
Leave that person with me

1987
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,920
Who led us here?

1988
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,399
Xiao He

1989
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:22,520
You're acting really strange

1990
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,240
This spacetime vortex he drew

1991
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:31,720
Starting from today

1992
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,960
A fresh start

1993
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,160
Today I invited everyone to do crafts

1994
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,160
What are you trying to

1995
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,479
Are you trying to dismantle my shop?

1996
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:46,600
Awesome

1997
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,319
Your craft shop is really well done

1998
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:49,279
At first glance it could "kill" (impress greatly)

1999
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,000
Let me tell you, we can negotiate

2000
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:53,520
What's wrong?

2001
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,960
Since childhood, both of us had

2002
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:55,640
When we were young

2003
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,920
We suffered some serious injuries

2004
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,960
Basically our limbs were prosthetics added later

2005
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,279
Both of them are intact

2006
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,279
How do we earn money?

2007
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:08,520
You actually touched our sore spot

2008
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,439
I'm also very poor

2009
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:10,680
Where did you get your clothes?

2010
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,520
You're studying at Columbia

2011
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,439
Can't you afford this small amount?

2012
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:14,439
She's in Chicago, right?

2013
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,040
Can we make the audience feel

2014
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,560
That we're the growth-oriented type

2015
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:22,800
I seem to have seen

2016
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,000
My own brain in a parallel universe

2017
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,640
Right?

2018
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,359
But it's always unclear

2019
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:26,880
Very blurry

2020
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:27,399
Blurry

2021
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:28,640
Unclear

2022
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,439
Don't follow the crowd mentality

2023
01:09:30,439 --> 01:09:31,200
I'm competitive

2024
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,560
Tonight I'll treat you to fried rice

2025
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,120
I'll also get him some rice soup

2026
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,359
I'll serve you rice

2027
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,200
Come on, serve the rice

2028
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,880
I'm a rice bucket (glutton)
