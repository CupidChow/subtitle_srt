1
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,760
Do you want to get the same reasoning experience

2
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,120
as the reasoning team in Apartment 11?

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,200
Do you want to play a table reasoning game at home?

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,440
Mr. Cao

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,120
committed suicide for fear of sin.

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,760
The reasoning group of Apartment 11,

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,120
which is popular all over the market,

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,440
They are all evil people.

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,120
"e-mo" is everywhere.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,240
He's spying on us.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,280
When we jumped off the building,

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,320
it was because of their revenge.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,760
Yes, you have to kill us.

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,080
"e mo" has always been among us,

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,240
pushing us

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,080
to a cusp step by step.

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,280
No one can get away with it.

18
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,320
Who's wearing a monitor?

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,200
No.

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,800
Even if we did,

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,320
we wouldn't know it ourselves.

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,200
What do we have?

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,240
It's something we have to bring with us every time.

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,520
Bag,

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,920
True Fruit Reasoning Bag,

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,360
go through

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,160
your pocket.

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,640
We flipped through each other,

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,920
but you didn't sit down today,

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,800
Do you have a problem?

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,720
You must be Goose, right?

32
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,160
Yes.

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,400
I'm going to kill the five of you.

34
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,600
I'm now playing five

35
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:55,880
out of one.

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,000
It's impossible.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,880
It's full of internal organs,

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,040
but trust

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,760
has collapsed without me,

40
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,480
It's so collapsing.

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,400
Is it in the milk box?

42
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,360
It won't be

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,120
put in real fruit red pomelo in spring all the year round,

44
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,440
I don't think so.

45
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,920
Look through your books,

46
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,160
but there's nothing in them.

47
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,240
Where's the pen?

48
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,960
A pen is a pen.

49
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,000
What is this?

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,480
What is this?

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,200
What is it?

52
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,880
This is not me,

53
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,320
this is not me,

54
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,760
It looks like a recording pen.

55
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,320
It must be something small.

56
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,200
Pour it.

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Pour one by one.

58
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,040
If you don't turn it over, just turn it over.

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,040
Bao You,

60
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,680
is it clean?

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,160
It's clean.

62
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,240
Okay,

63
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,080
Next.

64
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,800
I don't have anything.

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,960
I don't have anything left.

66
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,160
Why do you have so many strange pens

67
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,200
for no reason,

68
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,960
Comrade Liu Xialai,

69
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,160
if you put it this way,

70
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,720
If you don't,

71
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,440
Okay.

72
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,200
I've finished pouring it.

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,560
It's gone.

74
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
There's nothing here.

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,520
Look,

76
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,400
prove my innocence.

77
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,320
The murderer wouldn't have

78
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,360
put the bug on him.

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
The mole can't be found

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,280
among us.

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,080
That's right.

82
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,280
Inside,

83
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,480
we haven't looked at other channels yet,

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,880
Am I right?

85
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,280
Yes.

86
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,160
The side door is locked.

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,160
But Blast must have

88
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,000
escaped from this room.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,240
We came in because we heard

90
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,120
the sound of playing the piano.

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,800
Here we go again.

92
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,960
This music again,

93
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,640
Be careful.

94
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,400
Calm down.

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,120
It's okay,

96
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,240
What I don't understand is that

97
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,560
the music is played.

98
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,520
Someone played it here.

99
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
It must be playing.

100
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,240
How can it be playing?

101
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,120
It will be too late to play it.

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,360
How can I get there

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,120
if I don't have time?

104
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,480
Yes.

105
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,200
Is it possible, for example,

106
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,600
to leave as soon as the music goes off.

107
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,240
Where can I play music?

108
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,160
What is related to music?

109
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,279
There's music on it.

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:19,760
What do you mean?

111
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,680
I guess that's what he meant.

112
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,960
The entrance,

113
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,520
the exit,

114
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,360
Is it going to connect

115
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,080
all the notes

116
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
and how

117
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,760
should it go?

118
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,120
Just go straight, turn right,

119
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,880
turn left.

120
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,800
Then turn left.

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,400
Let's go here.

122
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,960
Then eat it before you come down.

123
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,560
Go in here,

124
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,840
eat it and then come back.

125
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,720
Come up and eat it.

126
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,280
And then come back.

127
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,040
Are you sure this is a path that everyone can take?

128
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,400
I don't think you can leave.

129
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,120
You can't go there.

130
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,320
It won't be able to leave at all.

131
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,680
It doesn't have to eat them all.

132
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,400
If you don't have to eat it,

133
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,120
the yellow one is the door,

134
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,960
There should be a door,

135
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,920
so the yellow one is fine,

136
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,520
Come on,

137
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,040
Let me

138
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,960
wait for you.

139
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,240
It seems to be one that can be opened.

140
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,160
This is a cut thing,

141
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,360
maybe it can move up and down and splice it,

142
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,280
That's great.

143
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,080
That's right.

144
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,600
That's it.

145
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,680
I'll open this one.

146
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,760
I really don't like this music.

147
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,960
I don't like this music either.

148
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,160
Be careful. It's a bit heavy.

149
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,440
Brother,

150
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,920
Watch out!

151
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Here's a key.

152
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,520
There's another door

153
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,840
outside. It can retreat directly.

154
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,360
This place,

155
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,080
the key,

156
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,200
Try this.

157
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,160
It's open

158
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,680
This is open.

159
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,440
No.

160
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,320
Brother,

161
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,920
Calm down.

162
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,400
I don't think it has anything to do with it.

163
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,920
It tells me this is the exit.

164
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,680
Well, shall we carry backpacks?

165
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,240
Brother,

166
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,520
Don't be like this.

167
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,600
you guys

168
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,320
Is there a light?

169
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,600
No.

170
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,280
You turned on your flashlight.

171
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,880
You scared me to death.

172
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,160
I'm really scared.

173
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,880
I've grown up.

174
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,840
Is this a shop?

175
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,320
What are you doing?

176
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,880
No.

177
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,560
Push the five-piece set.

178
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,320
Push the loudspeaker,

179
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,480
voice changer,

180
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,840
Wasn't this bow

181
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,480
supposed to be found at the scene?

182
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,120
Take a look.

183
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,840
Voice changer,

184
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,440
Conan,

185
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,720
Here's another five-piece suit.

186
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,520
Push the camera.

187
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,800
Hold on.

188
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,080
Look at the glue underneath.

189
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,680
This place,

190
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,240
it has a red mark,

191
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,000
Exactly

192
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,920
Four dots,

193
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,400
then a circle,

194
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,320
It looks like

195
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,560
a trace of something glued on it.

196
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,680
Look at this glue,

197
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,560
four dots,

198
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,840
A circle?

199
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,240
Yes, it's exactly the same.

200
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,080
Have you ever been in his bedroom?

201
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,520
No.

202
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,240
I can't get in.

203
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,920
Have you seen Agent Teng?

204
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,240
No,

205
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,160
No

206
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,920
But obedient sounds like

207
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,080
he told the agent that he had fainted at 11: 00

208
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,480
noon.

209
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,880
At eleven o'clock, he should have been "charming",

210
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,400
and the 24-hour agent

211
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,720
fell into a coma at ten o'clock.

212
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,560
That is to say,

213
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,440
he was fainted long ago.

214
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,960
Yes, I fainted a long time ago.

215
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,039
This one

216
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,880
The loudspeaker must have been used

217
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,440
by Teng.

218
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,159
These two

219
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,480
are the things that speak for him.

220
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,360
Maybe that person

221
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,240
killed him a long time ago.

222
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,960
It's just a voice changer,

223
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
a remote speaker,

224
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,560
Or put something there,

225
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,120
and talk to us over there.

226
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,520
Yes.

227
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,200
So for the whole night,

228
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,440
it wasn't Teng's agent,

229
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,240
Yes.

230
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,960
Yeah,

231
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,200
he was talking to us via remote,

232
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,440
I had a fight

233
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
with someone online,

234
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,760
We all are.

235
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,840
Who isn't?

236
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,640
But now there are two pieces missing

237
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,960
from the push five-piece set.

238
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:14,760
No,

239
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,840
this is already three.

240
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,680
And those two are the things

241
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,920
that monitored us just now.

242
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,160
Push the receiver,

243
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,240
monitor and receive it, right?

244
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,840
That is to say,

245
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,160
pushing the five-piece suit is for Sister Blast and Goose.

246
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
Let's look for it at the scene.

247
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,840
Come on,

248
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,760
Here's a notebook.

249
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,560
Push and hide the camera.

250
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,000
"Murder"? Yes,

251
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,080
it's Cao Yangguang.

252
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
This is a surveillance camera,

253
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,680
which can capture

254
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,760
everything about them in real time,

255
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,840
I've put this in your bookstore office,

256
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,520
because Xiao Ming's dad was trying to save Sunshine,

257
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,600
He took away this crucial evidence in advance,

258
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,880
and gave it to his dad.

259
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,640
That's right.

260
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
What do you mean?

261
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,440
Teng,

262
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,240
Zoom in,

263
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,680
this must be the one written,

264
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,440
The paper was messed up.

265
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,040
Agent Teng gave it to me

266
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,760
Yes,

267
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,760
A lot of words were erased,

268
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,280
the paper that was flowered,

269
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,800
What are all the words in it?

270
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,200
Let's take a good look at it,

271
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,400
the honorable "Tuihuicha" Detective Club?

272
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,080
I'd like to ask you to re-investigate

273
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,840
the case of a teenage girl

274
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,520
"burning the corpse"

275
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,760
in the woods near Tuihaoli Avenue three years ago,

276
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,280
According to my investigation,

277
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,560
there's something else behind this case.

278
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,480
Because of the recklessness and ignorance of a few people,

279
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,320
in this case,

280
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,920
Mr. Lou, who was regarded as the "murderer"

281
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,360
by the public, died of injustice.

282
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,000
Among these people,

283
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,760
one is my sister Xiao Ba Mei.

284
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,040
She found out a secret of Mr. Lou.

285
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,360
That led Mr. Lou to perform

286
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,040
a few other tests on her,

287
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,000
At first I thought

288
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,560
it was Bai San Wan

289
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,000
who is currently living in Apartment 11,

290
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,560
Song Meili,

291
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,640
Guo Baoyou,

292
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,920
Zhou Keke,

293
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,520
Liu Xialai,

294
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,120
Ke Wuku,

295
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,960
But then I found out,

296
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,520
there are only five people involved in this case.

297
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,920
The other one has a close relationship with Mr. Lou.

298
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,280
He's a deliberate avenger.

299
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,320
Who?

300
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,600
That is, among the six of us,

301
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,800
five of us are related to this case.

302
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
There is one person,

303
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,080
who is related to Mr. Lou.

304
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,000
It's related to Mr. Lou.

305
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,960
One of them is a traitor.

306
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,680
Traitor!

307
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,360
I don't think it should be so scary.

308
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,520
We've come to this day,

309
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,560
and one of us has always been

310
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,320
a deliberate Avenger,

311
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,080
Don't leave any of you. None of you

312
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,200
are close to Mr. Lou.

313
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,480
There are six of them.

314
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,560
What should I do?

315
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,200
She has a direct relationship with the teacher.

316
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,600
But it's too obvious.

317
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,000
I liked him before,

318
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,040
I liked him before,

319
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,240
But his problem is,

320
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,560
he turned me down.

321
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,600
I was rejected.

322
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,320
Yes.

323
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,800
That's why you hate him so much.

324
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,920
Then I posted him on the Internet,

325
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,760
so that he would be attacked by the Internet.

326
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,840
Hold on.

327
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,800
There's a problem.

328
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,240
His letter just now said,

329
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,480
We hurt Lou indirectly.

330
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:21,960
Yes.

331
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Lou.

332
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Lou.

333
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,800
I'm just a prank,

334
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,720
and I'm also

335
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,680
the one who made it worse.

336
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,920
What's wrong with Weibo?

337
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,120
In fact, I also brought a rhythm in it,

338
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,160
only he

339
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,040
didn't have much trouble with Lou.

340
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,760
When I was in high school,

341
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,560
I had a senior, Jing,

342
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,280
The three of us only wanted her to make money for once,

343
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,000
so he sounds like,

344
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,320
He doesn't feel sorry for Mr. Lou.

345
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,240
You can't do this.

346
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,120
You can't think like that.

347
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,400
Yeah, what I said just now.

348
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,800
Why would he think that way?

349
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,520
If you think like this,

350
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,480
I'm really powerless.

351
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,120
His reaction is a bit abnormal now.

352
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,240
It's a little unnatural.

353
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,160
She has a close relationship with Mr. Lou.

354
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,040
I don't even know him.

355
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,000
Don't worry.

356
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,360
I'll bring the list in.

357
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,080
Let's analyze it again.

358
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,640
Who has nothing to do with this case?

359
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,760
Can we hang it up?

360
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,720
Do you have a place?

361
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,320
Here, there's a rope on it

362
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,040
and a clip on it,

363
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,560
Yes.

364
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,680
Okay,

365
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,840
Okay,

366
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,360
I just remembered who said,

367
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,960
a violent person or something.

368
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,560
Violence is him.

369
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,320
Look, wait a minute.

370
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,000
I thought it was that violent man

371
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,080
who killed Jing.

372
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,960
So he's not.

373
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,080
If you think like this,

374
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,200
I'm really powerless.

375
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,120
Let's analyze it again.

376
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,160
What have we done?

377
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,000
First of all, I admit that

378
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,840
I was surprised

379
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,400
by the old lady,

380
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,840
What did you do?

381
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,640
I posted him online,

382
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,080
but I didn't see the girl go in.

383
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,680
But I insisted that I saw her go in.

384
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,120
And let him be attacked by the Internet.

385
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,600
I forged a poster for him,

386
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,920
falsely accused him of going to the forest,

387
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,840
Yes, you

388
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,520
… I took photos for that pick-up girl.

389
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,880
He wears women's clothes in private,

390
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,680
and then Mr. Lou,

391
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,320
Then pick-up girl posted him on the public account,

392
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,040
and then the whole network was "violent" with him.

393
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,720
Yes.

394
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,000
Bai is greedy, right?

395
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,640
If you are greedy for me,

396
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,440
it seems that

397
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,080
this really has nothing to do with Bai.

398
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,560
It has nothing to do with me.

399
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,520
You have a close relationship with Mr. Lou, don't you?

400
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,760
Yes.

401
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,960
Yes What's your relationship with Mr. Lou?

402
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,440
What's my relationship with him?

403
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,200
What does it matter? It doesn't matter.

404
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,280
We're close. You two are close.

405
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,680
Who says we're close?

406
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,880
I just didn't stand up for him.

407
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,800
Come forward.

408
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Why did you come forward?

409
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Because he hit me.

410
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,440
He hit me.

411
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,560
I took the jade

412
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,720
from his bag,

413
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,320
But it was you who hit me like that.

414
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,080
You're the one who hit me like that.

415
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,160
When I got home,

416
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,720
I found that I had taken this bag by mistake.

417
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,600
There was a jade three-piece set in my bag,

418
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,880
and the next day,

419
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,960
When I saw the picture of that girl,

420
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,840
I found out,

421
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,400
This jade belongs to this girl,

422
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,000
and his body shape is totally different

423
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,040
from that of this teacher.

424
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,440
At that time, I wanted to stand up and say something,

425
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,160
I said that night,

426
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,760
I got the jade from him.

427
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,440
Then the teacher will be innocent, right?

428
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,720
I didn't say that.

429
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,800
That means there's a problem

430
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,520
to unlock it. Guys,

431
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,880
A three-digit pinyin password,

432
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,760
pinyin,

433
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,320
Come on,

434
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,280
“e mo”

435
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,160
Lou,

436
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,200
Oh,

437
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:04,920
I can't.

438
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,560
You can't, can you?

439
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,040
Let's try using our own names.

440
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,280
For example, someone with a problem.

441
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,480
Okay,

442
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,960
I think Bai,

443
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,320
you'd better not try this first.

444
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,280
Why do you

445
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,280
try it out like this? It might go wrong.

446
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,960
But there's

447
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,600
no B. Right?

448
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,560
No B. Look.

449
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,120
It's not me.

450
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,400
No,

451
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,040
you took it with you.

452
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,000
Why did you take the box away?

453
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
I don't think you can be trusted.

454
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,720
I'm so scared right now.

455
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,800
Why don't you trust me so much?

456
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,680
There's a box here,

457
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,280
This is.

458
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,240
Agent Teng?

459
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,680
Xiao,

460
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,599
Xiao

461
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,200
My sister Xiao Ba Mei passed away.

462
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,839
Miss Fang Xiaomei is invited

463
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,960
to attend the memorial service,

464
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,480
Brother,

465
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,359
Xiao Tengteng,

466
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,720
XTT

467
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,520
Xiao Tengteng,

468
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,359
Xiao TT

469
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:25,920
It's open

470
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,640
Xiao Tengteng's,

471
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,280
Teng's agent,

472
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,520
From agent Teng,

473
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,880
he took it back.

474
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,400
Come on, let's watch it in bed.

475
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,840
Okay?

476
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,360
Come on,

477
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,720
Okay, look on the bed.

478
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,120
Don't go outside.

479
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,120
Don't worry. I won't leave.

480
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,880
I don't believe you.

481
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,960
Bai,

482
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,520
Bai has locked us up.

483
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,840
Now that you know the truth,

484
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,880
you can just die.

485
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,320
They became

486
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,840
puppets.

487
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,000
Uncle, don't worry.

488
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,960
It's not time for you to run, is it?

489
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,880
Not yet. It's early.

490
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,480
Not yet.

491
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,240
It's a long time ago.

492
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm telling you, there's something wrong with Bai.

493
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,520
He has a tablet computer.

494
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,120
This is the one that was torn off.

495
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,760
I found a piece of paper.

496
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,640
It's not strong glue. It's a piece of paper.

497
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,960
It must have been torn.

498
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,600
Yes.

499
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,720
It should have been painted before,

500
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
but you're not even interested in

501
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,600
tearing off the piece Why?

502
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,840
Why should I be interested?

503
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,680
Yes.

504
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,080
Yes.

505
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,200
I'm here.

506
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,280
This is the full version.

507
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm telling you, I really,

508
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,920
Goose bumps. Goose bumps

509
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,720
are coming up.

510
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,760
Come on, continue to clip this.

511
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,520
Clip it.

512
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,280
Let's read it together.

513
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,720
The reasoning team is good.

514
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,240
We found "Don't Cry".

515
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,040
The ID of "Don't Cry" is called

516
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,800
"e mo",

517
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,160
Sister Bao,

518
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,880
take a look at the sales record.

519
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,560
Let's see who bought 0091.

520
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,880
0091 is also an "e mo",

521
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,000
and Sister Blast has always guided Sister Bak,

522
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,160
Let her use "don't cry".

523
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,480
Yes.

524
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,000
So "e mo" is Blast Sister,

525
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,920
"e mo" is Blast Sister,

526
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,760
Blast got caught.

527
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,480
E Mo can't

528
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,800
log in in Apartment 11.

529
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,480
Blast,

530
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,680
she has been taken away for investigation.

531
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,120
There must be one of us,

532
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,280
"e mo".

533
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,880
I've checked all the surveillance cameras.

534
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,800
When I found out that Blast

535
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,280
went to the fourth floor the most,

536
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,080
What's hidden on the fourth floor?

537
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,800
This is

538
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,520
the "happy home",

539
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,120
"Happy House. "

540
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,000
"Happy House. "

541
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,520
So these are the seven people the Avengers

542
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,480
are going to take revenge on,

543
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:34,680
The seven people who wanted revenge,

544
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,400
the reason why they jumped off the building.

545
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,000
She's here to get traffic.

546
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,640
I went to Mr. Lou's house to find out the truth,

547
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,080
and he was really wronged.

548
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,640
Sister,

549
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,600
in order to make mom happy,

550
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,440
I can only go home every day.

551
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,960
In the toilet on the first floor of the apartment,

552
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,040
put on your clothes,

553
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,840
Put on a wig

554
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,240
and go home dressed like you.

555
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,800
Stay with me and make me happy.

556
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,880
On the day of Jing's death,

557
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,160
she didn't come to my home to make up lessons,

558
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,320
He clarified it for himself.

559
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,040
But no one believed me.

560
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,240
See?

561
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,760
Mr. Lou was indeed wronged.

562
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,080
then

563
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,320
Once again, I came to the "Happy House".

564
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,000
Only then did I realize that this crime

565
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,360
corresponds to my sister,

566
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,400
Sister Ba

567
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,680
She found out a secret of Mr. Lou.

568
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,000
That led Mr. Lou to rule her out

569
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,000
and put it on "pick-up girl"

570
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,120
Yes,

571
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,600
Yes,

572
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,640
this is an old apartment resident

573
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,680
who "died" a year and a half ago,

574
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,640
By contacting his family,

575
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,400
he found out that the resident died of illness

576
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,080
and said that he was sorry for Mr. Lou

577
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,400
in his suicide note,

578
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,560
It also corresponds to another crime.

579
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,720
Bai is greedy,

580
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,920
I am impulsive,

581
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,520
"Killing" an old man because of mindless revenge,

582
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,240
lies,

583
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,040
This is me.

584
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,760
Are you jealous?

585
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,760
That's how violent you are.

586
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,480
I think I should be this.

587
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,160
You're seeking justice.

588
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,960
She committed a crime.

589
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,600
Who is this person?

590
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,400
Maybe this

591
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,040
is "e Mo" himself.

592
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,760
In his heart,

593
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,000
she's dead.

594
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,960
She's a vengeful person.

595
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,360
Hold on.

596
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,760
We've been treating this executor

597
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,800
as "dead",

598
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,200
He's dead.

599
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,400
He can't be the executor.

600
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,680
It could be one of them.

601
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,480
Do you understand?

602
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,880
She's responsible for one crime.

603
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,560
Yes.

604
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,600
She must have been executed.

605
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,120
She must have been executed.

606
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,520
She wants to "kill" this person.

607
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,320
She's dead.

608
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,840
Yeah, the executor could be

609
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,760
one of the six of us,

610
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,200
There's a traitor among us.

611
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,480
There's a traitor among us.

612
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,560
There is one person,

613
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,880
the executor.

614
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,000
These are my teammates.

615
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,560
Really?

616
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,800
I'm speechless.

617
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,320
That is, the six of us

618
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,440
did something bad

619
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,760
to Mr. Lou,

620
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,800
But this "murderer"

621
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,280
He used the bad things he did,

622
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,560
and then he was cleared of suspicion.

623
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,680
In other words, among us,

624
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,840
Goose has never done anything wrong.

625
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,560
I've never done anything

626
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,640
related to these crimes,

627
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,720
Yes.

628
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
That is,

629
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,120
he can take this woman's sin

630
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,440
on himself.

631
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,240
So he can

632
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,680
pretend to be one of them.

633
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,840
But in fact, he is not

634
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,960
the man here at all,

635
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,680
He just took the blame for her crime.

636
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,240
Yes.

637
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,560
He just impersonated me.

638
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,840
He raised his hand and said,

639
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,480
"What this woman did,

640
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,600
In fact, when I did it,

641
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,720
he did it for undercover,

642
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,240
He's in front of us

643
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,320
for undercover. Got it.

644
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,240
Tell her that she wants to take up a crime.

645
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,480
Which one? The problem is that

646
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,160
she died of illness.

647
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,880
This is the old resident

648
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,400
who died in the apartment a year ago,

649
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,480
I contacted my family,

650
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,200
and found out that

651
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,000
the resident

652
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
died of illness. The suicide note mentioned that

653
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,760
I'm sorry for Mr. Lou,

654
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,000
It also corresponds to another crime.

655
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,640
We need to find her "suicide note" to find out.

656
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,560
Pickling girls and "sick and dead" residents

657
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,680
have accounted for two crimes.

658
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,360
Logically speaking,

659
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,880
the Avengers have five targets left.

660
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,440
But why did he die later?

661
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,480
The six members of the Reasoning Group.

662
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,200
What's the garbled code?

663
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,080
In the last time when we were investigating this symbol,

664
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,760
we intercepted

665
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,600
a piece of encrypted information.

666
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,400
I don't understand what that means.

667
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,600
I saw this password book,

668
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,960
so I cracked this message.

669
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,600
It turned out that they already knew that

670
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,280
Tuihuicha was about to find themselves.

671
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,840
Afraid of revealing his identity,

672
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,440
he plans to imitate

673
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,120
Get away with a fake "death".

674
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,080
Then everything makes sense.

675
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,680
survived  Eight guilty people were invited to

676
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,200
the island,

677
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,480
Please come in.

678
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,200
Hello,

679
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,560
while everyone is eating,

680
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,920
A mysterious voice,

681
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,520
accusing the eight people here,

682
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,040
who claimed that they had all

683
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,960
committed murder,

684
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,440
Other than her, there are people

685
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,360
who are sorry for you.

686
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,720
Six

687
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,480
The first one is gone.

688
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,720
Next,

689
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,160
everyone

690
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,320
died on the island one after another.

691
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,400
The Avengers who are hidden among us,

692
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,080
through fake "death",

693
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,040
I lied to everyone.

694
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,160
There's a movie like this,

695
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,320
I succeeded in taking revenge on everyone.

696
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:11,680
Am I right?

697
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,920
,

698
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,320
Yes.

699
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,120
Yes.

700
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,320
Among the six of us,

701
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,200
one of us has never died.

702
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,800
So scary.

703
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,880
It's creepy.

704
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,280
You've gone too far,

705
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,680
my friends.

706
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,760
We've been together for so long,

707
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,320
there's no need.

708
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,000
So scary.

709
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,200
Fake a "death" way to escape.

710
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,560
In our story,

711
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,840
who will get away with fake "death"?

712
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,240
For example, Investigate Jia Jia,

713
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,200
Investigate Jia Jia,

714
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,280
None of them died.

715
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:01,880
Fake "death",

716
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,960
fake "death",

717
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,320
She's a habitual criminal.

718
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,760
No,

719
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
but the detective is not from the six of us.

720
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,560
Not the six of us,

721
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
but she's closest to you,

722
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,600
Do both of you know how to do this?

723
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,120
No,

724
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,000
no, what he said is,

725
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,040
One of the six of us pretended to be dead.

726
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,800
Yes, yes,

727
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,040
so we can analyze it,

728
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,920
Last time for each of us, right?

729
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,080
It's really not me.

730
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
You're not good at this.

731
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,720
Brother, you know,

732
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,280
if it's really not your time,

733
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,880
It's me.

734
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,800
Explain it to me.

735
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,680
I don't need to explain.

736
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,360
As for my own business,

737
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,320
why should I explain it to you?

738
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,480
I think there's something wrong with you.

739
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,520
I also think there's something wrong with you.

740
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,520
I have a problem.

741
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,360
But you won't admit it today.

742
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,640
It's me.

743
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
I think the four of us,

744
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,920
I can trust each other.

745
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,440
Why can you trust each other?

746
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,680
Because there's evidence,

747
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,720
We

748
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,520
The things we did,

749
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
the things we did were more serious.

750
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,160
It's wicked.

751
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,680
It's wicked.

752
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,720
It's not that close

753
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,400
to Mr. Lou.

754
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,840
Now, the good people among us

755
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,720
are actually,

756
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,960
The bad guy in this matter,

757
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,400
Yes.

758
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,960
now

759
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,080
I "jumped the police" I was the bad guy,

760
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,200
because I went to their house

761
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,040
and scared his mother to death.

762
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,400
So,

763
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:13,760
are you sure?

764
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Did you scare his mother to death?

765
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,080
You scared me to death.

766
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,680
I didn't tell you the whole truth.

767
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,320
Because I know,

768
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,640
I really scared his mother to death.

769
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,040
Who are you?

770
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,640
Why didn't you say it

771
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,120
until now? When we confessed to the bureau,

772
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,200
You didn't tell me until now,

773
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,280
because I was

774
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,440
the bad guy in this story,

775
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,920
That's why I don't want to talk about it.

776
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,200
But now, only by proving that I've done bad things,

777
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,520
can I be our good person.

778
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,160
How can you prove that

779
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,360
you scared his mother to death.

780
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,800
Now everyone is saying,

781
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,320
"I'm a bad person. ",

782
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,040
I did something bad,

783
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,000
how can you prove that you did it?

784
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,280
Who can testify for you?

785
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,560
Whose evidence can be faked?

786
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,720
Yes.

787
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,800
For example, Bai,

788
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,040
for example, Brother,

789
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,160
You said you hit someone with your motorcycle?

790
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,600
How can you prove that

791
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,400
you hit someone with your motorcycle?

792
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,200
Didn't you get hit?

793
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,240
Didn't I see

794
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,120
who hit me?

795
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,960
Has this chat become like this?

796
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,560
In addition to his own confession,

797
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
the grandma he killed,

798
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,240
If there's any evidence to prove it,

799
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,720
that grandma died on the spot.

800
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,280
Who are you?

801
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,960
He's alone.

802
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,000
We're connected.

803
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,360
But I didn't see you clearly.

804
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,080
You didn't see me clearly, did you?

805
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,760
But I have a jade pendant in my hand,

806
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,960
and I have my transfer record to prove it.

807
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,120
If that jade pendant was the one

808
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,640
I bumped into for the first time that day,

809
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,600
He took it again.

810
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,120
It's yours again?

811
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,560
Am I right?

812
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,760
How about this? Let's see

813
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,560
if there's any connection between you two?

814
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,120
Can we

815
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,200
prove each other?

816
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,760
That's what I mean.

817
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,640
If that's the case,

818
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,280
we can't prove a lot of things.

819
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,800
Because I produced

820
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,880
all the evidence myself.

821
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,560
And those found by others in their own homes,

822
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,960
they may not be traceable.

823
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,720
For example,

824
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,200
I have a witness,

825
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,760
Who?

826
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,160
Who?

827
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,400
Who?

828
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,560
Karry,

829
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,200
Karry,

830
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,440
The three of us robbed it together,

831
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,520
and even though it was a small fight, it was a dead end,

832
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,680
But this brother is still alive.

833
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
We're not

834
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,800
Say yes

835
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,440
Robbery?

836
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,880
I think he did it before.

837
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,720
What do you do for a living?

838
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,320
Am I faking a picture?

839
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,080
He faked the map.

840
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,960
He faked it.

841
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,520
But you sold the fake map

842
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,720
to my home computer with retouching software,

843
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,240
-Forged? -Yes. But you faked it and

844
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,040
sold it to someone else.

845
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,720
Sister Xiao,

846
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,040
did we find the chat record

847
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,160
between you and Sister Xiao?

848
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,880
I found it.

849
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,000
Who searched it? Liu,

850
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,440
Me,

851
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,160
The old Liu you searched

852
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,880
has no chat record,

853
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,560
You only have a fake picture?

854
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,240
This one is on Push Power Avenue,

855
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,080
and the picture is of you,

856
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,680
Did you find it or did you take it?

857
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,760
This photo of the grove was forged by me.

858
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,440
Because I'm the one with the wind direction.

859
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,760
I did see

860
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,120
Jing enter his room.

861
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,960
Actually, I didn't see it.

862
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:16,640
Yes.

863
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,600
So, tell me,

864
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,520
what's your motive

865
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:19,880
for scolding him online?

866
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,800
If you don't think he's a good person,

867
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,880
I don't think he's a good person.

868
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,520
And then I thought

869
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,920
maybe this girl would go to his house,

870
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,760
And then this girl died.

871
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,320
That's his problem.

872
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,040
From what I hear,

873
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,520
I think Song Meili is kind of jealous.

874
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,400
Tell me the truth.

875
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,040
Why doesn't anyone suspect Zhou Keke?

876
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,720
Yes.

877
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,160
He's too clean.

878
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,000
Come to Zhou Keke

879
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,840
It's too shabby for you.

880
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,880
What's in Keke's room?

881
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,880
There are always the least things in my room.

882
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,240
Zhou Keke,

883
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,280
take that video,

884
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,640
He just gave it to a pick-up girl.

885
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,480
You said it,

886
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,440
You took that picture,

887
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,320
you went to that building,

888
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,360
Of course I did.

889
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,960
I took it secretly.

890
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,080
If you want to prove it,

891
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,560
you have to prove it to your sister.

892
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,360
But I can't. She's dead.

893
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,200
Do you have any?

894
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,160
You give her something,

895
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,120
you pass it on to her.

896
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,160
Transfer records,

897
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,440
chat records,

898
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,360
If you turn to my evidence,

899
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,960
how can you prove that it's you?

900
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,520
I think he

901
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,760
listened to me,

902
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,720
Let me make a point, do you understand?

903
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,640
This is interesting today.

904
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,440
Everyone is proving that they have done bad things.

905
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:49,920
Do bad things,

906
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,240
I'm a bad person,

907
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
I'm the bad guy.

908
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,200
I jumped the police,

909
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,680
Me,

910
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,880
I'm the bad guy.

911
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,160
I have a witness,

912
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,440
The three of us robbed it together.

913
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,560
Of course I took it.

914
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,280
I took it secretly.

915
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,160
I'm such a bad person.

916
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
I'm a bad person.

917
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,040
I'm a bad person,

918
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,560
I'm a bad person,

919
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,120
doing bad things,

920
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,360
I'm such a bad person.

921
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,400
I'm a bad person.

922
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,520
I'm a bad person.

923
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,240
Let's search again.

924
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,360
I just contacted

925
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,360
the six people of "Pomelo Meet You",

926
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,640
I already know who the Avengers are.

927
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,960
But it seems to alert the enemy.

928
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,040
The member of "Pomelo Meet You".

929
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,040
I'm sure you'll lie.

930
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,200
Cover it up for him.

931
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,960
Wait a minute. What do you mean?

932
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,440
I'm a member of Pomelo Meet You.

933
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,720
He contacted six of our families.

934
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,320
Is there any clue

935
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,240
about this room?

936
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,360
Let's go through it again.

937
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,920
Let's go through it again.

938
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:45,840
Flip over

939
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,280
-That tablet... -Yeah, I haven't looked

940
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
at the tablet yet,

941
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,840
We haven't checked the tablet yet,

942
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,760
and we've been arguing for a long time,

943
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,480
He has started to prove his innocence.

944
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:54,880
WeChat

945
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,000
Have a taste of Guoba.

946
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,440
Is this your dad?

947
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,400
I called my dad.

948
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,840
Come on, Doll,

949
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,240
Mei Mei Planet,

950
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,000
He might be looking into your information,

951
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,360
because he didn't say he called

952
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,920
all the people who came here?

953
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,120
-One, two, three, four, five, six. -Yes.

954
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,120
This is a person.

955
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,960
10: 30. It's all before

956
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,320
11: 00.

957
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,920
Let's draw up the timeline,

958
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,639
and determine when he took the call.

959
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,040
Let's all write it down, okay?

960
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,600
Can we get a notebook?

961
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,880
Do you think we dare to hold a pen now?

962
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,840
Where's my bag?

963
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,239
The bag has been dumped outside.

964
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,480
I'm here. Don't go out.

965
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,239
Scared to death.

966
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,360
I'm here. Don't go out.

967
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,800
Scared to death.

968
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,120
Don't try to get out of this door.

969
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,800
Let me tell you,

970
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,920
why didn't we take our bags?

971
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,679
Instead, you took the bag,

972
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,800
because I put my phone in it,

973
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,280
All right,

974
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,360
is that okay, brother?

975
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,760
I'll carry it for you. I have a bag.

976
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
Is that a reasonable reason?

977
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,320
Tell me,

978
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,040
how much is Fei?

979
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,040
10: 30, then 2 minutes 55

980
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,639
seconds.

981
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,080
Put this down.

982
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,040
Put that pen down!

983
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,280
He was just pressing

984
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,680
the pen. No. You must be crazy.

985
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,440
Brother, evacuate now.

986
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,000
You don't need to evacuate

987
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,680
since you've evacuated here.

988
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,080
I'm telling you, is there anyone else here?

989
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,640
My own people are still here.

990
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,720
Stop messing around.

991
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,800
If you were me,

992
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,920
how much would it be

993
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,000
if you weren't Fei?

994
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,720
10: 30, then 2 minutes 55

995
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,320
seconds

996
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,880
Come on,

997
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,080
10:

998
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,880
30: 32: 39, 10: 30: 06: 34,

999
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,720
This is Lee, right?

1000
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,520
At 10:

1001
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,400
40, Uncle Li,

1002
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,720
Take a sip of Guoba,

1003
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,160
the beautiful planet,

1004
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,480
10: 4162 minutes 414 seconds, what does that

1005
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,440
mean?

1006
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,200
This only means that

1007
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,880
he has contacted

1008
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,840
all of our families.

1009
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,600
I think what else do you have to look for?

1010
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,680
Here's a phone.

1011
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,280
Pick it up,

1012
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,200
Blast Sister's,

1013
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,360
Blast Sister's

1014
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,960
Let's see

1015
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,000
What's the content of Blast Sister's?

1016
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
Goose,

1017
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,120
Of the seven sinners

1018
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,320
who killed Mr. Lou,

1019
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,000
There is a sinner who has never been found.

1020
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I found out recently that

1021
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,720
she was next to the female character,

1022
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,840
That girl

1023
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,400
died of pollen allergy

1024
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,960
in 2021.

1025
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,760
It's true that evil people have their own retribution.

1026
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,280
About what happened to her in 2019,

1027
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,160
we have found the evidence.

1028
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,880
I'll give it to you when I have a chance.

1029
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,000
Goose is so strange,

1030
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,240
those sinner who "killed"

1031
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,560
Mr. Lou,

1032
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
I can't believe I moved into Apartment 11

1033
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,760
on the same day as you did.

1034
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,760
Is there any conspiracy?

1035
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,920
Hello,

1036
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,600
everyone. Your dog,

1037
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,320
Yes.

1038
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:48,840
There must be something wrong with Mr. Bai,

1039
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,840
but it doesn't matter.

1040
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,200
I'll approach them

1041
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:53,760
as my best friend.

1042
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,000
Find out all this,

1043
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,720
and find a chance to take revenge on them.

1044
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,440
Xiao Jing must like this red dress very much.

1045
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,440
Listen, Jing is not dead at all.

1046
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,520
Don't come near me.

1047
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,800
It's in Cao Yangguang's hands,

1048
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,160
but I can't find Jing.

1049
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,640
The girl who died at that time was someone else.

1050
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,720
And Cao Yangguang's dad

1051
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,320
must have been hiding it for him

1052
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,520
for three years,

1053
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,960
I never wanted to tell the truth.

1054
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,200
Look at these pictures.

1055
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:24,680
What's this?

1056
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,400
These are our clues.

1057
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
It's the day we die.

1058
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,120
Even if it's our six suicide notes,

1059
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,840
he also went in.

1060
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,640
Yes.

1061
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,040
Yes.

1062
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,600
Agent Teng found

1063
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,840
our "Happy Home",

1064
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,160
He even went through our password book.

1065
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,960
He must know something?

1066
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,320
But our revenge

1067
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,040
isn't done yet.

1068
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,640
We can't be influenced by him.

1069
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,800
I'll take care of it.

1070
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,880
I also destroyed the password book.

1071
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,520
Try to contact me after you escape.

1072
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,160
So the real "cause of death" of Agent Teng,

1073
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,200
is because

1074
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,760
he was one of the people in the orphanage.

1075
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,960
Sneak into us.

1076
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,800
He wants to kill all of us,

1077
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,640
and then when Teng finds out about this,

1078
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,960
In order not to let Teng

1079
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,880
expose this matter,

1080
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,800
Teng must die first.

1081
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,160
He put him in a coma on purpose,

1082
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,080
and then Cao Yangguang killed him.

1083
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,800
Using a knife to "kill" someone.

1084
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,240
I escaped.

1085
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,200
Go back to the apartment now.

1086
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,400
Now everyone knows

1087
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,040
our plan.

1088
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,480
We originally wanted to use "don't cry",

1089
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,520
to induce them to "commit suicide".

1090
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,440
It's hard to succeed.

1091
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,480
I can only change my plan.

1092
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,440
Mr. Cao is dead.

1093
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
And Cao Yangguang,

1094
00:38:59,440 --> 00:38:59,920
Kai,

1095
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,920
These two "culprits"

1096
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,600
Must "die",

1097
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,800
the other few,

1098
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,160
I also want them to lose their reputation

1099
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,120
and have a taste of being reviled by thousands of people.

1100
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,880
We did lose all our reputation.

1101
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,320
We've been on the hot searches.

1102
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,040
No.

1103
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,640
Come on,

1104
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,200
No.

1105
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,040
What are you doing?

1106
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,480
No.

1107
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,200
No

1108
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,960
You scared the hell out of me.

1109
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,400
You scared me to death.

1110
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,720
I don't get it. What's wrong with that?

1111
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,480
What do you mean?

1112
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,200
What?

1113
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,040
There's something here.

1114
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,160
No.

1115
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,800
Mom.

1116
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:47,960
Anyone here?

1117
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,160
Who?

1118
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,840
Don't talk.

1119
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,560
Don't talk.

1120
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,600
He doesn't know we're here.

1121
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,080
Cao Yangguang,

1122
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,160
Cao Yangguang and Kai,

1123
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,040
Lock the door first.

1124
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,040
Xiao Wei said that

1125
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,800
this is where the doll

1126
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,760
found the way to "cross"

1127
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,680
Where would it be?

1128
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,920
I don't know either.

1129
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,320
They said that when it's completely black,

1130
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,160
there will be fluorescence.

1131
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,760
Let's look for it first.

1132
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,920
There will be fluorescence.

1133
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,760
Why did they come in?

1134
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,000
I don't know.

1135
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,520
They're looking for something.

1136
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,080
I found it.

1137
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,840
Take a look.

1138
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,080
What is it?

1139
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,840
Apartment 11,

1140
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,520
in mid-air outside the window on the ninth floor,

1141
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,080
The magnetic field is special,

1142
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,080
which can reset time and space

1143
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,800
to 1. 1 thousand days ago,

1144
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,200
What?

1145
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,480
Every year on the nights

1146
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,200
of April 1 and July 30,

1147
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
The space-time reset magnetic field

1148
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,360
will automatically turn on,

1149
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,200
And close it before 20 o'clock.

1150
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,160
If you enter during this period,

1151
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,920
jump from the window on the ninth floor.

1152
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,160
When you are in a special magnetic field,

1153
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,360
your consciousness will be separated from your body.

1154
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,240
Consciousness will be "transmitted" into

1155
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,720
1. 1 thousand days ago's body,

1156
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,280
It closes at eight o'clock.

1157
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,680
It's seven o'clock now.

1158
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,600
Let's go to the ninth floor now.

1159
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,600
Let's go.

1160
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,480
Jump out of the window,

1161
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,080
Hurry up!

1162
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,200
Then I can see Xiao Nao.

1163
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
You can leave now.

1164
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:27,960
No,

1165
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,840
"e mo" is here for them.

1166
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,800
E mo is going to kill them.

1167
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,680
Yes.

1168
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,680
I can save my dad, too.

1169
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,360
Get out of here!

1170
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,960
Brother for life,

1171
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,760
his door is locked.

1172
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,400
Well,

1173
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,120
Go after him!

1174
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,120
"e mo" is lying to them,

1175
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,880
this is a rumor,

1176
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,080
You committed suicide voluntarily again, right?

1177
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,360
They want to "cross",

1178
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,520
to save their own.

1179
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,000
Yes.

1180
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,640
So in our

1181
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,600
previous timeline,

1182
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,880
I also thought that jumping from the ninth floor,

1183
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,640
no wonder we were all,

1184
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,040
No wonder we're dead.

1185
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,400
Everyone committed suicide by jumping off a building.

1186
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,640
Let's find a way to save them.

1187
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,240
Save them.

1188
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,600
Yeah, we can't leave him in disarray.

1189
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,520
How...

1190
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,800
how can I save him?

1191
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,160
Where are you going?

1192
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,560
A walkie-talkie,

1193
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,440
He,

1194
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,120
Looking for He?

1195
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,000
Ask Xiao He to go directly to the ninth floor.

1196
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,760
He He?

1197
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
What's wrong?

1198
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:39,960
Something happened.

1199
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,960
I told him to go to the ninth floor.

1200
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,280
408 or 405?

1201
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:42,840
On the 9th floor,

1202
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,120
someone wants to jump from the 9th floor.

1203
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,480
Xiaokai and Cao Yangguang,

1204
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,520
what?

1205
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,480
Did anyone jump off the building?

1206
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,240
quickly

1207
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:49,960
9th floor,

1208
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,560
hurry up.

1209
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,800
They're going from the fourth floor to the ninth floor.

1210
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,520
I'm going to jump.

1211
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,120
If you go there later, they'll be late.

1212
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,160
Okay,

1213
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,880
Where are you?

1214
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,800
Is it on the ninth floor or somewhere?

1215
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
If you want to wait any longer,

1216
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,320
just listen to me, okay?

1217
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,920
No,

1218
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,160
they're going to jump off the building if you go to the ninth floor.

1219
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,920
We're on the fourth floor.

1220
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,520
Never mind where we are.

1221
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:06,800
Okay,

1222
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,160
I'm on my way to the ninth floor.

1223
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,000
I'll be there soon.

1224
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,640
Okay.

1225
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,320
Youyou,

1226
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,480
I've just reached the ninth floor.

1227
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,600
But I didn't see anyone.

1228
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:38,560
Oh no.

1229
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,080
I saw it.

1230
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,720
They've already jumped.

1231
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:47,680
Let's go.

1232
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,520
Jump out of the window,

1233
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,080
Hurry up!

1234
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,280
So that I can see Xiao Nao,

1235
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,200
and leave quickly.

1236
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,080
And Cao Yangguang,

1237
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:52,600
Kai,

1238
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,560
These two "culprits"

1239
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,240
Must "die".

1240
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,440
Why don't you come to 408

1241
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,160
You do it.

1242
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:06,760
Help us!

1243
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,840
Help us!

1244
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,520
Okay,

1245
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,400
I'll come to you right away.

1246
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,960
So now let's go back to

1247
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,920
the question we just talked about,

1248
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,000
Who can prove that

1249
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,200
you did it yourself,

1250
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,200
Yes.

1251
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,680
Who is the Avenger?

1252
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,400
Hold on.

1253
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,520
I think for now,

1254
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,520
He,

1255
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,520
Why did you change your mind again?

1256
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,080
Didn't you just say it was me?

1257
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,720
Didn't you just say it was me?

1258
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,120
Because you're too normal.

1259
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,520
Brother Bai is angry.

1260
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,160
I'm not angry.

1261
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,960
I don't value you anymore,

1262
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,960
Brother Bai.

1263
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,320
My brother,

1264
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,520
my brother,

1265
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,800
How did you become so fast?

1266
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,040
The two of you

1267
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,000
just crossed the line crazily,

1268
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,680
He has no principles

1269
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,360
or stance at all.

1270
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,160
How can you prove that

1271
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,280
there's something wrong with you?

1272
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:52,880
You want to go first?

1273
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,840
I'm fine.

1274
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,600
Anyone here?

1275
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,360
I'm here.

1276
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,360
How do you know this place?

1277
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,640
I saw that the door was open,

1278
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,200
and the door was locked by a big chain.

1279
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,040
I can't get in at all.

1280
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,600
Open the door first.

1281
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,040
What?

1282
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,800
There seems to be a key here.

1283
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,320
Let me see.

1284
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,080
It's open.

1285
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,640
How's your investigation going?

1286
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,440
We're investigating a mole.

1287
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,200
It's as simple as that.

1288
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,360
Let's go.

1289
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,960
Let's take all the clues with us.

1290
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,200
Let's go to the property monitoring room to discuss it,

1291
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,560
Let's go.

1292
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,560
Give me the suitcase.

1293
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,000
Give him the box. Be

1294
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,560
careful!

1295
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,400
Look, Bai is about to run away.

1296
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,800
Lao Bai wants to run away,

1297
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,760
he really wants to leave?

1298
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:09,880
What are you doing?

1299
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,760
This unlucky guy

1300
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,040
comes here every time.

1301
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,120
It seems that everyone is here.

1302
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,120
I specially arranged this position

1303
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:35,880
like this today.

1304
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,160
It's convenient for us to discuss.

1305
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,640
Because I heard from you just now,

1306
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,120
there's a mole

1307
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,160
among you.

1308
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,480
How's your investigation going?

1309
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,360
We're investigating a mole.

1310
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,520
The "mole" must have replaced

1311
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,640
the "dead" person,

1312
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,000
Lurking in our place,

1313
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,240
in my place I won't rule out

1314
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,080
any of you,

1315
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,760
He might have died in his previous life.

1316
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,760
In the previous life, "real death" and "fake death",

1317
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,280
we really have no way to know this.

1318
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,720
The person pretending to be a girl may not be

1319
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,200
Guo Baoyou,

1320
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,200
Their plots are connected,

1321
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,560
but I didn't see the person who hit me.

1322
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,320
What does he look like?

1323
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,000
In your family group,

1324
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,800
he never said a word.

1325
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,040
Ke Ke didn't show himself in her account.

1326
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,000
All we have to do is point out that what I did,

1327
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,760
that woman can't do it.

1328
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,080
He must be wearing this shell

1329
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,880
because he just started to want to do it recently.

1330
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,240
Because he's starting to be exposed.

1331
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,320
Don't worry about it, bro,

1332
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,200
At this point.

1333
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,360
You've hurt everyone.

1334
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,880
What do you mean by falling on me for no reason?

1335
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,200
Lock Tencent Video,

1336
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,880
update 1 episode every Thursday, Friday, Friday and 6 pm.

1337
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,680
Members watch it first for 1 week,

1338
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,800

1339
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,040
00  case tracking every Sunday

1340
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,160
night at 6: 00,

1341
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,720
See Jiageng's Diary of Apartment 11.

1342
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,400
In the middle of the week, there were a lot of short videos of the preview tidbits,

1343
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,760
which were swiped every day,

1344
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,120
Let me show you a 360-degree exploration of Apartment 11,

1345
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,520
and open the Tencent video soon.

1346
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,480
Search .

1347
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,000
Immerse yourself with the bulldozers.
