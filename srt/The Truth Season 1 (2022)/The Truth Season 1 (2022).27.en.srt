1
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,560
It's just someone falling down

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,720
Xiao Bamei

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,680
I'm Bamei

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,240
We're in this together

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,880
I was taken away

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,720
You must come save me

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,280
What do we have in common?

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,360
Could it be that we've also "died"?

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,320
Insomnia Convenience Store

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,080
The counseling room hides their secrets

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,360
We successfully rescued Bamei

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,240
But she left in a hurry

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,360
Seems like she had something important to do

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,000
She only left us one clue

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,640
Behind the large cabinet in the consultation room

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,960
There's a password-protected door

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,040
And the password is hidden in the cabinet

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,560
This

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,080
should be useful

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,000
Right

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,200
Won't open

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,000
Some of these won't open

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,400
Yeah

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,760
There's a door behind this cabinet

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:30,960
Really?

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,680
Like this

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,400
If we want to uncover all the secrets

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,480
We must get through that door

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,720
But the first step to opening the password door

30
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,440
Is opening this cabinet

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,760
Wait

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,280
After pulling it open

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,520
We found something here

34
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,280
Password

35
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,520
Password boxes

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,120
There are so many

37
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,080
Here are

38
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
Six

39
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,880
Try pushing it

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240
Can't open these cabinets

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,400
There's a hole left here

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,360
Probably meant to retrieve from here

43
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,760
No one's hand can reach it

44
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,800
No, this thing is too big

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
It's impossible to take out

46
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,760
Right, impossible

47
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,720
Wait, which cabinet is this?

48
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,440
The ones that won't open

49
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,400
Exactly, the ones that won't open

50
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
Just these unopenable cabinets

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
How do I open this?

52
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,040
But there must be a reason for leaving this hole.

53
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,160
The hole might be...

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,480
Pull out that drawer and then push it through.

55
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:21,840
Right.

56
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,600
Such a big box

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,560
Such a small hole

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,000
No, how does it open?

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Stop trying

60
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,600
Can we try a smarter approach?

61
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,000
Sorry

62
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,600
Can this be opened?

63
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,400
Don't you think this

64
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,680
Don't you think this box looks just like

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,320
the one we saw in Gu Yangsheng's room that day?

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,800
What I got

67
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,840
It's somewhat like that mortise and tenon joint

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,720
Luban lock

69
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,520
That Luban lock feeling

70
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,560
If it weren't for this

71
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
Let's pull out all the drawers

72
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,360
After pulling them all out

73
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,000
See if it can open

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,040
Must follow the order

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,200
Let's first pull out everything we can

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,080
This one's so long

77
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,760
Some are short, some are long, right?

78
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,200
Can go in to get it

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
I'm going to crawl in

80
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,560
Don't crawl in, you might get stuck

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,040
No, there's a wooden board behind this

82
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,920
Can it move?

83
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,200
It won't budge

84
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,360
Could you be a little smarter?

85
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,840
This doesn't seem right, come out

86
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,640
No one knows how to unlock this

87
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,480
No one can solve this lock

88
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,360
Pull
Can't

89
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,680
Definitely can't use brute force

90
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,040
Right

91
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,280
No, there's a wooden board behind this

92
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,480
This one seems like it can be pulled out

93
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,040
Which one?

94
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,920
This isn't

95
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,680
No, this

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,440
This

97
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,680
Bro, did you remove it?

98
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,960
Yes, can't

99
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,720
Bro, you disassembled this thing

100
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,000
Can't pull it out?

101
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,640
You have to draw it

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,080
Are you all crazy?

103
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
Try pulling the drawer to see if it comes out

104
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,960
We were wrong

105
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,440
We misunderstood you, Lao Bai

106
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
Sorry, brother

107
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:45,720
Sorry, brother

108
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,520
I'm sorry

109
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,600
This is so frustrating

110
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,560
There's actually milk here

111
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,360
Let's dismantle whatever we can first

112
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,160
Gone now

113
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,360
Everything removable has been pulled out

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,080
So we need to keep dismantling, right?

115
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,040
This one moves

116
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,200
Right, we can pull out one more here

117
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,960
Gotta say

118
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,760
Honestly speaking

119
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,520
Not to be rude but

120
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,600
Old Bai is really helpful

121
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
Old Bai is truly great

122
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,280
Really good

123
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
This is ridiculous

124
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,800
Push from inside

125
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,920
Otherwise your arms definitely won't reach

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,160
Right, there's one

127
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,040
Finally

128
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,680
Six

129
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,440
Passwords

130
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,360
Password-protected small boxes

131
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,800
Alright, the physical work is done

132
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,600
You can take a break now

133
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,280
Taking another break already

134
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,440
You're the laborer

135
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,000
Six passwords

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,560
Each box seems to have a different password

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,280
She said after she infiltrated

138
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,120
She obtained many secrets

139
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,240
And they're all related to us

140
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,720
Six passwords

141
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,280
Could they be our six names?

142
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,560
Right

143
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,800
Let me see who's here

144
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,640
F - do we have an F?

145
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,240
No

146
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,520
Mine should be Ke Wuku

147
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,240
Guo, check if there's one

148
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,400
Guo

149
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,440
No Liu

150
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,400
No L

151
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,320
I can't find it either

152
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,320
No L

153
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,240
Our characters are the same

154
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,760
They're all the same

155
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,560
If they're all the same, that can't be right

156
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,200
All our initials are the same

157
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,760
Right?

158
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Then it probably isn't our names

159
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,640
Not our initials

160
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,480
But could they form a character together?

161
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,440
A three-character one

162
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,200
What could it be?

163
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:29,880
K

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,480
There's actually milk here

165
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,760
There's milk

166
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,600
Take out the milk

167
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,320
Real fruit pieces

168
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,080
Is there any? Right?

169
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,960
Yes, there's so much inside

170
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,520
Real tea, real fruit - "Grapefruit Meets You"

171
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
Tea and fruit meet in "Grapefruit Meets You"

172
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,200
Real tea, real fruit - "Grapefruit Meets You"

173
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,160
Remember our "Grapefruit Meets You" promise

174
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,200
Tea meets fruit

175
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,360
"Grapefruit Meets You"

176
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,080
The "Grapefruit Meets You" project

177
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,840
It must succeed

178
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,280
What about "Grapefruit Meets You"?

179
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,320
"Grapefruit Meets You" feels like...

180
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,480
"Grapefruit Meets You"

181
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,400
Impressive

182
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,880
It's open

183
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,320
"Yuzu Meet You Project" Agreement

184
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,360
Has serial numbers

185
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,240
I'm Number Three

186
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,240
I'm Number Two

187
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,800
I'm Number Six

188
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,600
I'm Number Five

189
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,480
Four

190
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,200
Number One

191
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,560
Number One goes first

192
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,120
Number One first

193
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,680
Go ahead

194
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,120
"Yuzu Meet You Project" Agreement

195
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,200
"Yuzu Meet You Project"

196
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,640
Initiated by Yurai Doll

197
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,880
This project involves

198
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,960
the truth behind the apartment's mysterious legend

199
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,800
Therefore all members must maintain secrecy

200
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,880
Strictly adhere to the following rules

201
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,920
1.

202
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,720
This project has extremely low feasibility and success rate

203
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,280
Except for organization members

204
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,400
Absolutely must not be disclosed to outsiders

205
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,120
Otherwise it will inevitably cause

206
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,080
Unpredictable consequences

207
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,080
2.

208
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,960
After the project succeeds

209
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,240
Must strictly monitor

210
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,320
the target's every move

211
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,480
When necessary

212
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,720
Restrict the target's freedom of movement

213
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,840
To avoid repeating past mistakes

214
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,160
3.

215
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,680
If the target shows memory confusion

216
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,720
or unknown aftereffects

217
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
Notify other members immediately

218
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,320
To avoid affecting subsequent plans

219
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,720
4.

220
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,520
Members must gather regularly at the office

221
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,200
Share information

222
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,640
Supervise each other

223
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,880
If any rule is violated

224
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,240
Will be expelled from the project

225
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,280
Future information will never be shared

226
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,840
5.

227
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,640
Members may use the next page

228
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,200
to record their most important notes

229
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,360
For personal reference

230
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,000
Guard against leaks

231
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,960
This part is the same for all of us.

232
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,560
Exactly the same.

233
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,680
The agreement is identical.

234
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,880
After the plan succeeds,

235
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,440
we must closely monitor

236
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,840
every move of the target.

237
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,320
If necessary,

238
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,080
restrict the target's freedom of movement.

239
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,680
To prevent

240
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,040
history from repeating itself.

241
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,440
Something terrible happened before.

242
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,360
Yes, their plan

243
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,200
must be to prevent

244
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,920
something that occurred in the past.

245
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,320
The jumping incident.

246
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,680
We've already seen her jump twice.

247
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,360
Again

248
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,320
And she's still alive

249
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,480
Who are you?

250
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm Bamei

251
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,920
You're Bamei?

252
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,680
Yes, so it's repeating

253
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,440
What could it possibly be?

254
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,320
That the six of us

255
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,720
Are also experiencing memory confusion

256
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,240
He might be having memory confusion

257
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,800
Or some other aftereffects

258
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,560
Actually, it's our problem

259
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
The person we saw fall

260
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,200
What was that?

261
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,640
Only we could see it

262
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,800
Or we witnessed her jumping

263
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,520
So this memory

264
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,840
Keeps resurfacing in our minds

265
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,400
No wonder on the first day, apart from us,

266
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,120
even the Teng Agency

267
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,880
had never seen that jumper.

268
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Someone jumped off the building.

269
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,400
The falling incident

270
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:07,960
Falling from height

271
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,920
We're not staying here anymore.

272
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,440
Your "haunted house"

273
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,360
How come I didn't see it?

274
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,120
That's possible

275
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,080
Something terrible must have happened

276
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,960
Yes, their plan

277
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,840
must be to prevent

278
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,760
something that happened before

279
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,800
It must be a rescue plan

280
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,480
His intentions must be good

281
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,560
It should be a good plan

282
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:38,880
Right

283
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,920
This puppet has something special

284
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,720
This is your ex-boyfriend

285
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,240
Puppet, your ex-boyfriend

286
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,400
How amazing to have such a god-like ex

287
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,320
Seriously, why would I still hang out with you guys

288
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,720
Just go ascend to heaven already

289
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
Suddenly looking down on us

290
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,920
What's that supposed to mean

291
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,040
Looking down on us, all of a sudden

292
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,880
If I were with him

293
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,280
You guys could just go home and sleep

294
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,200
Right

295
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,120
Besides this piece of paper

296
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,160
I also have a photo

297
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,960
How do you have a photo?

298
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,080
The photo shows

299
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,200
Bai Sanwan with a mysterious woman

300
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,440
Isn't this that person? Zhenzhen

301
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:16,920
Zhenzhen

302
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,320
June 1st

303
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,800
June 1st

304
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,240
June 1st, 2022

305
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,640
You saw it again?

306
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,680
No, then what he saw must be

307
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,400
Jiajia

308
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,960
Are you with Jiajia?

309
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,040
"Scumbag"

310
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,880
Why aren't you done yet?

311
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,480
Trouble keeps piling up for you

312
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,440
Zhenzhen "died"

313
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,400
You're with her sister now, right?

314
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,320
Look at yourself

315
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,680
Look at what you've done

316
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,840
Explain yourself

317
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,720
Why should I explain?

318
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,360
This is my own business

319
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,280
Why should I explain to you?

320
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,040
Why do you...

321
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Still making this about "you" vs "us"?

322
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
We're all one team now

323
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,880
Right?

324
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,960
I think there's something wrong with you

325
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,920
I think you have issues

326
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,840
I do have issues

327
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,560
Just say it already

328
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,000
Fine, I'll tell you

329
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,160
Zhenzhen didn't "die"

330
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,120
Neither Zhenzhen nor Jiajia are actually "dead"

331
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,120
Then whose "corpse" did we see?

332
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,680
Zhenzhen

333
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,840
The "corpse" was indeed her

334
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,440
But she didn't actually "die"

335
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,520
What about the "corpse"?

336
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,080
Let me explain that first

337
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,520
"Feigned death"

338
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,080
"Faking death"

339
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,800
Their goal

340
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,280
was to catch Screenwriter Song

341
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,840
Because

342
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,080
Zhenzhen really didn't want

343
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,600
Jiajia to be with Screenwriter Song

344
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,720
Jiajia also discovered

345
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,280
Screenwriter Song's true nature

346
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,560
So the two of them planned

347
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,920
this "faked death" scenario

348
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,080
She managed to record

349
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,840
Screenwriter Song's criminal actions

350
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,880
as evidence to give to the authorities

351
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,440
So they were actually

352
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,760
doing this to catch the criminal

353
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Yes, actually during this time

354
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,680
I've been living happily

355
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,920
with Zhenzhen all along

356
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,680
What about Jiajia?

357
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,280
But doesn't Jiajia like you?

358
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,880
These matters are none of your concern.

359
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,600
It's unrelated to this case.

360
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
Here you go again.

361
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,720
So annoying.

362
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,560
You've become quite impressive now.

363
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,240
You now...

364
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,440
But the problem is...

365
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,240
"The killer"

366
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,960
Deceiving both sides.

367
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,880
She used her sister's phone number,

368
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,200
then sent messages to several of us,

369
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,480
making us go look for her.

370
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,920
Then used the sister's handwriting to deceive the other sister,

371
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,120
making her come to the meeting.

372
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,280
The sister went to Room 1 at 13:40.

373
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,200
Screenwriter Song began manipulating it,

374
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,160
making a complete 180-degree turn.

375
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,200
Then...

376
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,000
He got on the vehicle here,

377
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,080
the vehicle turned...

378
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,280
made a full circle and returned.

379
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,040
He got off again at this spot.

380
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,360
On May 6th,

381
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,440
Screenwriter Song created the "murder" plan.

382
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,040
Why did Jiajia and Zhenzhen

383
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,080
know about it in advance?

384
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,040
What did her sister say just now?

385
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,680
She said the password is in the cabinet.

386
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,880
The password is inside the cabinet.

387
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,440
But when we opened the cabinet,

388
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,280
there was only that one (vial) inside.

389
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,920
What is this thing?

390
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,720
No idea.

391
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,520
This must be useful.

392
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,320
Let me smell it.

393
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,360
Sorry, everyone.

394
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,000
Here we go again.

395
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,800
Should we spray it onto that (paper)?

396
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,440
Members can use the next page

397
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,080
to note down their most important information

398
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,200
for easy reference

399
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,920
Guard against leaks

400
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,120
I guess I'll just spray it then

401
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,720
Let me try spraying it first

402
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Nothing's coming out

403
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,560
Anything?

404
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,640
Is it showing up?

405
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,120
No

406
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,800
Try spraying it again

407
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,600
I got a...

408
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,120
character appearing

409
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,680
It's obvious

410
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,880
Before Xiao Xiaowang

411
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,040
"committed suicide"

412
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,000
contacted him to cooperate

413
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,960
used their secret to threaten Xiao Xiaowang

414
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,400
How did you know about our

415
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,680
entire scam plan at Retro Street?

416
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,800
Then Old Li said

417
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,480
Don't worry about it

418
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,640
I already know everything anyway

419
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,400
On June 25th

420
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,440
I was here

421
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,160
and intercepted Xiao Xiaowang

422
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,960
He told me

423
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,920
he could help me

424
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,040
clear my name

425
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,120
Clear my name

426
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,680
and restore

427
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,400
the truth about the 1988 warehouse

428
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,600
"murder" case

429
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,400
This should be Old Li's

430
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,920
right?

431
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,280
How about this one?

432
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,840
Let me think about it briefly

433
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,920
On the day of the family recognition ceremony

434
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,640
I must make my move before my son does

435
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,120
Guoba

436
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,920
Your dad

437
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,640
Ju Yangsheng

438
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,680
Account: Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs

439
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,760
Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs

440
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,120
guoba0914

441
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,080
My dad - that's my father

442
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,800
Your father

443
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,880
In his phone

444
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,840
There's a reminder

445
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,040
It's a memo

446
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,840
It says:

447
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,880
"Real tea, real fruit - Pomelo Meets You"

448
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,920
"Pomelo Meets You" - hope everything goes well

449
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,000
So that means

450
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,640
my father actually made his move too

451
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,840
Your father took action

452
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,480
Didn't we think my father

453
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,040
had no motive?

454
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,520
Could this be his motive?

455
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,480
To act before I did

456
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,600
Didn't we buy those donuts at the time?

457
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,280
Heifasen

458
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,520
So it was your father

459
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,400
who was also in the "Pomelo Meets You" plan

460
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:55,880
Yes

461
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,240
Yes

462
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,560
Yes

463
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,480
If caught

464
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,839
The password starts from 14201

465
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,640
Fang Xiaomei

466
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,319
Right, Fang Xiaomei

467
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,800
I've been locked here for seven days

468
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,839
These are all the passwords I've tried

469
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,480
We even asked her at the time

470
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,119
Asked why it starts from 14201

471
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,240
She said it's my own business

472
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,200
Who has number six?

473
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Find him quickly and take care of him

474
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,359
Isn't that what's-his-name?

475
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:26,839
Coming?

476
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,040
Yes, Lai Wan'ou

477
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,720
So that's your boyfriend

478
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,440
Which case is the blank one?

479
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,120
Ke Wuku

480
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,280
Deputy Manager Fu doesn't have it

481
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,720
Deputy Manager Fu doesn't, right

482
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,920
"Meet You Pomelo Plan"

483
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,680
Initiated by Lai Wan'ou

484
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,720
Nothing there

485
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,040
Find him quickly and take care of him

486
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,560
Is it possible

487
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,520
Find him and protect him

488
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,720
It's Ke Wuku's matter

489
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,160
Find him quickly

490
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,320
Take care of him

491
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,160
This blank might be you

492
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,640
You're directly responsible to the boss

493
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,280
The matter with number six

494
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,520
Probably has to do with Ke Wuku

495
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,560
The only ones who can protect my brother

496
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,320
Are either my sister or my brother

497
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,480
Brother Ku

498
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:15,920
Fei

499
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,200
Real tea, real fruit, meet you pomelo

500
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,680
Remember the "Meet You Pomelo" promise

501
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,200
How many hands?

502
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,560
Six

503
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:21,880
Six

504
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,120
Six

505
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,640
Right, it's Boss Fei

506
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,160
Fei

507
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,680
Fei

508
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,840
Boss Fei is number six, right?

509
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,920
So the blank one is Lai (Wan'ou)

510
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,160
Should we move over here now?

511
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,120
Right?

512
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,480
"Meet You" is it? Come on.

513
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:46,880
No

514
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
At most we can input up to here

515
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,120
One, two, three, four, five, six

516
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,840
A six-digit password

517
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,640
What's this password related to?

518
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
Zhenguoli Hongyou Four Seasons Spring Pomelo Meets You

519
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,120
Let's try it

520
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,760
Z

521
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,520
G

522
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,640
Li L

523
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,880
ZG Li L

524
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,000
ZG Li L

525
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,760
You can either read it as pinyin

526
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,960
Or as English letters

527
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
ZGL

528
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,440
Z

529
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:02,960
G

530
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,840
L

531
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,720
That's not it either

532
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,440
Look at the fourth item

533
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,320
Members regularly gather at the office

534
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,160
Share information

535
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,000
Supervise each other

536
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,960
This means every one of them

537
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,920
Should know this office password

538
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,760
Right

539
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,560
Then it must be

540
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,800
Related to each of them

541
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,320
Let's type their names

542
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,120
Try inputting them

543
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,680
No, that's too long

544
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,720
Won't fit the digit limit

545
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,040
Then use their surname initials

546
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,880
Input in this order

547
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,280
Following one, two, three, four, five

548
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,400
First is Old Man Li

549
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,800
Old Man Li

550
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,840
Old Man Li - Li

551
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,000
Li, who's second?

552
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,320
Whose phone did we see it on?

553
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,600
The best friend of the jumper

554
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,560
How could you choose this method

555
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,360
Jiajia

556
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,080
Jia

557
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,320
Two, Jiajia

558
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,120
Number three is me

559
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,160
Li, Jia, Guo

560
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,400
Fang, Lai, Fei

561
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:04,880
Okay

562
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,240
Fang Laifei

563
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,480
It's open

564
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,400
Let's go

565
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,720
Okay

566
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,760
Come on

567
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,160
Let's go together

568
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,800
Uncover

569
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,560
the truth

570
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,640
Heartbreak

571
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,040
Heartbreak

572
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,440
Loneliness

573
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,880
Loneliness

574
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,320
Fear of punishment

575
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:43,840
Fear of punishment

576
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,800
Taking the blame

577
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,160
Guilt

578
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,880
Guilt

579
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,440
Anxiety

580
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,360
What does this mean?

581
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,760
This definitely can move

582
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,440
This

583
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:01,880
Flip it over

584
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,880
This is all us

585
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,880
Even if we avoid heartless "scumbags"

586
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,560
Stay away from negative friends

587
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,000
We still can't get satisfying love

588
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,680
Anxiety, the one who loves anxiety most

589
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,400
Snap it in for her

590
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,800
Right? Must get married by thirty

591
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,320
This is everyone's experience

592
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,680
This is everyone's sin

593
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,280
Come on, stick it in the right place

594
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,360
Come on, Bai Sanwan, what are you?

595
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,200
He must be heartbroken

596
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,800
Why is he heartbroken?

597
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,680
Why am I heartbroken?

598
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,320
He's always been

599
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,880
I'm heartbroken

600
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
I lost Jiajia's love

601
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,200
Why are you so vicious

602
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,040
Admitting this

603
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,160
What is Keke?

604
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,120
I feel like I did nothing

605
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,680
Loneliness

606
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,240
He is loneliness

607
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,760
Loneliness

608
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,920
I feel like I am loneliness

609
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,960
Should be

610
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,680
Imagine his friend is like this

611
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,600
How could he not be lonely?

612
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,640
What?

613
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,920
What's wrong with our NiaoNiao?

614
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,000
No

615
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,680
Nothing

616
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,040
What do you mean "my friend is like this"?

617
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,000
No offense

618
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,360
No, think about when you were little

619
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,040
People always bullied you

620
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,680
He was bullied as a child

621
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,920
Saying no one wants this kid

622
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,400
You're definitely the one taking the blame

623
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,840
Right?

624
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,560
He's not taking the blame

625
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,240
He's committing crimes

626
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,800
Then I must tell you all

627
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,080
Actually, I'm Kewuku

628
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,600
The one who went in is Kewuku

629
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,960
Just kidding

630
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,080
Very possible

631
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,400
You see

632
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,680
Why would Ku "kill" someone?

633
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,280
Actually, he's afraid of his previous crimes

634
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,200
So he commits another crime

635
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,000
Fine, you... let you...

636
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,560
Fear of punishment

637
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,160
So Ku could be fearing punishment, right?

638
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,560
Yes

639
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,040
What about you?

640
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,400
I feel no guilt, nor will I take the blame

641
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,080
This loneliness

642
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,000
Anxiety

643
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,840
Let's just pick one randomly first

644
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
I'm definitely not taking the blame

645
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,840
You try taking the blame

646
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,440
I'll take the blame

647
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
Not moving

648
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,240
Wrong

649
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,160
No response, right?

650
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,280
The "Meet You Project" was initiated by the dolls

651
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,960
May I let go of my emotions

652
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,680
With all sincerity

653
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,000
Say to you

654
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,520
I'm sorry

655
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,640
Thirty years old

656
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,600
I was in happiness

657
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,960
Wrong

658
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,400
It was my fault

659
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,720
My strong-willed father all his life

660
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,080
You are a beam of light in the darkness

661
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,640
Illuminating my past of despair

662
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,400
Some people, once missed

663
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,320
Are gone forever

664
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,600
Is it related to what the dolls did

665
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,320
And the songs our dolls played

666
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,480
Mine was

667
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,320
Saying "I'm sorry"

668
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,080
So I feel

669
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,440
Guilty

670
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,200
And yours was "a beam of light in the darkness"

671
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,080
Which means loneliness

672
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,520
Loneliness

673
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,720
The bitter doll cried "wrong"

674
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,960
Wrong, it was all my fault

675
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,320
Yes, it was all my fault

676
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,440
Taking the blame

677
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,160
Fear of punishment

678
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,440
Here it comes

679
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:16,720
Alright

680
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,560
That music again

681
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,920
That creepy "death" music from the doll

682
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,000
It's coming

683
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,400
This guy

684
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,760
Everyone?

685
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,840
He mapped out everyone's connections

686
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,240
Motives

687
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,240
All laid out clearly

688
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,840
Too unbelievable

689
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,920
On the blackboard

690
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,840
We saw a

691
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,320
Massive relationship chart

692
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,000
Everyone

693
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
All connections

694
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,200
So the truth

695
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
All outcomes

696
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,000
Since her "death" passed

697
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,280
Everyone has "committed suicide" by jumping

698
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
What

699
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,680
What the hell

700
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,640
The truth

701
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,920
appeared so abruptly

702
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,560
before our eyes

703
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,480
Everyone was too shocked to speak

704
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,200
All of this

705
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,040
Is it real?

706
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,080
The most recent was Song Piaoliang

707
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,640
She lasted ninety-two days

708
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,120
Then

709
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,600
suffered

710
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,160
took the blame

711
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,160
I jumped to my "suicide"

712
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,280
out of fear of punishment

713
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,760
I was consumed by guilt

714
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,320
Nine hundred fourteen

715
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,040
As of today

716
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,960
it's been

717
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,120
nine hundred forty-five plus one hundred five days since his "death"

718
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,720
We've all "died"

719
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,960
So have we "time-traveled" back?

720
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,200
Are we "dead"?

721
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,040
Then what are we?

722
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,960
And what is this place?

723
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,920
Does Apartment 11 really exist?

724
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,720
Look

725
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,480
There's a 50% off coupon here

726
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,360
Is everything we've experienced

727
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,960
real?

728
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,240
Who was the jumper?

729
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,480
This question that has haunted us

730
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,120
since the first day we moved in

731
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,440
What's really going on?

732
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,720
We all "died" by

733
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,320
jumping to our "suicides"

734
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,600
Countless new questions

735
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
came rushing

736
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,880
at us in that moment

737
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,520
They say the person who jumped from the building

738
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,640
was actually one of us

739
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,360
one of us

740
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,240
I never imagined you, who once meant so much to me

741
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,520
would end your life by jumping

742
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,640
You, the most important person

743
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,800
have left forever

744
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,720
I experienced

745
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,200
my dearest one jumping to their death

746
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,720
What were you thinking in that final moment?

747
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,480
That most important person

748
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,680
I didn't witness when they jumped

749
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,240
Two months later you "committed suicide"

750
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,760
Anyway, the six people in the "Meet You Project"

751
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,560
were meant to help us

752
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,120
prevent something that happened before

753
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,800
and stop us from "committing suicide," right?

754
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,760
That's a possibility

755
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,120
So the order in which we "died"

756
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,600
Is there anything worth investigating?

757
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,720
I "died" first

758
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,840
It's been the longest

759
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,240
Second was Liu Xialai

760
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,120
Right

761
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,960
Third was me

762
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,640
Fourth was...

763
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,320
It was me

764
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,120
You

765
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,200
Mine's approaching two years now

766
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,400
Fifth was Ku

767
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,240
Nearly a year

768
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,280
What exactly is this guilt you're feeling about?

769
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,320
If Old Man Li hadn't interfered with you

770
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,360
Let me think

771
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,160
Old Liu

772
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,680
Why are you lonely?

773
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,520
What did Fang Xiaomei do

774
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,640
to prevent your loneliness?

775
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,520
She didn't do anything to prevent my loneliness.

776
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,640
There's a combination lock over there

777
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,880
But there are two for each

778
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,040
One, two, three, four, five, six

779
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,480
These six

780
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,960
Probably correspond to the six of us

781
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,680
Right

782
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,320
Then according to

783
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,040
the order on this wall

784
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,320
The first one should be Liu

785
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
It's four digits

786
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,120
This password

787
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,480
Could it be our "death" date?

788
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:54,920
Possibly

789
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,640
There are two

790
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,560
Which year

791
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,640
Which month and day

792
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,440
That makes eight digits

793
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,240
Let's calculate

794
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,200
Today is

795
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,160
July 15, 2022

796
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,360
Get a pen

797
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,240
Get a pen for this thing

798
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,680
Look, we've added 105 days already

799
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,200
Let's first go back 105 days

800
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,400
Today is the 15th

801
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,800
Which means

802
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,480
The 10th would be 100 days, right?

803
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,440
Then go back 10 more days, that's 90 days

804
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,200
June has 30 days

805
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,120
May has 31 days

806
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,800
April 2nd

807
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,400
April 1st or April 2nd

808
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,760
Depending on whether you count today

809
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,840
Today is the 105th day, correct?

810
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,640
Not counting today

811
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,120
So we calculate from April 1st

812
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,640
Right?

813
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,160
Yes

814
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,520
Then that would be

815
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,760
April 1st, 2022

816
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,280
Starting from that date

817
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,240
Calculate your own previous number

818
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,680
Right?

819
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,120
And for those adding multiple years

820
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,800
We need to remember leap years and common years

821
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,160
Yes

822
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,720
This year isn't a leap year

823
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,400
Divide by four

824
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
If divisible, it's a leap year

825
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,440
If not divisible, it's not a leap year

826
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,880
Each of us

827
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,200
Should calculate our own first

828
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,080
Calculate your own first

829
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,400
Thirty days has September, April, June and November

830
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,200
All the rest have thirty-one

831
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,840
My February has 28 days

832
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,000
Subtract 28 days for February

833
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,680
This calculation is so hard, it's giving me a headache

834
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:15,880
Why?

835
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,280
Why did they give me such a difficult one?

836
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,320
I can't figure it out

837
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,240
I can't calculate it either

838
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,680
January also has 31 days, right?

839
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,800
I don't know

840
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,200
January has 31 days too, right Xiao Guo?

841
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,360
Yes

842
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:32,680
Uncle

843
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,680
Haven't you lived through January before?

844
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,280
I'm trying my best

845
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,680
Right now I'm...

846
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,320
I can barely calculate my own stuff

847
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,760
And now...

848
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,720
Everyone keeps asking me questions

849
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,160
I'm really struggling

850
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,040
Uncle, hurry up

851
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,960
Calculate quickly, uncle

852
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,400
You guys can reference

853
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,720
The three of you can calculate as one person

854
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,080
Right

855
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,200
Only mine and Ku's are difficult

856
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,720
Suddenly realized having an uncle

857
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,520
Is actually quite nice

858
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,920
Counting back 31 days from April 1st

859
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,440
Gives you March 1st

860
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,840
Counting back 28 days from March 1st

861
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,560
Gives you February 1st

862
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,200
Counting back 31 days from February 1st

863
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,840
Gives you January 1st

864
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,240
Counting back 2 days from January 1st

865
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,320
Gives you December 31st

866
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,320
December 30th

867
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,160
You try it

868
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,240
December

869
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,840
30th

870
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,160
Opened

871
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,800
Opened

872
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,640
But I couldn't open it in 2021

873
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,760
It won't open above

874
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,840
The year is incorrect

875
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,920
Wait a moment, let me try again

876
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,160
No, friends

877
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,200
I opened it

878
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,880
I was here from 2021 to 2024

879
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Try them one by one

880
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,080
Year

881
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,760
On the year of your "death"

882
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,680
Add three years

883
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,520
Why

884
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,440
Calculating it

885
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,960
If we go by the current date

886
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,640
I "died" in 2021

887
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,400
But I started in 2024

888
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,760
Started in 2024

889
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,200
Right

890
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Yes

891
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,760
2019

892
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,080
Then add three more years

893
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,000
2022

894
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,240
I'm September 30th

895
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,640
Good

896
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,880
Very good

897
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
I'll subtract from your days

898
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,080
another thirty-one days

899
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,920
Subtract thirty-one days

900
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,480
Then isn't that August 30th?

901
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,720
I've already started

902
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
April 30th

903
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,160
Smart

904
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,800
Really smart

905
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,440
Friends, we did it!

906
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:23,880
Awesome

907
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,040
Thanks to you math geniuses

908
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,880
Let's say everyone's date again

909
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm August 30th, 2022

910
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,360
I'm August 20th, 2022

911
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,920
I'm

912
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,560
December 30th, 2024

913
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,040
I'm September 30th, 2022

914
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,560
I'm

915
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,320
June 20th, 2023

916
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,560
I'm April 30th, 2024

917
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,960
Tore it open, huh?

918
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,400
This stretch

919
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,160
Be careful

920
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,800
Watch your hands

921
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,000
Cool

922
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,960
It's open

923
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,320
Here's a stack of comics

924
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,480
Another stack is photos

925
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,680
There's writing on them

926
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,360
Let's take them out and look together

927
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,680
Let's hang them all up first

928
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,080
Then we'll look at them one by one, okay?

929
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,920
We should hang them over here

930
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,160
Can you reach it?

931
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,320
Why is my rope so short?

932
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,040
Here

933
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,600
Isn't this alive?

934
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Can't you just pull it?

935
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,600
You people are so unfriendly

936
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,160
Photos are records of our personal experiences

937
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,760
July 2nd

938
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,720
July 5th

939
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,320
Make the dates bigger here

940
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,200
The ending in the comic

941
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,920
We all "committed suicide" by jumping off buildings

942
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,639
Could the comic's content be about us

943
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,440
and our "death" experiences?

944
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:18,960
Watch mine

945
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,920
Let's check Old Liu's first

946
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,679
Look at Old Liu's

947
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,480
See how I "died"

948
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,639
This...

949
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,679
We should start with this one

950
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,560
This is the first one

951
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,480
This is the first one, right?

952
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,320
Look at the date

953
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,159
The clip has a date on it

954
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,239
May 6th

955
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:28,960
I was struggling

956
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,840
about meeting Cao Yueguang

957
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,040
I'm Fang Xiaomei

958
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,520
I was struggling with whether to meet Cao Yueguang

959
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
Just got home

960
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,320
and was knocked unconscious

961
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,040
When I woke up

962
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,400
I was locked in the storage room

963
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,199
Help!

964
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,920
I kept trying the combination lock

965
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,040
but unfortunately got caught

966
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,440
The storage room's combination lock

967
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,760
was replaced with a key lock

968
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
September 4, 2022

969
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,480
I finally escaped from the storage room

970
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,800
During my captivity

971
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,160
a woman was living in my home

972
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,240
I heard that one day ago

973
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,800
she was taken by debt collectors

974
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,960
After escaping the storage room

975
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,440
I heard that on May 13, 2022

976
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,400
in the abandoned power distribution room next to my home

977
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,160
a deliveryman named Song Huo "died"

978
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,120
Not sure if it was an accident or "murder"

979
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,960
This is the investigation report

980
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Song Huo was "electrocuted to death"

981
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
What date is this from?

982
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,720
This is from May 13, 2022

983
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,560
Five-one-three

984
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,600
Song Huo "died"

985
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,000
Meanwhile,

986
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,520
I heard that five days ago,

987
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,520
on August 30, 2022,

988
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,840
someone jumped to their "suicide."

989
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,280
People told me

990
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,560
it was Cao Yueguang.

991
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,240
This was the day I "died."

992
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,600
I "died" on August 30.

993
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,000
Suicide note.

994
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,600
Beside him

995
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,960
there was also a suicide note.

996
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,400
You were a beam of light in the darkness,

997
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,680
illuminating my desolate past.

998
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,840
But the light has gone out.

999
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,960
If I had met him earlier,

1000
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,080
perhaps none of this would have happened.

1001
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,640
Only then did I realize

1002
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,640
Only at this moment did I discover

1003
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,880
his biological brother had been searching for him all along.

1004
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,920
This should have been your original life.

1005
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,080
April 1, 2025.

1006
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,720
That was the day fate changed.

1007
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,640
From this day onward,

1008
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,000
everything starts anew.

1009
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,720
April 1, 2025.

1010
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,680
Look at the photo.

1011
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,080
Okay.

1012
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,280
Today is the day to start over.

1013
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,960
The photo - these are the friends.

1014
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,160
I returned to April 1, 2022 once again

1015
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,600
I decided to change myself

1016
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,960
and meet Cao Yueguang as soon as possible

1017
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,000
and tell his biological brother on this day

1018
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,280
that he's with the Cao family

1019
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,080
On April 1st

1020
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,000
someone sent me a WeChat message

1021
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,440
saying my brother was adopted by the Cao family

1022
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,520
May 3, 2022

1023
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,320
After my plastic surgery

1024
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,960
I tried to contact Cao Yueguang

1025
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,720
but couldn't reach him no matter what

1026
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,200
I hired someone to investigate Cao Yueguang's whereabouts

1027
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,560
They said on February 15, 2022

1028
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,280
Cao Yueguang was "killed"

1029
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,400
I was very confused

1030
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,280
why he was "murdered"

1031
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,320
instead of "jumping to his death"

1032
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,640
Why did his "death" happen earlier

1033
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,400
even before the reset time of April 1st?

1034
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,440
Why so many changes?

1035
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,200
April 1st is a reset time

1036
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,360
April 1st reset time

1037
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,520
May 4, 2022

1038
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,040
I discovered the person who "killed" Cao Yueguang

1039
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,160
was Song Huo

1040
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,640
I'm waiting for the right moment to take revenge

1041
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,840
May 6, 2022

1042
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,280
I was knocked out and locked in this storage room again

1043
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,240
This time I know the person who locked me here

1044
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,800
comes here every mealtime

1045
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,200
But I can't let her discover

1046
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,400
that I've been secretly trying passwords

1047
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,520
I'll start trying from 14201

1048
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,200
These are all the passwords I've tried

1049
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,400
May 13, 2022

1050
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,000
I successfully escaped

1051
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,880
I was too impatient

1052
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,080
wanted to finish the surgery quickly to find you

1053
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,480
This time Fang Xiaomei wasn't caught trying passwords

1054
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,640
changing her previous fate of being trapped by the lock

1055
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,000
She escaped earlier

1056
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,400
and reunited with Liu Xialai

1057
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,560
Cao Yueguang

1058
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,480
Finally meeting you again

1059
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,760
I knew you weren't "dead"

1060
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,440
Your brother Hao Baojie and I

1061
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,720
will always be with you

1062
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,960
You know we all love you

1063
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
We won't let you jump to your "death" again

1064
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,200
Let you jump to your "death" again

1065
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,000
I should have changed this tragedy, right?

1066
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,800
I should have changed this tragedy, right?

1067
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,960
They altered our course of action

1068
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
So we wouldn’t

1069
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,080
end up doing these things

1070
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,560
Now we’re still alive and haven’t gone to "die"

1071
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:16,960
Right

1072
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,120
Could it be what was just mentioned—time resetting

1073
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
making her on April 1, 2025

1074
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,800
go back three years

1075
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
to alter the trajectory after

1076
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
April 1, 2022

1077
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,440
So the earlier password

1078
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,840
needs to add three years

1079
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,000
The time is calculated from April 1, 2025

1080
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,600
Yes

1081
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,000
My turn now

1082
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,520
May 20, 2023

1083
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,200
I'm Guo Ba

1084
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,120
Before the timeline reset

1085
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,920
May 20, 2023

1086
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,080
You, Youyou, saw Ju Chenggong

1087
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,040
wearing a jade pendant

1088
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,720
and came to the Ju family to reunite with him

1089
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,160
Before the family reunion ceremony

1090
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,960
you discovered the butler had framed your father

1091
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,600
and decided to "kill" the butler

1092
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,840
to avenge your father

1093
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,560
June 20, 2023

1094
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,080
Living as your grandfather

1095
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,440
I spent a month with you

1096
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,720
Before I could reveal myself to you

1097
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,240
your "murder" of the butler

1098
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,840
was quickly discovered

1099
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,280
To avoid implicating your father

1100
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,880
you chose to jump to your "death"

1101
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
Your original life

1102
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,680
Original life

1103
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,160
Then

1104
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,600
Fear of punishment

1105
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,360
I feared punishment

1106
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,520
In his phone messages

1107
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,360
there was an application

1108
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,480
to the psychological crisis intervention team

1109
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
I experienced

1110
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,680
the grief of my loved one's suicide

1111
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,840
I want to join you

1112
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,520
to prevent more tragedies

1113
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,320
Original life

1114
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,240
Then came April 1st

1115
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,720
Starting today, a fresh beginning

1116
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,200
April 1, 2025

1117
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,360
That was the day fate changed

1118
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,240
From this day onward

1119
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,120
everything starts anew

1120
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,480
I returned to April 1, 2022 again

1121
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,200
This time

1122
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,320
I will protect you properly

1123
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,400
I don't know what butterfly effects

1124
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,360
my actions after the timeline reset

1125
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,800
might cause

1126
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,600
So I can only try to maintain

1127
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,400
what happened before

1128
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,440
including accidentally

1129
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,040
losing my jade pendant

1130
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,480
June 2022

1131
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,280
You suddenly went viral

1132
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,720
And saw the jade pendant of success in advance

1133
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,640
June 17th

1134
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,360
You came to claim kinship early

1135
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,040
In front of everyone

1136
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,800
To witness this sacred moment today

1137
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,760
This is your grandfather

1138
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,280
I decided to act before you

1139
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,600
"Killed" the butler

1140
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,440
So you wouldn't have to bear

1141
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,440
The "murder charge" and "commit suicide" from guilt

1142
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,760
The donuts eaten today

1143
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,120
Were obtained by someone asking fans

1144
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,520
In the fan group

1145
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,960
Check the recommended account

1146
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,840
Account: Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs

1147
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,680
Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs

1148
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,440
My dad - that's my father

1149
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:42,920
Your dad

1150
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,640
He actually

1151
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,920
Wanted to "kill" using donuts

1152
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,520
Right

1153
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,480
But you ultimately took action

1154
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,160
Fortunately the "real killer" wasn't you

1155
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,000
Nor was it me

1156
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,160
I should have changed this tragedy

1157
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,320
June 17, 2022

1158
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,200
Bai Sanwan checks in

1159
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,920
Why aren't you reading May's entry?

1160
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,560
Okay

1161
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,880
Didn't see it, my bad

1162
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,080
My brother seems a bit off

1163
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,120
Only knows how to take things apart

1164
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,920
Okay, May 6, 2022

1165
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,720
I'm Jiajia

1166
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,800
Before the time reset

1167
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,800
May 6, 2022

1168
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,200
My sister Zhenzhen was "killed"

1169
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,360
The "killer" escaped

1170
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
And was never found

1171
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,720
That day

1172
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,680
I saw Bai Sanwan

1173
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,360
also at the crime scene

1174
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,280
I met him after sister's "death"

1175
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,520
Told him the whole truth

1176
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,720
But it was too late

1177
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,920
June 17, 2022

1178
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,240
Bai Sanwan moved to Apartment 11

1179
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,080
Maybe he's missing sister

1180
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,080
August 20, 2022

1181
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,240
Bai Sanwan left a suicide note

1182
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,400
Some people

1183
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,280
Once gone, never return

1184
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,320
Then jumped to his "death"

1185
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,840
He has been deeply in love with sister

1186
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,880
since 2019.

1187
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,200
It was my momentary willfulness

1188
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,080
that caused those who should have loved each other

1189
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,400
to miss their chance.

1190
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,760
In the end, before sister was "killed,"

1191
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,040
the misunderstanding from that confession remained unresolved.

1192
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,640
After sister "died,"

1193
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,600
Bai Sanwan became deeply depressed

1194
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,160
and ultimately chose to "end his life" by jumping off a building.

1195
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,320
He ultimately chose "suicide."

1196
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,840
You died for love,

1197
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,080
I never imagined

1198
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,480
that someone so important to me

1199
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,200
would end your life this way.

1200
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm sorry.

1201
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,760
That was the most

1202
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,640
regrettable decision of my life.

1203
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,680
If not for my selfishness,

1204
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,440
you wouldn't have had

1205
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,440
such a tragic ending.

1206
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,520
All of this was caused by

1207
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,840
my momentary willfulness.

1208
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,960
I will definitely prevent

1209
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,920
this tragedy from happening again.

1210
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,080
Starting today, we begin anew.

1211
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,040
April 1, 2025 -

1212
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,600
the day that changed fate.

1213
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,680
I returned once more to April 1, 2022.

1214
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,600
Nothing had happened yet.

1215
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,640
There was still time to start over.

1216
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,200
Then came May 6, 2022 again.

1217
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,240
I warned my sister she'd be in danger

1218
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,800
Prepared fake "death" pills for her

1219
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,760
Necklace camera

1220
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,440
Blood capsules

1221
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,960
I explained the entire plan to my sister

1222
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,040
Had her wear protective undergarments

1223
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,640
Equipped with pendant-style camera

1224
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,800
To expose the "killer"

1225
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,480
Unfortunately

1226
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,240
The camera was discovered by the "killer"

1227
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:31,720
And taken away

1228
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,160
But thankfully my sister didn't "die"

1229
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,600
Also reconciled with Bai Sanwan

1230
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,240
Made peace with Sanwan too

1231
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,120
I think I've changed this tragedy

1232
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,800
It's Jiajia

1233
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,240
Jiajia

1234
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,840
On May 6th

1235
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,840
I saw him

1236
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,360
I hope he'll be happy

1237
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,720
My turn

1238
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,200
July 2, 2022

1239
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,120
Xiaoxiao Wang used his own "suicide"

1240
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,600
to expose the scam in Chuyang Lane

1241
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,680
which helped me find

1242
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,520
Old Wang who framed me 34 years ago

1243
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,520
I am Old Man Li

1244
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,880
Before the time reset

1245
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,080
July 2, 2022

1246
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,520
Xiaoxiao Wang "committed suicide"

1247
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,480
The next day

1248
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,120
July 3, 2022

1249
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,320
After the fake news about Chuyang Lane was exposed

1250
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,720
Aunt Cai's "corpse" was found in the alley

1251
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,480
She was trapped in Chuyang Lane and couldn't get out

1252
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,880
and "starved to death" inside

1253
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:52,800
So tragic

1254
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,560
"Starved to death"

1255
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,960
August 20, 2022

1256
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,920
I never expected my grandson

1257
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,600
would also live in Apartment 11

1258
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,040
But I only found out after he "committed suicide" over love

1259
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,880
that this had happened

1260
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,600
Old Bai

1261
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,480
September 30, 2022

1262
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,120
My son Zhou Keke

1263
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,760
After learning of Aunt Cai's "death"

1264
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,840
was heartbroken

1265
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,120
Zhou Keke was the one who introduced Aunt Cai

1266
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,320
to Chuyang Lane

1267
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,600
Which means

1268
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,240
he personally pushed Aunt Cai into the abyss

1269
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,040
Guilt

1270
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,880
Old Man Li is so pitiful

1271
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,680
If I could have cleared my name earlier

1272
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,240
maybe I could have prevented all this

1273
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,040
I "caused" Aunt Cai's death

1274
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:32,440
Yes

1275
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,000
I just wanted to make her happy

1276
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,200
That's why I gave her that flyer

1277
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,640
April 1, 2025

1278
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,680
That was the day that changed everything

1279
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,880
Starting today

1280
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,120
I'll start over

1281
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,440
I've returned to April 1, 2022 again

1282
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,760
I must find Xiao Xiao Wang before he "kills himself"

1283
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,320
And convince him to work with me

1284
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,560
I also need to stop Sister Cai

1285
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,960
and Zhou Keke's "death"

1286
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,000
As for San Wan

1287
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,200
Jiajia's actions

1288
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,160
will surely change San Wan's fate

1289
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,840
May 6, 2022

1290
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,760
I discovered Bai Sanwan and Zhou Keke

1291
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,680
moved into the apartment on this day

1292
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,840
Come here

1293
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,840
He hugged me too

1294
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,280
Hug me

1295
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,400
He still only hugs the two of us

1296
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,760
I must clear my name as soon as possible

1297
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,960
So I can openly appear by their side

1298
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,400
After that

1299
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,520
I waited patiently

1300
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,040
In the basement shopping area

1301
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,160
Until Xiao Xiao Wang appeared

1302
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,320
Xiao Xiao Wang

1303
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,080
I convinced him who already wanted to "kill himself"

1304
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,240
To cooperate with me

1305
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,880
July 2, 2022

1306
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,760
Originally, Xiao Xiao Wang and I made a plan

1307
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,160
He would "kill" Old Wang (Xiao Wang)

1308
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,560
Then "commit suicide"

1309
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,760
To recreate

1310
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,160
The 1988 case

1311
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,640
To help clear my name

1312
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,640
And expose the Chuyang Alley scam

1313
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,480
Unexpectedly, Zhou Zengzeng saw

1314
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,200
Our recreation of the original method

1315
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,840
To avenge his family

1316
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,560
He "killed" Xiao Xiao Wang and Old Wang (Xiao Wang)

1317
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,040
The tragedy still unfolded, just in a different way

1318
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,800
I failed him

1319
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,200
July 5, 2022

1320
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,960
My grandson has found his love

1321
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,400
Keke, my son

1322
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,320
The future

1323
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,280
Sister Cai and I will stay by your side

1324
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,960
So you won't feel lonely anymore

1325
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,640
I hope you won't jump off buildings again

1326
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,200
There are still people in this world who love you

1327
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,720
I should have

1328
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,600
Prevented these two tragedies

1329
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,840
Come on, let's go over there

1330
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,520
Look at that

1331
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,760
In the original timeline

1332
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,440
General Manager Zong was "killed" on April 30th

1333
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,240
by being hit by a cat plushie

1334
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,560
I'm Boss Fei

1335
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,160
Before the timeline reset

1336
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,040
On June 23, 2022

1337
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,360
Late that night

1338
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,640
Deputy Manager Fu actually died suddenly

1339
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,320
from overwork during overtime

1340
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,640
On April 30, 2024

1341
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,920
I received news that Ke Wuku

1342
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,480
had "committed suicide" by jumping off a building

1343
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,440
Ku even left a suicide note

1344
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,080
Wrong

1345
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,040
It's my fault

1346
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,040
It's my fault

1347
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,840
I never expected

1348
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,000
to find Ku in this manner

1349
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,640
Why would he "commit suicide" by jumping?

1350
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,520
And even claimed that Zong and Fu

1351
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,640
were "killed" by him

1352
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,120
The "deaths" of Zong and Fu were clearly accidents.

1353
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,440
What were you thinking at the moment you jumped?

1354
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,200
If I had found him earlier,

1355
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,440
would things have turned out differently?

1356
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,760
I promised Brother Ku

1357
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,600
to protect his two younger brothers.

1358
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,040
Starting today,

1359
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,880
we begin anew.

1360
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,240
April 1, 2025.

1361
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,800
That was the day that changed our fate.

1362
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,400
From today onward,

1363
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,800
everything starts over.

1364
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,360
Once again, I returned to

1365
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,240
April 1, 2022.

1366
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,760
Following the clues from my memory

1367
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,080
that I only obtained after Ku's "suicide,"

1368
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,920
I went to search for Ku's traces.

1369
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,040
April 30, 2022.

1370
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,880
General Manager Zong

1371
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,160
still accidentally got "killed" by a giant device.

1372
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,200
He truly "deserved" to die.

1373
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,680
So I didn't step forward

1374
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,000
to warn General Manager Zong.

1375
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,120
On the night of June 23, 2022,

1376
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,400
to prevent Deputy Manager Fu

1377
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,520
from "dying suddenly"

1378
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,200
from overwork during overtime,

1379
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,080
I specifically invited him to a venting session to relax.

1380
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,840
Yet he ended up "dying" again

1381
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,280
at the venting session.

1382
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,040
What surprised me even more was

1383
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,320
the detective team

1384
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,800
actually uncovered the truth

1385
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,360
He was a good person

1386
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,000
But you might not be

1387
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,320
This Old Fu

1388
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,920
didn't die accidentally

1389
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,960
It was actually Ku

1390
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,320
who "killed" both Zong and Fu

1391
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,720
I deeply blame myself

1392
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,280
If I had discovered the truth earlier

1393
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,400
I could have stopped Ku

1394
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,520
from "killing" the first person

1395
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,040
That foolish kid Ku

1396
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,480
"Killing" people

1397
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,400
is never the solution

1398
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,800
June 25, 2022

1399
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,760
More than two months passed

1400
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,880
until I finally found again

1401
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,400
the wandering Ke Wuku

1402
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,680
You've suffered so much these years

1403
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,360
and made some mistakes

1404
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,680
But now you've finally come to me

1405
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,040
I'll take good care of you

1406
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:14,720
Hello everyone

1407
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,120
Who's this?

1408
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:17,920
Ming Wu

1409
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,760
Ke Wuku

1410
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,560
I finally understand why in the previous timeline

1411
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,280
Ku chose to "commit suicide" by jumping

1412
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,120
Before the timeline reset

1413
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,400
he must have wanted to take the blame for Ku

1414
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,040
In the end, I still failed

1415
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,160
to completely prevent this tragedy

1416
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,520
Originally it was actually

1417
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,720
I should take the fall for my younger brother

1418
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,760
I understand now

1419
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,040
It was Ku who "killed" someone

1420
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:01,840
Then Ku

1421
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,080
I pretended to be Ku

1422
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,240
Yes, and let Ku keep living

1423
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,280
Then the older brother jumped off the building for him

1424
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,120
This would end the investigation

1425
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,560
So my younger brother could keep living

1426
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,160
I've always taken the blame for my brother since childhood

1427
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,280
You're really something

1428
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,040
You're quite impressive

1429
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,000
A real "repeat offender"

1430
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,200
First look at that paper

1431
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,440
What was your original fate?

1432
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,600
The original fate was

1433
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,960
Song Pretty and Zhang Doll

1434
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,760
Met online five months ago

1435
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,360
I am Lai Doll

1436
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,520
Before the time reset

1437
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,160
May 7, 2022

1438
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,800
Song Pretty and Zhang Doll

1439
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,440
Started living together today

1440
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,040
June 1, 2022

1441
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,560
Song Pretty and Zhao Miss

1442
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,160
Zhang Singer

1443
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,600
Met at a handicraft store

1444
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,440
Became good friends

1445
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,040
October 30, 2024

1446
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,680
Three months ago Song Pretty

1447
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,600
Was hurt by Zhang Doll and broke up

1448
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,480
Started dating me today

1449
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,200
December 30, 2024

1450
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,760
Song Pretty will "commit suicide" by jumping off a building

1451
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,640
Watched helplessly as she jumped in front of me

1452
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,160
I deeply regret it now

1453
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,040
It was my careless "I don't want to get married" remark

1454
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,240
That hurt her

1455
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,440
If I could do it over

1456
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,600
I would definitely love her sooner

1457
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,360
Starting today, we begin anew

1458
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,440
With this

1459
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,280
I can finally

1460
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,560
I can finally make up for my regrets

1461
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,760
I found five others

1462
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,680
relatives of the "suicide" jumpers

1463
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,760
To "See You Again"

1464
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,160
We named the project

1465
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,000
"Pomelo Meets You"

1466
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,040
"Pomelo Meets You" time

1467
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:18,680
Don’t forget

1468
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,720
Tea and fruit meet at "Pomelo Meets You"

1469
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,200
Real tea, real fruit—"Pomelo Meets You"

1470
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,360
Remember the "Pomelo Meets You" promise

1471
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,120
How many hands?

1472
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:28,480
Six

1473
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,040
Six

1474
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:29,480
Six

1475
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,880
Now I understand.

1476
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,720
Why I have these memories from before.

1477
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,800
For example, I feel like

1478
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,480
I've lived with Zhang the doll before.

1479
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,080
Because that's how I lived previously.

1480
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,040
Starting today, a fresh beginning.

1481
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,640
I've returned to April 1st, 2022 again.

1482
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,840
This time I'll definitely make Song Piaoliang happy.

1483
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,720
Aside from those who "committed suicide" by jumping,

1484
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,680
Apartment 11

1485
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,160
will witness several more "murders."

1486
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,280
If I

1487
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,120
warn these "victims" to be careful,

1488
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,840
maybe I can save more people.

1489
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,400
Those who "died" before,

1490
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,440
the dolls that appeared at the scenes

1491
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,440
were all sent by you.

1492
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,560
Did you send them?

1493
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,760
Don't approach the abandoned power room.

1494
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,120
Don't attend the family reunion banquet.

1495
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,080
Don't go to work.

1496
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,560
Don't go to Chuyang Alley.

1497
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,480
Yes, I sent them.

1498
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,440
May 7th, 2022

1499
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,560
I succeeded.

1500
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,240
I made Piaoliang

1501
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,120
come to me ahead of time.

1502
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,600
July 8th, 2022

1503
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,640
Never thought my assistant would kidnap me,

1504
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,760
and ultimately "die" on stage.

1505
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,800
But Song Piaoliang,

1506
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,080
seems to have been counseled by new friends

1507
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,840
and finally let go of her anxiety and obsessions.

1508
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,760
She should be able to bravely

1509
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,720
continue pursuing happiness.

1510
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,480
Does this count as changing the tragedy?

1511
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,360
Good, really good.

1512
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,480
Really impressive, this guy.

1513
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,040
When photo after photo

1514
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,200
filled the room,

1515
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,360
the story of "Bai Song, Guo Zhou, Liu Ku"

1516
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,520
was finally fully revealed before us.

1517
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,680
No one could have imagined

1518
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,960
this was actually the intertwining of two timelines.

1519
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,080
Turns out we were never alone.

1520
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,240
When we knew nothing,

1521
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,520
someone had already quietly cleared away

1522
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,800
the obstacles ahead.

1523
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,320
This silent protection

1524
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,880
is what secured our ordinary everyday lives.

1525
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,200
Something feels off to me.

1526
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,760
What's wrong?

1527
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,240
It's this.

1528
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,400
The so-called "things that were supposed to happen."

1529
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,240
Right.

1530
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,680
How can we prove it's real?

1531
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,160
That day, Lai (the doll) was in his office,

1532
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:40,680
telling us

1533
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,880
that he could foresee the future.

1534
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,040
Actually,

1535
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,600
"I have the ability to predict the future"—

1536
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,200
it might not necessarily mean

1537
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,200
he truly has that ability.

1538
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:47,640
But because

1539
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,800
he came back from the past,

1540
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,960
or rather, from the future.

1541
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,360
It was Lai the doll who gathered these people

1542
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,200
together

1543
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,320
to try to prevent those "deaths" from happening.

1544
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,600
Because they changed things,

1545
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,080
those events didn't occur.

1546
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:57,480
Right.

1547
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,840
But for us,

1548
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,280
living in the present moment,

1549
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,280
how can we be sure of this?

1550
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:03,720
Exactly.

1551
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,440
But the story—

1552
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,440
does it really end here?

1553
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,600
The truth—

1554
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,360
is this all there is?

1555
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,040
There's a specific point in time—

1556
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,360
April 1, 2025.

1557
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,800
Why reset

1558
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,520
from this day?

1559
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,440
No.

1560
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,040
This is just the beginning.

1561
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,120
In fate,

1562
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,960
there seems to be an invisible hand

1563
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,120
pushing us toward

1564
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,400
a predetermined ending.

1565
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,000
Apartment No. 11 is an ominous place.

1566
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,400
She’s going to jump off the building tomorrow.

1567
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,040
Bamei

1568
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,120
We just made things worse.

1569
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:47,920
Hurry!

1570
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,360
Hurry!

1571
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:48,840
Go to the 9th floor.

1572
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,640
Is that a memorial tablet?

1573
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,520
Don’t come closer!

1574
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,080
What?

1575
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,080
It’s so eerie here.

1576
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,280
The vanished woman.

1577
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,320
Another "dead" person.

1578
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:02,760
There’s another one here.

1579
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,880
Why are there so many people here?

1580
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,240
What are you doing?

1581
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,600
Leave her here with me.

1582
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:08,640
Have you seen Bamei?

1583
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,640
I don’t know any Bamei.

1584
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,040
Who led us here?

1585
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,880
Then there must be another "time traveler."
