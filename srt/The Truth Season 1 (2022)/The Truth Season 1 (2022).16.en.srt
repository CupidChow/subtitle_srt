1
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,680
You don't suspect that I "killed" him, do you?

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,400
I'm innocent.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,960
What good would "killing" him do for me?

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,840
General Manager Zong's "death"

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,160
is indeed connected to me.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,280
I "killed" him.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:25,840
But

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,680
I didn't "kill" Deputy Manager Fu.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,880
The person who appeared in the office at 10 o'clock

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,320
might not have been Deputy Fu.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,400
I feel like everyone

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,800
is hiding something.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,640
Accomplice.

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,760
I think he's covering for his sister.

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,600
Then this Deputy Manager Fu

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
was "killed" by you?

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,080
Deputy Manager

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,480
It definitely wasn't the Deputy Manager

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,080
He didn't have the time

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,240
Our escape room

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,120
But what if he "killed" the night before yesterday?

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,240
"Killed" the night before yesterday

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
"Killed" last night

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,680
What I mean is

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,160
"Killed" last night

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,840
Frozen overnight

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,200
Need to take it easy today

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,280
First of all, this "corpse"

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,040
must have been kept in the fridge, right?

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,000
Kept there—yes, definitely kept there

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,200
But not for too long, right?

32
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,240
If at 10 o'clock

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,920
the person everyone saw wasn't

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,720
the real Deputy Manager Fu

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,960
If it wasn't the real Deputy Manager Fu,

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,800
that means

37
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,560
his "time of death" can be pushed even earlier

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,000
Right, definitely

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,640
It must have been before 10 o'clock

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,200
Right

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,560
Right.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,920
But today it seems everyone

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,520
has good things to say about Deputy Manager Fu.

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,560
Yes.

45
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,280
Deputy Manager Fu actually

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,720
helped me apply for

47
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,200
compensation benefits.

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,440
Found me a new job,

49
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,880
and before that he even gave me

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,760
a Happy Hometown membership card

51
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,520
so I could relax.

52
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Afraid I'd get scolded,

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,080
Oh no, afraid of this -

54
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,280
when General Manager Zong really gets angry,

55
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
he'd dock my pay.

56
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,840
This is strange.

57
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,560
Maybe everyone has their own...

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,800
He's got dirt on everyone.

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,760
Dirt.

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,640
Deputy Manager Fu helped Agent Xu

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,040
once by

62
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,400
arranging for him to be sent to headquarters for recuperation.

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,600
What did Deputy Manager Fu do for Brother Ku?

64
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,760
A big deal - a huge contract.

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,120
Gave Brother Ku a major contract,

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,240
introduced him to a big client.

67
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,800
He was almost fired at that time.

68
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,280
After my brother "died," Deputy Manager Fu

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,840
even helped her apply for survivor benefits.

70
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,320
Deputy Manager Fu assisted Deputy Manager Shen

71
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,440
in seeking justice,

72
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,360
found him a new job,

73
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,440
and helped classify the incident

74
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,080
as an accident.

75
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,160
So what you're saying

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,240
is becoming more plausible.

77
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,360
He held leverage over everyone,

78
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,120
helped them cover things up,

79
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,080
all these matters.

80
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,520
Right.

81
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Actually, everything

82
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,160
forms a circle.

83
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,360
Yes.

84
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,640
Everyone conspired together to

85
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,840
"kill" him.

86
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
Elaborate on that.

87
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,040
The truth is, that person

88
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
didn't die that way,

89
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,840
but everyone spread

90
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,160
a different version of his death,

91
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,840
covering for each other.

92
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,520
What we heard might all be false.

93
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,400
Is that possible?

94
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,160
We always blame the victim,

95
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,200
assuming they must have

96
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,840
"deserved to die."

97
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,160
Why can't it be a genuinely good person

98
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,360
who was harmed by evil people?

99
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,280
The main thing is we still need

100
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,040
to find new evidence.

101
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,800
I feel that

102
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,600
Let's go.

103
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,400
We're leaving.

104
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,560
Deputy Manager Fu

105
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,600
is actually good or bad.

106
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:30,920
We

107
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,480
don't know yet.

108
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,640
Some think he's bad,

109
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,680
others think he's good.

110
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,480
Another issue is

111
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,560
why everyone says

112
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,240
they saw Deputy Manager Fu

113
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,400
in the office at 10.

114
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:39,880
There's something wrong.

115
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,240
And that person

116
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,120
the one who made the call

117
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,360
actually dialed wrong.

118
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,440
They reached the real teacher.

119
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,400
So there are many questions.

120
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,520
I wonder if everyone

121
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,120
is hiding something.

122
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,880
I just saw

123
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,400
when you were at this workstation

124
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,480
in your video

125
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,000
which is this exact spot

126
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,880
look

127
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,840
this door was open

128
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,000
meaning there's also a door here

129
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,880
Rotate the flower pot

130
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,320
It's open

131
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,120
The door is open.

132
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,760
It's open.

133
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,440
There's another new place

134
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,440
There's another spot inside

135
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,840
Right?

136
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,280
Let's go

137
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,040
You go in first

138
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,160
No

139
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,840
Brother Bai

140
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,080
What kind of place is this?

141
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,600
Old Bai locked us in here

142
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,320
Old Bai has locked us in

143
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,920
Brother Bai

144
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:13,920
No

145
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,120
He's doing something

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,520
There's something in the flowerpot

147
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,120
Look

148
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,520
He turned off the light

149
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,720
What is he doing?

150
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,520
He turned off the light

151
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
We can't see him now

152
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
He has wires

153
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,480
Why

154
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,280
How do I open this?

155
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,880
How do I open this door?

156
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,960
Damn it.

157
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,800
It won't open.

158
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,840
You

159
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,520
Let me tell you

160
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,960
What are you trying to do?

161
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,440
No, you're the one with issues

162
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,400
What issues do I have?

163
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,120
No, he doesn't have any issues

164
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,360
He's just deliberately trying to test that thing

165
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,400
He's just deliberately trying to test that thing
(Note: This is identical to #164)

166
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,360
This is

167
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,720
Happy Hometown Workers' Confession Session

168
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,560
What is this thing?

169
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,920
Piano keys

170
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,120
Play "Happy Hometown"

171
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,840
Does it need to be that long?

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,000
The whole song?

173
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,240
Cat paws

174
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,000
Cat paw

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,720
Cat's paws

176
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,000
Where?

177
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,240
More cat paw prints

178
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,960
Here

179
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,440
The meowing one

180
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,160
This is where they keep the cats

181
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,480
So it lives here

182
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,040
And more "blood"

183
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,200
This cabinet is locked.

184
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,520
There's a letter here.

185
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,960
This belongs to the deputy manager

186
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,600
What?

187
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,160
What thing?

188
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,000
What did you find?

189
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,680
This is his work ID.

190
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,560
What kind of ID is this?

191
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,640
What job is this ID for?

192
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,080
It's his property manager ID card.

193
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,720
It has a small label

194
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,560
that says 940420

195
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,400
Then

196
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,640
He has a composition notebook

197
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,960
titled "My Good Father"

198
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,240
I have a good father

199
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,720
My father is very capable

200
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,600
All the family's money is earned by father

201
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,320
Once

202
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,280
Father refused to take sick leave even when ill

203
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,800
He said

204
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,640
If we don't work

205
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,520
our family will have nothing to eat

206
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,080
I don't want to go hungry

207
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,840
His son wrote

208
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,960
"Happy Hometown - Workers' Venting Session"

209
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
He's actually a member

210
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,200
together

211
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,040
Here we can vent, right?

212
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,640
Right

213
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,960
This is the fourth section

214
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,680
specifically designed for

215
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,680
everyone to complain and vent

216
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,160
Yes

217
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,760
So who are the members?

218
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,040
Xu the Agent

219
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Hao the Cleaner

220
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,720
But they do have a sense of romance

221
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,120
They also drink Zhenguoli Red Pomelo Four Seasons Tea

222
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,320
Indeed

223
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,280
You really know how to say the right things

224
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,080
This is

225
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,000
This should be

226
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,400
Deputy Manager Fu's work schedule

227
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
He works every single day

228
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,120
But only took off on June 23

229
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,720
Today is June 24

230
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,600
Last night

231
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,680
There was no mark for last night

232
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,040
Starting

233
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,240
Deputy Manager Fu was off last night

234
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,560
No, Deputy Manager Fu wasn't off last night

235
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,400
He wasn't scheduled to work last night

236
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,960
Then he came to this place

237
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,280
Meaning before he "died" yesterday

238
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,760
He visited this foot massage parlor

239
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,520
He came here for a confession session

240
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,200
But why during the confession session

241
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,480
did he take off his clothes?

242
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,520
Because he took off his clothes

243
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,960
And these things were found in his clothes?

244
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,280
No

245
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,000
Here's a work injury compensation standard

246
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,280
This was opened, right?

247
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,840
Work injury claims process and

248
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,960
had been searched

249
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,840
in that browser

250
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,640
Someone searched for this

251
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,960
Search history, correct?

252
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,560
Currently known conditions

253
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,760
One is the written letter

254
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,840
One is the shift schedule

255
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,480
Shift schedule

256
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,640
And there's also this

257
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
There are also cat paw prints here

258
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,360
Cat paw prints were found on the stairs

259
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,120
This suggests that possibly

260
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,960
This is the actual crime scene

261
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,880
Then he "died" on the stairs

262
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,160
The cat went there to eat

263
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,960
"died" on the stairs

264
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,520
It's more likely he "died" here

265
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,680
Meow Meow has a camera on it.

266
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,560
Do you remember?

267
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,360
Which means it would

268
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:00,960
have recorded

269
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,600
There might be crime scene footage.

270
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,240
Let me ask

271
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,400
He, what are you doing?

272
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,120
I'm here.

273
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,520
What's up?

274
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,480
Do you remember

275
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,000
this?

276
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,680
Last time we saw that camera

277
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,920
on Meow Meow?

278
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,360
Can we see the footage?

279
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,320
I have the phone.

280
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,960
Where are you?

281
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,760
I'll bring it over.

282
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,040
Okay, come on.

283
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,160
Happy Hometown Foot Spa.

284
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,800
That Oreo over there,

285
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,160
isn't there a plate of them?

286
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,960
What's this?

287
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,240
Look,

288
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,360
Oreos are all about chilling without competition.

289
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,560
No matter how competitive the workplace gets,

290
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,000
having fun means no rat race.

291
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,880
Then you two split and eat it, come on.

292
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,440
So we twist it,

293
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,080
lick it,

294
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,000
and dunk it.

295
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,280
Oreo's black and white filling

296
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,120
makes you so happy you forget day and night.

297
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,760
Okay.

298
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,080
Got it.

299
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,200
Xiao He, you came so quickly.

300
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,600
You startled me.

301
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,400
I happened to be nearby.

302
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,120
Here.

303
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,040
Take it easy.

304
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,080
The video is on my phone.

305
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,560
Take a look.

306
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,760
See if there's any information you need.

307
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,080
Right.

308
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,880
And I upgraded Miao Miao

309
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,920
with that video upgrade.

310
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,080
It can record sound now too.

311
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,520
Isn't this...

312
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,960
Here, watch the video.

313
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,720
It's fine, I'm listening.

314
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,560
What's wrong?

315
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,000
Wait a minute.

316
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,760
Isn't this Ku here?

317
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,320
Let me analyze...

318
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,680
Where's Ku?

319
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,480
Ku is here too.

320
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,720
Ku left.

321
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,880
Ku is gone.

322
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,360
What happened?

323
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,880
Kids...

324
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,000
Stop investigating further.

325
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,360
I saw him.

326
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,520
What do you mean?

327
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,680
I saw him right here.

328
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,560
What was he doing?

329
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,400
He's gone.

330
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,080
Let's watch that video.

331
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,120
Right, let's finish watching the video.

332
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,760
Let me see.

333
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,160
Ku, you go open the door.

334
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,160
Who's all there?

335
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,000
Pause it for a second.

336
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,440
Hao the cleaner.

337
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,560
Boss Fei.

338
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,240
Deputy Manager Shen.

339
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,600
And Xu the agent.

340
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,400
Plus Ku.

341
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:04,880
They're all here.

342
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,560
We must conceal

343
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,800
the truth about his "death."

344
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,120
Everyone hurry to Ku's place.

345
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,960
To discuss how to handle this.

346
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,520
Ku.

347
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,000
Put the key under the doormat.

348
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,480
Alright.

349
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,640
Just say

350
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,320
just say we're going to Ku's place.

351
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,280
Going to Ku's place.

352
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,120
To discuss how to handle this.

353
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,040
They're coming

354
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:28,840
They're here

355
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,600
It's over

356
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,560
What's wrong?

357
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,600
They found it

358
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,200
They've discovered it

359
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,920
They're at the confession meeting place

360
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,560
Then they saw a cat

361
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,360
This cat has

362
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,520
a permanent camera attached

363
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,160
It recorded

364
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,760
how we

365
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,920
dragged out his "corpse"

366
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,960
Now they're at the confession meeting

367
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,120
watching this footage

368
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
I've locked them all inside

369
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,000
Now all five of them are at the confession meeting

370
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,480
He said

371
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,240
the "death" truth or something

372
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,880
I understand now

373
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,200
Because

374
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,320
he might have "died" accidentally

375
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,400
or however he "died"

376
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,280
But actually

377
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,680
his family was under financial pressure

378
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,560
So these people

379
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,600
collaborated to fake

380
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,880
that he died from

381
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
an elevator accident at work

382
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,240
to claim work injury compensation

383
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,680
Right

384
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,480
Just to get some money for their family

385
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,240
Right, get some money

386
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,200
So they put him in the elevator

387
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,880
Then made it fall

388
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,800
To create this kind of—

389
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,120
Make it look like a workplace "accident"

390
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
So he fell on his own?

391
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,960
But we don’t know

392
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,600
how he actually "died"

393
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,160
Their relationship wasn’t that great either

394
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,640
Right

395
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,400
Their relationship wasn’t particularly good

396
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,160
They probably just thought

397
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,880
Maybe they were just venting here

398
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,240
Pitiful

399
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,720
Not easy

400
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,640
Really not easy

401
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,120
There’s that aspect to it

402
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,520
Probably

403
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,840
We still have a second floor

404
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,040
Let’s go upstairs and take a look

405
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,560
Just a quick look

406
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,400
Ku tricked us again.

407
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,040
What does this mean?

408
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,800
What is this paper for?

409
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,520
Bizarre work experiences

410
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,360
There's a lie detector

411
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,760
What is this thing?

412
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,200
Special dressing for cold dishes

413
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,720
Bitter melon

414
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,320
It's specifically for cold bitter melon salad

415
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,680
Yes, it's for cold bitter melon salad

416
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,240
But the question is

417
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,200
What's the point of this?

418
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,760
This thing

419
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,120
These are all medicines

420
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,840
What does this say?

421
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,640
8 PM, June 23rd

422
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,280
All medicines in first aid kit have been updated

423
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,080
There's a bitter capsule here

424
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,360
Right

425
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,000
It says

426
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,880
If taken with bitter melon

427
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,920
It can cause "sudden death"

428
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,120
And here we have this bitter melon

429
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,200
I get it now

430
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,280
So that means

431
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,360
Someone was trying to harm him, right?

432
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,240
Yes

433
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,000
Because they

434
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
probably replaced this special dressing powder

435
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,520
with that thing inside

436
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,040
The capsule

437
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,560
Replaced it with this capsule

438
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,400
Making him consume them together

439
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,920
The bitter capsule and bitter melon

440
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,600
To make him "die"

441
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,560
Eating them causes "sudden death"

442
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,240
Indeed

443
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,720
Special dressing for cold dishes

444
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
So that would mean

445
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,760
These four people "murdered" him together

446
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,120
Not all of them

447
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,680
It must be one particular person

448
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,400
Let's review the video again

449
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,080
They're trying to cover up the truth

450
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,960
Then deliberately let Ku

451
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,000
put the key under the doormat

452
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,040
Come

453
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,760
Go

454
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,440
We must conceal

455
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,720
the truth about his "death"

456
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,080
Everyone hurry to Ku's place

457
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,920
to discuss how to handle this

458
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:29,680
So

459
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,480
They're all in Ku's room now

460
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,720
Is there a password inside that?

461
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,680
That song "Happy Homeland"

462
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,040
The one with the keyboard

463
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Let's see what this is

464
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,440
Piano keys

465
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,800
First let's figure out how to get out

466
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,280
Someone try playing "Happy Homeland"

467
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,480
How does the first line of "Happy Homeland" go?

468
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,880
"Come with me"

469
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,720
"We'll leave at dawn"

470
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,160
Right

471
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,760
You're not going to play from the beginning again, are you?

472
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,240
No

473
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,880
I don't think it needs to be that complicated

474
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,440
Let's go

475
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,880
Let's go to the cool room

476
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,440
Big bro

477
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:27,920
The first one to run

478
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,680
He's very suspicious

479
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,160
How is big bro running so fast?

480
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,360
He's actually an "accomplice" too

481
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,520
Right, if you talk too much it'll be suspicious.

482
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,880
Then I'll do more of the talking.

483
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,080
This way, I'll protect you.

484
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,480
Okay.

485
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,640
We'll protect you.

486
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,800
Then who will protect me?

487
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,200
It wouldn't be right for me to protect you.

488
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,840
No.

489
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,440
How could I...

490
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,200
What's going on?

491
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,240
Why didn't you knock?

492
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
What's happening?

493
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,480
Why are you running?

494
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,760
What are you running for?

495
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,520
What's the situation?

496
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,000
What's wrong with you?

497
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,359
How could you resort to violence?

498
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,720
The parents are still here.

499
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,240
Fine.

500
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,480
Come on, speak up.

501
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,960
What's wrong with you all?

502
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,960
Where's Ku's room?

503
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,720
I recognize it.

504
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,280
Let's go.

505
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,359
On the fourth floor.

506
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,440
406.

507
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,200
Yes, this one.

508
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,119
Then the problem is...

509
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,280
They've already gone in.

510
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,600
Why is the big brother inside too?

511
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,120
I'm afraid we...

512
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,360
It's over

513
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,600
You're surrounded

514
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,840
How did you run so fast?

515
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,760
I just walked here

516
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,720
I didn't even run

517
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,440
We've been spotted

518
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,120
You people

519
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,160
Quite confident

520
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,080
Here

521
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,000
Come on, get on the kang (heated bed)

522
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,560
What's going on?

523
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Explain yourself

524
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,200
Come on

525
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,040
Why are these people

526
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,520
sitting here so calmly?

527
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,440
We all saw it

528
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,560
You were carrying people out

529
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,920
Dragging them out

530
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,200
You guys

531
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,280
Here's the thing

532
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,080
Actually, how did this start?

533
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,240
It was Boss Fei

534
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,840
Boss Fei thought

535
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,720
we work very hard normally

536
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,080
And yesterday we happened to be off

537
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,280
So he gathered us at the foot massage place

538
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,360
He wanted to play

539
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,000
that roast game

540
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,920
to help us relax

541
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,680
First let me ask everyone

542
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,720
Have you ever encountered

543
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,040
this kind of

544
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,920
most bizarre experience at work?

545
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,040
Good game

546
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,760
Old Fu was having a great time too

547
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,520
We had a punishment

548
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,440
Whoever lost had to eat bitter melon

549
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,880
No one noticed

550
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,560
he fell down the stairs

551
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
When we went over to check

552
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,360
he was already lifeless

553
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,200
Lifeless

554
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,360
Who prepared that bitter melon?

555
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,600
Our shop prepared it

556
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,280
Yes, the shop prepared it

557
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,560
Your shop prepared it

558
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,440
What's wrong with you all

559
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,360
Why are you hiding the truth

560
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,640
Look at this, just say it.

561
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,680
It's Old Fu.

562
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,600
This guy is really pitiful.

563
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,000
365 days a year,

564
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,440
he works 364 days,

565
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,560
only resting for one day.

566
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,680
And he "died" on his day off.

567
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,560
Don't you think he's pitiful?

568
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,080
He "died" so unexpectedly like this.

569
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,400
And the company must have rules stating

570
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,960
if you don't "die" on a workday,

571
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,120
they won't compensate.

572
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,960
No compensation.

573
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,280
So we wanted him to "die" the next day.

574
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,040
And think about Old Fu's family -

575
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,680
the whole family,

576
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,040
his children.

577
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,520
How will they survive?

578
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,800
So we were actually trying to be kind,

579
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,600
wanting his family

580
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,120
to get reasonable compensation.

581
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,480
And we're certain

582
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,080
his "death"

583
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,200
must be related to the company's

584
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,840
overworking and

585
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,680
no rest policy.

586
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,120
Right.

587
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,080
Otherwise he wouldn't have "died" from a fall.

588
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,720
When he "fell to his death",

589
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
where was his most severe injury?

590
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,640
He hit his head.

591
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,400
Hit his head, right?

592
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,800
Yes.

593
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
So you believe the fatal injury was to the head?

594
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,280
Correct.

595
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,120
He just hit his head.

596
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,560
Then you put him in the freezer?

597
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,040
Is that right?

598
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,880
That's correct.

599
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
First, I'll confess.

600
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,840
At 8 AM,

601
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,440
I was responsible for taking out Old Fu's clothes

602
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,880
and then going to the freezer

603
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,360
to change him into his work uniform.

604
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,760
What's with the "bloodstains" on the clothes?

605
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,920
When I changed clothes,

606
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,680
I accidentally

607
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,360
got some

608
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,760
on them.

609
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,320
Got some on them.

610
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
At 10 o'clock,

611
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,440
I pretended to be Lao Fu

612
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,760
and called a teacher

613
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
to discuss the child's matters.

614
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,760
At 12:20,

615
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,240
I was responsible for moving Lao Fu

616
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,640
into the elevator.

617
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,880
Then my job was done.

618
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,520
Then at 12:25,

619
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,320
I'll go cut the elevator's support cables.

620
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,440
You're really ruthless.

621
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,720
What if there's someone else in the elevator?

622
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,640
There won't be.

623
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:52,960
There won't be.

624
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,040
We'll make absolutely sure.

625
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,840
We've confirmed it.

626
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,120
Then I'll send the text at 12:30,

627
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,080
and you'll take us to the escape room.

628
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,400
Right on time.

629
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,720
At exactly 12:30.

630
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,840
Before the alarm goes off.

631
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,400
I have no choice.

632
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,120
I can't take you to that place.

633
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,240
So when we questioned you

634
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,920
you lied to us again

635
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,040
Look, man

636
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,600
What you know

637
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,040
you've already told us everything

638
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,600
you've already told us everything

639
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,200
What we saw ourselves

640
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,640
is absolutely everything

641
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,560
Old Fu was a good man

642
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,160
But you might not be good people

643
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,360
Let me tell you this

644
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,120
This Old Fu

645
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,240
didn't die by accident

646
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,920
That's right

647
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,680
That chilled bitter melon dish

648
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
was poisoned

649
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,320
Is that really what happened?

650
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,680
Yes

651
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,920
Because in that bitter melon dish

652
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,680
they put that powder

653
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,560
The seasoning was replaced

654
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,320
The cold dressing was swapped

655
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,120
After eating it, he might

656
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,640
take a few steps

657
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,760
then suddenly start

658
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,520
to faint

659
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,040
lose consciousness from suffocation

660
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,440
Someone deliberately tried to kill him

661
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Honestly, we really don't know

662
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,760
Among these five people

663
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,520
there must be a murderer

664
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,680
Right

665
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,360
Right, there's one more thing.

666
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,040
I just found something in his pocket.

667
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,320
A small metal piece.

668
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,160
Metal piece.

669
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,800
Do you recognize this?

670
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,040
940420.

671
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,800
It's from a life detector device.

672
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,880
Usually given to VIPs.

673
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,680
This should be the serial number.

674
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,480
Alright.

675
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,240
First we need to determine.

676
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,400
the actual "cause of death".

677
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,280
We need to understand.

678
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,920
the real situation clearly.

679
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,160
Then we can analyze it properly.

680
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,360
If you want to find the "killer".

681
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,240
We also think.

682
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,000
Okay.

683
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,240
Let's investigate.

684
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,640
And uncover the truth for Lao Fu.

685
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,200
Right.

686
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,680
Let's return to the crime scene.

687
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,240
Yes.

688
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,840
We're going back to the crime scene.

689
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,200
Can I come with you again?

690
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,840
Stop running around all the time.

691
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,000
You're being too jumpy.

692
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,160
No.

693
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,800
I'm really sorry.

694
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,960
For locking you in earlier.

695
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,880
Whose bag is this?

696
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,800
My bag.

697
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,760
Did I forget my bag?

698
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,440
My bag.

699
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,000
You forgot your bag.

700
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,840
Bag.

701
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,640
Nothing

702
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,880
Let's go

703
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,400
Bye

704
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,040
What's in the bag?

705
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,480
Bye

706
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,000
There's nothing

707
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,480
Let's go, sis

708
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,240
What's inside?

709
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,760
There's a key

710
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,040
The cabinet we didn't open

711
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,840
Open that cabinet

712
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,320
Right

713
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,240
Take a look

714
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,560
You're quite quick with your hands

715
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,480
I was thinking

716
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:27,880
Anyway I think

717
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,560
This matter isn't that simple now

718
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,880
It might be fabricated

719
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,160
He faked creating an accident

720
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,400
Then gained these people's sympathy

721
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Then got everyone to help him together

722
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,120
To cover up this "murder" truth

723
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,840
So I think this

724
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,920
Definitely isn't that simple

725
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,440
We still need to look behind

726
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,240
Who finally administered the "poison"

727
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,440
Let's return to the crime scene

728
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,120
Let's investigate the real cause

729
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,160
Why are you keeping things from us?

730
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,360
You really don't treat us as your own people

731
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,520
It's not that

732
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,280
Who could stand this?

733
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,600
I really have no choice

734
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,440
Let's go take a look

735
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,520
The real "cause of death" of Deputy Manager Fu

736
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,920
There should be some kind of recording

737
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,920
This is the one, right?

738
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,200
Alright

739
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,960
Let's open it

740
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,360
Come on

741
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,640
Testing device

742
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,040
Happy Home Leisure Zone remote control

743
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,240
Dedicated computer for testing device

744
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,320
Let's take all these out first

745
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,720
Here's a mouse

746
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,120
Bring the mouse over

747
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,480
Is there anything inside?

748
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,040
He needs to enter the code here

749
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,280
Enter what?

750
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,040
Here's the deputy manager's tag

751
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,520
Write 940420

752
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,400
Small metal plate

753
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,040
Do you recognize it?

754
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,360
940420

755
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,640
It's actually a life detector

756
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,600
Usually given to VIPs

757
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,400
This should be the serial number

758
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,320
Explanation of "Death" at 23:00

759
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,400
"The deceased" refers to "sudden death"

760
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,200
Just ate some bitter melon

761
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,320
Yes, ate bitter melon

762
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,360
Yes, "sudden death" from eating bitter melon

763
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,080
When we went to check

764
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,400
He was already not breathing

765
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,800
I pretended to be Old Fu

766
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,560
Made a phone call

767
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,440
I went and cut the elevator's support cables

768
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,520
I sent the text message at 12:30

769
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,760
That was really me

770
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,960
How could a normal person

771
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,600
Fall from upstairs

772
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,400
Just took one day off

773
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,240
And "died" from resting

774
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,800
There's a switch

775
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,440
I pressed it and it turned on

776
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,080
I'm pressing it now

777
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,800
On

778
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,120
What turned on?

779
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,320
Is the TV on?

780
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,080
Is someone turning on the TV?

781
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,240
Yes, the TV is on.

782
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,480
Game rules introduction

783
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,960
This game involves six players.

784
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,760
Players must anonymously write down

785
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,560
and submit one bizarre experience

786
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,680
from their workplace.

787
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,280
Lie detector

788
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,320
After confirming the content is true,

789
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,440
players must take turns

790
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,480
to post their notes in the frame.

791
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,200
After all submissions,

792
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,440
the machine will record the order

793
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,880
and the six bizarre experiences

794
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,000
into the system.

795
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,600
Then reshuffle them.

796
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,000
Players must guess

797
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,800
the owners of the other five

798
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,760
bizarre experiences.

799
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,480
The player most frequently guessed

800
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
loses the game.

801
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,560
They must face punishment:

802
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,920
eating cold bitter melon salad.

803
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,760
So,

804
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,040
this person lost,

805
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,960
and someone tampered with

806
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,320
Return to homepage

807
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,480
the bitter melon.

808
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,320
Return to homepage

809
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,800
Return to homepage

810
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,840
Latest game results

811
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,480
Let's check.

812
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,800
10:30 PM, June 23rd

813
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,840
Started at 10:30

814
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:05,880
Right.

815
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,200
Participants: Deputy Manager Shen,

816
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,760
Hao the cleaner,

817
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,560
Ke Wuku,

818
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,920
You played too.

819
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,520
Boss Fei

820
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,440
Agent Xu

821
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,520
Deputy Manager Fu

822
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,160
Then Deputy Manager Fu lost

823
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,320
He received five votes

824
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,880
Right

825
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,240
What was the bizarre story he told?

826
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,160
What was his bizarre experience?

827
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,520
He didn't know either

828
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,280
He must know

829
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,840
Do you know?

830
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:25,840
I know

831
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
He was present

832
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,280
What was his bizarre experience?

833
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,040
He worked continuously for 48 hours

834
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Just vote for him

835
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,240
Let me explain to you

836
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,840
The way we play this game is

837
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,320
Who

838
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,840
Basically

839
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,560
Not entering six experiences

840
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,640
Then everyone sitting below guesses together

841
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,240
After voting, the loser eats bitter melon

842
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
And at that time he

843
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,440
There were six people playing the game

844
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,400
Five all voted for him

845
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,320
Leaving only him

846
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,560
Then he went up and ate it

847
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,600
Then fell down and "died"

848
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Then how was he certain

849
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,080
That he would be the one to eat it?

850
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,000
Because everyone voted for him

851
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,360
Because everyone voted for him

852
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,880
Everyone was playing this game

853
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,440
How did they know

854
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,080
This round would definitely be him eating first?

855
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,480
What I mean is

856
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,000
before he did this

857
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,320
even the "killer" didn't know

858
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,200
he would write something

859
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,800
that the other five people

860
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,880
could all guess, right?

861
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Or perhaps

862
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,400
if I were the "killer"

863
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,880
and wanted to "kill" Lao Fu now

864
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,760
how could I control

865
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,920
what he's going to write?

866
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:26,920
Exactly

867
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,560
How could he be so precise

868
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,880
to guarantee "killing" him?

869
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,520
What others wrote

870
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,840
What did others write?

871
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,600
Where's the answer?

872
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,800
What does this mean?

873
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,120
The answer is in the box

874
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,720
That place

875
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,080
Tear that paper out

876
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,600
Tear it out

877
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,800
Let's see what others wrote

878
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,640
Check the print records

879
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,760
This voting slot

880
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,040
The longest duration reached

881
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,280
Forty-eight hours

882
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,800
He's in first place

883
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,440
He's indeed the top candidate

884
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,560
This is obviously Lao Fu

885
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,280
Why?

886
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,040
Workaholic

887
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,240
It matches everyone's

888
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,000
Those conditions

889
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,680
Family member seriously ill

890
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,160
Boss won't approve half-day leave

891
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
No half-day leave approved

892
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,000
That's your sister

893
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,520
Then exploited to "death"

894
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,360
That corresponds to Ke

895
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,080
Restroom breaks during work hours

896
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,880
Frequency and duration are restricted

897
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,440
This is hard to guess

898
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,280
Always having to do boss's personal errands

899
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,560
Isn't that Xu?

900
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,200
Xu

901
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,080
The one who picks up kids

902
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,840
Right

903
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,320
Then never turning off phone for 24 hours

904
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,560
Must reply to boss instantly

905
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,080
Hao the cleaner

906
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,440
Hao the cleaner said this

907
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,000
Then which one is you?

908
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,640
The family member one is you, right?

909
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,160
Yes

910
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,840
Let's discuss this later

911
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,960
The question is how it's so accurate

912
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,640
This is

913
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,840
Working hours

914
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,600
Toilet break frequency

915
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,160
are all restricted

916
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,320
Several people mentioned this

917
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,520
Must instantly reply to group messages 24/7

918
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,880
Working continuously for 48 hours

919
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,080
But many people have experienced

920
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,640
this 48-hour situation

921
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,440
Let's simulate it

922
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,560
For example, let's say I'm the "killer" now

923
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,440
I just want to make you "die"

924
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,000
I'll write mine last

925
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,040
Then let's play one round

926
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,680
Then we can guess

927
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,000
how they played it back then

928
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,280
Okay

929
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,320
Come on, let's begin

930
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,840
Let's go

931
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
System scan is ready

932
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,280
All players please

933
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,200
Go upstairs in order

934
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,640
Submit your bizarre experiences

935
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,480
Before submitting

936
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,360
Please wear the lie detector bracelet

937
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,760
After the bracelet verifies authenticity

938
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,200
Please post your experiences in the frame in order

939
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,360
Must be posted within the frame

940
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,520
Alright

941
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,520
Also need to write one

942
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,320
that's not easy for others to guess

943
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,600
It's somewhat like "Undercover" game

944
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,080
Kind of

945
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,520
Right

946
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,080
You need to write one

947
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,560
that others wouldn't easily think of

948
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,520
Also needs to be vague

949
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,160
What kind should we write?

950
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,960
What bizarre experience?

951
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,800
Not sure

952
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,920
And it has to be truly bizarre

953
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,360
You're wearing the bracelet, right Lao Bai?

954
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,280
I'm wearing it

955
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,840
Are you lying?

956
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
I'm wearing the lie detector

957
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,080
But you said

958
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,320
If the second person going up

959
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
I'll take his...

960
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,640
Or the last person going up

961
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,480
I'll check them all

962
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,720
Then post it as the first one?

963
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,400
Come on

964
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,800
Next step

965
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,720
Next

966
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,080
Okay

967
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,280
All six players have submitted

968
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,560
Please take your seats on the first floor

969
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,400
When ready

970
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,960
Click the "Start Game" button with your mouse

971
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,040
The system will reshuffle the stories

972
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,240
The system has rearranged the six bizarre experiences

973
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,520
in a new order

974
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,920
Please write your answers

975
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,720
on your individual voting sheets

976
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,680
Now we will read out

977
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,320
the first bizarre experience

978
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,520
My close friend who co-hosted variety shows with me actually said

979
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,200
All these years

980
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,840
I've never had any bizarre experiences

981
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,720
How absurd!

982
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,440
Alright, it's done.

983
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,360
The next story is

984
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,640
leaving the contract at the convenience store

985
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,480
This seems like something Xiao Song would do

986
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,440
That's right

987
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,640
I think the person who said this

988
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,320
is from southern China

989
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,760
Because in our northeast region

990
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,000
we call it "small shop"

991
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,120
or supermarket

992
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,200
we don't call them convenience stores

993
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,560
We people of the 21st century

994
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,400
we all are

995
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,760
Kuku could also be possible

996
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,840
The next story is

997
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,920
While working one time

998
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,000
accidentally swallowed a mosquito

999
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,840
This must be an actor

1000
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,200
This is definitely someone filming

1001
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:04,960
Not necessarily

1002
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,920
I tell you it's a singer

1003
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,520
Yes, singers perform

1004
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
always opening their mouths

1005
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:09,920
When they sing

1006
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,680
"Ah~"

1007
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,040
Whoever likes to hold long notes is the one

1008
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,600
I'm telling you

1009
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,120
This must be Zhou Keke

1010
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,360
Right

1011
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,920
There wouldn't be mosquitoes on stage, right?

1012
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,480
Stop pretending

1013
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,120
How could there not be?

1014
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,080
I'm telling you, it's Zhou Keke

1015
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,000
Look at Zhou Keke

1016
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,200
Your old man

1017
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,920
You should go eat bitter melon

1018
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,360
The next story is

1019
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,720
Haven't slept for too long

1020
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,560
and fell asleep in front of everyone while working

1021
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,640
fell asleep

1022
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,120
in full public view

1023
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,680
The next story is

1024
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,600
For a whole week

1025
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,440
worked eighteen hours daily

1026
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,480
Isn't this

1027
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,680
Isn't this Lao Bai?

1028
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,280
When I was filming before

1029
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,000
there was one week straight

1030
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,360
filming eighteen hours daily

1031
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,600
Eighteen hours every day

1032
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,920
Someone wrote about my experience

1033
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,960
That's really interesting

1034
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,440
Someone stole your

1035
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,680
This is absolutely insane

1036
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,400
Is human nature really this dark?

1037
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,719
When I said this

1038
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,560
all of you were present

1039
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,000
So the question is

1040
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,800
In that case, his polygraph

1041
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,120
I think

1042
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,679
there's only one person who could harm Lao Bai

1043
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,480
and that is

1044
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,360
me again

1045
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,480
I wrote all these

1046
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,840
You all went up to have fun

1047
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,960
I pasted six sheets alone

1048
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,800
The next story is

1049
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,560
getting foot massages while recording the show

1050
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,280
something that just happened today

1051
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,239
This is wicked

1052
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,120
This happened to everyone today

1053
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,719
Write Liu Xialai for this

1054
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,800
I also agree to write Liu Xialai

1055
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,960
This should be cool

1056
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,360
Let me tell you

1057
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,920
He's pretending here

1058
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,000
No

1059
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,520
This isn't me

1060
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,320
This really isn't me

1061
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,440
One foot massage

1062
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,240
And that eighteen

1063
00:34:59,240 --> 00:34:59,760
Pretty impressive

1064
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,360
Of course we can't rule out

1065
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,840
Lao Bai reading his own name

1066
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
Nor can we exclude

1067
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,200
Right?

1068
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,960
Lao Bai outsmarted us again

1069
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,400
It's him

1070
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,160
It's definitely him

1071
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,280
Human nature

1072
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,520
Time to change hearts

1073
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,640
Vote after writing

1074
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,400
I'll go first

1075
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,720
Let's move to the next step.

1076
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,520
Next step.

1077
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,520
The system has processed six votes.

1078
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,840
Now announcing the results.

1079
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,360
The loser is

1080
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,880
Bai Sanwan

1081
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,120
received four votes

1082
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,840
Wait a minute

1083
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,800
In other words

1084
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,560
There was one question where several of us voted for you

1085
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,080
Even if that wasn't written by you

1086
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
You would still "die"

1087
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,240
Right

1088
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,240
No

1089
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,640
You have to vote correctly for that to happen

1090
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,440
You have to vote correctly to "die"

1091
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,680
It's definitely not about blindly "dying" based on who gets the most votes

1092
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,280
Yes

1093
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,880
Who was it that voted number eighteen for Bai Sanwan?

1094
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,400
Anyone?

1095
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,200
Four votes

1096
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,880
Exactly four votes

1097
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:17,960
No

1098
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,920
Who wrote "eighteen"?

1099
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,320
Who wrote about not sleeping for eighteen hours

1100
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,800
Well

1101
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,880
We're telling the truth

1102
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,520
Today

1103
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,560
So it was him

1104
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,120
You're the one who wrote it

1105
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,760
Yes, I wrote it

1106
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,400
So we should vote correctly

1107
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,200
So we still need true stories

1108
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,360
Therefore

1109
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,880
He still brought this matter up

1110
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,400
To everyone

1111
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,880
Everyone has heard about this

1112
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,120
Or after knowing about this

1113
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,640
No

1114
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,040
But there's one problem

1115
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,560
I wrote about foot massage

1116
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,400
This matter

1117
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,320
We've all done it

1118
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,920
We've all had the same experience

1119
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,640
And it's also true

1120
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,120
But you wouldn't guess it was me

1121
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,240
Then his forty-eight hours

1122
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,720
Many people have had this experience

1123
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,920
Why was he voted out

1124
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,840
Could we have missed any crucial clues?

1125
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,360
We haven't found any.

1126
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,080
But forty-eight hours

1127
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,800
Hasn't everyone experienced that?

1128
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,360
Right

1129
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,560
Actually, everyone's mentality

1130
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,120
is hoping not to be chosen by others

1131
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,720
But what I wrote

1132
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,160
was meant to be guessed

1133
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,000
What do you mean?

1134
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,880
"Determined to seek 'death'"

1135
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,720
There's a reason

1136
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,040
for why

1137
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,880
everyone would think

1138
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,080
the person who wrote for 48 hours

1139
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,000
must be Deputy Manager Fu

1140
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,760
Do you want to

1141
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,040
to read the stories one by one

1142
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,800
and see if we can match them

1143
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,160
There's another clue

1144
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,880
It seems the small note

1145
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,200
already has something written on it

1146
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,000
Someone left a note here

1147
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,800
Let's write down what we know first.

1148
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,600
Let's start by noting what we're certain about.

1149
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:16,840
This...

1150
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,880
Old Fu.

1151
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,680
Right?

1152
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,760
Handles the boss's personal matters.

1153
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,360
This is Brother Xu.

1154
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,400
Both have...

1155
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,480
This is me.

1156
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,040
Must reply to boss's messages instantly.

1157
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,600
This should only apply to Fu.

1158
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,640
Or perhaps...

1159
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,920
Shen also has 24-hour...

1160
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,600
Fu and Shen...

1161
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,320
Because only these two...

1162
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,480
Directly report to the boss.

1163
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,720
So this one is Fu.

1164
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,080
Shen.

1165
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,680
Who else?

1166
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:50,800
Anyone else?

1167
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,560
I only have Shen here.

1168
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,320
Are all our sticky notes complete?

1169
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,840
We're missing some.

1170
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,560
We tore off all that were there at the time.

1171
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:03,880
But...

1172
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,080
We might have forgotten to take a few.

1173
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,760
Did some fall off?

1174
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,120
Here's another one

1175
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,240
Leave that one at the front desk

1176
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,840
Here you go

1177
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,400
Whose is this?

1178
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:16,880
Paid for

1179
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,600
Promise you an apartment

1180
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,360
Xu Agency

1181
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,200
So in the end,

1182
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,560
Actually, everyone has these experiences

1183
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,200
Really?

1184
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,960
A single sticky note holds so many stories

1185
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,760
Yes, within one sticky note

1186
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,600
there are countless stories

1187
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,040
Let's go

1188
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,680
Minimum overtime: 48 hours

1189
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,560
There's Fei

1190
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:32,880
Fei

1191
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,160
Weekends spent doing boss's personal errands

1192
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,920
There she is

1193
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,440
Family critically ill - leave denied

1194
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,480
Good people get their rewards

1195
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,560
Being told to be available

1196
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,480
24/7 for group messages

1197
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,360
Family member sick

1198
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,680
Company won't approve leave

1199
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,120
Is it worth staying?

1200
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,480
Half a lifetime earned two things:

1201
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:44,880
One is

1202
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,920
The exhaustion after 48-hour overtime

1203
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,400
The sleep deprivation

1204
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,080
The other is timed bathroom breaks

1205
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,680
How to politely refuse

1206
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,240
boss's personal assignments

1207
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,000
Ke Wuku

1208
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,760
Dog walking, kid pickup, food delivery

1209
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,920
Work is so exhausting

1210
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,040
Survived one full day

1211
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,800
Another full day awaits

1212
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,320
Fu's

1213
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
Waited for Friday

1214
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,040
Only to receive

1215
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,960
a rejected leave request for family emergency

1216
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,440
The greatest pain of a "corporate slave"

1217
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:03,920
is nothing compared to

1218
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,000
just pulling 48-hour shifts

1219
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,320
Xu

1220
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,720
Fu

1221
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,960
I've picked up boss's daughter so often

1222
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,400
the kindergarten teachers mistakenly think

1223
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,040
I'm her real father

1224
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,640
Shen hasn't slept for two days straight

1225
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,280
With strictly timed bathroom breaks

1226
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,160
Little sister, you're sick

1227
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,400
but I can't take leave because of work

1228
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,280
Must be those timed bathroom breaks again

1229
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,640
Fu

1230
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,960
Among the six conditions,

1231
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,320
five have "Fu" marked,

1232
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,200
this one has "Fu",

1233
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
Two,

1234
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,880
Three,

1235
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,400
Four,

1236
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,960
Five,

1237
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,720
Then why

1238
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,280
does everyone think

1239
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,760
that 48 hours must definitely be "Fu"?

1240
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,160
Because everyone wrote "Fu".

1241
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,120
What resources haven't we utilized yet?

1242
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,320
Like this.

1243
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,600
Let's first check Deputy Manager Fu's phone.

1244
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,640
See what's inside.

1245
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,080
What's this?

1246
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,240
Temporary call logs.

1247
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,680
Is there anything else?

1248
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,520
Take another look at the rest.

1249
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,400
Can stay awake for 48 hours without getting tired

1250
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,560
His computer screen shows that too

1251
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,440
So he basically exposed himself

1252
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,680
Everyone knows he can stay awake for 48 hours

1253
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,160
Right

1254
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,880
Six players

1255
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,040
must guess which of the five bizarre experiences

1256
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,160
belongs to whom

1257
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,880
The player guessed by the most people

1258
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,640
is the loser

1259
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,920
So he basically exposed himself

1260
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,720
Everyone knows

1261
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,040
he stayed awake for 48 hours

1262
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,920
Players don’t want to lose

1263
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,480
Right.

1264
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,120
Because everyone knew he had over 48 hours.

1265
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,920
I know one issue.

1266
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,680
It's possible the "killer" wrote this.

1267
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,200
What do you mean?

1268
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,560
"The killer" wrote it.

1269
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,120
Then everyone voted for him.

1270
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,800
You have to write it yourself.

1271
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,200
His logic makes sense.

1272
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,320
It could have been written by "the killer."

1273
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,040
"The killer" knew that...

1274
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,160
Forty-eight hours was Fu...

1275
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,880
Under the premise that this was common knowledge...

1276
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,040
Then at least two people wrote it.

1277
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,800
Working up to forty-eight hours, right?

1278
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,680
One person...

1279
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,080
"The killer" wrote this thing.

1280
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,040
There's no problem with that.

1281
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,480
But Fu didn't write it himself.

1282
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,360
He didn't write it, right.

1283
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,000
It was written by "the killer."

1284
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,680
If you vote for Fu, that's wrong.

1285
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,240
This wasn't written by Fu.

1286
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,160
It wouldn't be wrong.

1287
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,880
But could you sign Fu's name?

1288
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,560
I wrote this thing...

1289
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,560
It really did happen to me.

1290
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,080
But could I sign someone else's name?

1291
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,520
Then you signed his name.

1292
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,760
Then whose name did Fu sign?

1293
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,680
If I were Fei

1294
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,680
I write this

1295
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,000
You can pass the lie detector test

1296
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,480
Can pass

1297
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:03,720
Right

1298
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,800
Pass it and then you can go up

1299
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,280
Everyone meets this condition

1300
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,840
So they can all pass the lie detector

1301
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,480
Yes, none of them are lying

1302
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:11,920
Correct

1303
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:12,880
For example

1304
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,600
I go first

1305
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Then the lie detector tests who I am

1306
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:16,920
Doesn't matter

1307
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,560
Then

1308
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,360
As long as you pass

1309
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:18,720
I passed

1310
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,720
You can go on board

1311
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,320
Then I understand

1312
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,560
For example, if I set

1313
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,880
Fu to be the last one to board

1314
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,400
Then I write forty-eight hours

1315
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,760
And I'll post it as the sixth

1316
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,400
Which relates closely

1317
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,280
To the sequence

1318
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,320
We just discovered

1319
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,920
Is it because

1320
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,000
we tore them all off

1321
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,680
without paying attention to their order?

1322
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,040
Right

1323
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,000
Okay, let's try to remember

1324
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,120
what was the first piece just now?

1325
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,840
"Maximum duration up to 48 hours"

1326
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,680
"Family member critically ill, boss won't approve half-day leave"

1327
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,920
"Restroom breaks during work hours"

1328
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,360
"Number, timing and duration all restricted"

1329
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,800
The 48-hour one was definitely first

1330
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,760
What was the second one?

1331
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,880
The second was about critically ill family

1332
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,320
and the boss not approving leave

1333
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,400
"Family member worked to 'death'"

1334
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,080
This was the third

1335
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,640
The fourth was the 24-hour one

1336
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,640
Right, and this is the fifth one

1337
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,600
You have such a good memory

1338
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,480
You actually remembered them all

1339
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:15,600
"The deceased"

1340
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,120
He wouldn't write this story himself

1341
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,440
The "killer" wrote his story

1342
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,600
Then took his place

1343
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,080
Yes, replaced his position

1344
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,360
Because he was the first to write

1345
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,120
As long as he secured that position

1346
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,520
The rest could be randomly changed

1347
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,200
Right

1348
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:29,880
That's what it means

1349
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,160
The longest overtime record was 48 hours.

1350
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,200
It was written by the "culprit."

1351
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,080
Then it was posted.

1352
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,120
to Fu's designated position.

1353
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:40,840
No.

1354
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,320
Fu was the first one up.

1355
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,920
Fu was recognized by the system as the first.

1356
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:46,960
No.

1357
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,600
Fu was definitely the first one up.

1358
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,080
Fu absolutely wasn't one of the later ones.

1359
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,480
This is like fingerprints or irises.

1360
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,600
You were first—it must be you.

1361
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:52,960
Yes.

1362
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,480
Right?

1363
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,800
Fu was the very first one up.

1364
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,920
When Fu went up first,

1365
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,240
what did he originally write?

1366
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:58,960
No idea.

1367
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,560
He could've written anything.

1368
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,040
Anything.

1369
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:00,520
All five have it.

1370
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,360
They all do.

1371
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:01,760
Right?

1372
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:02,680
Then,

1373
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,560
maybe,

1374
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,280
it wasn't a swap between 1 and 6.

1375
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,600
It was a swap between 1 and 2.

1376
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,560
The second one up

1377
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,720
swapped them.

1378
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,000
That way,

1379
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,840
no one later would notice anything wrong.

1380
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,640
Right.

1381
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,520
So you're saying,

1382
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,360
the third one could also swap.

1383
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,040
Yes, actually, everyone could.

1384
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,200
Everyone could.

1385
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,640
2, 3, 4, 5—all could swap.

1386
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,840
I deliberately swapped with the first one.

1387
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,240
Right.

1388
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,400
Everyone could.

1389
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,040
Meaning all five of them

1390
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,080
could be the "culprit."

1391
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,920
Yes.

1392
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,760
This was definitely written by the "killer."

1393
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,200
So this has nothing to do with Fu.

1394
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,160
Then what Fu wrote...

1395
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,840
Which one? In which group?

1396
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,240
must contain the "killer."

1397
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,320
For example, if Fu wrote this one,

1398
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,520
then the "killer" must be one of these two.

1399
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,480
between them.

1400
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,520
If Fu wrote this one,

1401
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,880
then these two are involved.

1402
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,640
Right?

1403
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,600
Not necessarily.

1404
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,880
For example, this one...

1405
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,360
was written by Fei.

1406
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,200
Then she could have written his.

1407
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,880
If Ke wrote this one,

1408
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,440
then Fei could have written his.

1409
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,680
Do you understand?

1410
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,120
But he didn't...

1411
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,120
He hasn't done this.

1412
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:58,600
He didn't do this.

1413
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,640
So he wouldn't have written this.

1414
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,080
Fu wouldn't have.

1415
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,080
He wouldn't have written this.

1416
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,120
Right, so this wasn't written by him.

1417
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,560
Obviously this definitely couldn't be...

1418
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,480
written by Fu.

1419
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,960
But the others could all have been written by Fu.

1420
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,280
Right.

1421
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,640
But we can't say for sure which ones were written by Fu.

1422
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,000
We need to eliminate them one by one.

1423
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:13,840
Count it as written by Fu.

1424
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,800
I think this problem can be solved to...

1425
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,320
determine who wrote what.

1426
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:17,800
Definitely.

1427
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,600
Because each story...

1428
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,040
was only written by one person.

1429
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:22,920
Right.

1430
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,800
First eliminate

1431
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,160
Start with the least likely

1432
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,000
Shouldn't we

1433
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,880
start with the person who appears least

1434
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,800
and assign them

1435
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,440
to confirm which task they're assigned to

1436
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,720
Otherwise if there are too many

1437
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,440
we'll never find it

1438
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,080
Xu

1439
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,640
Two

1440
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,520
First eliminate Xu

1441
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,320
Which story have you assigned Xu to?

1442
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,680
Xu is this one

1443
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,200
There's a Xu here

1444
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:42,720
Forty-eight hours

1445
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,720
(Helping) the boss with personal matters

1446
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,040
Let's assume he's innocent first

1447
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,040
Then let him handle personal matters first

1448
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,040
For example if he's Xu

1449
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,560
Xu, right?

1450
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:50,960
Okay

1451
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,880
Which one did you say you wrote?

1452
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,520
I wrote about

1453
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,360
a family member being worked to "death"

1454
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:54,760
Right.

1455
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,880
So, that means

1456
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,920
this was you,

1457
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,360
correct?

1458
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,160
Then Fei didn't write this one.

1459
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,440
She might have written about

1460
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,440
a family member's critical illness.

1461
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,280
Because here she mentions

1462
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,840
Look,

1463
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,320
"My greatest regret is

1464
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,320
that when you were critically ill,

1465
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,880
I couldn't even get half a day off."

1466
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,600
All my regular customers know

1467
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,880
this is why I opened Happy Hometown.

1468
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,240
But what they don't know is

1469
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:21,880
that you, my dearest,

1470
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,360
were actually crushed by work.

1471
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,480
After two days of emergency care,

1472
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,680
we still couldn't save you.

1473
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,800
I hope

1474
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,360
no other worker will suffer like you did.

1475
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,440
Yes, I saw a photo where

1476
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,440
she wrote:

1477
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,560
"When you were seriously ill,

1478
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,360
they wouldn't approve even half a day off,

1479
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,120
absolutely refused.

1480
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,160
She said all her regular customers thought

1481
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,480
this was the reason

1482
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,440
I opened this shop.

1483
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,360
But actually it was because

1484
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,480
my family member was

1485
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,680
worked to "death."

1486
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,520
This information represents

1487
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,800
Fei wouldn't possibly fill this in

1488
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,480
Fei wouldn't write the last one

1489
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,800
I understand her point now

1490
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,400
She wants us to use reverse thinking

1491
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,320
Who's least likely to write what

1492
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,560
Right, take these sentences for example

1493
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,000
The first person you'd think of is Fei

1494
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,320
So first you eliminate Fei

1495
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,760
Yes, she definitely wouldn't write it herself

1496
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,680
This is reverse thinking

1497
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,680
Exactly

1498
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,760
It's the same logic as with Fu

1499
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,640
Because Fu even made it his profile picture

1500
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,040
Something everyone knows

1501
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,440
They'd absolutely never write that

1502
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,000
Fei started this business because of this

1503
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,240
So Fei wouldn't write this either

1504
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,320
Right

1505
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,280
After eliminating everyone else

1506
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:19,920
Who's left?

1507
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,640
Bao, Fu, Shen

1508
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,040
Right?

1509
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,360
Let me tell you

1510
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,320
It's still Bao, Fu, Shen

1511
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,680
Yes, looking at it this way

1512
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,640
Shen, Fu, Bao

1513
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,600
These three are all the same

1514
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,640
Constantly overlapping

1515
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,600
If Shen, Fu, and Bao these three people

1516
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,640
have the same remaining options,

1517
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,040
that is,

1518
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:42,920
these three pieces of paper

1519
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,040
were written by them,

1520
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,240
then the one who wrote

1521
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,760
"longest overtime record"

1522
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,120
reaching 48 hours

1523
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,480
must be among the remaining: Ke Wuku,

1524
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,360
Boss Fei, and Agent Xu.

1525
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,200
But what they don't know is

1526
00:48:59,200 --> 00:48:59,840
my most beloved you

1527
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,080
were actually crushed by work

1528
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,000
Nako, what exactly did you write?

1529
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,400
This is what I wrote.

1530
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,560
This is because

1531
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,480
those present at the time

1532
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,760
No one knew about this past of mine

1533
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,080
It was only during today's questioning

1534
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:23,760
that I told you about it

1535
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,640
this story of mine

1536
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,160
"The killer" must have written the 48-hour note

1537
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,600
So we need to examine the motives, right?

1538
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,600
Boss Fei was likely protecting

1539
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,320
her younger brother

1540
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,400
That's why she needed to

1541
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,800
"eliminate" Deputy Manager Fu

1542
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,720
General Manager Zong was taken care of by Ke Wuku

1543
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,400
Deputy Manager Fu had already called to threaten him

1544
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,560
So he had

1545
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,520
a motive to "eliminate" Deputy Manager Fu

1546
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,360
What about Xu's "murder" motive?

1547
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,520
Because in the previous case

1548
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,360
Fu had approached his sister

1549
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,280
saying about this case

1550
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,760
that she and her brother were involved

1551
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,760
So this Xu

1552
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,120
to protect the siblings

1553
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,120
planned to "kill" him

1554
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,040
That was his motive

1555
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:04,560
Right?

1556
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,880
Xu had the strongest desire

1557
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,240
It was so strong it seemed unreal

1558
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,160
Yes

1559
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:13,960
So it was Xiao Xu

1560
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,680
It was Xiao Xu all along

1561
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,320
Let's go

1562
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,840
Time to vote

1563
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,280
This Xu Zhongjie

1564
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,720
will definitely take the initiative

1565
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,040
to protect the siblings

1566
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,240
And he holds some resentment

1567
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,120
towards Deputy Manager Fu

1568
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:43,680
Therefore,

1569
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,680
his "murder" motive

1570
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,600
is quite strong

1571
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,760
I believe the "killer" is

1572
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,800
Xu Zhongjie

1573
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:00,880
Ke Wuku

1574
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,160
Because he already admitted

1575
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,040
the mistakes he made in the previous case

1576
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,280
so we thought

1577
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,800
it probably wasn't him

1578
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,360
so we voted for Xu Zhongjie

1579
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,120
Xu Zhongjie, we're sorry

1580
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:17,840
I believe

1581
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,880
the person who "killed" Deputy Manager Fu

1582
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,440
is none other than

1583
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,520
President Zong

1584
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,720
It's true that I "killed" him

1585
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,520
But

1586
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,480
Vice Manager Fu

1587
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,800
who exactly "killed" him?

1588
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,600
Today I cast my vote for

1589
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,960
Today is

1590
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,920
the most confusing day.

1591
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,320
There are three people

1592
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:53,880
namely:

1593
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,520
the "deceased,"

1594
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,720
Deputy Manager Fu,

1595
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,800
Hao the cleaner,

1596
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,920
and

1597
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,000
Deputy Manager Shen.

1598
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,720
These three people

1599
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,440
if considered as a group,

1600
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,480
after eliminating

1601
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,680
the possibility that the "deceased"

1602
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,440
would choose to write

1603
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,960
48 hours of overtime work,

1604
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,440
there are only three columns

1605
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,840
that satisfy all three being present.

1606
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,000
Therefore,

1607
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,800
excluding the "deceased,"

1608
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,840
Hao the cleaner and Deputy Manager Shen

1609
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,040
are essentially cleared

1610
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:17,840
of suspicion.

1611
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,160
That leaves three people:

1612
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,600
Xu the agent,

1613
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,200
Boss Fei,

1614
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,080
and Ke Wuku.

1615
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,480
I believe the "killer"

1616
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,560
when murdering Deputy Manager Fu

1617
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,360
definitely had malicious intent

1618
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,920
and certainly lied.

1619
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,480
I've concluded

1620
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,720
that today's "killer" is

1621
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,600
This case today is extremely complicated

1622
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,480
You are the "real culprit"

1623
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:51,880
So difficult

1624
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,720
Too painful

1625
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,200
Be a good person

1626
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:57,640
You all

1627
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,800
Welcome everyone

1628
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,400

"Let's Begin Deduction"

1635
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,480
This is the case review hall

1636
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,680
Everyone's here now

1637
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,800
I suggest we have a drink first

1638
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,400
Come on

1639
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,760
Let's toast to celebrate

1640
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,880
Today was tough

1641
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,840
The tea fragrance meets fruit pieces

1642
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,000
making milk more delicious

1643
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,600
Let's make the first toast

1644
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,120
to celebrate

1645
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,880
our deduction plan today

1646
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,800
has succeeded

1647
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,560
Let's raise this super delicious

1648
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,320

1650
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,880
Let's toast together

1651
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,480
and reveal the truth

1652
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,040
Here we go

1653
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,040
Congratulations on completing today's deduction

1654
00:53:59,160 --> 00:53:59,960
That was really tough

1655
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,760
So difficult

1656
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,040
In "Let's Start Deduction"

1657
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,120
every story

1658
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,280
the person with the highest votes

1659
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,160
will be identified as the "culprit"

1660
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,480
Did we correctly

1661
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,640
identify the culprit in today's case?

1662
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,640
The suspects discovered by all players are:

1663
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,280
Xu Zhongjie

1664
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,760
Hao Baojie

1665
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,160
Shen Deputy Manager

1666
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,600
Fei Boss

1667
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,480
Ke Wuku

1668
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,280
Five individuals

1669
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,480
After deduction

1670
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,600
The "culprit" voted by everyone is

1671
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,680
Xu Zhongjie

1672
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,280
Was your choice

1673
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,840
correct?

1674
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,560
Of course it was!

1675
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,120
Did we catch the "real culprit"?

1676
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,720
This case's "culprit reveal"

1677
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,640
"Lock the Culprit"

1678
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,600
Failure

1679
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:49,840
Failure

1680
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,240
The Real "Killer"

1681
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,480
The true "culprit" is

1682
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,120
The true "culprit" is

1683
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,840
Ke Wuku

1684
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,720
Look how excited he is

1685
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,520
Stop.

1686
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,360
Go stand in the back.

1687
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,440
You don't deserve to be in our team.

1688
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,760
How serious he was.

1689
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,480
I've already "killed" one person.

1690
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,720
You're the only one.

1691
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,880
As the one playing the "killer".

1692
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,080
Who sat in this position.

1693
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,440
If Shen, Fu, and Bao.

1694
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,440
Their remaining options are the same.

1695
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,560
Then write.

1696
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,080
The longest overtime record.

1697
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,440
Was as long as 48 hours.

1698
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,800
Then among the remaining Ke Wuku.

1699
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,680
Boss Fei, and Xu the agent.

1700
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,240
Tell us which one you wrote.

1701
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:44,880
I wrote.

1702
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,720
"Relative worked to death".

1703
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,120
Right.

1704
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,680
That means Fei didn't write this.

1705
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,880
Fei couldn't have written the last one.

1706
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,960
She said all her regular customers thought.

1707
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,280
That this was the reason.

1708
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,240
I opened this shop.

1709
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,200
I understand what she means.

1710
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,800
She wants us to use reverse thinking.

1711
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,720
Who would be the least likely to write about what.

1712
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,680
So Ke, what exactly did you write?

1713
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,240
The reason is...

1714
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,160
Those present at the time...

1715
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,440
None of them knew about this part of my past.

1716
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,760
I only told you about it today...

1717
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,440
during the questioning.

1718
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,320
This story of mine...

1719
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,400
Perhaps missing him was the most intense

1720
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,760
So intense it became unreal

1721
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,680
Right

1722
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,480
So it was Xiao Xu

1723
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,200
So it was Xiao Xu

1724
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,520
Ke Wuku deserves to die a thousand deaths.

1725
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,040
Indeed.

1726
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:34,360
Is that so?

1727
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,160
Deserves to die for his crimes.

1728
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,320
Did any of us vote for him?

1729
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,920
I did.

1730
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,760
I voted for him.

1731
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,640
I believe the "killer" was acting with malice.

1732
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,720
when murdering Deputy Manager Fu.

1733
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,520
Definitely had malicious intent.

1734
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,080
He must have been lying.

1735
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,960
Boss Fei's spouse,

1736
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,280
also known as Brother Ku,

1737
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,440
after passing away,

1738
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,360
the compensation money

1739
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,480
was applied for by Deputy Manager Fu.

1740
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,160
So she should feel grateful

1741
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,920
toward Deputy Manager Fu.

1742
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,440
Therefore, as the "killer,"

1743
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,360
I was torn between

1744
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,920
Xu Zhongjie and Ke Wuku.

1745
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,640
These two individuals.

1746
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,400
wavering back and forth.

1747
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,040
But then later,

1748
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,280
I suddenly remembered something else.

1749
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,160
I recall Xu Zhongjie

1750
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,840
during the noon interrogation,

1751
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,640
mentioned that

1752
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,080
Deputy Manager Fu had

1753
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,760
applied for

1754
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,440
a recuperation opportunity for him.

1755
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,600
But then I reconsidered,

1756
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,720
I thought about Ke Wuku

1757
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,720
less than a week ago

1758
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,000
received a message

1759
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,080
from Deputy Manager Fu.

1760
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,920
I realized

1761
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,640
General Manager Zong's "death"

1762
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,840
was deliberately

1763
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,120
engineered by someone.

1764
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,840
It could only be you and Boss Fei.

1765
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,040
I will investigate this thoroughly.

1766
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,160
Therefore, I reasonably suspect

1767
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:31,960
Ke Wuku

1768
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,560
had every reason

1769
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,160
to choose "silencing the witness."

1770
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,360
I've finally determined

1771
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,520
that today's "killer" is Ke Wuku.

1772
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,320
Have we missed any

1773
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,240
crucial evidence?

1774
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,640
The crucial evidence everyone missed is

1775
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,160
that we found in Kewuku's home

1776
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,600
his computer

1777
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,280
In the computer's start menu

1778
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,200
there was a messaging app

1779
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,240
After opening this messaging app

1780
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,760
we needed to use his phone

1781
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,960
to scan WeChat

1782
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,320
and log into his desktop WeChat

1783
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,680
This allowed us to discover

1784
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,480
that in his phone's WeChat

1785
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,560
the deleted chat history

1786
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,160
showed that after the incident

1787
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,960
he sent messages verifying

1788
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,480
whether Deputy Manager Fu

1789
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,440
had classified General Manager Zong's "death"

1790
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,920
as accidental

1791
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,400
While deleted from his phone

1792
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,360
it remained on his computer

1793
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,560
He only learned later

1794
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,760
Right, we always thought

1795
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,080
this had been settled long ago

1796
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,680
and your sister was paid

1797
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,680
so there shouldn't have been any issues

1798
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,560
But the sequence was wrong

1799
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,600
In this case

1800
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,240
Kewuku grew up with his brother Kewuku

1801
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,640
and sister-in-law Boss Fei, relying on each other

1802
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,440
His brother Kewuku

1803
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,520
after joining the real estate property department

1804
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,240
After becoming a real estate agent,

1805
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,160
during his work,

1806
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,240
he suffered exploitation from General Manager Zong of his company.

1807
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,400
and unfortunately "died" from overwork at his job.

1808
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,200
After "Brother Ku's" "death",

1809
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,400
his wife, Boss Fei,

1810
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,040
opened a foot massage shop called

1811
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,280
"Fei's Foot Care"

1812
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,600
in the basement of Apartment 11.

1813
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,240
She also offered

1814
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,880
a special service to reply to messages

1815
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,680
for overworked employees.

1816
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,880
Meanwhile, his brother Ke Wuku

1817
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,800
couldn't get over Brother Ku's "death"

1818
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,440
and held a grudge against General Manager Zong.

1819
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,240
On the evening of April 29th,

1820
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,400
Deputy Manager Shen from the property department

1821
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,680
submitted an order to the foot massage shop

1822
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,120
for message replying services.

1823
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,160
This order

1824
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,080
was coincidentally accepted by Ke Wuku.

1825
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,560
After logging into Deputy Manager Shen's account,

1826
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,680
he discovered the property department would hold

1827
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,680
a "Plum Blossom Appreciation" event on April 30th.

1828
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,240
General Manager Zong would give a speech at the apartment entrance.

1829
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,840
For this event,

1830
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,200
the property department specially commissioned

1831
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,880
a giant doll installation on the third-floor platform.

1832
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,640
This gave Ke Wuku an idea -

1833
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,240
to take advantage of replying messages for Deputy Manager Shen

1834
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,680
in the work group chat.

1835
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,320
Positioned General Manager Zong's speaking spot

1836
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,840
directly beneath the massive installation

1837
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,440
Then on the following day

1838
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,880
10 minutes before General Manager Zong's speech

1839
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,960
he loosened the load-bearing bolts of the installation

1840
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,440
causing it to fall

1841
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,960
and "kill" General Manager Zong

1842
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,600
June 17th

1843
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,880
Deputy Manager Fu

1844
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,120
began investigating the "death" of General Manager Zong

1845
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,240
and found it highly likely

1846
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,080
that someone had exploited

1847
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,480
the message relay service at Fei Maojiao's shop

1848
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,240
to "kill" General Manager Zong

1849
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,480
Meanwhile, Ke Wuku

1850
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,240
learned that Deputy Manager Fu was investigating the matter

1851
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,320
and feared being exposed

1852
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,480
To silence him

1853
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,360
he planned

1854
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,560
on June 23rd

1855
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,360
at Fei Maojiao's "Happy Hometown Confession Event"

1856
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,680
to use a game

1857
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,960
to "murder" Deputy Manager Fu

1858
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,560
On the evening of June 23rd

1859
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,760
before the game began

1860
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,840
Ke Wuku secretly took one of the shop's commonly stocked

1861
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,000
bitter anti-inflammatory capsules

1862
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,640
and mixed it into the seasoning for the loser's bitter melon salad

1863
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,800
by pouring it in

1864
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,160
because consuming the bitter capsule with bitter melon

1865
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,600
would cause instant "sudden death"

1866
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,240
After the game starts,

1867
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,880
Deputy Manager Fu enters first,

1868
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,000
submitting his story.

1869
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,360
Ke Wuku follows closely behind as the second,

1870
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,520
because he needs to ensure

1871
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,240
he's positioned after Deputy Manager Fu.

1872
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,280
Then,

1873
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,800
he writes in the system

1874
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,960
their shared experience of

1875
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,720
working overtime for up to 48 hours.

1876
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,240
But most people present

1877
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,840
would assume it's Deputy Manager Fu's story,

1878
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,520
because

1879
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,520
Deputy Manager Fu is a workaholic

1880
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,200
who often mentions "48 hours of overtime."

1881
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,280
Everyone immediately associates "48 hours"

1882
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,760
with him.

1883
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,200
As for Ke Wuku,

1884
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,840
he once distributed flyers for 48 hours too,

1885
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,080
but this detail

1886
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,040
isn't known by everyone present.

1887
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,680
He exploits the fact that participants

1888
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,840
won't write commonly known stories,

1889
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,600
switching the order of his story sheet

1890
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,200
with Deputy Manager Fu's.

1891
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,760
This allows him to manipulate the game's outcome,

1892
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,040
making Deputy Manager Fu

1893
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,320
the loser guessed by the most people,

1894
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,440
forcing him to eat that

1895
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,240
bitter melon he had poisoned beforehand.

1896
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,000
After Deputy Manager Fu ate the cold bitter melon salad,

1897
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,920
and fell down the stairs,

1898
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,800
you said Old Fu was a good person.

1899
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,680
Everyone said

1900
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,120
Deputy Manager Fu was actually

1901
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,040
sharp-tongued

1902
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,160
but soft-hearted.

1903
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,200
The reason he worked so hard

1904
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,000
was because his family was poor,

1905
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,160
and he had to raise

1906
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,840
his underage daughter alone.

1907
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,840
Moreover, he decided

1908
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,320
to report General Manager Zong's "death"

1909
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,280
as an accident

1910
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,160
to the headquarters.

1911
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,200
So everyone proposed

1912
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,040
to stage his "death"

1913
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,080
as an on-duty accident

1914
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,320
while inspecting the elevator

1915
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,000
when it malfunctioned.

1916
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,560
(Work-related accident)

1917
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,760
All game participants

1918
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,800
were involved

1919
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,560
in this conspiracy.

1920
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,120
The "real culprit" Ke Wuku

1921
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,520
also hid among them,

1922
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,440
collaborating to stage Deputy Manager Fu's "death"

1923
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,200
as

1924
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,640
a workplace accident.

1925
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,560
After returning home,

1926
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,600
Ke Wuku used his computer

1927
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,400
to message Teng Zhongjie

1928
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,000
on WeChat,

1929
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,920
confirming whether Deputy Manager Fu

1930
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,880
had indeed reported

1931
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,200
General Manager Zong's "death"

1932
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,280
as an accident

1933
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,040
to headquarters.

1934
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,920
After receiving Teng's confirmation,

1935
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,160
Ke deleted the message.

1936
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,640
This became the key evidence

1937
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,840
to identify the "real culprit."

1938
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,040
Because only the "real culprit"

1939
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,640
had motive against him,

1940
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,480
meaning they only learned he was good

1941
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,440
after acting.

1942
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,840
They also knew Zong's "death"

1943
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,120
had been reported

1944
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,680
as an accident.

1945
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,200
In this case,

1946
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,360
Guo Baoyou, who voted correctly,

1947
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,920
and Ke Wuku, who successfully escaped,

1948
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,560
both can receive golden keys.

1949
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,640
After you.

1950
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,240
Please collect your golden keys from behind.

1951
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,080
Go ahead.

1952
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:33,680
Come on.

1953
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,520
It's really these two.

1954
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,280
Awarding each other.

1955
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,600
Here.

1956
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,320
After you.

1957
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,280
Here.

1958
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,200
Alright.

1959
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:42,880
He's really impressive.

1960
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,920
Thank you.

1961
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,480
Don't come down.

1962
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,000
Stay up there.

1963
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,600
Apologize for Wuku.

1964
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:49,960
Quick.

1965
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,520
Sorry.

1966
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,160
In the end, Ke Wuku's fate was

1967
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,920
Ke Wuku was brought to justice.

1968
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,160
He also felt very sorry

1969
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:58,960
Bai, Song, Yi, Guo, Zhou.

1970
01:03:58,960 --> 01:03:59,680
Liu, Yi, Ku.

1971
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,280
Then after going back,

1972
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,360
he wrote a confession letter.

1973
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,560
He turned himself in.

1974
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,120
Yes.

1975
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,240
Today's case

1976
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,120
actually touches on many

1977
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,480
workplace issues we face.

1978
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,920
Now let's welcome with applause

1979
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,960
our old friend,

1980
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,000
Professor Ma Ai from

1981
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,280
China University of Political Science and Law,

1982
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,600
specializing in criminal psychology.

1983
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,000
Please welcome.

1984
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,800
Professor Ma Ai.

1985
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,280
Hello everyone.

1986
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,280
Welcome, Professor Ma.

1987
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:23,800
Here, Professor Ma.

1988
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,160
In this story,

1989
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,000
almost all these workers

1990
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,280
have experienced

1991
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,280
working 48 hours straight

1992
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,160
or

1993
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,520
only taking one day off

1994
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,520
in a whole year.

1995
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,600
Such situations occur,

1996
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,720
doesn't this actually violate

1997
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,240
many labor laws?

1998
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:43,800
Absolutely.

1999
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,120
This directly violates labor laws.

2000
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,000
The increasingly severe

2001
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,480
rat race phenomenon among corporate employees

2002
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,080
This might be particularly

2003
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,120
prominent in our current

2004
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,280
case study.

2005
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,880
My suggestion is:

2006
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,960
Why must you stay in such

2007
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:02,520
an uncomfortable environment,

2008
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,120
letting the rat race

2009
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:07,120
wear down your willpower

2010
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,600
and destroy your physical and mental health?

2011
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,000
Professor Ma,

2012
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,640
like in our case study

2013
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:15,880
there was a death from overwork.

2014
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,240
In such cases,

2015
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,000
for deaths from overwork like this,

2016
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
would his company

2017
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,040
bear legal responsibility?

2018
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:22,760
Absolutely.

2019
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,880
Regarding death from overwork,

2020
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,520
it's just a matter of degree.

2021
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,280
If it's confirmed that

2022
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,200
labor laws were violated

2023
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,720
and the employment contract

2024
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,800
between employer and employee,

2025
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,440
then the company must bear

2026
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,160
certain legal responsibility.

2027
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,000
However, from current cases we see

2028
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,280
most companies

2029
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,240
will more or less

2030
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,520
offer some moral compensation,

2031
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,160
since the employee worked hard

2032
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,080
for the company with this outcome.

2033
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:52,480
Professor

2034
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,400
For example, in the workplace,

2035
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,400
you've already clocked out,

2036
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,800
but your boss asks you to

2037
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,840
do personal favors for him.

2038
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,200
Like picking up his kids,

2039
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,480
or buying groceries for him.

2040
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,320
Is this illegal?

2041
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,440
We should say

2042
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,560
this falls under your personal

2043
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,840
civil relationship.

2044
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,360
Personal connection.

2045
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,400
It's not part of your company's

2046
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,560
contractual agreement

2047
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,440
between both parties.

2048
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,920
But if you refuse and get fired,

2049
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,280
this means the boss is abusing

2050
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,400
his official authority

2051
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,040
to handle his personal matters.

2052
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,520
There's no fault on your part,

2053
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,320
but rather it's the boss's

2054
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,320
personal character issue.

2055
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:30,880
Yes.

2056
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,480
But legally speaking,

2057
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,960
how would you punish him?

2058
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,720
There's really no good method.

2059
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,840
It's a moral issue.

2060
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,320
Truly just a moral issue.

2061
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,400
A character issue.

2062
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:41,760
Not an obligation.

2063
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,600
Not my duty as your employee.

2064
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,320
Definitely not a basic obligation.

2065
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,000
Okay.

2066
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,640
Alright, thank you Professor Ma for sharing.

2067
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,520
Okay, thank you.

2068
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,120
Thank you.

2069
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,240
Thank you, Professor Ma.

2070
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,960
Thank you, Teacher Ma.

2071
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,360
<Start Guessing

2072
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,720
See you next week.

2073
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,240
I believe first and foremost that everything

2074
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,840
exists in a state of cooperation

2075
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,160
This cooperative state means

2076
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,240
we must respect each other

2077
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,800
First, you must respect your work

2078
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,000
You must respect your boss

2079
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,160
But equally, your boss must respect you too

2080
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,520
So I believe this constitutes

2081
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,480
a relationship of mutual respect

2082
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,080
Therefore, when you feel disrespected

2083
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,080
or when demands exceed your capacity

2084
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,280
you should actually choose to make changes

2085
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,440
When encountering certain situations at work

2086
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,720
that you find completely unacceptable

2087
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,800
or excessively strict

2088
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,160
or extremely

2089
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,360
unreasonable demands

2090
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,040
I believe you should courageously refuse

2091
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,520
Have the courage to say no

2092
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,120
You can't keep being exploited by others

2093
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,440
So what we can do is

2094
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,800
first protect ourselves

2095
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,160
using all available legal means to

2096
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,040
fight for our rights

2097
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,920
Eat when you should eat, rest when you should rest

2098
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,280
Ensure your physical

2099
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,440
remains healthy as a foundation

2100
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,960
before working hard

2101
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,560
Right

2102
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,240
Even when striving in your youth

2103
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,200
pay attention to your mental

2104
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,120
and physical health

2105
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:19,359
Stress is something that

2106
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,600
frequently accompanies us in life.

2107
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,240
I believe

2108
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,080
when facing work pressure,

2109
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,560
it's crucial to maintain a positive mindset.

2110
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,080
High pressure doesn't mean you should slack off,

2111
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,399
fear it or retreat from it.

2112
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,520
It's like driving a carriage -

2113
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,640
if life weren't pushing you from behind,

2114
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,479
you wouldn't feel compelled to move forward.

2115
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,520
When I feel extremely stressed,

2116
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:45,040
I try to do things I genuinely enjoy.

2117
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,960
For me, I love watching movies,

2118
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,000
singing, listening to music,

2119
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,319
or eating delicious food.

2120
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,800
I really enjoy good food.

2121
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,920
I think

2122
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,680
first you need to discover

2123
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,279
what you're passionate about beyond work.

2124
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,240
For example, during my acting career,

2125
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,600
people often told me:

2126
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,720
"You should consider

2127
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,520
who Song Zuer can be

2128
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,520
beyond just acting."

2129
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,600
Because when we endure

2130
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,720
what seems unbearable,

2131
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:15,399
and make it through,

2132
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:17,439
you'll definitely emerge stronger.

2133
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,359
I hope everyone

2134
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:20,720
can maintain good routines,

2135
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,520
keep a positive mood,

2136
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,160
With good habits, good mood and good health,

2137
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,560
we can better

2138
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,240
contribute meaningfully,

2139
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,359
whether to our companies,

2140
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:30,560
our society,

2141
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,000
or our country.

2142
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Once you find a job you truly love,

2143
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,640
you'll never tire of doing it.

2144
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,880
You'll constantly challenge yourself,

2145
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,479
and I believe this is

2146
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:50,200
the right path to take.

2147
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,560
So if you're currently a "daily-disposable" youth,

2148
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,960
I think you could give it a try,

2149
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,240
move toward what interests you,

2150
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,080
try being "monthly-disposable",

2151
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,640
then eventually "yearly-disposable".

2152
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,560
You might just discover

2153
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,320
the career that truly belongs to you.

2154
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,800
I believe every slash youth is

2155
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,160
someone full of fighting spirit,

2156
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,920
that's why they're willing to fill their lives completely.

2157
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,280
And I believe they will certainly

2158
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,480
quickly find the career they love,

2159
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,680
to be passionate about it and devote themselves to it.

2160
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,360
Hey, guys...

2161
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,720
I just saw Ke Wuku in the lobby

2162
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,680
being taken away.

2163
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,320
Then I went to his place

2164
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,600
and found a letter he left behind.

2165
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,200
He

2166
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,480
has realized his mistakes

2167
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,800
and hopes his younger brother will turn over a new leaf,

2168
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,960
and truly reform himself.

2169
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,600
And Boss Fei is acting strange too...

2170
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,680
Someone she knew also jumped from a building.

2171
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:52,360
Could it be...

2172
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,600
Jiajia, Fang Xiaomei, Guo Ba, Boss Fei...

2173
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,840
the person they knew who jumped...

2174
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:58,600
could it be the same person?

2175
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,120
Who exactly is this person?

2176
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,120
Actually, what concerns me more

2177
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,160
is that apartment legend...

2178
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,120
They say this apartment makes people disappear.

2179
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,600
Many elderly residents have mysteriously vanished.

2180
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,080
Oh right,

2181
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,960
my friend Cai, who's much older than me,

2182
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,760
is among them.

2183
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,160
I really want to know...

2184
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,840
where exactly did they all go?

2185
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,040
No, don't worry,

2186
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,960
we'll definitely find out eventually.

2187
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,560
But the main strange thing today is...

2188
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,400
this.

2189
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,280
Today in Deputy Manager Fu's drawer,

2190
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,720
we saw that prophecy doll again.

2191
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,320
Seriously, I just want to know...

2192
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,560
who keeps placing these dolls repeatedly?

2193
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,200
Who exactly is putting these dolls here?

2194
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,920
Yeah, this is already the third doll.

2195
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,600
This week we haven't found any information

2196
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,560
about that strange symbol.

2197
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,920
We need to investigate quickly,

2198
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,760
or we'll all be "dead."

2199
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,800
Enough, stop thinking about it.

2200
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,840
Let's get our beauty sleep.

2201
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:56,520
I'm tired.

2202
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:06,680
Three

2203
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:07,720
Two

2204
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:08,800
One

2205
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,960
Cheese

2206
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,160
This can't be a time machine, can it?

2207
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:17,560
Time may pass, but images endure

2208
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,320
1988

2209
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,520
Chuyang Lane "Murder and Arson" Case

2210
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,240
will happen again

2211
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,520
"Killer" identified as Old Man Li

2212
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,320
So handsome

2213
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,280
It's 1988 now

2214
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,320
Why are you here again?

2215
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:38,880
This isn't mine

2216
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:39,640
Cai?

2217
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,040
Little slob

2218
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,440
Nephew

2219
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,480
Nephew

2220
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,160
Grandpa

2221
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:48,880
Dad

2222
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,000
Are we related?

2223
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,880
Fire!

2224
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:55,960
There's a "dead body"

2225
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,440
It's our fault again

2226
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,120
Sister Cai, you're also a murder suspect

2227
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,640
I discovered their plan

2228
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,240
I don't believe it

2229
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,880
So you killed Xiao Xiao Wang

2230
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,440
I didn't

2231
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,920
I wanted to stop them

2232
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,720
Who did you say your boss was?

2233
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:09,760
So that means

2234
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,960
There's an even bigger boss here

2235
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,200
It's not you, is it?

2236
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:12,720
I'm not

2237
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,760
You're not the boss, are you?

2238
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:14,440
No

2239
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,320
I'm a writer

2240
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,720
Unrelated to this case

2241
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,040
Those who hurt you deserve to "die"
