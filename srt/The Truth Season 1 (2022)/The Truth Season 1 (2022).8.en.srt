1
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,760
Someone "died"

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,440
This must be Song, the delivery guy, right?

3
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,440
The key people in today's case are:

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,280
Liu Xialai

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,080
Hao Baojie

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,920
Fang Xiaomei

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,440
And you discovered that the one who "killed" her

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,840
was most likely Song Huo

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,000
So now you hate Song Huo, don’t you?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,840
I hate him to death

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,680
And since you hate him

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
Have you ever

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,880
thought about killing him?

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,800
Of course, I want to "off" him

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,320
There’s a traitor among us

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,640
So you’re Yueguang?

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,600
Yes

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,680
They’re brothers

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,680
This looks like a bedroom

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,920
Storage room

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,640
Hold on

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,760
What kind of place is this?

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,280
I "killed" Zhou Keke by dropping him.

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,760
It's open.

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,640
Hold on

26
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,240
Why aren't you arresting anyone?

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,000
Why?

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,840
Don't touch me

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,480
Don't touch me

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,600
No, why are you...

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,560
You see people but don't arrest them

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,360
Don't touch me

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,160
What are you doing?

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,920
Wait a minute

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,160
Hold on

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,600
She's the one who was hiding

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,759
What are you trying to do?

38
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,280
Don't touch me

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,840
I don't even know you

40
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,880
Why aren't you arresting anyone?

41
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,520
Why?

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Don't touch me

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,840
Why aren't you arresting anyone?

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,480
Why?

45
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,640
Don't touch me

46
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,960
Why aren't you arresting anyone?

47
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,360
Why?

48
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,520
Isn't anyone going to control her?

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,080
Who are you?

50
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,680
Control her!

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,120
Bring her in for questioning.

52
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,040
Don't arrest me!

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,440
Wait a minute, I think I understand now.

54
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't come out!

55
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,520
I can confess everything to you.

56
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,720
But can we sit outside instead?

57
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,560
In this space,

58
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,200
I feel extremely oppressed.

59
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,720
Alright, fine.

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,440
Come, have a seat.

61
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,840
Is there someone

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,880
who locked you in here?

63
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,640
I told you

64
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,280
Do you know us?

65
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,720
She doesn't know us

66
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,080
This is your first time seeing us

67
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,520
You are...

68
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,720
Are you Fang Xiaomei?

69
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,640
Do you know him?

70
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,160
Do you know

71
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,960
Cao Yueguang?

72
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,200
What is he to you?

73
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,400
He's my boyfriend.

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,360
Who are you all?

75
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,240
Why are you here?

76
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,720
We're residents of this building.

77
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,600
Today, one of us

78
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,280
"died" up here.

79
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,600
So we followed some clues

80
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,680
and found this door.

81
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,720
So why are you inside this door?

82
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,000
I've been locked in here

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
for seven days.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,560
Seven days?

85
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,680
Who locked you in here?

86
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,600
I don't know.

87
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,360
I was just at home

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,760
when someone suddenly knocked me out

89
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,760
and then they

90
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,960
locked me in here.

91
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,520
Help!

92
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,120
Help!

93
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,360
Help!

94
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,840
Help!

95
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,320
Help!

96
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,840
Hello

97
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,640
No

98
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
This feels so distant

99
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,680
I am Cao Yueguang

100
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,000
But Cao Yueguang "died"

101
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,080
At that time

102
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,760
Why did I "die"

103
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,720
Because

104
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
I was being hunted down

105
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,920
And during this process

106
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,720
I had to conceal my identity

107
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,360
And completely reinvent myself

108
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,320
To re-emerge in this world

109
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,920
But Cao Yueguang didn't look like you

110
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,040
What more proof do you need?

111
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm your boyfriend

112
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,720
What's your online username?

113
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,200
My username is Moonlight Treasure Box

114
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
I'm Planet Meimei

115
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,800
Then why didn't you go that day?

116
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,800
Because

117
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,160
Because

118
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,880
I had plastic surgery

119
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,160
Then I went to the plastic surgery clinic

120
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,960
They said

121
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,160
if I kept looking at my phone

122
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,680
it would be bad for my recovery

123
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,880
I was in such a hurry

124
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,720
to finish the surgery quickly and find you

125
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,200
so I didn't check my phone at all

126
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,680
I only came back ten days ago

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,160
Today is May 13th

128
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,960
Look, here's my ID card

129
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
You were born in 1997

130
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
That's right

131
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,480
Can't you tell?

132
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,280
Plastic surgery has some side effects

133
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,880
It can make you look older

134
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,520
So try to avoid plastic surgery

135
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,200
You should listen to me

136
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,840
Really

137
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,840
Then why did you get surgery when I did?

138
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,040
This sentence

139
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,840
seems familiar - someone else asked that

140
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,440
Right?

141
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
"I get surgery, you get surgery"

142
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,200
Are you crazy?

143
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,680
You're insane!

144
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,920
"I get surgery, you get surgery"

145
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,400
No

146
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,120
Why did I get surgery?

147
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,880
Because I wanted to escape my life

148
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,760
Now my name is

149
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,520
Liu Xiashui

150
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,680
No, Liu Xialai

151
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,240
Why change to "Xiashui"?

152
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,320
Liu Xialai

153
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,680
Why would you say "Liu Xiashui"?

154
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
Why do you keep saying "Liu Xiashui"?

155
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,560
My name is Liu Xialai

156
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,320
I've changed my name to Liu Xialai now

157
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,720
Yes, that's right, it's me

158
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,680
Liu Xialai

159
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,360
Yes

160
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
Definitely not alone.

161
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,000
Let me ask you a question

162
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,960
You're alone in this room

163
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,880
Are you scared?

164
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,800
I'm scared "to death"

165
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,640
You say the word "fear"

166
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,800
Fear

167
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,480
is two people

168
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,920
That person says "fear"

169
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,440
Because I am afraid

170
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,920
Do you think they might have switched identities?

171
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
She locked her up

172
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,280
And then lived her life for her

173
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,360
Pretending to be me

174
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,000
Right

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,240
How could she pretend to be me?

176
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,640
Do you know Song Huo?

177
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,360
I know of him

178
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,760
You know Song Huo?

179
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,400
He often delivers packages for me

180
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,160
Yes

181
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,800
That's all there is to it

182
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,200
Who do you think "killed" your

183
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,720
boyfriend

184
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,320
ex-boyfriend

185
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,960
I think it was Song Huo

186
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,320
Do you remember our

187
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,040
couple's watches?

188
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,600
Of course I remember

189
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,200
He was wearing one

190
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,040
But

191
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,520
How do you expect me to believe

192
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,000
that you're really Yueguang?

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,040
Where's your watch?

194
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,520
My watch is here

195
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,080
This is my watch

196
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,880
But didn't we have a pair?

197
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,680
You gave it to that fake Fang Xiaomei.

198
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,120
The Real and Fake Sun Wukong

199
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,680
The one wearing the watch is the real one (Fang Xiaomei)

200
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,160
What do you mean?

201
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,280
If we don't find her

202
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,880
The other one is Fang Xiaomei, right?

203
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,320
Yes.

204
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,360
She can do live streaming.

205
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,559
She can earn money.

206
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,480
What a mess.

207
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,760
Now there are no couple watches either.

208
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,200
How can you prove you're him?

209
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,720
Well...

210
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,240
Sing a song.

211
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,600
Does my voice sound familiar to you?

212
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,320
This is it.

213
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,760
Do you have this part?

214
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,560
Do you have this part?

215
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,240
Then do you know my favorite song?

216
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,160
Which song is it?

217
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Have you heard "A Beam of Light in the Dark"?

218
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,160
I've heard him sing it.

219
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,600
You are

220
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,600
Here we go again

221
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,880
You're a beam of light in the darkness

222
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,680
Illuminating my ashes-of-heart past

223
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,240
You taught me to brave through

224
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,520
Lent me your gentle shoulder

225
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,440
Those despairs that once crushed me

226
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,400
Will ultimately give me wings to soar

227
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,600
A beam of light in the darkness

228
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,080
I've touched the radiance too

229
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,960
Yes, I'm certain it's you

230
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,280
Shall we hug right now?

231
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,080
No need

232
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,800
Not necessary

233
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,760
Look how intense this is getting

234
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,240
I think we should

235
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,920
No

236
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,400
You haven't seen each other for so long

237
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,880
He hugged that woman this afternoon

238
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,720
And even put a watch on her

239
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,640
Showed her photos

240
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,800
There's this woman

241
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,920
Do you know her?

242
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,600
Who took this photo?

243
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,720
Who took this picture like this?

244
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,920
She looks so much like me.

245
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,120
No, listen to me

246
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,840
Right now, I

247
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,200
don’t necessarily believe what she said

248
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,560
I have one last question

249
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,840
Perhaps it's a question you need to go inside to answer

250
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,360
Do you have

251
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,040
proof that you've lived inside for seven days

252
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,720
without going out?

253
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,320
We'll take you inside right away

254
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Come on, let's go in then

255
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,640
Wait a second

256
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,480
What's wrong?

257
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,040
I feel really oppressed when I come to this room

258
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,640
You're not feeling well?

259
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Alright, let me explain

260
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,240
I think someone needs to stand by the door

261
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,760
I'll stand

262
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,680
First, he locked me in here

263
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,840
Then there was a combination lock

264
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,400
I used my hands to break this part

265
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,320
Then I could bring the lock inside

266
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,000
These are all...

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,320
These are all the combinations I tried

268
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,960
Why are these two numbers circled in red?

269
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,920
These were the combinations I tried on the first day

270
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,240
Because this was the last combination I figured out

271
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,960
When you came in...

272
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,880
The door was slightly open

273
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,760
That's because I had already opened the door

274
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,320
When I came home...

275
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,040
I saw a group of people sneaking around

276
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,960
Inside our house

277
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,640
Several people

278
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,520
That was us

279
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,560
I didn't dare look closely to see who it was

280
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,160
It was us, no doubt about it

281
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,280
It's just that...

282
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
It was also today, right?

283
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:31,960
Yes

284
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,000
You just cracked it today

285
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Then why did you come back?

286
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,600
I thought you were the ones who knocked me out

287
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,960
and brought me here

288
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,800
Then I thought...

289
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,560
The most dangerous place

290
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,520
is the safest place

291
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,280
So I hid back here

292
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,400
Pretending I never escaped

293
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,200
What's this combination box for?

294
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,360
Right, this box...

295
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,000
I've been studying it for many days here

296
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,800
I don't know what it is

297
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,600
This lock...

298
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,080
Are those many scratch marks?

299
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,480
I made those

300
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,560
I've been trying to open it all along

301
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,720
Your key...

302
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,920
can turn it open

303
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,720
I haven't seen these things either

304
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,880
Then why are you stopping us from seeing them?

305
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,320
Miss Jia Xiaomei

306
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,240
Jia Xiaomei

307
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,160
I'm Fang Xiaomei

308
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,080
Ms. Jia Xiaomei

309
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,480
Your contract with Meili Loan

310
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,560
has been overdue for many days

311
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,080
The amount due is one million

312
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,360
Why does my post-surgery appearance

313
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,880
look exactly like hers?

314
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,720
I just remembered

315
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,920
there might be a clue

316
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,120
which is

317
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,440
when I was at our doorstep

318
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,800
I found many plastic surgery flyers

319
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,400
then I followed the template

320
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,920
shown on those flyers for my surgery

321
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,800
My current appearance

322
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,240
You used their template?

323
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,920
Yes, because I noticed that template

324
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,560
seems to be the person in this photo

325
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,600
That was my reference

326
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,680
But this can sync with my phone

327
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,920
This is your handwriting

328
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,840
Did you write this?

329
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,600
This looks very similar to my handwriting

330
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,880
I can barely tell the difference myself

331
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,440
Whether this is actually my handwriting or not

332
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,200
The recipient is Fang Xiaomei

333
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,440
And the online shopping account

334
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,600
Fang Xiaomei

335
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,520
December 5th

336
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
WeChat account

337
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,320
All your accounts

338
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,080
How did she know?

339
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,040
I always use name plus birthday as passwords

340
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,680
The key point is why would you

341
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,000
have the same username and password

342
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,800
Can you believe this?

343
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,840
Anyway now Jia Xiaomei

344
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,040
has every motive to impersonate Fang Xiaomei

345
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,480
Jia Xiaomei definitely used to live here

346
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,400
Jia Xiaomei lives right here

347
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,120
Look

348
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,160
And look, this happens to be

349
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,600
May 5th

350
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,880
Exactly one week ago

351
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,720
Today is May 13th

352
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,320
One day before that week

353
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,840
See?

354
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,120
This product will no longer be manufactured

355
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,760
Last unit at a discount price for you

356
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,720
Last unit of what?

357
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,280
What kind of machine?

358
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,920
The main question is what is HMSM?

359
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,840
What exactly is this thing?

360
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,160
HMS

361
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,320
We definitely need to know what this product is

362
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,000
exactly

363
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,800
Because this thing is no longer available

364
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,040
The boss has disappeared

365
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,000
This product will not be produced again

366
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,520
Could it be something like a cosmetic device?

367
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,160
I think

368
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,840
No

369
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,440
Not a cosmetic device

370
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,080
Because back in March she already

371
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,680
On March 31st she already looked like this

372
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,440
She didn't need more procedures

373
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,600
Here's what I think, look

374
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,400
Jia Xiaomei

375
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,960
To escape this debt

376
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,240
she took out loans for plastic surgery

377
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
and now owes a million

378
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,800
Now the debt collectors are after her

379
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,880
They've already started pursuing her

380
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,200
Let's set aside her

381
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,280
Let's assume she's real first

382
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Assuming she's real

383
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,120
then it's possible Jia Xiaomei is living in

384
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,160
the ventilation ducts like a parasite

385
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,480
Then she locked her up here

386
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,520
and could take over her life

387
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,840
Who?

388
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,600
Why is the door locked?

389
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,160
Who are you?

390
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,480
Aren't you Fang Xiaomei?

391
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,160
Fang Xiaomei, you don't look well.

392
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,120
Let me take you to get checked.

393
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,640
Okay.

394
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,200
Alright.

395
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,880
Fine.

396
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,360
Let's go to the first floor.

397
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,920
Okay.

398
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
Alright, go rest for a while.

399
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,880
Soon we won't be able to tell them apart again.

400
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,240
Who's the real (Fang) Xiaomei and who's the fake (Jia) Xiaomei?

401
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,120
Alright

402
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,960
Let's take a look at this

403
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,640
Is there anything else in the room

404
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,120
we need to take?

405
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,640
I think we're good

406
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,240
Wait, my phone's ringing

407
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,800
Who's calling you?

408
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,840
Come meet me at the styling studio on the 5th floor

409
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,240
I need to talk to you

410
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,560
Mei Mei Planet

411
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,160
It's her

412
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,400
Not necessarily her

413
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,600
Let's go

414
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,200
To the 5th floor

415
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,360
The styling studio on the fifth floor

416
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,200
Have we been to the fifth floor?

417
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,640
No, we haven't.

418
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,200
Never been there.

419
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,320
We have her passcode.

420
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,160
Styling studio.

421
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,080
Try the keypad door.

422
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,320
What is it?

423
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,800
951205.

424
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,720
Unlocked.

425
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,080
We're in.

426
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,880
This seems similar to that person

427
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Isn't this the floor plan?

428
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,520
No, look

429
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,359
Isn't the person who messaged you to come here present?

430
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,640
We arrived first

431
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,040
Right?

432
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
It's written here

433
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,880
Hao the Cleaner

434
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,520
After cleaning

435
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,720
Remember to help me organize
the messy clothes

436
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,400
as well

437
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,119
I really appreciate your help

438
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,079
From now on, every weekend

439
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,960
help me clean once

440
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,480
You know the store's passcode

441
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,240
Fang Xiaomei

442
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,080
Meaning the password for this room

443
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,120
Hao the Cleaner has it

444
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,440
Yes

445
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,840
Who exactly messaged you

446
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,560
to come here?

447
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,920
Smart Fitting Room

448
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,600
When the customer enters the fitting room

449
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,200
and wears the data collection garment

450
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,480
stand before the mirror and complete designated movements

451
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,440
The system will scan the customer

452
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,640
On the mirror surface

453
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,920
the full-body image displayed

454
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,560
will be converted into body measurement data

455
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,600
After completing body measurement scanning

456
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,640
you may open the door and leave

457
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,360
The outer door is already locked

458
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
If we don't do that

459
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,760
we won't get out

460
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,680
We're already trapped

461
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,680
Never mind that, let's take things step by step

462
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,560
First, change your clothes

463
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,160
Don't hesitate, I'm telling you

464
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,440
Seriously, don't hesitate

465
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,480
Just get this done first

466
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
Then we'll know what to do next

467
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,000
Please enter the fitting room
corresponding to your height

468
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,880
Proceed to the designated fitting room

469
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,320
Trying on

470
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,920
Okay, go ahead

471
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,080
Fitting room occupant detected

472
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,400
Five

473
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,440
Four

474
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,480
Three

475
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,560
Two

476
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,000
One

477
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
Please complete the second specified action

478
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,080
Please hold

479
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,280
Five

480
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,320
Four

481
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,360
Three

482
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,440
Two

483
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:00,920
One

484
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,440
Please complete the third specified action

485
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,600
Please hold

486
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,800
Five

487
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,880
Four

488
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,920
Three

489
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,080
Two

490
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,560
One

491
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,880
Data collection completed

492
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,040
Data will be synced to computer shortly

493
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,720
So let's

494
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,920
What's the purpose of doing this?

495
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,880
Collected data has been synced to computer

496
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,000
Please check

497
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,800
This is No.1's

498
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,600
Why is mine different from yours?

499
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,880
Why is Liu Xialai's background black?

500
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,680
Let me take a look.

501
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,720
Let's go.

502
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,920
This is a door

503
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,000
The mirror can be pushed open, they...

504
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,800
This is the path

505
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,280
No way

506
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,720
Of course it's the road, bro.

507
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,680
Come, there's a secret passage here.

508
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,440
Come.

509
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,920
This is too "magical".

510
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,560
Unfinished apartment for rent.

511
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:51,960
Wait a moment.

512
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,560
Did you see anything?

513
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,960
This door can open, friends.

514
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,160
502.

515
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,360
Here.

516
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,520
Here.

517
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:02,800
Chase him.

518
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,160
Here.

519
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,520
Chase him.

520
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,000
Here.

521
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,720
So impressive.

522
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,200
Can't catch up.

523
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,440
His door is locked.

524
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,520
Hands, hands, move aside.

525
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,640
Brute force dismantling?

526
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,120
Let's give it a kick, okay?

527
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,040
Pull the door down

528
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,840
Come on, you guys do it

529
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,320
Big guy, come here

530
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,480
Push

531
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,120
Go

532
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,840
He went down.

533
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,240
He went down.

534
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,800
He went down.

535
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,440
He went down.

536
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,640
Who is it?

537
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,200
Who's there?

538
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,040
Bring him up.

539
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,240
What's your business?

540
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,160
I'm just an athlete.

541
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,040
An athlete?

542
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,720
Got him.

543
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,280
What's down there?

544
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
Xiao He.

545
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
Where are you?

546
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,160
We're on the fifth floor.

547
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,960
Fifth floor, got it.

548
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,320
Alright, I'll bring him up.

549
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,800
There's a human skin here.

550
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,000
A mask made of human skin.

551
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,880
This is my hairstyle.

552
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,720
What that person was wearing earlier...

553
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Is it the clothes we collected?

554
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,960
He was also wearing collected clothes.

555
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,280
There's also a bag on the window.

556
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,200
Bank card

557
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,320
Isn't this your bank card?

558
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,800
This is mine

559
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,000
This is my bank card

560
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,360
I know Song Huo

561
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,880
He entered my room

562
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,400
And took that five-million-yuan bank card

563
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,840
away

564
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,720
There's another phone here

565
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,680
Zhang's decoy phone

566
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,400
What does it say?

567
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Song Huo says

568
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,080
This kind of iris scanning device

569
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,680
can produce contact lenses

570
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,640
that can completely fool

571
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,120
the bank's facial recognition

572
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
This is the machine

573
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,000
The only one left in the world now

574
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,480
and I've already gotten hold of it

575
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,120
Are you going to cooperate with me or not?

576
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,360
I didn't say I wouldn't do it

577
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,200
It's just that I'll do it

578
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,720
This is the "killer" Song Huo hired

579
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,480
who's here to "kill" you

580
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,880
Because he obtained this bank card

581
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,840
But he needs my identity verification

582
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,200
to be able to withdraw this money

583
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,360
That's why they haven't withdrawn the money yet

584
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,520
They need your iris

585
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,720
This is your iris

586
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,280
Iris Theft Plan

587
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,080
Execute the plan on May 13th at 11:00

588
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,440
After Song Huo confirms Liu Xialai is home

589
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,960
Go to the abandoned restroom on 5th floor to wait for support

590
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,320
Log into Fang Xiaomei's account

591
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Send a message to Liu Xialai

592
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,280
Invite him to the styling studio

593
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Zhang the double will use the replaced dressing mirror

594
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,200
To collect Liu Xialai's iris data

595
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,000
Using the human skin mask and iris data

596
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,160
Withdraw money to get rich

597
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,600
His notebook also contains everyone's room passwords

598
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,960
When the iris scanner is inactive

599
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,600
It appears as a one-way mirror

600
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,760
After the collector activates the iris scanner

601
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
The one-way mirror becomes transparent glass

602
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,440
Collection time is three minutes

603
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,400
The subject must within three minutes

604
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,680
Maintain eye contact with the glass for five seconds

605
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,120
For successful collection

606
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,920
After three minutes

607
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,200
The glass reverts to one-way mirror state

608
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,320
Right after we entered that room

609
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,560
He locked the door

610
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,160
He told us

611
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,720
That after each person's collection was complete

612
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,960
The door could be opened

613
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,240
So he tricked us

614
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,280
Into changing into these clothes

615
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,520
And standing in front of the mirror

616
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,760
Then took this opportunity

617
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,600
To collect my iris, my eyes

618
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,960
Zhang the double replaced the dressing mirror

619
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,160
He was just wearing identical clothes

620
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,760
Imitating your movements

621
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,320
To get himself detected by the scanner

622
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,280
Three

623
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,440
Two

624
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,360
One

625
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,520
Please complete the first designated action

626
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,360
That photo wasn't of you

627
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,920
But of Zhang the double

628
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,480
And incidentally extracted your iris data

629
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:12,880
Right

630
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,640
Such high-tech

631
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,760
No, wait a second

632
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,440
This bag belongs to Zhang's double

633
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,040
No, this bag doesn't belong to Zhang's double

634
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,520
It's Song's goods

635
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,120
Isn't this notebook Song's goods?

636
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,160
Isn't this home delivery?

637
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,440
The phone belongs to Zhang Tishen

638
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,400
It's Zhang Tishen's

639
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,560
Zhang Tishen "killed"

640
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,360
Song Huo's

641
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,200
bag

642
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,680
Song Huo's men

643
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,200
Because he refused to share that 10%

644
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,080
He wanted to take it all

645
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,440
Zhang Tishen "killed" Song Huo

646
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,120
Where are you?

647
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,680
Here.

648
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,200
We brought him.

649
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,640
Who's this?

650
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,400
Xiao He is here.

651
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,880
Come here.

652
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,320
Zhang the stand-in, right?

653
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Hello, Zhang the stand-in.

654
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,880
His shoes.

655
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,560
Give me the shoes.

656
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,000
These shoes of yours...

657
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,280
Why such tall lifts inside?

658
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,160
He's got very high lifts in here.

659
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,360
Elevator insoles, right?

660
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,920
To reach over 189cm?

661
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,360
I wouldn't believe it even if you wore them.

662
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,880
You're about my height.

663
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,560
Don't doubt my abilities.

664
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,800
I'm a stunt double.

665
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,240
So you're Zhang the stand-in, correct?

666
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,000
That's right.

667
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,720
Ever "killed" anyone?

668
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,280
Never "killed" anyone.

669
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,040
This is Song Huo's notebook.

670
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,760
Where's Song Huo?

671
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,920
I'd like to know where Song Huo is too.

672
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,880
Haven't seen him all day.

673
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,840
Where'd you get this notebook?

674
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,920
Not telling.

675
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,680
You couldn't find Song Huo?

676
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,400
Yes.

677
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,600
Before 11 AM this morning,

678
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,320
I arrived here.

679
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,880
I waited for him

680
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,840
at the styling studio.

681
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,000
But he never showed up.

682
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,640
I don’t know why.

683
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Maybe he chickened out.

684
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,200
Then I went looking for him.

685
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,120
I went to the usual place we go to—

686
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,480
that abandoned restroom.

687
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,400
Where is the abandoned restroom?

688
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,800
Which abandoned restroom?

689
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,960
You wanna know?

690
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,880
Yeah, we do.

691
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,800
Why should I tell you?

692
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,640
Hit him.

693
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:13,960
No!

694
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,840
Torture him for answers.

695
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,400
Trick him.

696
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,600
No hitting.

697
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,360
Ask properly.

698
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,320
No violence.

699
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,240
Do you know Xiaomei?

700
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,840
Xiaomei.

701
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,240
Fang Xiaomei.

702
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,560
Fang Xiaomei.

703
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,960
Song Huo mentioned her once.

704
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,600
I don’t know her.

705
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
So have you been to her room?

706
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,320
Have you been to room 610 or not?

707
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,400
Yes, I have.

708
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,160
What did you go there for?

709
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,720
To find Song Huo.

710
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,520
You had an argument, didn't you?

711
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Just mentioning Song Huo makes me angry.

712
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,960
Why are you so angry?

713
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,880
Speak.

714
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,640
There was five million in that card, right?

715
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,840
Yes.

716
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,600
At first he only gave me a thousand yuan.

717
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,120
Let's do it together

718
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,080
He offered me a thousand yuan

719
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,080
Who would agree to that?

720
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,760
There's no way I'd do it

721
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,560
Absolutely unacceptable

722
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,240
I said no

723
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,920
Then he said

724
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,080
Fine, I'll give you 10%

725
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,960
He'd take 450,000 (out of 500,000)

726
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,640
Right, who would accept that?

727
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,080
I definitely wasn't happy

728
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,000
Still not acceptable

729
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,320
Right, I said no

730
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
My wife also told me

731
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,200
Saying I've done so much

732
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Why should I only get 10%?

733
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,880
Right, unacceptable

734
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,240
Exactly

735
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,080
Why treat me like a fool?

736
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,720
I was furious

737
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,360
Really angry

738
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,920
So I went to confront him

739
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,440
I said at least 30-70 split

740
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,400
30 for me, 70 for you

741
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,720
He said impossible

742
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,240
Still refused

743
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,520
I asked why

744
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,560
He said if not for his big head

745
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,800
Couldn't fit the mask

746
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,920
I wouldn't even be involved

747
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,120
He said others would take the deal

748
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,720
Take it or leave it

749
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,280
I was extremely angry

750
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,960
His big head

751
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
And he had the nerve

752
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,200
So then

753
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,560
If he's ruthless, don't blame me for being worse

754
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,840
My plan was

755
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,720
First play along with him

756
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,560
Accept his 10% offer

757
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,000
Follow his lead

758
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,440
After the job was done

759
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,920
Once I got his iris data

760
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,520
After collecting it

761
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,840
As soon as I withdrew the money

762
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,360
I would

763
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,400
Double-cross him

764
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,640
But today he didn't show up

765
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,560
So I don't know where he went

766
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,680
Then let me ask you one more question

767
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,120
Do you know Hao Baojie?

768
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,320
As far as I know

769
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,600
I know nothing about this

770
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,800
So

771
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,480
Come find me at the 5th floor styling studio

772
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,240
You sent this message

773
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,880
Yes, because Song Huo wasn't there

774
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,320
I just saw his computer

775
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:13,840
I'll send it to you

776
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,000
Because I thought his absence was perfect

777
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,880
This money is all mine

778
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,080
Where's the computer?

779
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,640
Let's go check

780
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,800
Abandoned restroom

781
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,520
Where's the abandoned restroom?

782
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,760
It's near the styling studio

783
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Inside that hole over there

784
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,680
I got it

785
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,480
Let's go

786
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,000
So unlucky

787
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,320
I even used special skills

788
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,760
Still got caught

789
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,800
Special skills weren't enough

790
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Using this human skin disguise

791
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,000
Is also illegal

792
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,360
New location

793
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,680
There's a light here

794
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,560
Right, there's a light

795
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,520
There's that

796
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,400
There's cardboard

797
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,600
Blocked by cardboard, right

798
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,760
Spiderwebs

799
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,840
This is an abandoned restroom, right?

800
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,600
That must be it

801
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,200
There's a wrench here

802
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,400
Seems to be one of their tools for the crime

803
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,680
That must be useful, right?

804
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,000
His computer

805
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,440
Fake Fang Xiaomei

806
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,760
May 9th

807
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,840
Don't think I don't know

808
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,040
About your robbery and "murder"

809
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,640
I also know

810
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,760
That you're the one who stole my things

811
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,840
Give my things back to me

812
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,720
You little liar, stop pretending

813
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,760
Do you really think no one knows

814
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,000
About your dirty little secrets?

815
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,480
You took advantage of Fang Xiaomei looking like you with filters

816
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
After applying those filters

817
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,280
To trick Fang Xiaomei

818
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,640
Into getting plastic surgery to look like you

819
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,840
The moment she left

820
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,880
You took over her place

821
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,120
You locked her in that storage room for rent

822
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,480
I think you wanted to replace her

823
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,760
If you dare expose my secret

824
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,600
I'll make you disappear from this world

825
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,280
It seems what that Xiaomei said earlier

826
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,640
was true

827
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,280
It's just that after learning the truth

828
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,080
I understand

829
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,720
Do you know what Song Huo

830
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,200
stole from her?

831
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,680
He stole her account

832
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,840
No, the account belongs to the real Fang Xiaomei

833
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,240
The last remaining one in the world

834
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,280
has already been obtained by me

835
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,680
This product won't be manufactured again

836
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,360
Only this one exists

837
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,120
I'll give it to you at a low price

838
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,360
Is the machine

839
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,880
that iris scanning machine?

840
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,760
Possibly

841
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,280
The iris machine

842
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,520
was bought by the fake Fang Xiaomei

843
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:39,840
Right

844
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,880
But then he took it

845
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,520
But why would the fake Fang Xiaomei

846
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,200
buy an iris machine?

847
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,480
She wanted to replace the real Fang Xiaomei

848
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,040
Replace the real Fang Xiaomei

849
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,880
Originally she probably didn't intend to collect yours

850
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,440
She likely wanted to collect the real Fang Xiaomei's

851
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,000
Yes

852
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,440
Why collect hers?

853
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,680
Because she was short on money

854
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,600
She wanted to use the real Fang Xiaomei's money

855
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,720
to repay loans

856
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
Yes, using the real Fang Xiaomei's money

857
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,480
to repay her own loans

858
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,920
Jia Xiaomei owes one million.

859
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,200
I think we should gather all the evidence.

860
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,360
I think we should leave this room.

861
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:21,640
Okay.

862
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,120
Let's go.

863
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,640
Let me start by saying

864
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,560
Real (Fang) Xiaomei and Fake Xiaomei

865
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,000
Alright

866
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,760
Fake Xiaomei wanted to use this iris scan

867
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,880
to become Real (Fang) Xiaomei

868
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,000
and deceive her

869
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,520
At this moment, Song Huo

870
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,160
saw what was happening

871
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,520
and quickly snatched it away

872
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,840
Fake Xiaomei got anxious

873
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,040
saying "Don't cut off my income source"

874
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,960
"I need this"

875
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,600
"to scam Real (Fang) Xiaomei's money"

876
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,000
Song Huo replied "Don't cut off my income source either"

877
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,480
"I want to use this to deceive (Liu)"

878
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,080
And her final words were

879
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,520
"If you dare expose my secret"

880
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,360
"I'll make you disappear from this world"

881
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:54,960
Right

882
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,800
Because this thing can only be used once

883
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,080
Yes

884
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,800
The iris can only be used once

885
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,000
The iris can only be used once with that machine

886
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,160
This clearly shows

887
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,600
Fake Xiaomei's intention to "kill" Song Huo

888
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,200
Her murder motive

889
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,160
The ones with the strongest motives now

890
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,320
are Jia Xiaomei and Zhang Stand-in

891
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,320
But I don't think Zhang Stand-in is suspicious

892
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,360
Zhang Stand-in is an idiot

893
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:14,800
No

894
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,600
Zhang Stand-in is actually

895
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,360
genuinely a fool

896
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,640
someone who gets used as a pawn

897
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,440
just a tool

898
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,040
Song Huo is also quite suspicious

899
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,800
After confirming Liu Xialai was home

900
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,400
he was supposed to go to the abandoned 5th floor restroom

901
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,520
to wait for contact

902
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,480
But he didn't go to the 5th floor's

903
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,200
abandoned restroom

904
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,440
Right, he went to the electrical room instead

905
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,520
He went to the abandoned electrical room

906
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,120
Electrical room

907
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,760
Electrical room

908
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,960
And he brought a small doll with him

909
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,600
"Don't approach the abandoned electrical room"

910
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,400
"Disobey and you'll 'die'"

911
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,720
But he still disobeyed

912
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,760
Didn't come to the agreed place

913
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,280
Instead went to the electrical room

914
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,840
Because the one who wanted to "kill" him

915
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,640
was Jia Xiaomei

916
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
That's my feeling

917
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,080
But how could Jia Xiaomei make him

918
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,840
not go to the appointment at 11

919
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,960
but go to the 6th floor instead?

920
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,640
The abandoned restroom and abandoned electrical room

921
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,440
The electrical room is

922
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,120
on different floors

923
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
Is it possible that

924
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,320
when he took the elevator

925
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
the elevator buttons

926
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,400
had numbers pasted on them

927
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,440
so he pressed the wrong floor?

928
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,040
Like the lights were off

929
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,480
So

930
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:19,960
And then

931
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,760
he couldn't tell if it was the 5th or 6th floor

932
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,440
Wrong floor

933
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,639
Wrong floor

934
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,920
Abandoned restroom and abandoned electrical room

935
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,560
The electrical room is

936
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,440
for moving between floors

937
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,520
Why are there so many packages here?

938
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,600
This looks like that one (Hao the cleaner's place)

939
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,040
501 and 601

940
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,520
The apartment layouts are identical

941
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,680
There's this cardboard piece

942
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,480
Spiderweb

943
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,000
Box

944
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,400
I understand now.

945
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,200
Someone found out about

946
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,880
Song Huo and Zhang the double's plan.

947
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,440
So when he knew it was time

948
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,680
for Song Huo to go to the meeting,

949
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,080
he cut the power.

950
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,960
At this moment,

951
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:00,960
this location

952
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,160
has the same layout as the top floor.

953
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,600
The positions of the two rooms are identical.

954
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,280
The darkness made him confused

955
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,920
mistaking the sixth floor for the fifth

956
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,680
Then after entering

957
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,320
he was electrocuted "to death"

958
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,840
Seems like we might have come to the wrong place

959
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,280
This room on the sixth floor

960
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,240
is Hao Baojie's place

961
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,800
This is my home

962
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,120
Your brother

963
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,720
Your brother

964
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,360
The entrance to this

965
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,080
can only be accessed through Hao Baojie's room

966
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,440
Right?

967
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,320
Then I think

968
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,160
it really is connected to Hao Baojie

969
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,480
there must be some connection

970
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,560
Definitely connected

971
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,160
Your brother

972
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,760
Let's go up and take another look.

973
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,080
Okay.

974
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,520
Let's go.

975
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,360
No

976
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,440
Look

977
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,920
All six floors are labeled

978
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,400
He doesn't know which floor this is

979
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,640
This should be a six

980
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,360
Right?

981
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,560
He doesn't know which floor this is

982
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
There's a problem

983
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,440
The codes for 501 and 601 are different

984
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,360
Check the door

985
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,680
The janitor's door

986
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
Hao the janitor's code is 940721

987
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,920
Try it

988
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,360
Unlocked

989
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,120
Correct

990
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,440
But Xiaomei's studio is

991
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,320
951205

992
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,120
Locked

993
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Unlocked

994
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,280
Two codes

995
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,680
Both codes can open it

996
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,400
So he has two codes

997
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
Trash can

998
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,880
This is what he brought up, right?

999
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,320
Yes.

1000
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,760
There's something inside this.

1001
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,560
There's something in here.

1002
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,280
It must contain evidence of his crime.

1003
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,840
For purchases, please call.

1004
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,160
Look at this symbol.

1005
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,600
The one used to threaten us.

1006
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,440
Yes, the paperclip.

1007
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,400
You will all...

1008
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,560
"die."

1009
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,440
Keep it.

1010
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,000
This is...

1011
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,240
For purchases, please call.

1012
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,080
It was clipped in the notebook.

1013
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,880
He replaced the elevator buttons.

1014
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:48,800
Right.

1015
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,120
The 7th floor button.

1016
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,920
And the 2nd floor.

1017
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,640
He swapped the buttons.

1018
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,480
Glue.

1019
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,760
40-minute strong adhesive.

1020
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,800
Short-term super strength glue.

1021
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,920
The jack of all glues.

1022
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,360
Can bond extremely heavy objects.

1023
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,680
Dissolves after 40 minutes.

1024
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,200
But before he entered

1025
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,280
he had already replaced the button

1026
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,800
Right

1027
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,520
The elevator

1028
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,680
Hao the cleaner

1029
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,720
The evidence is irrefutable

1030
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,040
Wait a second

1031
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,600
No

1032
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,040
Look

1033
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,440
This

1034
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,520
Doesn't seem to be green

1035
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,400
This is different

1036
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,400
This wall is different

1037
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,160
Right

1038
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,560
Yeah

1039
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,600
It's just the color that's different

1040
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,560
Only this wall is different

1041
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,720
He clearly took the wrong path

1042
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,440
Is there any way to make him

1043
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,200
willingly stay here

1044
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,560
Right

1045
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,680
He still thinks this is downstairs

1046
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,000
Right

1047
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,160
Why?

1048
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,120
Even if the colors are different

1049
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,480
He still made a mistake

1050
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,840
Would Song Huo make such a mistake?

1051
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,000
He cut off the power on the 6th floor

1052
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,240
The lights were off on the 6th floor

1053
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,960
He couldn't see the wall color clearly

1054
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,720
Xiaomei proved

1055
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,800
That before 11 pm

1056
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,080
The power in the room was always on

1057
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,360
Because her livestream never stopped

1058
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,760
Right

1059
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,800
The room was lit

1060
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,960
Yes, the room was lit

1061
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,000
He wouldn't go to the wrong place

1062
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,640
I've got it

1063
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,200
Song Huo

1064
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,200
is colorblind

1065
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,800
No, I just said that

1066
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,720
Because Song Huo is colorblind

1067
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,480
You're truly the Qiao family's finest

1068
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
Get out, all of you out

1069
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,920
Don't interfere with us

1070
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,280
This is driving me crazy

1071
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,240
Xiao He

1072
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,960
Ask him

1073
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,600
Xiao He

1074
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,160
Are you there?

1075
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,880
I'm here

1076
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,320
At 11 AM

1077
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,720
At 11 AM

1078
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,480
When the 6th floor corridor lost power

1079
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,200
When the 6th floor corridor lost power

1080
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,000
Do you know where cleaner Hao was at that time?

1081
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,920
Cleaner Hao's work schedule

1082
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,320
Is posted in the elevator

1083
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,760
Maybe you should check again

1084
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,320
Let's go

1085
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,400
First, let's check the cleaner's working hours

1086
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,600
From 8 to 11 o'clock

1087
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,760
At Apartment 11

1088
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,800
Common areas

1089
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,680
There's only one

1090
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,480
What's inside here?

1091
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
Many magicians

1092
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,120
use colorful flash paper

1093
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,840
Flash paper ignites instantly

1094
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,880
The performance is spectacular and magical

1095
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,840
But don't try to imitate it

1096
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,920
Flash paper burns quickly without smoke or residue

1097
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,240
It's the same paper magicians use for tricks

1098
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,520
Only this wall is different

1099
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,560
Just the color is different

1100
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,440
So that green color

1101
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,520
Who has flash paper in their room?

1102
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,640
Many magicians

1103
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,880
use colorful flash paper

1104
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,080
Flash paper burns quickly without smoke or residue

1105
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,200
But this doesn't burn fast

1106
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,640
It's yellow powder

1107
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,840
Highly flammable material

1108
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,640
Must be stored in oxygen-proof containers

1109
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,400
Self-ignites after three minutes of air exposure

1110
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,040
Is there green in this?

1111
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,800
Must be stored in oxygen-proof containers

1112
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,640
Self-ignites after three minutes of air exposure

1113
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,080
Airtight storage

1114
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,840
It's that

1115
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,400
The one above

1116
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:54,920
This one

1117
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,760
Green paper

1118
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:58,840
Burns slowly

1119
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:01,680
Actually

1120
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,040
It's just covered with a layer

1121
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,800
Completely covered

1122
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,840
Completely covered with green paper

1123
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,840
After he entered

1124
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,720
Didn't notice anything and left

1125
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,040
After three minutes passed

1126
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,440
The yellow powder emerged

1127
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,840
Whoosh - everything burned up

1128
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,240
Completely burned away

1129
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:11,720
Good

1130
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,680
So who placed this flash paper?

1131
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,320
Anyway, we've confirmed it now

1132
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,200
We know the method

1133
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,840
The method is definitely correct

1134
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,640
Who could have set this up?

1135
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,400
I have to avenge my brother.

1136
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,280
Song Huo is "dead."

1137
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,280
Then he deserved it.

1138
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,120
He should have "died."

1139
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,920
The only one who fits all these conditions

1140
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,760
I think is Hao Baojie.

1141
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,680
If it's Hao Baojie,

1142
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,840
why would he leave the evidence

1143
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,920
in his own room?

1144
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,240
It might not be him.

1145
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,800
He might have just picked it up casually.

1146
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,960
Let's gather all the clues

1147
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,600
and go have a talk.

1148
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,920
Can we team up today

1149
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,560
Unite

1150
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,040
Stand together against a common enemy

1151
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,360
Right?

1152
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,280
I think it's very possible

1153
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,600
You dictate and I'll write, okay?

1154
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,000
Okay

1155
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,360
Today's case is about

1156
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,680
"The deceased"

1157
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,480
Song Huo

1158
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,000
"died" in the abandoned power distribution room

1159
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,680
Suspects:

1160
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,720
How many suspects total?

1161
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,640
Let's aim high

1162
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,600
Let's say five

1163
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,240
Including me, five

1164
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,400
Who are the suspects?

1165
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,640
Hao Baojie

1166
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,440
Hao Baojie

1167
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:29,680
Okay

1168
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,080
Hao Bao(jie)

1169
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,400
Then Zhen(Fang) and Jia(Jia) Xiaomei

1170
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,120
That's two people

1171
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,320
Zhen(Fang) Xiaomei

1172
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:34,960
Jia(Jia) Xiaomei

1173
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,400
Okay

1174
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,360
Fourth is (Zhang) the stand-in

1175
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,320
Zhang the stand-in

1176
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,160
Zhang Ti(shen)

1177
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,520
Your suspicion is the lowest

1178
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,800
So put you in fifth position

1179
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,840
Agreed

1180
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,000
Then Liu Xialai

1181
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,560
Old Liu

1182
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,040
Liu

1183
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:56,960
They want to commit the crime

1184
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,680
The essential conditions required

1185
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,800
First, they need to know

1186
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,360
The arrangement between Song Huo and Zhang's double

1187
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,680
Know their criminal plan

1188
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,000
Right

1189
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,800
What else is needed?

1190
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,240
They need to know the passwords

1191
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,680
Know the costume room

1192
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,560
And Hao the cleaner's family password

1193
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,320
And Hao the cleaner's family password

1194
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,120
Know the 5th and 6th floor passwords, right?

1195
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:14,480
Correct

1196
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,760
And they must know the secret passage

1197
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,040
Also know about the old toilet

1198
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,000
Layout

1199
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,240
Isn't that right?

1200
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:19,800
Layout

1201
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,120
Meaning they're familiar with the building, right?

1202
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,040
Yes

1203
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,400
What else?

1204
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,000
Also need to be able to pull the switch on the first floor

1205
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,520
Also need to be able to pull the switch on the first floor

1206
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:24,920
Right

1207
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,040
Between 10:30 and 11:00

1208
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,840
They can pull the switch

1209
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,320
Yes

1210
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,280
Why between 10:30 and 11:00?

1211
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,640
They must pull the switch

1212
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,800
At 10:30 he called us to his room

1213
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,040
There was no power outage then

1214
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,400
So between 10:30 and 11:00

1215
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,400
Which was during his "death"

1216
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,720
And when we reached Old Liu's room

1217
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,720
He was already in the room

1218
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,760
I was in the room

1219
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,320
Right

1220
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,520
So it's impossible that

1221
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,600
We came out

1222
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,440
And he pulled the switch downstairs

1223
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,240
Okay, cross out number five

1224
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,080
Alright, Old Liu is cleared

1225
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,720
How come it's so simple?

1226
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,440
Just like that your suspicion is cleared

1227
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,120
Just erase it directly

1228
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:55,720
Just erase it

1229
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,000
Okay

1230
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:57,760
Which one else

1231
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,600
Does the fire paper count as my turn

1232
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,000
Meaning he must set it up properly

1233
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,040
And ensure it's not destroyed

1234
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,160
Fire paper

1235
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,560
Like elevator buttons

1236
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,200
I think pasting (fire paper)

1237
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:07,640
I believe these

1238
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,360
Can all be preset

1239
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,600
These are all public

1240
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,480
No need to know specifics

1241
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,240
Can still be arranged

1242
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,240
Right

1243
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,320
Anyone can do this

1244
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:14,640
No need to write it down

1245
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,720
I think these are roughly the three points

1246
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,920
It should be these three points

1247
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,440
Let's eliminate Zhang's double first

1248
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:21,840
We...

1249
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,080
Zhang's double knows the plan, right?

1250
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,240
Knows the plan

1251
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:25,760
You see

1252
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,880
The plan is like this

1253
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,520
I think

1254
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,160
Which part does he not need to do?

1255
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,400
Zhang's double said

1256
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,640
He wants to "kill" Song Huo

1257
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:32,920
Right

1258
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,160
But he wants to do it after Song Huo cooperates with him

1259
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,440
After getting you "killed"

1260
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,240
Then he'll "kill"

1261
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:38,520
Right

1262
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,920
Then double-cross him

1263
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,840
Before the deal even begins

1264
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,040
Because it's hard for him to arrange a meeting with you

1265
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,080
Right

1266
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,320
And he can't guarantee

1267
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,440
That he alone can get you "killed"

1268
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:47,880
Right

1269
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,600
This point actually convinces me a bit.

1270
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,560
I think he wouldn't be satisfied with this.

1271
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,200
structural condition of the fifth and sixth floors.

1272
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,280
Right.

1273
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,720
Zhang Ti (the stand-in) might know

1274
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,960
about this structure on the fifth floor,

1275
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,080
but he might not know

1276
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,240
about this structure on the sixth floor.

1277
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,640
Because he doesn't live here.

1278
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,120
Right.

1279
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:08,720
Eliminated.

1280
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,360
Elim(inated).

1281
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,240
Cross him off.

1282
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,960
How could Fang Xiaomei possibly

1283
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,520
be listed as a suspect by us?

1284
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,320
Because she knows the password.

1285
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,120
She meets the conditions for pulling the switch.

1286
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,720
And she might know

1287
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,320
the layout of the fifth and sixth floors.

1288
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,920
She's lived here for many years.

1289
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,640
She lives on the sixth floor.

1290
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,040
And the fifth floor is her dressing room.

1291
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,320
Possibly.

1292
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:32,600
Right.

1293
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,360
What possible

1294
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,480
ways could Fang Xiaomei know

1295
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,520
about their plan?

1296
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,480
If Fang Xiaomei could know

1297
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,320
about this plan of theirs,

1298
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:43,880
I would...

1299
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,880
She couldn't possibly know.

1300
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,320
How could she know about this plan?

1301
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,120
Right.

1302
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,480
Shared tablet

1303
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,040
She was sharing Jia Xiaomei's

1304
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,240
Jia Xiaomei's phone

1305
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,280
That tablet only has this password

1306
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,200
Right, only this password

1307
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,120
Or where she went and what surveillance she saw

1308
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:01,680
Or maybe she

1309
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,880
She couldn't have seen the surveillance

1310
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,880
If she had seen the surveillance

1311
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,600
She would know someone was watching her

1312
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,280
Right

1313
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:06,840
She didn't see the surveillance

1314
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,920
And she didn't even know about this secret passage

1315
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,160
How could she not know about this passage?

1316
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,080
Because that passage

1317
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,800
Was where Jia Xiaomei stayed

1318
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,200
Right

1319
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,840
It was Jia Xiaomei who was watching her

1320
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,280
Right

1321
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:16,800
But the premise is

1322
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,080
She's lived here for a year already

1323
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:18,880
At least a year

1324
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,560
If she knew about this passage

1325
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,520
She probably wouldn't have been so easily

1326
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,280
Monitored by Jia Xiaomei

1327
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,440
Kept under surveillance

1328
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,120
Right

1329
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:29,920
I think

1330
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,960
The real Xiaomei didn't know

1331
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,040
About their "murder" plan

1332
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,400
Right, this "murder" plan

1333
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,240
She might have known

1334
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,120
About Jia Xiaomei's actions toward her

1335
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,280
But she probably didn't know

1336
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,320
About that "murder" plan

1337
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,360
Indeed

1338
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,320
Not that easy

1339
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,240
There's one more point I want to make.

1340
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,800
Why commit the crime today?

1341
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,920
Have you considered

1342
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,640
because today

1343
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,120
is the day when everything is supposed to happen?

1344
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,560
Right.

1345
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,320
Everyone scheduled it for May 13th.

1346
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,560
Yes, but why?

1347
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,720
Take Jia Xiaomei for example.

1348
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,000
Why would she act today?

1349
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,520
Because she knew about the plan.

1350
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,320
Because today

1351
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,000
Song Huo would use that retina

1352
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,280
to take my things.

1353
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,040
But that retina can only be used once.

1354
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,960
So she had to commit the crime today.

1355
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,320
Correct.

1356
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,280
She wanted to use hers

1357
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,920
to replace the real (Fang) Xiaomei's retina.

1358
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,280
Right?

1359
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,080
Yes.

1360
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,840
So she absolutely had to do it today.

1361
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,720
If she was the perpetrator,

1362
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,640
it had to be today.

1363
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,120
So based on these two points,

1364
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,960
in terms of motive,

1365
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,720
Jia Xiaomei actually

1366
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,920
had stronger motive to "kill" Song Huo than Hao Baojie.

1367
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,280
True.

1368
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,120
But in terms of means,

1369
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:30,880
Hao Baojie

1370
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,840
had better

1371
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,680
opportunity

1372
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,640
and capability

1373
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,280
than Jia Xiaomei.

1374
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,240
Now we're down to two suspects.

1375
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:36,960
I think we should eliminate the real (Fang) Xiaomei too.

1376
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,400
Let's rule out the real (Fang) Xiaomei.

1377
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,120
We'll exclude the real (Fang) Xiaomei first.

1378
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:40,680
Agreed?

1379
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,160
I think it's fake (Jia Xiaomei)

1380
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,200
You think it's Jia Xiaomei

1381
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,000
I think it's Jia Xiaomei

1382
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,560
Possibly

1383
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,880
Between 10:30 and 11:00

1384
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,920
She first went to pull the switch

1385
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,880
Then went upstairs

1386
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,800
And went back again

1387
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,360
Then came back

1388
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:01,560
She needed

1389
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,520
Between 10:30 and 11:00

1390
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,760
Pull the switch, change the elevator sign

1391
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,600
And the elevator sign

1392
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,040
Would fall off after forty minutes

1393
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,880
Right, the elevator sign lasts forty minutes

1394
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,800
Which means

1395
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,160
Before 10:50

1396
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,560
That needs to be

1397
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,520
Because at 10:50

1398
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,640
The goods we saw from Song

1399
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,600
Right

1400
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,920
So at 11:00

1401
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,160
When we pressed the elevator button

1402
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:23,680
It was already

1403
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,120
Fallen off

1404
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:24,800
Fallen off

1405
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,640
Already fallen off

1406
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,160
Already fallen

1407
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,560
So 11:00 minus forty

1408
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,480
Must have been posted at 10:20

1409
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,520
Posted at 10:21

1410
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,400
Went downstairs

1411
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,240
Pulled the switch

1412
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,000
Then went home

1413
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,160
Right

1414
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,800
Before 11:00

1415
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,840
She had to finish

1416
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,080
Setting up the fire paper

1417
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,240
All the arrangements

1418
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,200
Completely possible

1419
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,720
Because she knew the cleaner's schedule

1420
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,080
(Hao) The cleaner doesn't return until 12:00

1421
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,840
Right

1422
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,640
So the house was empty before then

1423
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,040
I think we're in agreement this time

1424
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,680
Right?

1425
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,640
Don't always go against the grain like this

1426
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,600
But anyway, the fake one (Jia Xiaomei) insists on doing this

1427
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,360
Also

1428
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,560
She wants to do it at the Hao's (the cleaner's) place

1429
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,120
Paste a whole wall of green paper

1430
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:08,600
Spirit money

1431
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,640
Spirit money

1432
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,560
And then deal with this powder

1433
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,280
It's quite troublesome

1434
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,680
So in the end,

1435
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,840
I think today's "murderer"

1436
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,120
the final "murderer"

1437
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,160
I believe is

1438
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,160
I vote for

1439
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,520
So I vote for

1440
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,720
I hope it's you

1441
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,120
With such intelligence, you could do anything

1442
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,320
Why choose to "kill" people?

1443
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,000
So difficult

1444
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,120
Is this "killing" people?

1445
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,880
It's "killing" my brain cells

1446
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,320
I didn't have many to begin with

1447
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,840
About us,

1448
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,720
the "Bai Song Yi Guo Zhou" team,

1449
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,280
even though our investigation has reached

1450
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,440
this point,

1451
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,800
but everyone is still

1452
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,640
doing great.

1453
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,440
Our vote should be

1454
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,920
pretty accurate,

1455
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,920
identifying the "killer," right?

1456
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,080
But this apartment is still so creepy.

1457
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:24,960
I don't dare stay here.

1458
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,400
When we moved in,

1459
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,120
where did that jumper go?

1460
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,240
Also,

1461
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,280
that crying woman's voice in Liu Xialai's house -

1462
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,400
who is it really?

1463
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,600
Are you hiding a woman at home

1464
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,440
and not telling us?

1465
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,680
I'm not keeping any secret lover.

1466
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,680
Don't believe me? Come search.

1467
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,200
If you find anyone, I'll admit defeat.

1468
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,520
Right, and I have another question:

1469
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,680
who put those death warning dolls

1470
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,080
around Song Huo?

1471
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,520
Also,

1472
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,520
why won't the Meow Meow doll hug me,

1473
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,640
only willing to hug

1474
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,240
Zhou Keke and Bai Sanwan?

1475
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,840
What's going on with that?

1476
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,760
Not to be pessimistic,

1477
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,120
but doesn't this seem like

1478
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,080
it might mean

1479
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,560
Bai Sanwan and Zhou Keke

1480
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,040
could be the next "victims"?

1481
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,480
Don't scare me!

1482
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,720
Don't be afraid.

1483
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,560
I'll walk you home.

1484
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,600
By the way, did you notice

1485
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,360
when Fang Xiaomei was locked in the storage room,

1486
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,440
she started trying passwords

1487
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,000
from 14201?

1488
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,280
Speaking of strange,

1489
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,320
Zhou Keke's

1490
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,400
talking doll, what was it called?

1491
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,880
Zhou Biaobiao.

1492
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,160
That's even weirder, right?

1493
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,480
Stop thinking about it.

1494
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,560
Go get your beauty sleep.

1495
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,360
I'm tired.

1496
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,400
The most intense

1497
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,360
The moment of truth revealed

1498
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,960
The most thrilling moment

1499
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,080

00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,680
Deduction real power

1520
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,440
Now entering Zhen Tea Zhen Fruit's

1521
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,640
Truth moment

1522
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,080
Take a sip of the delicious

1523
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,760
Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring

1524
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,200
Let's reveal the truth

1525
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,280
Cheers

1526
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,000
Congratulations to all players

1527
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,880
for successfully completing this deduction

1528
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,600
The congratulations are just for our completion

1529
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,360
You shouldn't be too happy

1530
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,720
This time, only he needs to escape

1531
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,760
Hard to say

1532
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,640
If he escapes this time

1533
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,360
I think he deserves five golden keys

1534
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,760
Old Liu is too impressive

1535
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,880
No

1536
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,320
In this week's story

1537
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,760
The suspects are:

1538
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,040
Jia Xiaomei

1539
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,560
Hao Baojie

1540
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,760
Liu Xialai

1541
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,640
Fang Xiaomei

1542
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,200
and Zhang Tishen

1543
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,680
After voting

1544
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,880
only one person received votes

1545
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,560
Either we all win or we all lose

1546
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,200
Everyone leaves

1547
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:08,600
Come on

1548
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,360
Tell us

1549
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,600
Next, we will reveal

1550
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,720
the story of Week 2

1551
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,160
"The Mysterious Tenant"

1552
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:15,480
The one who received

1553
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,440
six votes is

1554
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,640
Jia Xiaomei

1555
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,240
In the Week 2 story

1556
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,760
"The Mysterious Tenant"

1557
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,320
the true "culprit"

1558
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,680
who could it be?

1559
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,600
The real "culprit" is

1560
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,680
Jia Xiaomei

1561
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,280
Don't you dare shake it

1562
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,360
Just like what I said

1563
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,120
What everyone missed

1564
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,400
The decisive evidence

1565
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:03,800
Missed it again

1566
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,840
Can we have one episode where we don't miss it?

1567
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,480
In Hao Baojie's

1568
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,360
surveillance footage,

1569
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,400
there was a recording of

1570
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,040
Jia Xiaomei

1571
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,320
Footage from home

1572
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,560
In the video from May 10th

1573
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,400
we can see

1574
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,320
a white decorative item with

1575
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,000
burn marks on it

1576
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,280
This proves that on May 10th

1577
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,280
at this specific time

1578
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,600
Jia Xiaomei who was living in

1579
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,400
Xiaomei's house

1580
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,920
had previously been in her own home

1581
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,040
Conducted experiments with fire-resistant materials

1582
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,160
In today's real (Fang) Xiaomei's home

1583
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,800
This white ornament has disappeared

1584
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,120
Because Jia Xiaomei discovered

1585
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,520
the charred marks and then threw it away

1586
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,640
What?

1587
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,560
I think this

1588
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,560
also serves as a reminder for us

1589
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,200
When reviewing surveillance footage in the future

1590
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,800
we should adopt a fault-finding mindset

1591
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,480
That is to say,

1592
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,000
No, it's us—

1593
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,760
when we're at the scene,

1594
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,560
we need to spot these things first.

1595
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,600
Remember,

1596
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,000
remember:

1597
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,480
The smaller

1598
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,480
the more likely they are

1599
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,080
to tamper with things.

1600
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,360
It seems our investigative skills

1601
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,080
have leveled up again.

1602
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,960
Right?

1603
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,840
We only upgraded superficially

1604
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,400
as if

1605
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,040
we've upgraded

1606
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,920
In this case

1607
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,040
The "murderer" Jia Xiaomei

1608
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,160
was being pursued for massive debts

1609
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,920
and hid in the storage room

1610
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,400
of apartment #11 in Tuishi City

1611
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,600
During this time

1612
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,240
Jia Xiaomei saw the livestream

1613
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,760
of apartment 610 resident Fang Xiaomei

1614
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,440
and noticed the filtered Fang Xiaomei

1615
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,080
looked remarkably like herself

1616
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,960
Through Fang's livestreams

1617
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,080
she learned that

1618
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,680
Fang was orphaned

1619
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,160
with simple social connections

1620
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,120
This sparked the idea

1621
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,040
to replace Fang Xiaomei

1622
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,320
Jia discovered the abandoned vents on 6th floor

1623
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,720
could spy into Fang's apartment

1624
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,040
She frequently hid there

1625
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,560
observing Fang's daily life

1626
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,760
and learned all about Fang

1627
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,760
Then she gave Fang

1628
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,600
a plastic surgery ad

1629
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,480
using her own face as template

1630
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,680
While Fang was getting surgery

1631
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,360
Jia lived in Fang's apartment

1632
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,440
May 3rd

1633
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,000
When Fang returned post-surgery

1634
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,120
she discovered Cao Yueguang

1635
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,760
"murdered" by Song Huo

1636
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,640
After completely replacing

1637
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,200
Fang's identity documents

1638
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,440
on May 6th

1639
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,200
Jia knocked Fang unconscious

1640
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,720
and locked her in the storage room

1641
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,720
Intending to use an iris scanner

1642
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,440
to fully replace Fang's identity

1643
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,360
she discovered when preparing

1644
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,160
the scanner had been stolen

1645
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,600
May 7th

1646
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,160
Jia Xiaomei overhears

1647
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,080
the apartment deliveryman Song Huo and another person talking

1648
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,560
about how they stole her iris scanner

1649
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,400
and plan to steal others' irises

1650
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,120
She also discovers her true identity

1651
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,640
has already been exposed to Song Huo

1652
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,160
As long as Song Huo is around

1653
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,440
her identity could be revealed

1654
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,480
Jia Xiaomei overheard

1655
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,880
that Song Huo would enter at 11:00 on May 13th

1656
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,880
through the fifth floor's

1657
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,360
styling studio's ventilation shaft

1658
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,640
to access the abandoned passage

1659
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,720
leading to the abandoned restroom

1660
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,320
But Jia Xiaomei knew

1661
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,720
the sixth floor had identical layout to the fifth

1662
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,000
The cleaner's apartment above the styling studio

1663
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,560
had identical decoration to the studio

1664
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:57,120
and also had a vent to the abandoned passage

1665
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,320
but it led to the abandoned electrical room

1666
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,640
So Jia Xiaomei planned to exploit

1667
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,480
the similar structures of both floors

1668
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,400
to confuse the floors

1669
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,720
and "electrocute" him

1670
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,160
On the day of the crime

1671
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,640
the cleaner left home at 8:00

1672
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,680
Jia Xiaomei entered the cleaner's apartment

1673
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,760
used fire paper to cover the walls

1674
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,520
making them match the studio walls'

1675
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,000
color scheme

1676
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,880
Then she programmed the apartment's keypad

1677
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,000
with the studio's access code

1678
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,320
Second step:

1679
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,440
Inside the cleaner's apartment door

1680
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,320
she set up a glass bottle device

1681
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,800
connecting the stopper with (elastic) fishing line

1682
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,280
to the door

1683
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,600
filled with slow-burn powder

1684
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,480
When Song Huo entered the apartment

1685
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,440
and the door closed

1686
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,080
it would pop the stopper

1687
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,800
releasing the powder

1688
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,000
After he entered the abandoned passage

1689
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,360
the powder would ignite the fire paper

1690
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,160
which burns rapidly

1691
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,600
revealing the foyer's original wall color

1692
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Step Three

1693
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,040
Jia Xiaomei puts on insulated gloves

1694
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,600
and removes half of the insulating rubber

1695
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,520
from both sides of the abandoned power room's door handles

1696
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,480
She then wraps a bare wire

1697
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,560
around the inner door handle

1698
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,760
and closes the door properly

1699
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,920
Using forty-minute strong adhesive

1700
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,520
she covers the bottom four buttons

1701
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,360
inside the elevator with square metal stickers

1702
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,400
(continuing from previous line)

1703
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,920
Then using identical elevator buttons

1704
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,000
and stickers, she modifies the original buttons

1705
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,280
to make the fifth-floor button

1706
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,560
actually go to the sixth floor

1707
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,960
After forty minutes

1708
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,360
these stickers will lose adhesion

1709
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,560
and fall into the trash bin below

1710
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,880
to be collected by cleaners

1711
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,520
Step Four

1712
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,160
Jia Xiaomei goes to the first-floor power room

1713
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,320
and manually switches off

1714
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,200
the circuit breaker for the sixth-floor hallway

1715
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,720
So when Song Huo exits the elevator on sixth floor

1716
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,280
he won't recognize it as the sixth floor

1717
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,040
Then she turns on the power in the abandoned sixth-floor power room

1718
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,040
After completing all this

1719
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,680
it's nearly 11 o'clock

1720
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,280
Jia Xiaomei immediately returns home

1721
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,880
to wait for Song Huo to enter the abandoned power room

1722
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:51,880
and get "electrocuted"

1723
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,800
I hope everyone

1724
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,320
in the future

1725
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,760
during the deduction process

1726
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,000
will continuously improve their investigative skills

1727
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,480
so that

1728
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,520
no piece of evidence is overlooked

1729
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:03,960
Next,

1730
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,320
the six players

1731
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,960
can proceed to the building behind

1732
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,560
to collect their golden keys

1733
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:13,640
Today we're

1734
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,080
unlocking which floor?

1735
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,200
Sixth floor, right?

1736
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:16,680
Sixth floor.

1737
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,720
The sixth floor is the main one.

1738
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:23,840
Thank you.

1739
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,160
Alright, no need to thank me.

1740
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,720
Thank yourselves.

1741
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,040
It's what you deserve.

1742
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:28,640
Teacher Bai.

1743
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,920
You're acting really strange today.

1744
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,520
What's so strange about it?

1745
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,320
Last week you said I was strange.

1746
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,640
This week you're still saying I'm strange.

1747
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,360
Let's see how you'll be next week.

1748
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,320
Fine, alright.

1749
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,000
Okay, come on, cheers.

1750
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,240
We find that today's story

1751
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:52,880
actually speaks about

1752
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,480
something quite close

1753
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,400
to our daily lives

1754
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:54,680
Of course

1755
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,000
Right

1756
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:55,680
So we've invited

1757
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,880
an old friend of ours

1758
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,240
specifically

1759
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,800
China University of Political Science and Law

1760
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,240
Professor of Criminal Psychology

1761
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,000
Professor Ma Ai

1762
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,600
to join us

1763
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,480
in reviewing this case

1764
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,160
Let's welcome

1765
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:03,720
Please welcome

1766
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,280
Let's welcome Professor Ma Ai

1767
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,080
Hello everyone

1768
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,200
Hello Professor Ma

1769
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,680
Thank you.

1770
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,480
Please, have a seat.

1771
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,280
Thank you, Professor Ma.

1772
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:12,960
Professor Ma Ai.

1773
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,640
So how should we

1774
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,120
protect

1775
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:15,800
our own

1776
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,680
privacy and security

1777
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,680
to prevent those

1778
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,760
with malicious intentions?

1779
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,840
Regarding this issue,

1780
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,000
we're currently

1781
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,200
continuously discussing

1782
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,920
whether it's the information society

1783
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,240
or this future

1784
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,400
intelligent society,

1785
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,640
this is an inevitable trend.

1786
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,280
So all we can do is maintain

1787
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,920
a basic sense of vigilance.

1788
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,960
You see, our approach is:

1789
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,440
At crucial moments,

1790
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,960
especially regarding financial matters,

1791
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,640
you must be extra cautious.

1792
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,000
Never disclose passwords,

1793
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,280
verification codes,

1794
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,160
or such information to

1795
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,480
potentially illegitimate

1796
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,960
online platforms,

1797
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,480
or even during phone calls.

1798
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,480
This...

1799
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,440
We can only

1800
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,760
hold no malice toward others,

1801
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,320
but remain wary of others' intentions.

1802
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:03,800
We need more

1803
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,360
self-reminders.

1804
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,800
Professor, I have another question.

1805
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,520
For example,

1806
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,040
something I think we all encounter:

1807
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,400
For those of us in this industry,

1808
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,040
if your

1809
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,920
flight information

1810
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,160
gets leaked,

1811
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:17,960
what legal consequences

1812
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,080
would those who sell

1813
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:19,840
this flight information

1814
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,040
face?

1815
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,040
What would be their legal standing?

1816
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:23,640
Because

1817
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,320
he leaked this information

1818
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,360
intentionally

1819
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:26,880
Right

1820
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,000
Sometimes he

1821
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,640
even if

1822
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,560
not for profit

1823
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,400
he still does it

1824
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,240
to satisfy his own

1825
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,560
so-called interests

1826
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,080
or needs

1827
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:36,640
Yes

1828
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,960
What you mentioned earlier

1829
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,440
because this situation

1830
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:40,840
might be

1831
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,840
relatively minor

1832
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,600
so it might

1833
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,120
constitute

1834
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,320
an infringement against you

1835
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,200
If it has caused you

1836
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,320
certain damages

1837
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,720
you can pursue

1838
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,080
civil litigation

1839
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:49,880
civil lawsuit

1840
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,240
I believe legally

1841
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,680
this should hold up

1842
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,840
Selling personal information

1843
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,920
for direct profit

1844
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,400
such cases

1845
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,800
He sold your personal information for profit.

1846
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,040
Correct.

1847
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,360
Then depending on the amount involved,

1848
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,800
you can go to the public security authorities

1849
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,280
to file a report.

1850
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,160
Submit your complaint.

1851
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:06,960
So Teacher Ma,

1852
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:07,360
why is it that

1853
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,640
there are so many online loans (in the story)

1854
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,560
like cosmetic surgery loans

1855
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,840
or student loans,

1856
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:12,880
there are actually many of them?

1857
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,160
Why

1858
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,200
has there been no way

1859
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:14,560
to

1860
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,280
shut them down?

1861
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,400
Online lending practices (in the story)

1862
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,960
are definitely illegal.

1863
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:21,920
First, they may involve usury.

1864
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,280
If their profit interest

1865
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,200
exceeds 24 percent,

1866
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,600
then it's considered illegal.

1867
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,520
It violates

1868
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,480
Article 680 of the Civil Code,

1869
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,800
which prohibits usurious lending.

1870
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,600
Then when collecting

1871
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,440
such usurious loans,

1872
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,720
it can easily constitute

1873
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,760
a (criminal law) offense.

1874
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,440
We specifically have the crime of collecting illegal debts,

1875
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,400
which is stipulated in Article 293 of the Criminal Law.

1876
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,360
as it prescribes.

1877
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,960
But I think recently

1878
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,560
regarding these P2P loan sharks

1879
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:56,440
have been greatly suppressed

1880
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,680
during the campaign against organized crime

1881
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,480
Right?

1882
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,760
Behind them

1883
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,520
there are often these criminal gangs

1884
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,920
acting as their protectors

1885
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,800
In this week's story,

1886
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,400
what every viewer should know is

1887
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,600
crimes utilizing

1888
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,880
personal information

1889
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,680
will become increasingly common.

1890
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,240
The reason is that

1891
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,280
in the past decade or so,

1892
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,680
with the advent of surveillance systems,

1893
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,120
traditional financial crimes

1894
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:21,720
like theft

1895
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,560
and robbery

1896
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,320
have virtually disappeared.

1897
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,480
Think about stealing something -

1898
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,760
your phone,

1899
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,720
which is your most

1900
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,160
valuable possession

1901
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,240
and practically glued to your hand,

1902
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,520
has become nearly impossible to steal.

1903
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,560
So what do criminals do?

1904
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:33,560
Criminals

1905
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,000
have begun

1906
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,520
using our personal information

1907
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,760
as their primary method

1908
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,800
to commit property crimes.

1909
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,640
Therefore,

1910
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,960
from this case we increasingly realize

1911
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,320
how crucial it is

1912
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,880
to protect personal information,

1913
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,520
even from those close to you.

1914
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,880
Safeguarding your sensitive data

1915
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,160
is particularly

1916
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,760
of utmost importance.

1917
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,720
If we all

1918
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,040
maintain this vigilance,

1919
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,000
then crime itself

1920
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,400
will naturally decrease.

1921
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,720
This is the key insight I've gained.

1922
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,360
You've explained it perfectly.

1923
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,440
Great, thank you Professor Ma.

1924
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,760
Analyzing today's story

1925
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,920
has given us valuable advice.

1926
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,040
Let's all thank Professor Ma.

1927
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,600
Thank you, Professor Ma.

1928
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,520
Looking forward to our next case review.

1929
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,400
Great, thank you.

1930
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:20,560
See you next week

1931
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,800
Next week then

1932
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,960
Goodbye

1933
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,400
Family

1934
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,440
I found in our apartment

1935
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,520
my dad who I haven't seen in eighteen years

1936
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,720
Dad

1937
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:32,800
Mom

1938
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,360
Son

1939
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,080
Grandpa

1940
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:34,760
Uncle

1941
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,320
Surprise

1942
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:35,920
This is my sister

1943
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,680
What kind of family is this

1944
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:38,920
What

1945
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,840
What was that sound just now

1946
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,760
Another doll again

1947
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,360
Someone is always reminding us

1948
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,800
It's foretelling "death"

1949
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,280
Why?

1950
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,840
Why so many whys?

1951
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,240
Don't panic, stay calm

1952
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:56,880
The butler is "dead"

1953
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,360
Did anyone have a grudge against the butler?

1954
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,960
That's an excellent question

1955
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,200
You should ask my wife

1956
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,280
Shameless

1957
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,800
Ready to ruin your reputation anytime

1958
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,800
He wants to replace me

1959
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,640
Aren't you afraid?

1960
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,400
Not bad

1961
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,840
This family has more than one secret

1962
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,040
More than one person wants him dead

1963
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:12,760
What?

1964
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,840
Guo Baoyou is an illegitimate child

1965
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,600
He's being targeted, right?

1966
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,280
Never would have expected

1967
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,320
You can know someone's face but not their heart

1968
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,520
Do you have any secrets you haven't told us?

1969
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,480
I don't have any secrets

1970
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,240
The evidence is irrefutable

1971
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,000
Stop pretending

1972
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,640
We've got motive

1973
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,440
And we've got method

1974
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,920
"Killer" - you

1975
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,320
You'll get us all "killed"

1976
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,360
You're the "murderer"

1977
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,400
No!

1978
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,720
But that... wait a minute

1979
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,480
Framing someone

1980
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,760
Don't be fooled by appearances

1981
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,440
Is it possible it's him?

1982
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,200
What did you see?

1983
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:39,960
Plotting for money

1984
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:40,680
Scheming for lives

1985
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:41,320
"Kill" him

1986
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,200
Yes

1987
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,160
