00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,440
invitation to "Let's Start Deduction"

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,120
Please answer the following questions

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,080
In the Deduction Building

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,400
there are ten mysterious cases set up

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,640
awaiting you to uncover the truth

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,280
Please predict

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,360
your own accuracy rate

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,840
Accuracy rate

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,200
I think

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,440
it should be above 90%

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,360
Because I've at least seen many

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,240
The procedures of all cases

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,080
are quite similar

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,360
percent

21
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,200
hundred

22
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,840
If you don't achieve 100%

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,320
If it doesn't reach 100%

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,760
I regret it

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,680
One should always leave some room for oneself

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,920
Don't speak in such absolute terms

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,520
60%

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,280
If during your deduction

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,840
you don't achieve

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,800
60% accuracy rate

31
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,200
you will

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
I can even eat three bowls of noodles in a row

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,000
It's either right or wrong

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,160
So the accuracy rate should be

35
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,600
Fifty percent

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,200
Fifty-fifty chance

37
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,320
Can we be more confident?

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,800
No

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,080
Not even fifty percent

40
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,320
If not

41
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,120
I'll do five push-ups

42
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,760
Okay?

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,800
If my teammates perform better

44
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,000
I think

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,600
Seventy to eighty percent should be achievable

46
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,760
If out of these ten cases

47
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,640
I can't solve six

48
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,560
I'll come back next season

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,040
I'll strive to solve six next season

50
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,680
The accuracy is fifty-fifty

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,440
If I'm wrong

52
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,000
It means

53
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,440
This case is unreasonable

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,479
I'm ready

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,600

56
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,000

"Let's Solve the Case"

60
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,880
So big

61
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,720
This dog is so big

62
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,520
Barley

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,160
Come

64
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,800
Go

65
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,200
Good

66
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,160
Come

67
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,240
Sit

68
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,440
Sit

69
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:20,880
Barley

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,960
Come, sit

71
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,560
Sit

72
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,280
Sit

73
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,560
Sit

74
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,280
Come

75
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,160
Go

76
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:36,840
Barley

77
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,280
Come

78
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,320
Sit

79
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,840
Good

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,520
I fell down by myself.

81
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,280
What a big one

82
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,000
What's your name?

83
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,120
What's it called?

84
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,480
Left hand

85
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,000
It's wet

86
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,320
Hello

87
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,800
I'm here

88
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,880
Dressed as Tang San today

89
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,920
How did you know?

90
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,640
I also watch some youth-oriented animations

91
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,960
What's your name?

92
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,120
I don't dare tell you

93
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll tell you later

94
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,960
You're so boring

95
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,960
What's your name, Teacher Zhou?

96
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,280
Won't tell you

97
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,680
What else can you do?

98
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,880
You're boring too

99
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,280
(The pendant) is so cute

100
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,800
Hello

101
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,840
You both have little babies with you

102
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,440
They're both on your chests

103
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,560
My good friend

104
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,640
It's called Zhou Biaobiao

105
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,520
That's right, I'm Zhou Biaobiao

106
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,080
I was made with Zhou Keke

107
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,680
in our first batch of chocolate together

108
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,600
Hello

109
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,640
Your dog

110
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,200
Yes

111
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,720
Right

112
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,640
What's its name?

113
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,680
It's called Barley

114
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,280
Shake hands

115
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,000
But its paw is dirty

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,880
Give it back

117
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,760
You're so good

118
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,440
Let's ignore them

119
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,000
Alright, take him down

120
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Jump down

121
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,760
I was actually in the first episode

122
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,480
The first one to "die"

123
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,440
Evidence found - "strangled" by a dog

124
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,280
Come here

125
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,360
Come over, don't get their clothes dirty

126
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,240
Look at that photo

127
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,800
I don't recognize anyone

128
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,480
Where's Teng Zhongjie?

129
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,000
No

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,200
This seems to be Li Xueqin

131
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,400
No, did you see this?

132
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,880
Look at this

133
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,480
This is too small

134
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,040
Look at this

135
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,040
Absolutely ridiculous

136
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,920
Xiao Guo

137
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,720
Is this person Li Xueqin?

138
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,000
It's Xueqin

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,480
This

140
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
It's Xueqin

141
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,040
Yan Hexiang

142
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,920
Zhou Jiuliang

143
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,560
You guys

144
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,840
These are all our colleagues

145
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,960
You're here

146
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,920
What are you two doing here?

147
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,280
Nothing

148
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,320
How come you just casually showed up?

149
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,160
Hello

150
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,600
Crawling forward

151
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,080
It's so hot and warm in here

152
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,760
I'm wearing a down jacket inside

153
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,760
Same, I'm wearing thermal underwear

154
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,720
Even thermal pants

155
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
I'm wearing thermal pants too

156
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,360
Really?

157
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,920
Really

158
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,360
What's this?

159
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,120
Chocolate

160
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,040
This is

161
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,320
Fake

162
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,480
No, I mean did you make this?

163
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,040
Just purely for cuteness

164
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,000
Purely for cuteness

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,400
So your profession is

166
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,800
My profession is

167
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,000
I run a handicraft store

168
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,760
I made all these myself

169
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,760
Look at my jump

170
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,600
I'll be here like this

171
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,240
I'll add some background music for you

172
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,880
You're raising and waving your hands, right?

173
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,920
What's your occupation?

174
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,000
Unemployed

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,120
Do I look unemployed?

176
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
I'm a writer

177
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,560
Typing at home every day

178
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,280
So my outfit, you see...

179
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,720
You really don't look like a writer at all

180
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,320
The things you write

181
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,400
Probably aren't worth reading

182
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,440
You don't look like that either

183
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,320
Why wouldn't they be worth reading?

184
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,160
That goes without saying

185
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,400
Anyone can tell you're a stand-in

186
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,640
This outfit gives me bonus points

187
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,120
Do you know he's dressed as Tang San today?

188
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,320
What do you mean?

189
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,680
Okay

190
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,360
"Douluo Dalu" (Soul Land)

191
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
"Soul Land"

192
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,320
Got it

193
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,480
Written by writers like me

194
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,200
That's what we write

195
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,120
Unfinished luxury sea-view apartment

196
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,920
Need my help if you want to rent it

197
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,640
Mr. Shen Teng

198
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,720
Hello everyone

199
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,600
Have a seat, sir

200
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,520
No need, I'll stand

201
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,080
This Golden Retriever is huge

202
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,680
So smart, this Golden Retriever

203
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,760
Finally tired out

204
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,480
Finally exhausted

205
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,920
Now it's lying down

206
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,640
Xiao He

207
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,560
Take them to see the apartment

208
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,400
No problem

209
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,200
Hope you'll like it

210
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,400
Let's go then

211
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,760
Let us show you

212
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,520
The viewing platform on the third floor

213
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,880
Offers a direct view of the ocean

214
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,160
Let's go

215
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,080
Everyone, please come in

216
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,480
Here's a missing cat notice

217
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,440
It's so cute

218
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,200
Has anyone seen the apartment's kitten?

219
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,840
Come on

220
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,360
We're here

221
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,159
It's cold outside

222
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,520
Everyone should wear a jacket

223
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,080
Okay

224
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,720
Can everyone feel it?

225
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,080
The passion of this wind

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,760
This time the tall one goes in front

227
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,120
Come on

228
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,280
We can't do it

229
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,400
Everyone link arms

230
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,840
Move forward

231
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,040
This ocean view

232
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,400
This wind

233
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,360
This ocean view

234
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,640
Should've told me earlier, I wouldn't have styled my hair

235
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,680
My hair

236
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,480
All that hairstyling wasted

237
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,920
Come on everyone, this way

238
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,640
Okay, be careful

239
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,000
What are they doing?

240
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
Some people are playing badminton

241
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,200
These are our staff members

242
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,600
You can see the ocean from here

243
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,200
So amazing

244
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,320
Because this is one of our

245
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,280
Instagram-worthy spots

246
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,960
I think everyone should come here

247
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,240
Because

248
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,960
Whether you live here or not

249
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,680
Everyone comes here

250
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,440
Pretty cool

251
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,560
Let me take a photo for everyone to remember

252
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,040
Alright, let's go up

253
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,960
Boss Bai, why...

254
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,880
Watch out

255
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,000
I bumped into it too

256
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,520
No way

257
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,240
How is there something I can bump into?

258
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,720
Three two one

259
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,680
Good, very good

260
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,600
Next, I'll take everyone to see the rooms

261
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,400
Let's go

262
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,520
We've arrived at the fourth floor

263
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,720
The fourth floor is Liu Xialai's

264
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
Ke Wuku

265
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,240
Let's check the door—there should be nameplates

266
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,720
This is mine

267
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,280
Yours

268
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,440
406

269
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,600
Okay, then please come in

270
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,720
401

271
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,480
This is my home.

272
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,640
Sixth floor.

273
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,400
I'm on the sixth floor.

274
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,880
Me too, sixth floor.

275
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,080
Sixth floor is (Song) Pretty.

276
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,640
(Bai) Three Bowls.

277
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,200
Guo Baoyou.

278
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,080
I'm in 608.

279
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,360
This is mine.

280
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,800
Your room is nice.

281
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,320
To be honest about my room,

282
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,280
it's really beautiful.

283
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,520
I think this is what I like

284
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,080
It looks like a chocolate factory

285
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,040
And everything has chocolate elements

286
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,920
Moreover, it's the only one

287
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,200
luxury ocean-view room

288
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,560
Why is there a Little Tyrant here?

289
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,880
This isn't a toy from my era

290
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,680
Little Tyrant

291
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,920
Let me find some clothes to change into

292
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,880
Wig

293
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Let's wrap in a blanket

294
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,160
This room has a lot of

295
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,320
music-related items

296
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
and some old records too

297
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,000
Are these all records Teng Zhongjie prepared for me?

298
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,440
All of these...

299
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,920
So...

300
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,240
vintage?

301
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,000
It's quite cozy

302
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,680
a comfortable little room

303
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,920
Today I saw

304
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,240
a toy I absolutely love

305
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,960
Iron Man has this toy too

306
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,320
Can I take this with me?

307
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,040
Excuse me director

308
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,480
May I take this home?

309
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,560
The toys in this room are all amazing

310
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,920
Look at your own room

311
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,400
It aligns well with my personal interests.

312
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,640
About motorcycles,

313
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,040
decor,

314
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,680
and camping stuff like that.

315
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,720
Because there was this movie before

316
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,760
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"

317
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,360
I just wished

318
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,600
that I could be as lucky as little Charlie

319
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,480
from the story

320
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:40,920
I just wished

321
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,280
to have a room like this

322
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,520
where you feel that in this room

323
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,080
none of adult worries would exist

324
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,480
And it must have something for watching TV

325
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,520
TV

326
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,680
Fake one

327
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,480
With an electric blanket

328
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,200
LOL "dead" - not plugged in

329
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,760
Here it is

330
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,040
It really can heat up

331
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,000
It seems to be okay.

332
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,560
After coming to my room

333
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Seeing all of this

334
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,840
minimalist

335
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,960
It really brings out my cultured aura

336
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,000
coming through so strongly

337
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,400
It's quite nice actually

338
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Very satisfying

339
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,320
The first time I saw it,

340
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,120
I felt it was my dream house.

341
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,760
I personally prefer something more minimalist,

342
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,360
with a touch of forest-style elements.

343
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,040
It feels quite cozy.

344
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,920
Pretty good

345
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,640
So my room

346
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,440
has no place to sleep?

347
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,960
Are you tired?

348
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,480
To become a pet caretaker

349
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,480
And they actually turned my room into

350
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,160
a place to keep pets

351
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,360
Today, they even prepared

352
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,280
a big dog for me

353
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm really so happy

354
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,680
Wait a moment

355
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,840
Don't move

356
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,440
Okay

357
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,720
First place

358
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,920
Hello

359
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,360
Hello

360
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,960
Master/Sir

361
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,520
Would you like to eat?

362
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,240
Yes

363
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,920
So you have everything, right?

364
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,720
Yes, 58 yuan per serving

365
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,400
Okay

366
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,840
Okay

367
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,880
Alright, then I'll give you

368
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
Card not charged

369
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,640
Transaction failed

370
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,120
Why is it still short by 8 yuan?

371
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,080
You don't have 8 yuan

372
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,320
We can't let you eat here

373
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,880
Sorry

374
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Wait, then where can I earn 8 yuan?

375
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,640
Wait a moment

376
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,880
Do you hide money in this room?

377
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,400
There shouldn't be any

378
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,120
Isn't this all here? I'll serve myself

379
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,800
This is good, your food is nice

380
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,640
The meals are quite good

381
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,360
Is there any money in this tree hole?

382
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,040
What's this? A trash can, right?

383
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:16,839
Forty-eight yuan

384
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,560
We're having a big promotion today

385
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,040
Is that okay?

386
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,760
Sorry about that

387
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
I don't have the authority for that

388
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,960
I'm just, you know

389
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,400
Just an employee too, it's not easy

390
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,720
Right

391
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,240
Then can you lend me eight yuan?

392
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,800
I don't have any on me

393
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,320
I've got nothing with me

394
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,000
Come

395
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,160
Let me introduce to everyone

396
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,360
the cafeteria we've carefully prepared

397
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,080
I can already smell the delicious food

398
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,880
Can you smell it?

399
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,440
Yes, I can smell the aroma of rice

400
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,080
Look forward to it

401
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,720
We've prepared many set meals

402
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,400
Set meals

403
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,160
You scared me

404
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,680
Someone's already here

405
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,320
Who?

406
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm literally starving

407
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,200
Guo Baoyou, you're quick

408
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,600
Everyone check your cards

409
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,120
It's 58 yuan per person here

410
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,680
Welcome

411
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,000
My card only has 50 yuan

412
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,680
8 yuan short

413
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,440
Then don't eat

414
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,560
Can't pay the bill

415
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
What to eat?

416
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,240
Put it on credit

417
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,960
Just check - he won't give credit

418
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
This is our cafeteria guy

419
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,720
His surname is Shi

420
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,400
Brother Shi

421
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,920
Hello, Brother Shi

422
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,480
Hello everyone

423
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
This is our new resident, right?

424
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:06,920
Yes

425
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,480
This is our

426
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,000
new resident who just moved in today

427
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,840
Welcome to our restaurant

428
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,000
Is everyone here?

429
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,480
No money

430
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,080
Let's not embarrass ourselves then.

431
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,400
No, nothing at all.

432
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,360
Brother Teng doesn't even have one yuan.

433
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,800
How do you manage, bro?

434
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,480
Brother Teng, you're broke.

435
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,160
Brother Teng, last month you...

436
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,280
still owed me 500 yuan.

437
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,320
Let's go.

438
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,560
Not eating.

439
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,120
Find time to settle this with me.

440
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,560
April 1st: five marinated eggs.

441
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,680
A dozen oysters.

442
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,840
Alright, brother.

443
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,640
Always five marinated eggs, huh?

444
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,040
What kind of nonsense is this?

445
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,760
Need to solve equations?

446
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,840
Right here.

447
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,520
I'll settle it tomorrow.

448
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,920
I'll take care of today's too.

449
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,440
First pay for my share today.

450
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,160
Come on.

451
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,240
So hungry.

452
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,320
I won't be able to eat, will I?

453
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,200
Or use my card.

454
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,400
So you have enough then?

455
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,200
I just topped up.

456
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,240
You've got 500 yuan here.

457
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,160
Why is Xiao He so rich?

458
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,360
How much does Xiao He have?

459
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,080
Five hundred yuan.

460
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,360
See?

461
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,280
Monthly salary is 1000 yuan.

462
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
I spend 500 on food.

463
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,560
Then today Xiao He treats us.

464
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,120
Right?

465
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,680
Alright, I'll treat everyone.

466
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,320
Thanks, Boss He.

467
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,480
Come on.

468
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,560
Why is Xiao He so rich?

469
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,760
This cafeteria food is good.

470
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,680
This is mouthwatering chicken, right?

471
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,880
Looks good.

472
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,240
It smells so good, this looks delicious

473
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,920
Yes, Hunan cuisine

474
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,400
This stir-fried beef with yellow peppers looks perfect with rice

475
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,880
Right

476
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,720
Is no one willing to talk during the meal?

477
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,520
Let's drop the script analysis.

478
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,600
Didn't expect it to be this difficult.

479
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,240
Never thought it would be so hard.

480
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,960
So convoluted.

481
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,600
Even if we eventually vote out the killer,

482
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
we might not be able to explain it clearly.

483
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,360
But we originally thought

484
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,160
it was someone among us.

485
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,320
Yet when Zhenzhen suddenly appeared,

486
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,160
I think (the killer) is her.

487
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,000
(The killer) is definitely her.

488
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,080
That chicken is

489
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,760
Just now we saw Zhenzhen's side

490
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,320
She

491
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,480
must be

492
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,080
very exhausted

493
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,200
No, she just touched up her makeup

494
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,600
Very refined, clearly very refined

495
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,720
It's just that

496
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,400
she looks quite scary in the dark

497
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,720
But when the flashlight shines on her

498
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,840
she looks quite beautiful

499
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,920
In the end, I was amazed by her

500
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,280
Both startled and dazzled

501
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,480
No soup

502
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,080
Contains real fruit bits - Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring Tea

503
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
Contains real fruit bits - Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring Tea

504
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,840
Contains real fruit bits - Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring Tea

505
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,320
When she was at the door earlier,

506
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,440
we caught a glimpse of her.

507
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,360
That impression,

508
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,640
I think she should be cold,

509
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:52,920
yes, cold.

510
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,880
The "dead" one

511
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,720
was gentle,

512
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,080
yes, gentle.

513
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,640
And what she was wearing

514
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,440
was the same red dress that Guo Baoyou and I

515
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,640
saw in the elevator.

516
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,720
But I feel

517
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,560
that wasn't quite human just now.

518
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,480
More like a hologram.

519
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,720
Ever since the inner and outer shells could rotate,

520
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,880
now even projections have appeared.

521
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,960
Those inner and outer shells

522
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,480
might not mean the room is rotating,

523
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,360
it could be the middle layer that's turning.

524
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,720
Right

525
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,200
Because that's the easiest to rotate

526
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,920
But it can't rotate at the elevator entrance

527
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,800
That's pointless

528
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,840
Rotating in the mezzanine is meaningless

529
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,800
That compartment connects to the outside door.

530
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,680
No.

531
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,920
He always takes...

532
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,320
You mean door number 3 outside, right?

533
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,960
Just turning that door handle won't work.

534
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
Because we...

535
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,800
You're also ten steps away.

536
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,320
You also reach it after one turn.

537
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,880
No, what Bai Sanwan said makes sense.

538
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,960
Because every time they enter,

539
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,240
the outside light is on.

540
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,080
So they enter by looking at the numbers.

541
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,080
So if the numbers change,

542
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,800
the room they enter will be different.

543
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,160
Later we'll go up and try pushing it.

544
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,280
Go up and take a look.

545
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,040
Search around.

546
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,080
Today is everyone's first day moving in.

547
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,560
Any thoughts or feelings?

548
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,920
Did you let us return to our rooms?

549
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,640
We haven't rested at all.

550
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,280
Completely exhausted.

551
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,840
Finally managed to sleep for two minutes,

552
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,720
then the "blood" started dripping.

553
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,120
Do you think this room is livable?

554
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,480
No.

555
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,080
What was mentioned earlier was just a prop.

556
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,400
The fake "blood" poured from the bottle

557
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,440
Dye

558
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,600
You think everything is just paint

559
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,960
That's why there's such a large area, right?

560
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,040
Exactly

561
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,480
Stabbing once was just to deceive others

562
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,920
Even if stabbed after "death"

563
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,080
She would still "bleed"

564
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,760
But not that much, right?

565
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,040
Right

566
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,560
After "dying"

567
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,840
Probably wouldn't bleed as much

568
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,040
It would be slower

569
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,920
Sticky

570
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,480
And with no heartbeat after "death"

571
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,360
There'd be even less "blood"

572
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,000
But that bottle was indeed poured

573
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,760
It was indeed poured

574
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,600
We're eating here

575
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,160
Talking about "corpses"

576
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,360
While eating and talking

577
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,440
See? So open about it

578
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,360
I think her "death"

579
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,400
Could have been from illness

580
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,240
Or something else

581
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,840
For example, if we

582
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,920
Why jump off a building if dying from illness?

583
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,360
I think the suicide jumper

584
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,040
doesn't seem related to this case

585
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,360
That's impossible

586
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,160
It must be related

587
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,480
I think there must be some connection

588
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,440
I believe it's related

589
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,120
Weren't we watching that TV show back then?

590
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,480
That's right.

591
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,040
You will all "die."

592
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,520
What you saw was all real.

593
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,000
Yes.

594
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,320
And that clue given to us

595
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,880
What is that chain-like thing

596
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,440
Is it because it's the middle link?

597
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,160
It's the intermediary.

598
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,800
So that means...

599
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,160
It must be a pun.

600
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,920
So after all our deductions...

601
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,400
None of it compares to...

602
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,600
The ring.

603
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,080
The person connecting in the middle is the intermediary.

604
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,800
Intermediary.

605
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,600
I'm also puzzled.

606
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,800
We all looked out the window together.

607
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,720
Only I didn't see it.

608
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,560
You really didn't see it?

609
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,120
I genuinely didn't see it.

610
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,920
I saw it clearly.

611
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,840
I really didn't see it.

612
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,960
And Xiao He was downstairs the whole time.

613
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,200
Yet he somehow missed seeing someone fall down.

614
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,440
Where's Xiaoshi?

615
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,240
Xiaoshi went to eat.

616
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,040
The shredded potatoes are too bland.

617
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,400
I'll tell him later.

618
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,080
To be honest,

619
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,240
it is indeed a bit bland.

620
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,000
Not very appetizing.

621
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,160
Right, it should be more flavorful.

622
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,960
His hearing isn't great either.

623
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,560
Where are you from?

624
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,520
I'm from Liaoning.

625
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,080
Where from?

626
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,840
It's not like

627
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,040
the whole city has bad hearing.

628
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,520
Look at our Bai Sanwan not saying a word

629
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,240
You're the "murderer," aren't you?

630
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,480
Yes

631
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,760
He keeps admitting it

632
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,680
Is it you?

633
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,560
It's you

634
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,360
Your submissive attitude

635
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,240
Makes us very uncomfortable

636
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,040
I just want to look for more evidence

637
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,800
To prove my innocence

638
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,040
Or maybe you're the "accomplice"

639
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,760
Right

640
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,760
Admitting again

641
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,640
"Accomplice"

642
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,680
Why do you love admitting so much?

643
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,360
I'm begging you

644
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,800
Fight back, bro, fight back

645
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,160
We can't lie

646
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,000
The "murderer" can lie

647
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,800
Right

648
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,760
You're the "murderer"

649
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,600
Why do you care if I am?

650
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,120
He's starting to act shameless

651
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,360
Acting shameless

652
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,240
Being the "murderer"

653
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,360
Isn't anything to be proud of

654
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,120
So we'll say it's him

655
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,440
So are you?

656
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,080
No

657
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
He gave two different answers

658
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,520
Then he must be

659
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,160
This logic makes sense, right?

660
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,040
Right, because only the "murderer"

661
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,240
Can lie

662
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,160
No, I'm not

663
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,160
Is everyone done eating?

664
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,200
Yes, are we leaving?

665
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,280
Okay

666
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,440
I'll clean up here

667
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,600
Everyone can go ahead

668
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,040
Thank you so much, Xiao He

669
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,960
Hello everyone

670
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,400
Newly renovated sea-view apartment

671
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Need my help to rent it

672
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,400
I am

673
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,560
Teng the agent

674
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,320
Hello Teng the agent

675
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,440
Hello everyone

676
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,160
Bro, have a bowl

677
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,040
Just made it

678
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,280
Who's it for?

679
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,560
When did you make it?

680
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,240
I won't eat

681
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,600
I've got nothing here

682
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,720
Just some peanuts and sunflower seeds

683
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
And two packs of pickled vegetables

684
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,080
That agent Teng - I suspect before becoming an agent

685
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
he used to perform comedy sketches, didn't he?

686
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,600
Right?

687
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,360
He's been stalking your sister, bro

688
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,040
Bro, look

689
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,480
No

690
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,720
I can explain

691
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,240
I can explain

692
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,840
I can explain

693
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,800
I can explain

694
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,160
No

695
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,000
What are you trying to do?

696
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,160
This is your sister accusing him

697
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,200
Has my sister ever sat on this bed?

698
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,320
No

699
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Do you like her?

700
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,880
Have you ever truly liked her?

701
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,640
There wouldn't be photos of my sister in there, would there?

702
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,680
No

703
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,480
What about videos?

704
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,240
I'm not

705
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,000
There aren't any photos of my sister, right?

706
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,720
The whole world loves your sister

707
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,560
Extremely

708
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,080
Horrifying

709
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,520
Extremely horrifying

710
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,720
But in daily life, I'm actually

711
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,120
not afraid of walking at night

712
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,280
Yes, what scares me most is

713
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,160
other people being scared

714
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,120
For example, Zhou Shen

715
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,160
When Zhou Shen gets frightened

716
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,320
I've been feeling numb all over these past few times

717
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,120
It was Zhou Shen who startled me

718
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,040
Not by the incident itself

719
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,800
Zhen Zhen

720
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,200
The real estate agent Teng you like is here

721
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,240
Dragged me away

722
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,400
I'm sorry

723
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,600
Was it me who scared you again?

724
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
Every single time, it's you who startles me.

725
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,720
