1
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,680
It's this man

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,200
who stole

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,280
this woman's creative idea

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,440
the use of light and shadow

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,160
The "dead" woman

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,720
had a child

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,080
That child was his and the Southern painter's

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,720
She had a child

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,080
Are these the three of you?

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,240
Yes

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,520
Yes

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,520
The "killer" must be one of you

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,720
She did the costume herself

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,000
And did her own hair too

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,680
But why did Bamui still "die"?

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,840
The question is who this fan of hers is

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,440
Very suspicious

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,720
Right, we don't know who the fan is

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,720
Is there anything?

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,920
There's a box here.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,000
Why are they all empty?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,560
Then there should be more.

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,360
Look at that board.

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,440
What's drawn on it?

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,320
Cross marks.

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,080
All marked with crosses.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,120
And also...

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,560
Here.

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,560
There's something here.

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,040
"Sleep-inducer."

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,080
After inhaling it,

32
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,440
you'll fall into deep sleep for ten hours.

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,200
Not a single drop of "blood" shed.

34
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,800
"Sleep-inducer" again.

35
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,040
The people who wronged you,

36
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,080
there are six others besides her.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,840
The six of us.

38
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,600
This is her photo, right?

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,880
And the lost medal was found too.

40
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,080
2019.

41
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,040
Top Ten Trending Articles Medal.

42
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,640
Look, there are seven boxes in total.

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,080
It must be...

44
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,840
After killing all of us,

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,919
burying us one by one.

46
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,520
The first person is already gone

47
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,160
already gone

48
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,600
So we didn't "commit suicide"

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,240
We were "murdered"

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,000
Right

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,440
Which means

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,800
The doll wanted to save us

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,440
But this person kept

54
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,280
trying to "kill" us

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,120
Yes, he must also know

56
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,320
the secret of returning

57
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,600
Right

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes, I think

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,440
there's another mastermind

60
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,000
the one who made the "No Cry Gas"

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,360
Right

62
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,640
Who would want to "kill" us?

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,600
Solve the case quickly, otherwise

64
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,560
I'll "die"

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
I'll be first

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,520
Brother, did you buy insurance?

67
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,400
Should we first

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,320
What do you want to

69
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,480
Never mind searching

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,200
Let's get insurance first

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,680
I'll find you an "insurance agent"

72
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,160
And list you as beneficiaries

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,920
Right

74
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,880
If I were "emo" I'd come now

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,520
Come on, keep digging

76
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,480
Come on, keep digging the hole

77
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,560
See what else is here

78
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,840
Dig through

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,360
What's this?

80
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,400
Guys

81
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,440
We've struck gold

82
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,560
Whose is this?

83
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,760
This box is...

84
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,360
The painter's.

85
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,600
Big haul.

86
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,480
What else?

87
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,160
Southern School (painter).

88
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,040
The one who wronged Mom.

89
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,560
I only meant to hurt you,

90
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,840
then escape this house.

91
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,280
But I never expected my prank

92
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,800
would accidentally "kill" you.

93
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,520
It was your "death" that made me realize

94
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,280
the best way to deal with those bad people

95
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,960
is to make them jump down themselves

96
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,640
The kid who pranked his mom

97
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,320
accidentally scared the creepy uncle

98
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,400
I dressed the doll in

99
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,360
your favorite white dress

100
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,280
Unexpectedly

101
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,360
after he saw it

102
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,600
got terribly frightened

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,920
So fifteen years ago

104
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,040
he did indeed "die" from accidentally falling off the building

105
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,920
Right

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,880
But that kid did it

107
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,040
After that, the kid learned

108
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,800
how to deal with those (bad people)

109
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,600
just make them jump down themselves

110
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,960
So today

111
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,120
Bamei's "death" method

112
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,920
is exactly the same

113
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,240
as that person's fifteen years ago

114
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,040
So that means

115
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,920
the "killer" from fifteen years ago

116
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,160
and today's are the same person

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,320
Possibly

118
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,880
Possibly

119
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,760
But the first time was an accident

120
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
Yes, right

121
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,920
But I never thought my prank would make you...

122
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,120
This was still his doing

123
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,680
Yes

124
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,080
Right?

125
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,760
Fifteen years ago

126
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,400
It was him

127
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,920
But was it him today?

128
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,480
It's all "e"

129
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,440
The "e" from "e mo"

130
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:36,880
It's all him

131
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,360
It's him

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,240
But his opening line

133
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,920
wasn't it "someone you've wronged"?

134
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,400
Yes

135
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,520
Someone you've wronged

136
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,160
Besides her, there are six others

137
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,240
Who is this "you"?

138
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,200
It's us and Bamui

139
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,960
Who have we all wronged together?

140
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
Right, when we met Bamui this morning

141
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,520
she said we have one thing in common

142
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:54,840
which is

143
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,320
we've all wronged someone

144
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,840
You said you and the six of us

145
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,040
have one thing in common. What is it?

146
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,760
Tell me.

147
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,240
I don't know.

148
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
I haven't had time to investigate yet.

149
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,880
Who have we wronged?

150
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,040
We've wronged him.

151
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,920
Youyou

152
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,680
This is He

153
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,280
How's the evidence gathering going?

154
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,480
If you think you've found enough

155
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,200
Want to come down to the dining room to discuss?

156
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,040
He, we're returning to the dining room

157
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,160
Who have we wronged?

158
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,880
What have we done?

159
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,160
Who have we let down?

160
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,240
Baby, I'm sorry

161
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,120
It's not that I don't love you

162
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,280
Love

163
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,680
Little Wen as chairperson

164
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,360
Am I worthy?

165
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,720
Absolutely

166
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Our Little Wen has contributed so much

167
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,120
Right

168
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,320
Especially his courage is outstanding

169
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,080
I didn't dare to go

170
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
In the end, he had my back

171
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,920
Thank you

172
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,960
Thank you everyone

173
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,160
Otherwise how could he be a security guard

174
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,440
Security is reliable

175
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,920
Should we first write down our suspects

176
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Write down the suspects first

177
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,240
"The deceased" is

178
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,280
"The deceased" is Sister Ba

179
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,240
Time

180
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,760
July 16, 2022

181
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,000
Fell from building

182
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,000
Who are the four suspects?

183
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,600
Sister Bao

184
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,400
Then Nan Fans

185
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,160
Agent Wu

186
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,480
And Lucky

187
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,880
Who's Lucky?

188
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,480
Lucky

189
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Lucky

190
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,440
Said it in English

191
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,040
This is clearly from his past

192
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,880
These things were done by a child

193
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,560
It must be someone who experienced this event

194
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,240
Right, it's the same method from fifteen years ago

195
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,600
The same "cause of death"

196
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,560
Yes

197
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,160
Within these four categories

198
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,320
Narrow it down further

199
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,360
Who has orphan status

200
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,480
Isn't it just these three people?

201
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,360
These three people, yes

202
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,280
And those toy cars on the ground

203
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,160
They're children's toys

204
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,360
Things children play with

205
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,040
Why

206
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,440
They really want to lead us to think it's a boy

207
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,560
Trying to make us say it's a boy

208
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,080
Right?

209
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,160
No, we found that little doll

210
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,600
The one wearing a dress

211
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,360
I think this doll

212
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,520
Can't prove whether it's a boy or girl

213
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,680
Because this is

214
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,720
His image of mother

215
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,120
Right

216
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,040
That's how children are

217
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
If that's the case

218
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,680
If that doll represents mother

219
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,520
Then it's a boy

220
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,840
Why?

221
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,880
Because all the toys are for boys

222
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,800
All the toys are

223
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,000
The crime process

224
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,880
Basically

225
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,920
Two people working together

226
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,520
First, they needed to lure Bamei in

227
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,480
Let her enter first

228
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:30,880
Right

229
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,920
I think before Bamei "died"

230
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,200
Bamei even helped them set this up

231
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,080
Because the purpose of placing this black thing

232
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,560
Was to allow passage

233
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,720
This person must have told Bamei

234
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,440
"If we set this up, you can come over"

235
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,640
"After you come over, we'll remove it"

236
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,720
"Then we'll go in and start filming"

237
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,520
Yes

238
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,960
Right, after luring her

239
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,400
Exactly

240
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,040
He committed the crime inside the room

241
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,360
Actually from that position

242
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,720
He could have removed the tools

243
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,680
All by himself

244
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,320
That's correct

245
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,240
Her "death" process

246
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,440
Let's continue

247
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,200
At the crime scene

248
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,560
There was a bottle of "No Cry Gas"

249
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,360
The "victim"

250
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Was she pushed down

251
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,320
While fully conscious

252
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,080
Or

253
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,320
After she entered the room

254
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,520
Was she drugged/hallucinating

255
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,080
So the "killer" could have had the ability

256
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,800
To push her out the window

257
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,760
Sister Bao mentioned seeing her before

258
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,680
talking to herself in the air

259
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,240
Stay away from me

260
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,559
Don't hurt me

261
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,679
I didn't mean to provoke you

262
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,840
So she probably wasn't in her right mind

263
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,000
And that fan of hers

264
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,240
was actually guiding her all along

265
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,480
to make her use "No-Cry Gas"

266
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,320
I think she was hallucinating

267
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,400
I think so too

268
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,560
Right

269
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,000
Climbing out the window in an excited state

270
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,040
That's not very realistic

271
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,400
That person directly told her

272
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,320
Back then

273
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,920
that person

274
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,520
went down through this very window

275
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,480
Then I'll come take a look

276
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,920
Sounds like something Brother Bai would do

277
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,760
Or maybe she was genuinely scared

278
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,800
For example if she actually saw

279
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,880
that woman

280
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,640
When the lights came on

281
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,520
she might have panicked

282
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,120
and tried to hide in the fireplace or something

283
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,480
then jumped down by herself

284
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,040
The video of that necklace

285
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,800
Should we take another look?

286
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,240
Sure

287
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,800
Xiao Wen, please go check it out. Sorry for the trouble.

288
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,560
No problem at all

289
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Xiao Wen's salute today was really...

290
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:32,800
dashing

291
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,440
Salute!

292
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,040
Salute!

293
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,600
Yes, just play it right there

294
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,840
Squatting

295
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,680
She started from the camera's blind spot

296
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,560
and squatted down

297
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,640
No wonder it's so shaky, right?

298
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,040
Because she was walking while squatting

299
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,240
Went straight in

300
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,840
Went right in

301
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,400
She didn't remove anything

302
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,480
She didn't pack anything

303
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,000
Listen

304
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,280
Don't come over

305
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,480
I'm just here to investigate

306
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,640
the truth behind the "death" of the Southern painter

307
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
There's absolutely

308
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,320
no ill intent toward you

309
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
I'm sorry

310
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,280
I'm truly sorry

311
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,600
This is the window

312
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,240
She fell down

313
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,840
She was like this

314
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,760
At that time she was like this

315
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,440
There's nothing

316
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,880
I'm sorry

317
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,760
I saw her hand was like this

318
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,400
But no one was talking to her

319
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,120
Yet she kept saying "I'm sorry"

320
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,480
It seemed like she was speaking
Translation
to something invisible

321
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,160
(implied in previous line)

322
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,320
I've figured out her movement path

323
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,960
After she entered

324
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,920
This spot is the sensor-activated cabinet

325
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,600
Right

326
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,400
At that time she faced this sensor cabinet

327
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,600
"I'm sorry"

328
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,240
Then slowly turned this way

329
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,560
I think she was facing a mirror

330
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,120
If she was facing a mirror

331
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,720
She'd need to turn left to face the window

332
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,360
If she was facing

333
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,240
the sensor cabinet

334
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,600
She'd need to turn right to face the window

335
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,560
When we went there today,

336
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,000
wasn't the remote control inside that thing?

337
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,880
There's a remote control inside.

338
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,560
Right.

339
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:04,960
It's inside.

340
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,640
It can control the room lights.

341
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,080
Yes.

342
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,520
So the "killer"

343
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,600
could be inside that sensor cabinet,

344
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,280
turning off all the lights,

345
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,800
creating a terrifying atmosphere.

346
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,760
Then suddenly pressing it again to turn them on,

347
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,720
controlling everything from inside.

348
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,640
Scaring everyone "to death".

349
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,080
So they all "died".

350
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,840
Scared everyone "to death".

351
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,600
So they're still using prank methods

352
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,480
to continue.

353
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,720
Yes, that should be it.

354
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,880
What we can confirm is

355
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,000
no one pushed her down,

356
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,400
she fell by herself.

357
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,960
Yes.

358
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,000
And placing a can of

359
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,560
"No Cry Gas" was meant

360
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,920
to mislead.

361
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,400
Right.

362
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,960
To make it seem like she used too much herself.

363
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,040
Because that Southern painter back then

364
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,920
after "dying",

365
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,360
was found with "No Cry Gas".

366
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,760
This time it's the same method.

367
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,680
Yes.

368
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,040
So what we've concluded now is

369
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,000
the "killer" of Southern painter

370
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,560
and the "killer" of Bamui are the same person.

371
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,200
It's one person.

372
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,880
Right?

373
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,400
And it's the same method.

374
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,840
Yes.

375
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,280
So who is the "killer"?

376
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,400
I think this Bamui fan

377
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,600
must be the "killer".

378
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,080
Right.

379
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Think about it - he even gave her "No Cry Gas".

380
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,520
Look at which month he

381
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,160
bought it for her

382
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,480
July 12th

383
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,400
July 12th

384
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,040
The bottle number by Bamui's window

385
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,480
0091

386
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,600
Check who bought 0091

387
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,440
0091 is also "e mo"

388
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,280
Right, so "e mo" means fans

389
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,720
Correct

390
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,600
Arrival times on the 15th

391
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,000
Do you all remember

392
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,480
Yes

393
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,880
1:30, 1:50

394
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,760
2:20, 2:30

395
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,560
Is there a possibility

396
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,080
that the "killer"

397
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,320
needed to arrive first

398
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,360
to set up the knockout drug "Tuimirin"

399
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,440
Possibly

400
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,360
Because the more people arrive

401
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,160
the more he'd need to do it in public view

402
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,640
to complete this

403
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,040
No way

404
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,160
He knocked them all out

405
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,560
With ten hours he could do anything

406
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,280
I was wondering how he could

407
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,360
knock people out in public

408
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,600
And it's not just this knockout drug

409
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,240
Right

410
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,600
It's impossible for example if we're sitting together

411
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
I get knocked out

412
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,880
The "Tuimirin"

413
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,520
only causes unconsciousness

414
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,640
but not amnesia

415
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,240
Right?

416
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,640
Why doesn't Lucky seem like...

417
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,800
I have a bit...

418
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,560
This memorial service...

419
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,000
was proposed by Lucky.

420
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,480
If she wanted to "kill someone,"

421
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,400
she didn't have to suggest holding it.

422
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,440
Who says?

423
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,080
She might be more likely...

424
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,960
Maybe she just wanted...

425
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,040
to create an alibi.

426
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,480
And the bookstore she rented...

427
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,960
Right.

428
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,400
Yes.

429
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,480
You say Lucky likes Youyou so much,

430
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,080
why would she want to "get rid of" me?

431
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,200
What he says actually makes some sense.

432
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,480
To confuse you.

433
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,240
Then you can only take my peach as a woman.

434
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,000
What do you mean "future father-in-law"?

435
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,720
I don't agree yet.

436
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,120
Because I really like Youyou.

437
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
To be worthy of Youyou, I joined them.

438
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,800
Wanting to get close to me...

439
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,040
and then take the chance to "get rid of" me.

440
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,520
She's a fickle woman.

441
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,800
It shows she's not love-struck.

442
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,760
When you touch upon...

443
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,920
her moral bottom line,

444
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,080
Who told you to glance over there?

445
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,560
She would still "kill" you if she wanted to

446
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,080
Take that book called "Marriage Psychology"

447
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,600
and give it to you

448
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,560
You should read it when you get back

449
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,440
Pass it around

450
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,280
Let's all read it in turn

451
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,120
So who is the "killer"?

452
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,200
Wait a minute

453
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,480
Now I understand

454
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,280
Following this logic

455
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,480
we can identify the last person

456
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,680
We just need to figure out

457
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,720
other than Bamui

458
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,200
which of us six also "wronged"

459
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,920
who this person is

460
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,840
This "wronged you"

461
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,960
who does this "you" refer to?

462
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,200
I don't know

463
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,160
I don't think we can figure out now

464
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,000
who this "you" is

465
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,040
I also think we can't figure it out

466
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,640
Can't figure it out

467
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,840

No

474
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,160
That report she did many years ago

475
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,040
What was that about?

476
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,200
In 2019

477
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,800
The article "Murder of a Blossoming Girl"

478
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,160
"Murder of a Blossoming Girl"

479
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,800
Yes

480
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,880
I just suddenly remembered something

481
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,720
Why did I start

482
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,440
escorting a thousand girls home

483
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,320
Escorting a Thousand Girls Home

484
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,040
Because

485
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,320
I learned about this incident

486
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,040
And then I felt

487
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,800
"Murder of a Blossoming Girl"

488
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,960
was an extremely terrible thing

489
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,080
That's why I wanted to escort

490
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
so many girls home

491
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,480
Really?

492
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,560
When this blossoming girl was murdered

493
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,480
I was aware

494
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,600
But you didn't do anything

495
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,280
All of us

496
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,240
are somewhat connected to this murder

497
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,320
of the blossoming girl

498
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,040
So you're saying

499
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,720
the person we wronged today

500
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,360
was the killer's best friend

501
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,280
Yes, exactly that blossoming girl

502
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,680
Then where's the evidence?

503
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,640
Goodbye everyone, I'm going to vote now.

504
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,320
Let's go vote for the "killer."

505
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,160
This has been the most difficult day

506
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,520
since moving into Apartment 11.

507
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,320
It's completely

508
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,240
like grasping at straws.

509
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,320
Because we haven't obtained

510
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,080
any concrete evidence at all.

511
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,840
I've chosen

512
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,240
Jiang Lucky - apart from one photo,

513
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,040
there's nothing else.

514
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,080
Also, she never mentioned

515
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,800
how her mother "died."

516
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,320
Her father

517
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,760
- we don't know if he's biological or adoptive.

518
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,960
So my choice for

519
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,520
the "killer" is

520
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,400
Jiang Lucky.

521
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,400
We've narrowed down

522
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,080
the "killer" to

523
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,320
three suspects with orphan backgrounds.

524
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,520
Originally I thought

525
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,080
Jiang Lucky and Nan Fans

526
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,040
were most suspicious.

527
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,480
But then I realized something:

528
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,920
If fifteen years ago this person

529
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,760
already hated this "weird uncle,"

530
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,079
Today I believe

531
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,760
he definitely wouldn't become

532
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,920
this weird uncle's

533
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,880
a fan of Southern Painter

534
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,599
But today there's one person

535
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,560
who didn't appear as

536
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,319
a crazy fan

537
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,200
That's Sister Bao

538
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,079
So today I'll cast this vote

539
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,720
for Sister Bao

540
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,599
That's all, thank you

541
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,720
Bamei and us

542
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
have provoked someone we shouldn't have

543
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,080
So who is this person?

544
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
Don't know

545
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,360
The modus operandi

546
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,560
still remains

547
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,680
an extremely ingenious method

548
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,520
Extremely ingenious

549
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,600
Guided her

550
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,200
to use that gas

551
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,840
making her mentally confused

552
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,240
Step by step, she completed it herself

553
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,680
"suicide"

554
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,680
Cruel

555
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,600
I believe the "killer" should be

556
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,320
The person I'm accusing

557
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,640
would be the most convenient one to commit this crime

558
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
Bamei's fans always contacted her

559
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,320
via phone or WeChat

560
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,760
to communicate with Bamei

561
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,880
The reason being

562
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,960
if Bamei had met this person

563
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,320
she might not have believed his plan

564
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,240
Whether Lucky or Nanfans

565
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,400
could all speak to her face-to-face

566
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,280
Except for

567
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,440
this Baojie

568
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,560
who couldn't let Bamei meet her

569
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,120
Because Baojie herself

570
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,960
is just a marketing account operator

571
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,240
Moreover, she infiltrated Bamei's room

572
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,200
and saw all her plans

573
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,240
Therefore my answer

574
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,400
the "killer" is

575
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,920
Baojie

576
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,040
The most difficult part today was

577
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,360
having to choose between Baojie,

578
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,160
Xingyun,

579
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,200
and Nanfanshi.

580
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,520
Because they

581
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,000
are the same age,

582
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,120
all grew up in happy families,

583
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,080
and had similar upbringings.

584
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,920
But why

585
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,960
did I ultimately choose this person?

586
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,400
I think there was one major difficulty -

587
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,160
that

588
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,480
the shelf was extremely heavy,

589
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:56,880
and moreover,

590
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,440
during our questioning process,

591
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,360
every time the topic of mothers came up,

592
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,160
his reaction

593
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,080
was particularly intense.

594
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,400
So in the end,

595
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,480
I decided on...

596
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,600
This is so hard.

597
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,200
Have we wronged someone?

598
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,280
Have we actually wronged anyone?

599
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,520
Welcome everyone

600
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,320
to Tencent Video

601
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,400
Presented by the delightful blend

602
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,440
where tea fragrance meets fruit bits

603
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,440
Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Tea

604
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,840
exclusively sponsored by

605
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,120
the immersive mystery reality show

606
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,040
"Let's Begin Deduction"

607
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,800
This is the Case Review Hall

608
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,040
Where tea aroma meets fruit pieces

609
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,440
making milk even more delicious

610
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:31,960
Congratulations to all

611
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,880
We've collectively completed

612
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,280
today's deduction challenge

613
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,960
Let's raise our

614
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,800
delicious

615
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,720
Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit tea

616
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,440
and toast together to reveal the truth

617
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,080
Alright

618
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,760
Cheers

619
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,760
We will now directly reveal

620
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,280
the truth behind this case.

621
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,080
In today's case,

622
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,960
the suspects identified were:

623
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,000
Sister Boom

624
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,120
Lucky Jiang

625
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Nan Fensi

626
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,840
Agent Wu

627
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,480
four individuals.

628
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,320
After deduction,

629
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,320
the "culprit" voted by everyone

630
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,640
was narrowed down to three people:

631
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
namely Sister Boom,

632
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,840
Lucky Jiang,

633
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
and Nan Fensi.

634
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,320
Among these three,

635
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,040
Nan Fensi received three votes.

636
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,520
I believe the "culprit" should be

637
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,280
Nan Fensi.

638
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,560
I choose

639
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,400
Nan Fensi.

640
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,280
The one locked is

641
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,240
Nan Fensi.

642
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,760
According to the game rules,

643
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,920
Nan Fensi with the most votes

644
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,560
is identified as

645
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,320
the "true culprit."

646
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,760
It's over.

647
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,840
For this case,

648
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,520
everyone's "culprit identification"

649
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,600
has failed.

650
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,520
That's a good thing

651
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,800
It's a good thing for us

652
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,880
Why?

653
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,280
Among the four of us, there must be two

654
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,000
We just

655
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,800
We must be right

656
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,560
Those two golden keys

657
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,480
will be competed for among the four of us

658
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,000
Those who voted for Sister Bao are:

659
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,600
Ke Wuku

660
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,320
Liu Xialai

661
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,520
Those who voted for Jiang Xingyun are:

662
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,280
Guo Baoyou

663
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,160
Song Piaoliang

664
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,600
The real "culprit" in this case

665
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,520
is

666
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,400
Sister Bao

667
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,760
Okay

668
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,320
Did we miss any crucial

669
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,720
decisive evidence?

670
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,720
The time-limited hidden crucial evidence everyone missed

671
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,080
is quite well-concealed.

672
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,760
Yes,

673
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
it's in Sister Bao's phone.

674
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,200
We specifically checked her phone,

675
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,080
right, there was nothing in it.

676
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,360
Among the four people in the bookstore,

677
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,440
they were all unconscious

678
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,120
from 10 pm last night

679
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,560
until 8 am this morning.

680
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,440
But on Sister Bao's phone,

681
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,560
if you check the battery in settings,

682
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,400
you can see her screen usage time

683
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,960
shows prolonged activity

684
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,840
last night.

685
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,000
What?

686
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,920
Check her screen time -

687
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,200
usually phones with clues

688
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,840
have evidence right there on display.

689
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,320
Right.

690
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,120
So this is another

691
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,320
point we overlooked.

692
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,800
They're getting really good at this, honestly.

693
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,640
Sister Boom, posing as a fan,

694
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,680
accessed the backend of "Gossip Girl's Gossip Corner"

695
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,800
and privately messaged Gossip Girl.

696
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,080
Gained Bamui's trust

697
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,480
Started luring Bamui step by step

698
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,800
Voluntarily jumped off the building

699
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,840
First, have Sister Ba use "No-Cry Gas" long-term

700
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,560
While her thoughts are in disarray

701
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,640
Guide Sister Ba to develop the obsession of jumping off a building

702
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,200
to verify her viral article's premise

703
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
Four days ago

704
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,600
Jiang Lucky made phone calls

705
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,760
to childhood friends from Happy Home

706
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,360
Nan Fan and Sister Bao

707
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,480
and the late artist Nan's manager

708
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,400
Manager Wu

709
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,800
inviting them to jointly hold

710
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,760
a memorial for the 15th anniversary of Artist Nan's death

711
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,760
Yesterday afternoon

712
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,200
the four came to the venue Jiang Lucky rented

713
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,880
on the 7th floor of Apartment 11

714
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,280
Tuiduo Bookstore

715
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,120
to begin event preparations

716
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,440
Meanwhile, Sister Bao needed to use

717
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,920
this preparation period

718
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,840
to help Sister Ba

719
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,640
open Artist Nan's door

720
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,080
from the inside

721
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,440
and complete the plan to induce Sister Ba

722
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,680
to "commit suicide"

723
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,840
Sister Ba messaged

724
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,880
Sister Bao privately

725
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,400
saying she originally planned tonight

726
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,560
on the evening of July 15th

727
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,800
to go to Artist Nan's home to prepare

728
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
for jumping during daytime tomorrow

729
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,160
on July 16th

730
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,040
to verify her manuscript

731
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,120
But just now when going to Artist Nan's home

732
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,960
she encountered the investigation team on the 9th floor

733
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,440
at Artist Nan's doorstep

734
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,880
and the team said

735
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,520
they'd keep watching the 9th floor corridor from surveillance

736
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,200
until they see her pass by

737
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,000
Under these circumstances,

738
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,480
she couldn't have avoided the surveillance cameras

739
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,200
and used the hallway to jump off the building.

740
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,400
Sister Bao had investigated

741
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,040
the layout of Artist Nan's home

742
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,120
and had long known the bookstore

743
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,880
had a hidden door

744
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,960
that connected to Artist Nan's residence.

745
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,920
Moreover, on the 9th floor hallway

746
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,040
outside Artist Nan's door,

747
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,120
the glass panels were covered with decorative film

748
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,240
that matched the material used

749
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,080
in Artist Nan's work "The Vanishing Painting" -

750
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,120
both used polarizing films.

751
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,720
This coincidentally helped Sister Pa

752
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
conceal her movements.

753
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,600
Through the surveillance footage,

754
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,560
Sister Bao told Sister Pa she could assist her,

755
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,040
but the plan had to be executed tonight

756
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,600
because Sister Bao could only help

757
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,040
during late night when Jiang Lucky, Nan Fan, and Manager Wu

758
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,200
were supposed to be asleep,

759
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,600
to avoid raising suspicion.

760
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,080
That night, around 10 o'clock,

761
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,600
as everyone was preparing for bed,

762
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,280
Sister Bao covered her mouth and nose,

763
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,000
and secretly lit the pre-prepared

764
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,160
"Pushing Enthraller" enhanced knockout smoke.

765
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,720
According to the original plan, Sister Bao needed to knock everyone out

766
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,440
to go to Southern Painter's residence

767
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,000
and open the door for Sister Pa.

768
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,960
After confirming the other three

769
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,160
were in deep ten-hour slumber,

770
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,280
Sister Bao used the bookstore's secret passage

771
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,840
to enter Southern Painter's home.

772
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,520
She removed the frame from "The Vanished Painting,"

773
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,920
attached it to a long easel pole,

774
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,960
and opened Southern Painter's door from inside.

775
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,360
Then, hugging the wall,

776
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,680
she moved to the blind spot beneath the surveillance camera.

777
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,280
She placed the easel pole with polarized frame

778
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,880
on the wooden clamp above the glass display case,

779
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,280
right below the surveillance lens.

780
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,480
After preparations,

781
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,960
she simultaneously turned off

782
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,840
the corridor lights.

783
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,280
At that instant,

784
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,000
she pushed the polarized frame before the lens

785
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,080
and turned the lights back on.

786
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,200
The entire blackout lasted less than one second.

787
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,120
This made others mistakenly believe

788
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,280
the polarized frame's movement before the lens

789
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,560
caused the surveillance feed to black out,

790
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,640
when actually it was the corridor lights flickering.

791
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,720
Now the surveillance lens, layered with polarizing film,

792
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,520
filming through the equally polarized

793
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,480
glass section,

794
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,080
would capture

795
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,160
only light-blocking darkness.

796
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,080
and cannot capture

797
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,120
objects moving normally in this area

798
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,480
Bamei crouched down as agreed

799
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,520
and crawled forward

800
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,760
Sure enough, without being caught on camera

801
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,160
she passed through the surveillance area

802
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,760
After Bamei entered the southern painter's home

803
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,240
Baojie just needed to, before anyone came to check

804
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,200
perform the same maneuver

805
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,720
retrieve and hide the easel pole

806
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,240
push the frame back into position

807
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,800
then return to the bookstore through the secret passage

808
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,920
Go claim your prize, you two.

809
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,600
Go claim your prize.

810
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,200
Go on.

811
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,360
Come on.

812
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,200
How enviable.

813
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,840
There are many aspects to today's case

814
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,080
that are worth reflecting upon

815
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,000
and contemplating.

816
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,080
So let's once again welcome

817
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,680
Professor Ma Ai

818
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,080
from China University of Political Science and Law,

819
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,360
our criminal psychology expert.

820
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,880
Hello everyone.

821
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,760
Please save us.

822
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,280
Hello, Professor Ma.

823
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,040
Good day, Professor Ma.

824
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,800
Hello to you all.

825
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Professor, is there hope for foolishness?

826
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,360
Yes, recognizing your foolishness

827
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,600
means there's already hope.

828
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,000
Is that a compliment for her?

829
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,920
It's a compliment for me.

830
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,440
But professor,

831
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,040
she hasn't realized her own foolishness yet.

832
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,520
In our current case,

833
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,680
the "deceased" was a tabloid reporter.

834
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,160
A tabloid reporter.

835
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,320
Her job

836
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,360
was skilled at stirring up public opinion,

837
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,720
controlling the narrative,

838
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,120
and inciting online harassment.

839
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,480
Exactly.

840
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,880
This online harassment

841
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,360
is actually a relatively new form

842
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,800
right?

843
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,320
It harms people,

844
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,280
and it wounds the heart.

845
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,400
"Destroying both body and spirit."

846
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,480
Exactly.

847
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,000
It often drives people to suicide.

848
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,080
Yes.

849
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,400
Cases of people jumping to their deaths

850
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,440
due to online harassment.

851
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:16,720
Right.

852
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,320
But now we're seeing more and more

853
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,080
cases where people outside

854
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,120
this industry suffer online harassment

855
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,720
and consequently take their own lives.

856
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,680
Celebrities are public figures by nature,

857
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,680
yes, in the public eye.

858
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,640
But now many ordinary people

859
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,400
just because of certain incidents,

860
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,840
perhaps saying a few words,

861
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,520
immediately face

862
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
A group of people gang up to attack

863
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,640
Drawing them in, right

864
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,440
Yes, cyberbullying

865
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,880
is a typical socio-psychological phenomenon

866
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,520
But now it's gradually

867
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,080
becoming a cultural phenomenon

868
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,480
First,

869
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Anonymity

870
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,200
Anonymity

871
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,880
lets me say things I normally wouldn't dare

872
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,520
and vent emotions

873
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,840
that I'd normally suppress

874
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,680
Right

875
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,320
Second,

876
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,840
we can all see

877
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,720
the diffusion of responsibility

878
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,520
"His death isn't my fault"

879
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,400
When thousands are criticizing him

880
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,920
Right

881
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,160
Exactly

882
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,040
Third,

883
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,120
The internet has a fatal flaw

884
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,520
When we start arguing

885
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,760
If I tell Guo Qilin

886
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,640
"Alright,

887
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,000
I was wrong"

888
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,320
you might somewhat forgive me

889
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,880
Right

890
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,000
Online you can't see

891
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,680
Right

892
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,560
If I don't respond

893
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,080
you think this person

894
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,920
is looking down on you

895
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,680
If I apologize

896
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,600
you might say

897
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,520
"This person is faking it"

898
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,520
If I defend myself

899
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,080
See?

900
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,880
"This person remains unrepentant"

901
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,440
"Making excuses"

902
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,480
Say six of you

903
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,000
are cyberbullying me

904
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,760
If someone speaks up fairly

905
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,880
they become your enemy too

906
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,920
a new target

907
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
So no one steps up

908
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,040
to mediate

909
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,480
Right

910
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,960
Thus cyberbullying

911
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,240
is actually worse than we

912
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,000
Ordinary group violence

913
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,960
has a greater impact on people.

914
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,120
It comes in waves,

915
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,480
escalating continuously.

916
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
If you say something like

917
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,040
"He's scum,"

918
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,640
then

919
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,400
someone else will try to outdo you

920
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,080
by saying something even harsher.

921
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,520
"I'll use even worse language."

922
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,680
Yes, they keep competing,

923
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,560
escalating the rhetoric,

924
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,440
actions,

925
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,720
and emotions.

926
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,760
And what's the final escalation?

927
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,680
The severity of harm increases.

928
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,080
The damage to a person

929
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,400
grows worse and worse.

930
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,960
That's why with cyberbullying,

931
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,320
we all need to be careful.

932
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,120
If each person pours a cup of water,

933
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,480
you might not think much of it.

934
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:24,840
Right.

935
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,920
But if millions of people

936
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,520
each pour a cup,

937
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,640
all at the same time,

938
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,320
it's enough to "drown" someone.

939
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,160
Yet we might not realize

940
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,920
the harm we're causing others.

941
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,160
Yes.

942
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,920
So when we encounter this,

943
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,120
here's the simplest advice I can give:

944
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,080
Just

945
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,800
don't listen,

946
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,480
don't look,

947
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,160
and focus on yourself.

948
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,800
Yes, you're absolutely right.

949
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Otherwise,

950
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,240
you'll only absorb negativity.

951
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,760
Yes, rise above it.

952
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,800
Teacher Ma

953
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,960
Regarding today's case,

954
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,720
the "murderer" was step by step

955
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,880
guiding Bamei to "commit suicide"

956
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,360
Right.

957
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,320
And even told her that by doing this,

958
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,760
she could gain more popularity and traffic

959
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,200
Bamei,

960
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,800
while being completely irrational,

961
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,160
yes,

962
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,560
actually went through with it.

963
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,600
So this behavior

964
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,320
by this "murderer"

965
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,840
what kind of behavior is this?

966
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,160
How is this legally defined?

967
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,240
First we need to understand

968
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,360
Bamei herself is an adult

969
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,080
She has her own civil

970
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,720
and criminal

971
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,360
capacity for independent responsibility.

972
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,320
Therefore,

973
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,920
when this "murderer"

974
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920
continuously instilled

975
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,560
certain ideas into Bamei,

976
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,400
leading to her "suicide",

977
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,840
this "murderer"

978
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,400
bears no criminal responsibility.

979
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,520
I'm just telling you

980
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,360
what happens after "death"

981
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,000
But

982
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,400
as a

983
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,920
adult

984
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,960
adult

985
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,360
you're responsible for your actions

986
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,000
If you choose to do this

987
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,880
she might only bear moral responsibility

988
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,360
This is the first scenario

989
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,080
The second scenario

990
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,480
It seems she was given some drug

991
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,840
Yes, that affected her mental state

992
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,320
They gave her so-called

993
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,560
"Non-crying gas"

994
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:58,920
"Non-crying gas"

995
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,280
Yes, "Non-crying gas"

996
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,560
After causing Bamei's mental disorder

997
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,720
then guided her to "commit suicide"

998
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,280
this constitutes intentional harm

999
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,440
Because she was drugged

1000
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,200
This falls under criminal law jurisdiction

1001
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,760
So these are two scenarios

1002
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,960
One is moral condemnation

1003
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,960
The other is intentional harm

1004
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,680
Understood

1005
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,680
Okay

1006
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,880
Thank you to our teacher Ma for

1007
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,200
the analysis and many suggestions

1008
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,640
Thank you, Teacher Ma

1009
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,320
Thank you, Teacher Ma

1010
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,440
"Let's Start Reasoning"

1011
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,320
See you next week

1012
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,320
Bamei is someone

1013
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,560
who acts very irrationally.

1014
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,520
Blinded by desires for fame and fortune,

1015
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,480
she's lost all reason.

1016
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,000
She would go so far

1017
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,760
as to hurt others for these goals,

1018
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,880
even hurting herself.

1019
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,360
I find it utterly disgusting.

1020
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,320
Yes, I find this kind of thing particularly annoying.

1021
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
Anyway, I think we should try to avoid this.

1022
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,640
So there will be consequences.

1023
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,520
As you've seen.

1024
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,280
Right?

1025
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,320
Yes, try not to do this.

1026
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,440
For those who just seek

1027
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,680
attention or

1028
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,960
try to grab people's attention by

1029
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,520
creating short-lived

1030
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,920
controversies.

1031
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,320
I can only say she's being too short-sighted.

1032
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,520
Calling her short-sighted might be harsh,

1033
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,440
but she really isn't seeing the bigger picture.

1034
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,000
For example, in journalism,

1035
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,680
first there's timeliness -

1036
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,040
news must be current.

1037
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,600
If it's not current, it's not worth reporting.

1038
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,680
Secondly,

1039
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,200
you must ensure the truthfulness

1040
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,480
and completeness of the story.

1041
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,240
These are the most important

1042
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,840
ethical principles for journalists.

1043
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,640
Making up sensational stories

1044
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,080
actually completely

1045
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,640
abandons truthfulness.

1046
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
It's just fabricating nonsense.

1047
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,240
This is

1048
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,160
something I consider

1049
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,880
utterly despicable for journalists.

1050
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,320
But making up stories from pictures -

1051
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,960
this kind of thing -

1052
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,280
how can you even claim

1053
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,200
to be doing journalism?

1054
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,720
Right?

1055
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,760
So

1056
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,600
nowadays,

1057
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,720
why is this kind of

1058
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,680
situation

1059
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,080
so common online?

1060
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:47,960
It's because

1061
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,960
the

1062
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,120
barrier to entry is too low.

1063
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,000
Many social media platforms

1064
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,880
don't verify qualifications.

1065
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,320
Right?

1066
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,960
As long as you have enough followers,

1067
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,840
you become an influencer.

1068
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,760
Then you just spend every day

1069
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,840
so-called "breaking news."

1070
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:02,920
Actually, sometimes

1071
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,120
for example, when we see certain

1072
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,720
insider information

1073
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,320
or exposés

1074
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,000
many things are actually

1075
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
not true

1076
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,880
I hope we can

1077
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
spread more

1078
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,040
relatively accurate information

1079
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,679
Don't sacrifice morality

1080
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,080
just for temporary clicks

1081
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,199
or sensationalism

1082
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,600
When you see such content

1083
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,880
you should think critically

1084
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,320
Don't let superficial things

1085
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,760
dictate your way of thinking

1086
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,639
I think this is actually

1087
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,239
a psychological issue

1088
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,400
namely

1089
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,800
being too eager to show off

1090
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,840
or seek validation

1091
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,280
But actually, I believe

1092
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,920
focusing on your work is what matters

1093
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,520
If you want others to

1094
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,199
notice or like you

1095
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,480
you need to make it

1096
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,639
a sustainable process

1097
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,520
It must start with yourself

1098
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,639
You should learn to

1099
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,239
showcase your strengths

1100
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,120
and let them be recognized

1101
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,639
This is the proper way

1102
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,200
or more positive method

1103
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,920
to attract attention

1104
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,760
Creating viral moments

1105
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,200
to gain temporary

1106
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
applause or attention

1107
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,120
is ultimately fleeting

1108
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,760
I believe the priority should be

1109
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,440
improving your professional skills

1110
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,640
above all else

1111
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,720
Water can carry a boat, but can also capsize it

1112
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,520
This is the principle

1113
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,400
I think we should focus on

1114
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,760
what we need to do

1115
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,640
and do it well

1116
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,560
As for external opinions

1117
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
or evaluations

1118
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,880
they don't really matter

1119
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,520
Friends,

1120
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,720
I can't sleep.

1121
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,240
Think about how we might have

1122
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,520
offended Nan Huajia's

1123
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,800
family child.

1124
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,240
No idea.

1125
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,280
We're not even close with him.

1126
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,040
No clue when we might have provoked

1127
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,600
someone we shouldn't have messed with.

1128
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,720
Did you hear?

1129
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,240
The Tui Hui Cha Detective Agency

1130
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,080
exposed Baojie as the one who instigated

1131
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,600
Xiao Bamei's "suicide."

1132
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,560
Now Baojie

1133
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,240
has been taken away for investigation.

1134
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
See? I told you it was Baojie.

1135
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,760
Right?

1136
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,440
Really?

1137
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,680
How did Tui Hui Cha find this out?

1138
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,520
I also think Baojie

1139
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,000
"killed" Xiao Bamei.

1140
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,160
But I genuinely don't know

1141
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,800
who else I might have wronged.

1142
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,520
Really?

1143
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,240
I thought it was Nan's fans.

1144
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,720
Where did this

1145
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,760
Tui Hui Cha come from?

1146
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,200
Another question:

1147
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,560
Those prophetic dolls before—

1148
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,480
were all placed by him.

1149
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,920
So who warned Bamei this time

1150
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,480
not to investigate Nan Huajia?

1151
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,080
Alright,

1152
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,280
let's get our beauty sleep.

1153
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,200
Is Song Beautiful?

1154
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,840
Is Song pretty?

1155
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,480
I'm Xiao He.

1156
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,160
What's wrong?

1157
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,440
Someone "died."

1158
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,520
The surveillance footage shows

1159
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,680
You were at the crime scene.

1160
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,840
Room 205 at Teng Agency.

1161
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,640
So you're listed as a suspect.

1162
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,080
Let's go.

1163
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,600
the door of Room 205?

1164
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,200
Please wait at the room door.

1165
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,800
Okay.

1166
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,520
I'll go there now.

1167
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,360
No no.

1168
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,680
They say

1169
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,880
I "killed" someone.

1170
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,560
What?

1171
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,440
Let's go check it out.

1172
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,600
走吧

1173
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,240
Why would

1174
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
What brings you here?

1175
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,120
Xiao He asked me to come.

1176
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,440
Xiao He asked me to come here too

1177
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,160
But there's nobody here

1178
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,880
Isn't this Teng Zhongjie's room?

1179
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,560
It's been sealed off

1180
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,720
29th

1181
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,640
At noon today

1182
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,800
There were many playing cards underneath it

1183
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,160
You've been called here too

1184
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,720
I don't know what's going on here

1185
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,880
What do you two mean?

1186
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,840
Didn't Xiao He call and ask us to come?

1187
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,600
He called you too, right?

1188
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,880
What are you doing?

1189
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,120
Why are you here?

1190
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,960
What does this mean?

1191
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,200
The early process of taming one's legs

1192
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,720
It's already been sealed off.

1193
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,840
Tui Huicha Detective Agency.

1194
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,320
Isn't Tui Huicha that...

1195
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,400
agency that's always stealing our business?

1196
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,840
That detective agency.

1197
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,160
After our agency's four hours of...

1198
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,560
online and offline information gathering...

1199
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,160
Following our agency's months-long investigation...

1200
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,000
Manager Wu asked Tui Huicha Detective Agency...

1201
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,960
about stealing our business.

1202
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,320
Right.

1203
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,200
What right do they have to seal this place?

1204
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,600
Tear it down.

1205
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,880
Replace it with ours.

1206
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,360
Tear it off.

1207
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I thought it was really open

1208
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,800
Where's Xiao He?

1209
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,400
He was the one who called us here

1210
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,120
Didn't scare him

1211
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,880
Ended up scaring me instead

1212
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,800
That was a pointless scare

1213
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,480
Why didn't anyone come?

1214
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,880
That was so lame

1215
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,400
You were amazing today

1216
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,000
Of course I was

1217
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,600
What do you want?

1218
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,760
Is there something wrong with you?

1219
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,800
Haven't you always doubted

1220
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,960
my identity?

1221
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,880
Then I'll tell you

1222
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,720
Actually, besides being from Apartment 11,

1223
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,280
I'm also a property management intern,

1224
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,720
and I have another identity.

1225
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,480
That is...

1226
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,360
the founder of Tuihuicha Detective Agency,

1227
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,160
Tuihuicha,

1228
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,120
's son.

1229
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,160
Tuinengha.

1230
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,200
Can I be honest with you?

1231
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,120
Come here, you.

1232
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,680
Your bangs today...

1233
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,720
aren't they parted a bit too high?

1234
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,440
Is that so?

1235
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Then I'll adjust them.

1236
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,800
As for this detective team,

1237
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,520
I've been observing

1238
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,400
your performance closely.

1239
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:39,720
I think...

1240
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,800
you might still be lacking somewhat.

1241
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,560
If the audience thinks we're lacking, fine,

1242
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,280
but even you think we're lacking?

1243
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,720
I have proof.

1244
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,320
I carry this work ID every day,

1245
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,960
but none of you

1246
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,400
wanted to see what's on the back.

1247
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,120
What could it be?

1248
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,240
We're not that curious about you.

1249
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,800
Tuinengha,

1250
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,600
detective.

1251
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,440
Tuihuicha Detective Agency.

1252
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,040
Do you know who lives in 205?

1253
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,800
Teng Zhongjie.

1254
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,520
Teng Zhongjie.

1255
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,800
Yes, it's Teng Zhongjie.

1256
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,480
I am...

1257
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,080
the much-beloved Teng Zhongjie.

1258
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,840
Because I received

1259
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,960
a commission from Teng Zhongjie,

1260
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,760
that's why I came.

1261
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,840
Tuihuicha Detective Agency.

1262
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,040
I sealed this off

1263
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,960
to protect the crime scene,

1264
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,240
because when I entered,

1265
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,040
I found Teng Zhongjie

1266
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,880
"dead" inside.

1267
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,720
Come, follow me inside.

1268
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,960
"Dead"

1269
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,600
When I arrived here at noon today

1270
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,080
he was already in this state

1271
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:08,800
Come

1272
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,240
Step back

1273
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,960
Move back

1274
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,640
Won't let us in

1275
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,520
Back

1276
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,240
Back

1277
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,560
Back

1278
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,400
Okay

1279
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,200
What does this mean?

1280
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,800
When I came here at noon today

1281
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,560
No matter how I knocked

1282
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,240
Agent Teng wouldn't answer

1283
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,560
So I bent down

1284
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,240
and first checked the door

1285
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,440
Through the door gap

1286
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,360
I actually saw

1287
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,280
that these playing cards

1288
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,600
were stacked in a tower shape

1289
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,280
placed over there

1290
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,560
Meaning before I entered

1291
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,960
this door hadn't been opened

1292
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,360
This glass

1293
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,160
Why

1294
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,640
When I came here at noon

1295
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,720
I noticed

1296
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,480
there was a

1297
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,080
small gap in the frosted glass

1298
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,560
Through this gap

1299
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,120
I saw

1300
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,440
Teng Zhongjie collapsed inside

1301
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,800
He wasn't responding to my shouts

1302
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,120
So I got really worried

1303
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,640
That's why I broke

1304
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,680
this glass door

1305
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,400
You broke this, right?

1306
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,960
Yes, I broke it

1307
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,240
I used this hammer to break it

1308
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,280
Why were you carrying a hammer?

1309
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,360
About the hammer

1310
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,040
It was here

1311
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,160
There's a toolbox here, right?

1312
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,520
I found it in this toolbox

1313
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,520
After breaking it

1314
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,560
I was able to unlock

1315
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,880
the door from inside

1316
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,440
and then entered

1317
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,080
When I entered

1318
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,560
this door was intact

1319
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,560
No one had entered

1320
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,000
Because the door was locked from inside

1321
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,440
As for the outer door

1322
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,440
before I kicked it open

1323
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,520
this house of cards

1324
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,960
was perfectly built

1325
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,280
against the closed door

1326
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,240
meaning the door hadn't been opened

1327
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,440
A "locked room" murder case

1328
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,160
Exactly

1329
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,160
Based on my deduction

1330
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,120
I believe it must be

1331
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,680
someone created a double locked room

1332
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,560
Double locked room

1333
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,200
Yes

1334
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,200
Because I just checked

1335
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,600
yesterday's surveillance footage

1336
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,240
and found only you six

1337
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,000
had come here

1338
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,720
What were you doing here last night?

1339
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,160
I was...

1340
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,080
Just some personal matters.

1341
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,880
Did Teng Zhongjie invite you?

1342
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,280
Or were you looking for Teng Zhongjie?

1343
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,240
Teng Zhongjie invited me.

1344
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:21,880
He invited you?

1345
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,800
Yes, he invited me.

1346
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,520
Do you have any proof?

1347
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,680
He gave me a small note.

1348
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,080
This is...

1349
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,200
Why right from the start...

1350
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,560
I'm already presenting evidence?

1351
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,600
What?

1352
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,680
Did you actually see him?

1353
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,040
No.

1354
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,280
No.

1355
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,600
I could only see his

1356
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,280
feet. Just his feet.

1357
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:44,920
His feet were sticking out.

1358
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,800
But from the voice, it sounded like him.

1359
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,800
It was him.

1360
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,800
Did you talk to him?

1361
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,720
Yes.

1362
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,840
You talked? About everything?

1363
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,680
Yes.

1364
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,520
Did you enter his bedroom?

1365
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,440
No.

1366
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,800
I looked through a small crack in the door

1367
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,400
to see inside.

1368
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:05,880
Right.

1369
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,920
Just enough to see his feet.

1370
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,480
This spot.

1371
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,280
Why did you come here yesterday?

1372
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,840
Care to explain?

1373
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,000
Why should we?

1374
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,680
Just because you ask doesn't mean we'll tell.

1375
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,600
We don't have to explain just because you say so.

1376
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,080
Why should we explain?

1377
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,280
I don't want to talk about this now.

1378
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,400
It has nothing to do with this matter.

1379
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,280
I don't want to discuss it.

1380
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,480
Some secrets can't be shared.

1381
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,800
It's none of your business.

1382
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,040
What's this about?

1383
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,400
It's inconvenient.

1384
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,000
No, I don't remember, I don't know.

1385
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,200
Irrelevant to the case.

1386
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,520
Not related to this case.

1387
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,720
You've done your homework on this.

1388
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,760
As a detective, right?

1389
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,560
I won't make you talk for nothing.

1390
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,640
I have evidence to confront you with.

1391
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,960
Indeed.

1392
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,320
Indeed.

1393
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,560
This was given to me by Teng Zhongjie.

1394
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,600
A letter.

1395
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,680
He knows everything about you.

1396
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:04,640
Come

1397
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,640
Come on

1398
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,080
Come

1399
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,800
Respected Tui Huicha Detective Agency

1400
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,560
I'd like to request a reinvestigation

1401
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,400
Three years ago

1402
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,800
Specifically in 2019

1403
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,000
July 30th

1404
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,320
In the woods beside Tui Lihai Avenue

1405
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,600
A "corpse burning" case occurred

1406
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,240
"Corpse burning" case

1407
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,240
Then it was erased later

1408
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,360
Yes, because it rained

1409
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,840
So it got a bit blurred

1410
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,720
Several people

1411
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,440
Led to

1412
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,200
Teacher Lou

1413
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:31,800
"Death"

1414
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,200
One of them was my sister, Xiao Bamei

1415
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,520
Xiao Bamei is his sister

1416
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,360
The others

1417
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,120
Are currently residents of Apartment No. 11

1418
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:40,520
Bai Sanwan

1419
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,000
Song Piaoliang

1420
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,440
Guo Baoyou

1421
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:41,840
Zhou Keke

1422
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,240
Liu Xialai

1423
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:42,920
Ke Wuku

1424
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,880
Be sure to come the day after tomorrow

1425
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,960
which is July 29th

1426
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,120
Friday at noon

1427
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,480
Meet me at Apartment 11, Room 205

1428
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,360
We'll discuss in detail then

1429
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,480
This is from the 27th

1430
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,080
Xiao Bamei is Teng Zhongjie's sister

1431
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,760
Isn't his sister Xiao Mian?

1432
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,360
Right, is she the one you were following?

1433
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,760
Bro, he was following your sister

1434
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,280
Bro, look

1435
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,000
This is your sister accusing him

1436
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
He was stalking your sister

1437
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,640
No

1438
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,840
I can explain

1439
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,240
They're both his sisters

1440
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,800
Seems you're quite familiar with his sisters

1441
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,240
Followed them

1442
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:23,680
What do you mean "followed"?

1443
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,840
And escorted them home

1444
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,920
You've followed so many girls

1445
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,520
Haven't you followed Bamei?

1446
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,640
No, I haven't

1447
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,880
Bamei was too hard to follow

1448
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,560
Because I saw in this letter

1449
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,400
mention of a name - Teacher Lou

1450
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,400
So I did some investigation

1451
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,920
It's in my phone

1452
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,800
Let me screen share it for everyone

1453
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,960
Here, Bamei investigates

1454
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,160
Now let me show you

1455
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,480
Hello everyone

1456
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,600
This is "Bamei Investigates"

1457
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,400
I'm Bamei

1458
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,040
July 30, 2019

1459
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,680
In the small woods beside

1460
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,360
Tuilihai Avenue in Tui City

1461
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,160
Yes, near Apartment 11

1462
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,600
a heinous murder occurred

1463
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,320
The "victim" was a female student

1464
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,120
After being "murdered" in the woods

1465
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,800
her body was cruelly "burned"

1466
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,680
It is reported that the female student was outstanding in both character and academics during her lifetime.

1467
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,560
She was extremely well-liked.

1468
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,840
She rarely had conflicts with others.

1469
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,440
However, she recently had close contact with her teacher,

1470
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,360
Teacher Lou.

1471
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,200
They were in relatively frequent contact.

1472
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,240
An insider revealed that

1473
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,840
Teacher Lou's private life was very chaotic,

1474
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,760
and he had unusual preferences.

1475
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,080
Therefore, based on solid evidence,

1476
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,440
we can reconstruct that

1477
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,160
the last person the "deceased" saw

1478
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,880
before her death

1479
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,000
might have been Teacher Lou.

1480
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,920
Moreover, she had discovered

1481
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,680
one of Teacher Lou's secrets,

1482
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,520
which led Teacher Lou to take action against her.

1483
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,440
Just yesterday

1484
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,400
Teacher Lou "committed suicide out of guilt"

1485
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,240
We can fully believe

1486
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,000
that he used his death

1487
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,760
to escape the sins he committed

1488
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,280
This is Bamie Exposé

1489
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,080
bringing you more uncovered truths

1490
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,600
From this information

1491
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,520
we can see

1492
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,200
that in the past "corpse burning" case

1493
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,040
the victim "killed"

1494
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,280
was a female student

1495
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,760
The "culprit" identified at the time

1496
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,400
was Teacher Lou

1497
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,280
Based on Teng Zhongjie's letter

1498
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,640
I strongly suspect

1499
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,040
that Teng Zhongjie's "death" is connected

1500
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,440
to the "corpse burning" case three years ago

1501
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,080
and all six of you

1502
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,520
are involved

1503
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,200
I suspect there might be

1504
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,480
a "murderer" among you

1505
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,280
Before click rates and money,

1506
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,000
truth and conscience become worthless.

1507
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,200
Teng Zhongjie is "dead".

1508
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,040
If this "evil demon" isn't eliminated, there will be consequences.

1509
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,560
The "corpse burning" case in the grove.

1510
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,560
A young girl in her prime

1511
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,520
met a tragic end.

1512
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,640
He is the source of everything.

1513
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,800
The prime culprit.

1514
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,760
Among you six,

1515
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,960
there is one "murderer".

1516
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,440
Zhou Keke, look what you've done!

1517
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,600
I "killed" someone.

1518
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,400
"Ran over" someone to death,

1519
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,320
and took things from their body.

1520
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,400
Because we share the same blood type,

1521
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,440
I used you as a container for kidneys.

1522
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,680
He really deserves to "die".

1523
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,320
Then I "killed" Teng Zhongjie.

1524
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,320
He "ran over" Xiao Jing to death,

1525
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,400
then "burned the corpse".

1526
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,400
Rage rose from the heart,

1527
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,320
evil grew from the gall.

1528
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,240
It was you who "caused his death".

1529
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,160
Outrageous!

1530
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:15,600
Disgraceful!

1531
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,120
Shameful!

1532
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,480
A young girl actually did such things.

1533
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,040
I advise you all to stop clamoring.

1534
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,400
We are all "murderers".

1535
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,760
The women in our building cry,

1536
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,400
their wails...

1537
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,120
This "pervert"!

1538
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,040
Catch him!

1539
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,120
She is the most perfect

1540
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,120
thing in this world.

1541
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:30,960
If I had such a child,

1542
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,360
I would have "strangled" them with my own hands long ago.

1543
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,840
May these two go to "hell" together.

1544
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,400
This was edited by him.

1545
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,160
Since you know the truth,

1546
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,320
then you can wait to "die".

1547
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,240
Bring him back to me,

1548
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,280
this "murderer".

1549
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:43,960
When an avalanche occurs,

1550
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,600
no snowflake is innocent.

00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,280
