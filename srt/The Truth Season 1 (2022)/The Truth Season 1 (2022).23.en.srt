1
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,720
The doll "killed" someone

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,440
This curtain only descends when the entire room's

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,240
lights are turned off

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,760
Its string

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,160
just blocks the edge of that mirror

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,000
from view

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,760
Your sister has serious issues

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,920
Let's play hide-and-seek together

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,320
Hide quickly

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,480
I want to get out

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,480
Can we go now?

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,240
It's open.

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,120
Liu

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,520
Bai

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,400
They're both down there

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,480
Liu

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,520
They came out

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:16,960
Bro

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,720
Damn, both of them are gone

20
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,480
Someone got taken

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,520
We're missing someone

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Brother Bai

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,200
Old Liu

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,160
Bro

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,720
Liu

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,960
Did they really disappear?

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,240
Do you remember what they said

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,880
The dolls will invite you to play games

29
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,640
Right

30
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,160
Come

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,440
Play games

32
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,920
So they went with the puppet

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,520
To play games

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:43,880
Yes

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,440
Can we turn on the lights here?

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,160
It's here, right?

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,760
Let's look around

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,880
They were hiding here just now, right?

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,240
Right

40
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,080
What about up there?

41
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,560
Is there anything up there?

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,520
There's nothing up there

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,120
Really?

44
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,440
Can this door be opened?

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,840
It can

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,200
They were just hiding inside

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,320
They just hid in there

48
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,920
And then left

49
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,000
But now it won't open

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,600
Right

51
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,240
It's locked

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,760
Are you there?

53
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,480
Did they really disappear?

54
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,000
No, or did they?

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Impossible

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Then they must have really disappeared

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,480
Just gone

58
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,680
Can't

59
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,400
Doesn't feel like it

60
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,320
This is just a movable box

61
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,800
Right

62
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's go first

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,320
Go

64
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Wait a second

65
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,720
How many people can fit inside this?

66
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,800
We can fit one more

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,320
No

68
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,000
Actually

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,360
Come

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,200
Can we really squeeze in here?

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,400
Are we really going to pack like this?

72
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,480
We can squeeze

73
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,680
How many people did we cram in?

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,080
Launch

75
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,960
Where is this going?

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,160
They're here

77
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,120
You're ignoring us

78
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,560
We were over there

79
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,760
Screaming our lungs out for you

80
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,440
But you didn't come

81
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,080
What's wrong with you?

82
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,800
They've turned into...

83
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,320
...into puppets

84
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,600
Where did you just go?

85
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,320
Where were you just now?

86
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,760
What's going on?

87
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,560
Where have you been?

88
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,680
What?

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,160
Don't talk to him.

90
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,760
If they keep repeating the same phrase,

91
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,920
Right, they turn into puppets.

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,480
Be wary of companions who got separated from you.

93
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,160
Especially when they keep

94
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,800
repeating the same words.

95
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,040
Stop joking around.

96
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,840
They've started repeating the same phrase.

97
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,800
Where did you guys go?

98
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,600
This must be Brother Bai's idea.

99
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,440
Are you guys okay?

100
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,920
Let's go.

101
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,800
It's just the two of us left.

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,960
Who cares who's left.

103
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,720
Is this a pillar or something?

104
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,040
There's a hand under me.

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,920
We're holding a leg.

106
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,120
We'll hit anyone who dares to come near.

107
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,720
I don't care (I'm telling you).

108
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,960
I've got a hand now.

109
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,440
I don't care.

110
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,320
I've got a leg now.

111
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,360
I'll hit anyone who comes near.

112
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,720
Let's mess with them later.

113
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Let's pick a phrase and keep repeating it.

114
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,960
"You're all going to die."

115
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,600
No.

116
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,640
Too direct.

117
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,800
Let's pretend to be like...

118
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,280
Those very human-like dolls.

119
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,000
For example...

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,920
"Where did you just go?"

121
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Keep asking that.

122
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,280
Okay.

123
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,080
Okay.

124
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
"Where did you just go?"

125
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,240
Are you never going to stop?

126
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,400
Mocking us.

127
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
"Where did you just go?"

128
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,560
They revived it, right?

129
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,600
"Where did you just go?"

130
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,560
He just won't stop.

131
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,560
Where did you go just now?

132
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,720
Where were you just now?

133
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,120
Where have you been?

134
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,640
Where'd you go earlier?

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,720
Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Melon Ice

136
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,800
How is this exactly the same...

137
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,560
...as what I just developed?

138
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,720
We've discovered...

139
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,480
...a huge secret.

140
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:27,760
Come...

141
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,040
Quick!

142
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,040
Song Piaoliang!

143
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:32,960
Zhao Budao!

144
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,120
Read this carefully.

145
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,440
This is yours.

146
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,360
Read it yourself.

147
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,240
Go ahead and read it.

148
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,600
At 28, met a "scumbag"...

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,120
Although once happy...

150
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,920
...but ended up deeply hurt.

151
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,760
Got proposed to at 28...

152
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,600
What's there to read about this?

153
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,320
Didn't you see this part?

154
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,040
You wrote this.

155
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,920
I didn't write this.

156
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,840
This is Lai Wan'ou...

157
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,240
...designing my life.

158
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,920
Every doll...

159
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,120
...has this signature underneath...

160
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,440
...Lai Wan'ou's signature.

161
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,040
This is Lai...

162
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,000
Look at Zhao Budao's...

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What does it say?

164
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,320
At 6, separated from mother and lived on streets...

165
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,440
At 18, attended Chicago Affiliated High School...

166
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,080
...never transferred.

167
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,360
I was admitted to Chicago Affiliated High School...

168
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,280
...funded by a stranger.

169
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,040
Who was this person?

170
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,600
Lai Wan'ou.

171
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,280
It must be this person.

172
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,360
It plans their lives...

173
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:24,880
...brainwashes them...

174
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,000
...like in "The Truman Show".

175
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,640
"The Truman Show"...

176
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,480
Right, we stopped obeying...

177
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,560
It's right beside us, giving us...

178
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,320
...medicine to take.

179
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,200
You two also had motive to "kill" him...

180
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,560
...including your mother...

181
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,480
...also had motive to "kill" him.

182
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,080
Why don't you look for your mother?

183
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,680
I can barely remember what she looks like now.

184
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,240
I remember my mother made a living by selling paintings.

185
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,920
And I would often with my mother...

186
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,840
sing a song together.

187
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,720
Called "Little Red Riding Hood."

188
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,800
Little Red Riding Hood...

189
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,360
wearing colorful clothes...

190
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,760
If Little Red Riding Hood wore flashy clothes, how ridiculous would that be?

191
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,720
How does "Little Red Riding Hood" go again?

192
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,440
I walk alone on the country path...

193
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,040
Bringing treats for grandma to taste.

194
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,680
Then I remember when I was little, there was one book

195
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,520
Our home only had one fairy tale book

196
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,440
called "The Nutcracker"

197
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,640
"The Nutcracker"

198
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,480
"The Nutcracker"

199
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,960
Isn't "The Nutcracker"

200
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,680
also that puppet being controlled?

201
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,920
"The Nutcracker" is about a little girl

202
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,280
who receives a gift

203
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,440
It's a doll

204
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,800
Suddenly mice invade

205
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,200
and try to harm her

206
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,800
Then the doll transforms into

207
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,880
a real person -

208
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,200
a soldier

209
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,000
to protect her, becoming a soldier to defend her

210
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,120
So when someone tries to harm

211
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,320
when someone tries to hurt me

212
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,880
it will stand up to protect you

213
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,400
Have you all searched here?

214
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,920
No, we haven't.

215
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,640
Haven't checked this one?

216
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,280
No.

217
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,000
Found a doll.

218
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,120
If I could start over,

219
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,080
I'd want fame early.

220
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,120
If I could restart, I'd seek early fame.

221
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,960
This is Singer Zhang's doll.

222
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,840
Singer Zhang's doll.

223
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,520
And you didn't find it either.

224
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,880
Singer Zhang's paper, right?

225
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,720
No.

226
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,080
Only you two have papers.

227
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,160
Let's keep this for now.

228
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,200
Couldn't find Singer Zhang's paper.

229
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,680
Let's search around more.

230
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,280
What's this?

231
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,080
What is this?

232
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,560
Here comes Singer Zhang's life story.

233
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,920
Singer Zhang's letter was torn up.

234
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,720
Started practicing singing/dancing at 5.

235
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,640
At 15, won:

236
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,960
Gold in "Sing Well" competition.

237
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,080
Gold in "Dance Great" contest.

238
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
Age 16:

239
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,520
A little secret nobody knew -

240
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,000
Had a crush on a classmate.

241
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,120
Became a big star.

242
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,040
Wanted to be as great as him.

243
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,480
At 25, in a vegetable market,

244
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,000
a talent scout knelt with cauliflower,

245
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,160
shouting "Singer Zhang, you're my pick!"

246
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,280
then discovered her.

247
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,520
As songwriter, couldn't produce hits,

248
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,800
was mocked.

249
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,160
Father passed away.

250
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,880
Later tried out for

251
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,480
a show but got rejected.

252
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,680
Finally left the group.

253
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,520
Why was only hers torn up?

254
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,000
She must have...

255
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,800
I think she read it herself.

256
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,880
She came here,

257
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,680
then tore it up.

258
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,440
Right, she saw it.

259
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,360
She was always being

260
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,320
controlled in life.

261
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,200
Then Singer Zhang

262
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
had motive to "kill" him.

263
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,240
What should we do now?

264
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,200
Should we go back and look again?

265
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,280
Let's retrace our steps.

266
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,280
Let's go.

267
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,240
Let's split into groups.

268
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,720
I'm leaving.

269
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,920
Alright, see them out.

270
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,400
So boring

271
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,600
The few of us

272
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,960
are opening

273
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,160
seems like

274
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
are closing

275
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,280
It's open

276
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,200
Welcome to "Push You Bar"

277
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,640
Push you

278
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,240
We still have one that's not open here

279
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is where you insert the key

280
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,240
Wait a moment

281
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,560
Did you just pick up a key?

282
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,840
Come, let's see what's written here

283
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,840
Notice: I've decided from today onward

284
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,880
to use new technology for making dolls

285
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,120
Doll warehouse key

286
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,880
Found the key

287
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,320
We can open the door now

288
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,440
Where did you find the key?

289
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,480
In that room we were just in

290
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,640
Okay, someone please

291
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,600
Come on, let's get that

292
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,000
Puppet

293
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,480
No

294
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,080
Puppet

295
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,320
Come here, puppet

296
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,960
Activate

297
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,040
Are you defaulting me as the puppet?

298
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,240
Doesn't matter, you're it anyway

299
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,120
This is awesome

300
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,760
Super awesome

301
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,200
This isn't Song Piaoliang

302
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,040
Free-spirited Zhao Budao

303
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,000
Your doll is here

304
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,400
No

305
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,800
Wait

306
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,800
People all want to live

307
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,160
a life as orderly as clockwork

308
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,040
doing the expected things at the expected ages

309
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,920
But the beauty of life

310
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,760
lies in the fact that everyone

311
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,960
has their own life rhythm

312
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,200
We should become our unique selves

313
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,240
rather than conforming to standard answers

314
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,640
Those chasing after society's clock

315
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,560
are like soulless dolls

316
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,080
This is why I created these

317
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,560
new dolls

318
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,720
Start learning from ages 0 to 5

319
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,000
Don't fall behind at the starting line

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,400
Aim for perfect scores from ages 5 to 10

321
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,240
Be the top performer

322
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,560
Between ages 10 to 15

323
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,200
Prepare for college entrance exams

324
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,880
Absolutely no dating allowed

325
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,800
From ages 15 to 20

326
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,880
Attend a prestigious university

327
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,640
Study a promising major

328
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,680
Secure a good job and work hard

329
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
Where's the freedom in this?

330
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,760
Exactly

331
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,920
Then from ages 20 to 25

332
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,760
Achieve fame while young

333
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,040
Don't fall behind your peers

334
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,480
Singer Zhang

335
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Like Singer Zhang

336
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,880
From ages 25 to 30

337
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,600
Marry the perfect partner and have children

338
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,440
Just like you mentioned earlier

339
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
You have this wish to

340
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,120
get married before 30

341
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,400
From 30 to 35, establish career success

342
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,840
Own luxury homes and cars

343
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,160
From 35 to 40

344
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Raise a perfect child

345
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,800
Save retirement funds for parents

346
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,720
From 40 to 45

347
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,360
Start building your own retirement fund

348
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,440
From 45 to 50

349
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,720
Care for aging parents

350
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,400
From 50 to 55

351
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,000
Find suitable partners for your children

352
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,080
From 55 to 60

353
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,920
Reach retirement age

354
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,080
Enjoy family happiness

355
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,640
This is actually a step-by-step

356
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,600
life blueprint

357
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,040
You see

358
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,400
0-5, 5-10

359
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,440
What this means is

360
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,720
Everyone in our society

361
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,160
now lives

362
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,840
trapped in this rigid pattern

363
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,600
Chasing the social clock

364
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,240
Like soulless puppets

365
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,200
So the reason we became

366
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,880
his targets

367
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,640
is precisely because

368
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,880
we have these mandatory life plans

369
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,400
Exactly

370
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,920
There's also a bag.

371
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,280
Come on.

372
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,520
Let's go.

373
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,640
Let's search that bag.

374
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,160
Why is there a crowbar here?

375
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,280
What's this for prying?

376
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,160
"The Nutcracker"

377
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,280
This was written by her mother.

378
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,360
So this bag belongs to her mother?

379
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,960
But her mother's belongings...

380
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,240
Why are they here?

381
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,480
So her mother has been here.

382
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,440
Yes, her mother came here.

383
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,680
Crowbar.

384
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,320
Was this used to pry these two dolls open?

385
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,880
Whose doll was pried?

386
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,440
She should have pried her own daughter's then.

387
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,840
Take a look at Zhao Budao's doll.

388
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,320
Here, look.

389
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,400
There are prying marks on the back.

390
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,920
Did her mother try to pry it?

391
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,280
Then realized it couldn't be pried open.

392
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,080
Because outside they said the illegal intruder...

393
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,800
wasn't just Song Piaoliang alone.

394
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
So her mother got rid of that person

395
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,240
eliminated him

396
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,520
Yes

397
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,280
We should leave now, right?

398
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,360
There don't seem to be any more clues here

399
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,080
We need a password

400
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,600
to get out

401
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,080
What numbers have we found so far?

402
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,120
Come, let's see what's written here

403
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,640
Notice

404
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,400
I've decided that starting today

405
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,720
I'll use new technology to make dolls

406
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,480
Come to the doll

407
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,440
April 1st

408
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,440
How do you open this?

409
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,360
I think I've figured out the trick.

410
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,760
Hello.

411
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,440
So how's the evidence gathering going?

412
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,120
Any suspects yet?

413
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,040
Could you call Singer Zhang?

414
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,680
And Zhao Budao's mother.

415
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,560
Okay.

416
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,480
We'll be waiting in the property management's surveillance room.

417
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,240
See you there.

418
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,920
Let's recap

419
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,080
what happened today

420
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,720
Today is

421
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,320
July 8, 2022

422
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,200
We were invited by Song Piaoliang

423
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,240
to visit Song Piaoliang's handicraft store

424
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,280
where we met a very strange woman

425
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,840
It's okay, we

426
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,800
Take it easy, it's fine

427
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,800
She said she's been searching for her daughter

428
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,480
"This is my daughter, I've been looking for her"

429
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,640
named Zhao Budao

430
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,680
Then following what the woman said

431
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,240
Look at this

432
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,680
there's a

433
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,920
doll exhibition hall on the second floor

434
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,560
We went to the Life Doll Exhibition Hall

435
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,240
But when we tried to enter

436
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,880
the door had no switch

437
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,000
so we

438
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,800
could only look inside through the glass

439
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,280
There was a long corridor

440
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,320
and we saw someone in white clothes

441
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,560
Someone collapsed

442
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,320
At that moment all of us

443
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
were still outside

444
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,840
Right

445
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,640
Could that possibly be Zhao Budao?

446
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,320
Possibly

447
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,080
Could be

448
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,680
Because she arrived late

449
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,080
Quick, save them! Go in and help! Hurry!

450
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,120
So we went through the back door

451
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,320
and entered that exhibition hall

452
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,160
We found something

453
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,360
On the stage

454
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,000
There's a face painted like a clown

455
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,080
Wearing the same clothes as the mischievous magician

456
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,880
A "corpse" dressed identically

457
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,720
Is this "victim" really the doll performer?

458
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,880
The doll designer?

459
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,120
Not necessarily

460
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,080
Not confirmed

461
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,560
For now we think it resembles him

462
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,880
Because his face is also painted

463
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Right

464
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,480
During the investigation

465
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,000
We've temporarily identified three suspects

466
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,360
Namely:

467
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,960
Zhao Budao

468
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,120
's mother

469
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,800
What a pause

470
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,760
Zhao Budao's mother

471
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,280
Then Song Piaoliang and Singer Zhang

472
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,920
Should we question Zhao's mother first?

473
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,760
Let's go find Zhao's mother

474
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,720
Zhao Budao's mother

475
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,600
Mom is normal now

476
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,120
Mom please sit, auntie please sit

477
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,520
I don't know

478
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,560
Ready

479
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,960
Mom

480
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,560
Zhao Zhao

481
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,720
You don't recognize mom anymore?

482
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,560
I don't recognize

483
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,400
She hasn't seen her for over ten years

484
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,200
Yes

485
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,680
Aren't you called Zhao Budao?

486
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,200
Yes

487
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,880
Then you are my daughter

488
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,040
Come to mom, okay?

489
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,000
Let mom hug you

490
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,079
It's been so long

491
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,359
since you've seen your daughter

492
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,280
How can you prove that after she grew up

493
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,560
she would look like me?

494
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,480
I saw you

495
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,720
I don't remember mom

496
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,400
what she looks like anymore

497
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,200
I got lost when I was very young

498
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,520
Please sit first

499
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,400
Auntie, you sit first

500
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,120
Okay, mom will sit first

501
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,160
Mom will talk with you slowly

502
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,960
Zhao Zhao

503
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,240
You say you don't recognize mom

504
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,040
I'm wondering if you're mad at mom

505
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,000
You still hate mom, don't you?

506
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,280
Zhao Zhao, you were born in 2004, right?

507
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,600
In 2010

508
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,040
My Zhao Zhao got lost once

509
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,880
Got lost

510
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,440
Yes

511
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,160
At that time I was painting

512
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,800
Making a living

513
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,400
Once the child went out to buy soy sauce

514
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
A six-year-old child

515
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,120
Could she carry such heavy soy sauce?

516
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,720
Half of the soy sauce got spilled

517
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,760
I got angry when she came back

518
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,320
I scolded the child

519
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,200
The child got angry and ran away

520
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,400
I was doing business at the time

521
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,240
I didn't have time to chase after her

522
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
As a result of leaving like that

523
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,080
She disappeared

524
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,960
Since then, I've had trouble controlling my emotions.

525
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,200
I often need to take medication.

526
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,160
Once a day.

527
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,400
It keeps me calm for twelve hours.

528
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,360
It keeps me calm.

529
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,280
I have...

530
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,880
This.

531
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,600
Show this to the kids.

532
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,880
There's an automatic reminder on it.

533
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,440
I take the medicine when the alarm goes off.

534
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
Today I took the medicine at 11:30.

535
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,840
Took it at 11:30.

536
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,320
So the person we met...

537
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,200
wasn't in her right mind.

538
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,320
Right, she didn't eat at eleven.

539
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,840
She's very calm now.

540
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,760
Yes, twelve hours.

541
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,480
Auntie, I'd like to ask you...

542
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,040
About this pillbox of yours...

543
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,760
How often do you usually refill it?

544
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,920
I refill when it's empty.

545
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,640
Just refill when empty.

546
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,040
Before taking them this morning...

547
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,800
how many pills were in your box?

548
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
I'm completely lucid now.

549
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,240
I want to ask you...

550
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,800
When you're sick with a cold or fever...

551
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,480
if you use a small pillbox for medicine...

552
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,040
would you count how many pills are inside?

553
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,000
Zhao Zhao...

554
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,160
Mom wants to ask you...

555
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,400
When you were little...

556
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,120
you loved singing a particular nursery rhyme...

557
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,680
"I walk alone on the country path..."

558
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,720
I've

559
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,800
found it

560
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,720
This is

561
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,640
This is your real daughter

562
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,160
Mom

563
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,080
Son

564
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,880
Zhao Zhao, are you Zhao Zhao? Zhao Zhao

565
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,640
You're Liu Budao

566
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,680
Zhao Zhao

567
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,400
Liu Budao

568
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,880
Liu Buliao

569
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,360
You're all bad people

570
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,040
I've lost my child for so long

571
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
And you're still laughing here

572
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,560
Auntie, did you write this?

573
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
This is the missing person notice her mother printed.

574
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,640
This is what I drew.

575
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,680
These are the people I can't remember.

576
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,760
There are fifteen of them.

577
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,920
What does this mean?

578
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,040
Didn't you write these words?

579
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,680
Yes, but they all say they don't recognize them.

580
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,040
Who was your homeroom teacher?

581
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,800
Sit down, let me explain properly.

582
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,080
I remember I once

583
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,280
found our Zhao Zhao.

584
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,040
A month ago,

585
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,320
in my mind,

586
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,240
there was clearly a vivid image.

587
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,480
Extremely clear.

588
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,760
You see,

589
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,640
we all have these clear images

590
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,120
from when you were growing up.

591
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,640
You and I

592
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,920
lived together for about three years.

593
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,360
Zhao Zhao was in high school then,

594
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,200
at Niubanjin High School.

595
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,640
Her grades were excellent,

596
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,200
and she got into university.

597
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,080
I remember I even

598
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,640
helped her choose her major.

599
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,320
It was called

600
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,040
Finance Department.

601
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,040
But this memory

602
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,800
might just be a reaction to your medication,

603
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,400
right?

604
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,800
Are you saying that after taking medicine,

605
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,160
I just had this muddled reaction?

606
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,120
No.

607
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,200
I didn't attend Niubanjin.

608
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,320
I went to the affiliated high school in Zhijiadi.

609
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,720
Her paper mentioned studying finance,

610
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,840
but it was crossed out.

611
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,760
How is this similar to that imaginary,

612
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,280
vague boyfriend she mentioned?

613
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,680
Yes.

614
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,560
Isn't it?

615
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,360
They all seem to have this same hallucination.

616
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,840
They experience certain hallucinations.

617
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,960
I always feel like

618
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,840
I'm dating

619
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,040
a man whose face I can't see clearly.

620
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,600
My mind is in complete chaos right now.

621
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,280
After seeing that footage,

622
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,120
I went to Niubanjin Middle School.

623
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,840
I asked her homeroom teacher from back then,

624
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,560
and her former classmates.

625
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,040
They all said

626
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,840
they didn't know her.

627
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,120
I was extremely disappointed. I didn't know

628
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,720
what exactly went wrong.

629
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
Until

630
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,800
five days ago,

631
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,160
I received new footage.

632
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,120
Something came back to me.

633
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,840
It's you

634
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
saw Song Piaoliang

635
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,960
She was in that footage

636
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,400
She was my daughter's

637
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,040
best friend growing up

638
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,280
but this memory was also erased

639
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,960
So

640
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,640
I tried many methods

641
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,280
and finally found Piaoliang

642
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
We met

643
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,920
Yes

644
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,640
But didn't I tell you then

645
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,680
I don't remember

646
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,800
Right, you don't remember

647
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,080
But in your craft workshop

648
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,160
you had a row of dolls

649
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,760
Among those dolls was one

650
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,800
that's etched in my memory

651
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,160
It was my Zhao Zhao's favorite

652
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,120
Zhao Zhao, do you remember that?

653
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,480
I don't remember

654
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,400
You used to hold it every day

655
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,840
You treasured it dearly

656
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,800
So when Mom saw that

657
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,720
I became anxious

658
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,640
I was about to ask Piaoliang

659
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,600
when a man appeared

660
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,120
That man was very suspicious

661
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,840
He was muttering to himself

662
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,040
while talking to these puppets

663
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,800
"Why are the dolls I made"

664
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,640
placed here?"

665
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,760
What do you mean by "dolls he made"?

666
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,840
That was my daughter's doll

667
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
I think this man is suspicious

668
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,000
I had to follow him

669
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,440
So I kept following him

670
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,480
Just trailing behind him

671
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,760
Until we reached the doll museum

672
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,680
Then I saw this man

673
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,920
Wander off and disappear

674
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,160
He was gone

675
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,520
I believe

676
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,440
He's connected to my daughter's disappearance

677
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
I couldn't rest easy

678
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,120
I asked around everywhere

679
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,760
Finally I found someone in the basement level

680
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,400
An arcade owner

681
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,920
That owner told me

682
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,320
There's a terrifying legend here

683
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,240
That the dollmaker here

684
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,480
Can turn people

685
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,400
Into dolls

686
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,760
Except for those closest to him

687
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,560
No one else would recognize them

688
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,040
I'm wondering

689
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,680
Could my daughter have been turned into a doll?

690
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,400
Later I came to the dollhouse again

691
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,720
I sneaked in through the back door

692
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,480
Inside the dollhouse

693
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:10,960
I discovered

694
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,480
something like a disc

695
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,600
I saw it

696
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,360
You saw it

697
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,760
I searched everywhere

698
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,000
Finally

699
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,720
I found the doll storage room

700
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,800
There was a large bell

701
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,880
In the center of the bell

702
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,040
was my daughter's doll

703
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,480
Zhao Zhao

704
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,680
It even had your name written on it

705
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,240
Zhao

706
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,680
No

707
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,040
Wait

708
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,120
It called me

709
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,800
Mom

710
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,520
That doll called you mom

711
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,160
It could even call people

712
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,440
I must save her

713
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,320
So I found a crowbar outside

714
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,280
A long one

715
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,600
I pried with all my strength

716
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,720
I couldn't pry it open

717
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,520
Just at that moment

718
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,880
There were footsteps outside

719
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,280
I got scared

720
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,600
I was afraid I wouldn't be able to get in again

721
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,760
I threw the crowbar away

722
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,600
I think I left my bag there too

723
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,520
Yes

724
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,280
My daughter

725
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,800
Mom really wants to save you

726
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,520
Mom wants to save you

727
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,480
That thing about the nutcracker earlier...

728
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,320
"The Nutcracker"

729
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,960
Okay

730
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,560
Where did that "Nutcracker" book go?

731
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,160
What are you talking about?

732
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,040
Were you just talking about...

733
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,920
"The Nutcracker"?

734
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,760
Yes, "The Nutcracker"

735
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
"The Nutcracker"

736
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,680
This "Nutcracker"...

737
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,800
Are you familiar with it?

738
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,720
When my daughter was little...

739
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,520
her favorite book...

740
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,920
was called "The Nutcracker"

741
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,320
The ending said that...

742
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,720
as long as you defeat the Mouse King...

743
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,240
he can return to...

744
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,360
his original form

745
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,080
I was thinking...

746
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,160
could it be...

747
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,400
that this fable from my daughter's childhood...

748
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
was hinting to me...

749
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,120
that if I "kill" that puppeteer...

750
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,920
my daughter could come back to life?

751
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,000
That's why I "killed" that...

752
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,880
That's why I defeated the puppeteer

753
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,280
So you were the one who defeated the puppeteer?

754
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,840
Yes

755
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,840
I wanted so badly to defeat him

756
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,240
But...

757
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,560
today...

758
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,280
when I came in with you all...

759
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,120
did I need to take action?

760
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,920
Wasn't he already "dead"?

761
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,120
It's good that he's "dead"

762
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,680
But you should feel more heartbroken

763
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,640
About your daughter going missing back then...

764
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,480
why did you place all the blame...

765
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,160
on the puppeteer?

766
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
Auntie, are you sure?

767
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,280
You only went in once?

768
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,760
I only went in once.

769
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,720
But the record shows multiple break-ins.

770
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,520
I didn't.

771
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,320
That's why I'm asking you.

772
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,960
Outside the 12-hour medication window,

773
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,800
would you remember

774
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,600
what happened?

775
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,160
You might have entered while not fully conscious.

776
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,720
At those times, I didn't even know myself.

777
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,640
Zhao Zhao...

778
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,600
We've talked so much already.

779
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,120
Mom misses you.

780
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,720
Or is there anything

781
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,120
you'd like to tell Mom now?

782
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,920
Some things, once lost,

783
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,160
can never come back.

784
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,480
Okay.

785
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,240
It's okay, we still have time.

786
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,440
Mom found you.

787
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,160
I'm so happy.

788
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,840
Mom loves you.

789
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,000
I'll do whatever it takes

790
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,280
to protect my child.

791
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,200
If you have no more questions,

792
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,480
I'll leave now.

793
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:20,960
Thank you for your trouble.

794
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,800
Thank you.

795
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,680
Thanks.

796
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
Thank you, Auntie.

797
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,280
Alright.

798
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
Sorry to bother everyone.

799
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Goodbye, Auntie.

800
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,600
As long as Auntie is happy.

801
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,440
Thanks for your hard work.

802
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,840
You clearly know her.

803
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,920
You're lying.

804
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

805
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,560
Song Piaoliang...

806
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,680
So you don't know her?

807
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,360
Don't know her.

808
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,120
Okay, understood.

809
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,760
Today there are many she doesn't recognize.

810
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,520
Right, why does she share

811
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,160
these same strange memories with Piaoliang?

812
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,200
But she would truly do anything for her daughter,

813
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,800
even "kill" this person.

814
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,040
Because she loves her daughter so much.

815
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,680
Then let's ask the next one

816
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,320
Singer Zhang

817
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:25,920
The singer is here

818
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,000
Singer Zhang

819
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,160
Which song will you sing today?

820
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,240
Which song will you sing again?

821
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,840
You've been investigating for so long

822
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,640
Have you discovered the dollhouse's secret?

823
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,760
Whose secret

824
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,760
Boss Wang

825
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,040
Doll Museum

826
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,840
You tell me

827
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,640
Go ahead and say it

828
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,680
Let me see if it matches

829
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,120
what we've discovered

830
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,480
Right

831
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,920
The secret is

832
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,880
All of you present here

833
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,040
are not human

834
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,880
She's insulting us

835
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,000
None of us are

836
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,480
How come?

837
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,600
Why aren't we human?

838
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,320
You're just like me

839
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,200
We're all puppets

840
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,040
I see

841
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,640
She's describing a social phenomenon

842
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,640
We're all following the rules

843
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,440
A bunch of these

844
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,000
Like soulless puppets

845
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,320
That's what you mean, right?

846
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,680
No, you ARE puppets

847
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,000
Literally puppets

848
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,160
We are actually puppets

849
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,360
If you don't believe me

850
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,680
I have proof here

851
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,080
Let's hear it

852
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,200
You have evidence that we're puppets?

853
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,600
You investigate us too, go ahead and investigate

854
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
This is what I want to give to Song Piaoliang

855
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,600
Back then,

856
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,760
when you lacked inspiration for your crafts,

857
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,680
I would always give you

858
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,600
this delicious

859
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,080
Real Fruit Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring Tea

860
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,120
It has a light tea fragrance

861
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,480
and chewable

862
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,280
real fruit pieces

863
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,640
Yes, exactly

864
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,240
We've recognized each other now

865
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,480
Go ahead

866
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,720
Now we truly know each other

867
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,880
It also contains high-quality fresh milk

868
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,160
So take a sip now

869
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,640
to find some inspiration

870
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,200
Then I'll remember, right?

871
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
What happened to your hand?

872
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,400
I injured it while dancing

873
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,880
No, tell me what other proof you have

874
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,320
The evidence is in my phone

875
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,520
It's a video

876
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,840
Assistant Yang, come help quickly

877
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,160
Did you take the doll-making manuscript

878
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,440
to your office to look at?

879
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,640
No video recording allowed

880
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,400
You should leave now

881
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,440
We have work to do

882
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,200
Assistant Yang

883
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,160
Did you take the doll-making method

884
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,040
and put it in your office?

885
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,480
Who is Assistant Yang?

886
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,040
Assistant Yang is the doll maker's assistant

887
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,880
Because Assistant Yang invited me

888
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,800
to today's new product launch

889
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,640
Right

890
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,200
So you know Assistant Yang

891
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,600
Yes, we knew each other before

892
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,080
The person dragging the doll inside earlier

893
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,640
was Assistant Yang

894
00:30:59,640 --> 00:30:59,960
Yes

895
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,320
The one squatting on the ground showing their face

896
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,080
is Assistant Yang

897
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,680
This Assistant Yang

898
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,920
Was he standing and taking photos with two people?

899
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,600
Yes, the one standing on the right is Assistant Yang

900
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,080
Yes, it's Old Yang.

901
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,520
Then Assistant Yang...

902
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,120
If he's the performer's assistant,

903
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,240
he would know about backstage operations.

904
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,640
Right?

905
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,280
Of course.

906
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,280
It's also possible the "killer" is the assistant.

907
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,160
No, what does this have to do

908
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
with us being dolls?

909
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,520
Right.

910
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,280
Because in the doll museum,

911
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,360
I've seen...

912
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,120
you when you were still dolls.

913
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,760
I've seen our dolls before

914
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,440
Right

915
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,080
You have a doll too, you know that?

916
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,680
I know

917
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,040
But why do you and the doll

918
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,480
exist simultaneously?

919
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,960
Logically, if you exist, it shouldn't

920
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,280
Because

921
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,360
The dollmaker "died"

922
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,520
As long as I "kill" that dollmaker

923
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,120
my daughter can be revived

924
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,080
So you emerged from that shell

925
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,720
and broke free

926
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,480
You're all free now, just like me

927
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,320
Only when the dollmaker "dies"

928
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,000
will the dolls become uncontrolled

929
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,000
Then why investigate?

930
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,360
Let's just celebrate happily

931
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,760
Alright, this episode's over again, right?

932
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,800
Why did I record this video?

933
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
It was around late April

934
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,720
my memories of Song Piaoliang

935
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,880
became increasingly clear

936
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,640
We were very close friends

937
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,000
But people around me

938
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,640
don't remember Song Piaoliang at all

939
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,720
I asked her homeroom teacher from back then

940
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,120
and her classmates

941
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,920
Everyone said

942
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,000
they didn't know her

943
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,400
But I clearly remember

944
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,480
she had a boyfriend

945
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,600
who was the dollmaker

946
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,400
So I searched online

947
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,360
for "dollmaker"

948
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,880
who worked at Doll House in Apartment 11

949
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,440
(working there)

950
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,880
Forum posts said

951
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,360
this dollmaker

952
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,200
could turn people into dolls

953
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,600
After becoming dolls

954
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,120
everyone's memories of that person

955
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,240
would disappear too

956
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,000
So at that time,

957
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,600
I registered as a member online

958
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,800
to visit this doll exhibition hall

959
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,480
Originally wanted to ask the doll maker directly

960
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,840
if they knew Song Piaoliang

961
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,960
But the doll maker wasn't there

962
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,200
So I asked Assistant Yang

963
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,240
Then Assistant Yang said

964
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,000
Song Piaoliang was one of their dolls

965
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,680
And he took me to the warehouse

966
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,240
to see

967
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,360
Song Piaoliang's doll

968
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,040
And beside her doll

969
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,160
we found an empty box

970
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,680
with my name on it

971
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,440
Zhang Singer

972
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,400
It was labeled "Under Modification"

973
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,920
So her doll

974
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,960
we found in the drawer

975
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,199
Right, they were designing you

976
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,800
When did you go ask?

977
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,760
May 3rd

978
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,120
First time coming to this doll exhibition

979
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,800
But why

980
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,080
do the posted photos say

981
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,320
"Multiple break-ins"

982
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,840
Yes, multiple break-ins

983
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,679
My first time

984
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,400
wasn't entering on May 3rd?

985
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,679
After seeing that empty box with my name

986
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,080
immediately from the room behind me

987
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,120
that doll came running out

988
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,120
The one in the video

989
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,159
Yes, I thought there was something wrong

990
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,239
So later I

991
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,239
tried twice

992
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,520
to sneak in secretly

993
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,480
The first time didn't work

994
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,520
The second time succeeded

995
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,360
I wanted to investigate

996
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,639
what exactly this matter

997
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,159
was all about

998
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,040
what it was like

999
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,880
Is there any possibility that

1000
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,480
actually, everyone

1001
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,400
was never really a doll to begin with?

1002
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,320
We're all human beings.

1003
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,240
Have you ever thought about this?

1004
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,000
That possibility probably doesn't exist.

1005
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,920
Do you really not believe you're human?

1006
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,320
Do you recognize this paper?

1007
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,200
Yes.

1008
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,960
You've definitely held this paper before, right?

1009
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,720
Yes, I was the one who tore that paper.

1010
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,120
This paper contains

1011
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,560
records of my life experiences from childhood onward,

1012
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,600
including some secrets

1013
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,640
I've never told anyone about.

1014
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,520
Why did you tear this paper?

1015
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,720
Because

1016
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,080
it contained many things

1017
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,600
I couldn't accept.

1018
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,240
For example,

1019
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,400
I was supposed to become

1020
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,440
very close friends with Song Piaoliang at 25,

1021
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,760
and then at 28,

1022
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,240
I was supposed to write a hit song

1023
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,320
and hold a concert for thousands.

1024
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,360
But all of these

1025
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,520
were crossed out.

1026
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,760
How old are you now?

1027
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,080
Twenty-five years old.

1028
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,200
Did anything significant happen to you this year?

1029
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,960
You sound like a fortune teller.

1030
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,680
This year...

1031
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,480
Actually many significant things happened.

1032
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,400
My father "died."

1033
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,400
Why did he "die"?

1034
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,200
Sudden heart attack.

1035
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,200
When I saw that script...

1036
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,000
My father was in good health.

1037
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,520
After I saw it...

1038
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,600
Father "passed away."

1039
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,520
Why is everything such a coincidence?

1040
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,880
Including things I've never told anyone...

1041
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,960
about before.

1042
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,280
They were all recorded there.

1043
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,720
Isn't that strange?

1044
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,200
There's a line written in pencil on this paper.

1045
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,600
"Will be eliminated in future show auditions."

1046
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,280
"Ultimately leave the group."

1047
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,400
Did you write this?

1048
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,400
I didn't write it.

1049
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,160
No, it's like this...

1050
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:45,960
Then I understand.

1051
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,720
That...

1052
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,680
Didn't the puppet say...

1053
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,480
it wanted to change her future?

1054
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,440
Maybe the writing...

1055
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,720
These words were written by the puppet.

1056
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,320
It wants you to develop this way.

1057
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,280
You don't want to develop this way.

1058
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,640
Right.

1059
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,640
Do you hate this puppeteer?

1060
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,760
I do.

1061
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,680
Why wouldn't I hate him?

1062
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,120
He changed my life.

1063
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,280
So you "killed" him?

1064
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,760
No

1065
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,960
Your "motive for murder" is very strong

1066
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,520
Too strong

1067
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,000
It's you

1068
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,560
Alright, let's close the case

1069
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,840
This morning

1070
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,440
What were you doing before 11:30?

1071
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,520
I arrived at the shop at 10:40

1072
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,400
At the arcade

1073
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:31,840
Right

1074
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,680
Then around 11:10

1075
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,880
Right after changing clothes and coming out

1076
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,560
I happened to run into you guys

1077
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,200
You saw us

1078
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,360
Then what did you do?

1079
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,880
Then I went to the lobby

1080
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,720
Around 11:30

1081
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,440
You went to the lobby and waited

1082
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,400
You waited by the entrance

1083
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:45,760
Yes

1084
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,840
Then I ran into you again

1085
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,280
So during that time

1086
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,560
You were just sitting there alone the whole time?

1087
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,400
Yes

1088
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,560
What time did we get there?

1089
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,160
12 o'clock, right?

1090
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,760
12 o'clock

1091
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,720
So between 11:30 and 12:00

1092
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,080
We don't know what she was doing

1093
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,160
Your personal journey

1094
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,840
Your life experiences from childhood till now

1095
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,320
Is there anything else you'd like to share?

1096
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,320
Forcing someone to confess again

1097
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,920
I just really want to emphasize one thing

1098
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,200
That you really shouldn't distrust me

1099
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,280
What's written there is really

1100
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:17,880
true

1101
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,520
This is really true

1102
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,440
It's really true

1103
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,960
Like this

1104
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,960
If you don't believe me

1105
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,200
Go ask Assistant Yang

1106
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,560
Assistant Yang

1107
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,520
Can you find Assistant Yang?

1108
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:27,880
Right

1109
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,120
Assistant Yang should be at

1110
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,880
that Life Doll Museum

1111
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,720
His office

1112
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,880
We also have another office

1113
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,320
Couldn't find Assistant Yang's office

1114
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,600
Let's put Assistant Yang on the schedule first

1115
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,000
Alright

1116
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,680
Okay

1117
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,440
Any more questions?

1118
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,480
If no questions, I'll take her out first

1119
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,600
Okay, goodbye

1120
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,400
Ask Song then

1121
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,560
So you really want to ask?

1122
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,680
Of course we're asking

1123
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,720
Are you seriously going to ask?

1124
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,440
This seems really...

1125
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,320
You've been squatting there preparing for so long

1126
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,280
We won't ask

1127
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,320
No need to sit

1128
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,080
There's a new person here today

1129
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,240
You won't let her sit

1130
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,480
But you make me sit

1131
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,960
How could you make the new person sit there?

1132
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,800
Right, is this how you treat guests?

1133
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,640
Exactly

1134
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,120
These few...

1135
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,840
One is Song Piaoliang,

1136
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,720
another is Zhang Singer,

1137
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,400
but it doesn't say Zhao Budao here,

1138
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,040
it just says "Budao." Is it possible

1139
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,880
there's another person also named Budao?

1140
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,000
Like another Budao, Zhang Budao.

1141
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,080
She might not be the real Zhao Budao.

1142
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,880
Right, she could be...

1143
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,040
a puppet.

1144
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,240
Plus her background...

1145
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,920
we barely know anything about it.

1146
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,720
We only know she came at age six.

1147
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,520
If you put it that way...

1148
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,200
maybe you should come back first.

1149
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,960
Let's "interrogate" her first.

1150
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,040
That's exactly what I meant.

1151
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,600
Why do you always "interrogate" me?

1152
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,880
Wrong.

1153
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,040
I think you should go first.

1154
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,920
You have many (questions) about this.

1155
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,040
Do I still need questioning?

1156
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,920
I think she needs "interrogating."

1157
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,280
Because we know nothing about her.

1158
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,120
Right, question you first.

1159
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,360
After questioning you, we'll "interrogate" her.

1160
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
In your memory,

1161
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,960
were you and Song Piaoliang good friends?

1162
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:50,800
No.

1163
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,120
You don't remember this either?

1164
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,960
I don't remember.

1165
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,080
Have you ever experienced parallel universes

1166
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,240
where you saw things

1167
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,680
that you believe didn't happen in real life,

1168
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,240
but you saw them with your own eyes?

1169
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,440
No.

1170
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,520
Do you take medication then?

1171
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:08,880
I don't.

1172
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,840
If you keep being uncooperative like this,

1173
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,360
I'll have to call Mom to deal with you.

1174
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,400
Rejecting a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit

1175
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,360
There really isn't

1176
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,080
I'm telling the truth

1177
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,960
There really isn't

1178
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,520
Really don't have

1179
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,360
Really don't have

1180
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:29,960
She really doesn't

1181
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,040
Then what about your

1182
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,880
memories before coming here?

1183
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,480
What do you remember?

1184
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,800
I just remember on the night of July 7th

1185
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,280
Because I like mystery novels

1186
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,520
And also like

1187
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
life-sized dolls and such things

1188
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,640
So I searched online

1189
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,680
and followed this doll maker

1190
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,120
named

1191
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,880
Lai Doll

1192
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,440
Lai Doll

1193
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,800
You're my fan, right?

1194
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,120
Meaning

1195
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,280
you like the novels I wrote

1196
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,640
Yes

1197
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,240
Thank you

1198
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,120
What time did you go to this doll exhibition?

1199
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,000
After midnight

1200
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I was a little late

1201
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,880
Meaning before midnight

1202
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,280
you hadn't arrived at Apartment 11 yet?

1203
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:06,920
No

1204
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,600
Is today your first time

1205
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,480
coming to Apartment 11?

1206
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,560
Yes

1207
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,000
Because the exhibition only started today

1208
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,680
Then it couldn't have been her who "killed" that person

1209
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,600
She's never been to this place in her life

1210
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,360
Right

1211
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
But what's strange is

1212
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,520
her doll was among those too

1213
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,480
If she had no connection

1214
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,400
with this man at all

1215
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,120
why would her doll

1216
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,000
appear in this doll museum?

1217
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,640
Exactly

1218
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,840
The world is so vast

1219
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,360
why was she specifically chosen?

1220
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,640
True

1221
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,240
I find this very puzzling too

1222
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,400
She just mentioned this Assistant Yang

1223
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,600
Do you know him? No, I don't either

1224
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,240
Don't know him

1225
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,080
Do you know anything about it yourself?

1226
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,840
You can tell us.

1227
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,200
After I got separated from my mother,

1228
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,800
I was adopted by an orphanage.

1229
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,400
Because I had good grades,

1230
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,840
I got into Chicago Affiliated High School.

1231
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,000
But I wanted to go to Oxford.

1232
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,520
Oxford offered full financial support,

1233
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,600
but then the orphanage

1234
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,400
suddenly received a call

1235
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,880
from someone willing to sponsor me

1236
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,440
to stay at Chicago Affiliated High School.

1237
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,160
So I chose not to go to

1238
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,880
Oxford.

1239
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,880
I stayed in Chicago.

1240
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,200
Yes.

1241
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,800
The person who sponsored you

1242
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,880
was likely the so-called Puppeteer.

1243
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,320
Yes.

1244
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:25,800
Right.

1245
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,200
His so-called control over your life

1246
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,000
was actually guiding you to do

1247
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,840
what he thought

1248
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,640
you should do.

1249
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,680
Later, feeling my education was useful,

1250
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,040
I chose to pursue freedom

1251
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,720
and travel the world.

1252
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,360
In your memory,

1253
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,240
were you always

1254
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,760
resisting your mother's control?

1255
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,200
Not really.

1256
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,640
Because I got lost at six,

1257
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,360
I don't have many memories.

1258
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,760
Did you ever think of looking for your mother?

1259
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,120
I did,

1260
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,560
but as time passed,

1261
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,600
the memories faded.

1262
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,000
When the memories faded,

1263
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,880
I stopped thinking about it.

1264
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,120
But actually,

1265
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,800
my mother was always busy selling paintings

1266
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,080
and neglected me.

1267
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,640
This probably affected me as a child,

1268
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,480
but as so much time passed,

1269
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,680
The song "Little Red Riding Hood"

1270
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,560
actually tells this story.

1271
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,160
I just had a sudden idea

1272
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,360
There's a group of wealthy people

1273
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,560
or an organization

1274
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,440
who want to use their dolls

1275
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,200
want to buy a doll

1276
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,000
to control that doll's life

1277
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,760
And they happened to

1278
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,280
select us too

1279
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,200
These wealthy people

1280
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,040
are controlling our lives

1281
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,920
Every step we take

1282
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,200
is being manipulated by them

1283
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,120
Possibly

1284
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,360
Today it feels like

1285
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,480
we've returned to the main storyline

1286
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:46,880
Right

1287
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,120
Because some people's memories are fuzzy again

1288
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,640
I remember things differently

1289
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,280
but others don't know

1290
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,200
Just like in our first episode

1291
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,120
what we could see, they couldn't

1292
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,640
like when someone fell

1293
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:01,920
Yes

1294
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,320
And why is it always us few

1295
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,000
who happened to

1296
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,320
move into this apartment building together

1297
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,960
An even bigger mystery

1298
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,880
We were manipulated

1299
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,680
into living here

1300
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,520
Yes, possibly

1301
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:14,960
These people

1302
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,600
might also be controlled by them

1303
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,760
Possibly

1304
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,880
Actually we're all the same

1305
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,080
We might all be controlled

1306
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,040
We also want to find out who it is

1307
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,120
So can I leave now?

1308
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:28,680
Yes

1309
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,520
Yes

1310
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,000
Okay, sit

1311
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,920
Nothing else for now

1312
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:37,760
Come on

1313
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,960
Looking beautiful

1314
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,760
Why do you have to sit there?

1315
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,320
Really

1316
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,800
Tell me, do you want to

1317
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,880
"kill" this doll

1318
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,400
I do

1319
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:53,640
Why?

1320
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,440
Because in my understanding

1321
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,800
he "killed" someone I loved

1322
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,400
Because it says "case closed" on it

1323
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,720
And if I don't "kill" him

1324
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,880
he might "kill" me instead

1325
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,840
You think he's been manipulating you

1326
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,160
And you don't want to be controlled

1327
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,920
I don't know if he's manipulating me

1328
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,320
I just feel he's been deceiving me

1329
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,560
And think about it - someone

1330
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,680
who sleeps beside you every night

1331
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,640
has already "killed" someone

1332
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,200
Then "killing" someone as small as you

1333
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,280
would be done in

1334
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,160
a snap

1335
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,440
That makes sense

1336
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,280
Then why didn't you ask

1337
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,080
We're all your friends

1338
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,160
Why not ask us for help?

1339
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,880
Because well...

1340
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,120
Are we really that close?

1341
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,200
No, I never thought about it.

1342
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:37,840
Isn't it true for everyone

1343
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,040
to have some personal secrets?

1344
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:39,920
Even between close friends

1345
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,360
there should be some privacy.

1346
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,880
Who were your good friends back then?

1347
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,240
My good friends are all of you here.

1348
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,200
Brothers and sisters.

1349
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,200
Really?

1350
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,600
Didn't expect that answer, did you?

1351
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:49,880
Right.

1352
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,880
And we're not even that close.

1353
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,080
Right, having a boyfriend -

1354
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,160
you didn't even share that with us.

1355
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,640
We didn't even know you were living with someone.

1356
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,560
Next thing you know she'll get engaged,

1357
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,400
then have a wedding,

1358
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,840
and we probably wouldn't even be invited, right?

1359
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,600
That would be great!

1360
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,720
You wouldn't have to give wedding money.

1361
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,280
Perfect!

1362
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,320
I was just about to say that.

1363
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
No need for wedding gifts.

1364
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,000
Now that's what I call good friends.

1365
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,840
Alright, now we're interrogating you.

1366
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,280
Interrogating you.

1367
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:06,840
Okay, bro.

1368
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,200
Confess now.

1369
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,440
How did you "kill" him?

1370
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,240
Just confess already.

1371
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,800
I didn't "kill" him.

1372
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,400
If I wanted to "kill" him, I had plenty of chances.

1373
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,600
He lived with me every day.

1374
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,520
If I wanted to "kill" him,

1375
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,600
I could've done it anytime.

1376
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,240
You just want to perform - show us then.

1377
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,440
No, if he lived with you

1378
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,040
and you "killed" him,

1379
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,040
wouldn't that make you the "killer"?

1380
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,040
If you "killed" him here,

1381
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,360
wouldn't that clear your suspicion?

1382
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,320
When would I have time to "kill" him?

1383
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,960
I was with all of you earlier.

1384
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,440
Maybe he didn't "die" today.

1385
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,880
He might have "died" yesterday.

1386
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,720
Just rotting and stinking inside for days.

1387
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,440
This was at that entrance

1388
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,600
We saw it together

1389
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,200
You're a repeat intruder

1390
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:42,880
Yes

1391
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,480
How many times have you been there?

1392
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,400
Twice

1393
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,800
Including this time?

1394
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,360
No

1395
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:47,960
Not counting this time

1396
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,600
Yes, twice

1397
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,400
Explain in detail

1398
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,320
Let's record this first

1399
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,320
About a week ago

1400
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,560
Suddenly it just "clicked"

1401
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,240
Like a lightbulb moment

1402
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,480
I could clearly see his face

1403
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,720
And I knew his name too

1404
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,320
So I searched his belongings

1405
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,280
Found a note among his things

1406
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,320
It said that

1407
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,960
He had "taken care of" my loved one

1408
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,360
This is it, right?

1409
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,160
Yes

1410
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:09,880
Then I had

1411
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,880
A very clear memory

1412
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,120
That my beloved and I

1413
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:13,880
We had gone together

1414
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,200
To this Zhang Doll

1415
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,600
We had visited together

1416
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,520
This doll shop

1417
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,160
But I'd never gone there alone

1418
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,240
So I went there first

1419
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,040
I tried to enter

1420
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,720
With facial recognition

1421
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,800
They said I wasn't a member

1422
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,720
Wouldn't let me in, kicked me out

1423
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,560
That was the first time

1424
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:27,880
Right

1425
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,280
Probably the same day

1426
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,240
I went back

1427
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,160
Then I asked

1428
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,120
"Do you have someone here

1429
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,440
named Zhang Doll?"

1430
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,200
A staff member

1431
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,960
They said no such person ever existed

1432
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,680
So I had no choice but to leave

1433
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,480
She also suddenly saw clearly

1434
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,600
Just like that singer Zhang earlier

1435
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,880
Becoming clearer and clearer

1436
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,240
Yes, everyone goes through

1437
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,560
this process of gradual clarity

1438
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,400
It's just that I always feel

1439
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,120
I don't like my current boyfriend

1440
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,400
Are you having hallucinations

1441
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,840
because you don't like him?

1442
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,840
No, it's that you start doubting

1443
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,560
whether this person

1444
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,640
is really the same person

1445
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,440
you first knew

1446
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,520
or not

1447
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,040
Right

1448
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,840
Because I also asked him about the dolls

1449
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,560
When I first knew him online

1450
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,560
he used to do crafts and such

1451
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,640
I thought

1452
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,720
he was quite impressive

1453
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,640
I really admired him

1454
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,600
But now when I ask him

1455
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,000
he claims not to know anything

1456
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,680
I see

1457
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,040
Well...

1458
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:18,640
I wanted to ask you

1459
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,040
what you meant by consulting a doctor

1460
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,560
I keep having this hallucination

1461
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,560
of the same scene

1462
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,240
where you're with two people simultaneously

1463
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,960
The one who should be your boyfriend

1464
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,120
is someone you just can't like

1465
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:30,800
While you feel

1466
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,400
drawn to another faceless man

1467
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:32,960
that you really like

1468
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,240
You'd naturally first consider

1469
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,400
whether you might have

1470
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,160
mental health issues

1471
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,920
or are just too exhausted

1472
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,600
Okay, that medicine

1473
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,760
When did you start taking it?

1474
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,680
I didn’t take that medicine.

1475
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,600
The doctor’s advice for me

1476
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,400
was to get more rest.

1477
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,320
She always thought she was taking

1478
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,000
vitamins.

1479
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:51,800
Right.

1480
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,840
So you never took it?

1481
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,960
I did take it—my medicine,

1482
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,680
was prepared by my boyfriend.

1483
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,000
Her boyfriend prepared it for her.

1484
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,480
But I have a question:

1485
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,760
How could I have memories of

1486
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,280
someone I’ve never met?

1487
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,440
Did the parallel worlds start

1488
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,400
after taking that medicine,

1489
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,320
or what?

1490
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,200
I just forgot—I really can’t remember.

1491
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,720
So it's also a parallel universe

1492
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,760
You think you've seen him

1493
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,960
You think you've done this with him

1494
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,960
I don't know if that was a parallel universe

1495
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,360
or something else

1496
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,680
Just like the person we saw jumping off the building

1497
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,960
They all said they didn't see it

1498
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,920
Was that our parallel universe?

1499
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,040
There must be a connection, I think

1500
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:44,640
There is a connection

1501
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,600
It feels like our minds

1502
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,320
Are also having problems

1503
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,800
Right

1504
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,880
Let's all take our meds, okay?

1505
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,720
Inside this building

1506
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,600
There's some kind of signal interference

1507
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,920
We still have many questions

1508
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,120
And there are still things we haven't opened

1509
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,000
Look, there's a box under that doll

1510
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,800
Next, shouldn't we go to

1511
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,040
Assistant Yang's room?

1512
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:00,720
Yes

1513
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,640
Where was that password box just now?

1514
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,320
Here

1515
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,880
Behind this doctor at his feet

1516
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:15,680
Got it

1517
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,600
Is "doctor" related to "one"?

1518
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,400
"Doctor" - "生" is three

1519
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,080
One three

1520
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,280
One three

1521
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:28,920
One three

1522
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,840
One three one four five two zero

1523
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,560
Five two zero

1524
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,400
Let's try one three one three

1525
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,680
There's English here

1526
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,400
Let's try all the people

1527
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,240
Called Yang

1528
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,440
No, it's related to this doll

1529
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:44,920
Definitely

1530
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,640
This is the doctor

1531
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,280
Bu Shengbin

1532
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:47,640
No

1533
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,440
Xin

1534
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,200
Xin Li

1535
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,520
Doctor Xin Li?

1536
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,680
Yes, seems to be called Xin Li

1537
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,440
This one's called Bu Shengbin

1538
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,040
The one who diagnosed them is called Bu Shengbin

1539
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:56,520
Right

1540
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,240
What?

1541
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,640
Assistant Yang

1542
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,920
Assistant Yang

1543
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,920
This is Assistant Yang

1544
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,000
What's below?

1545
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,480
Wait a moment

1546
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,720
There are so many again

1547
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,600
Enter the painting code to open the door

1548
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,880
If the input is wrong

1549
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,440
the painting will close forever

1550
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,760
The paintings are the ones in the hallway outside

1551
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,600
They have labels

1552
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,760
with their numbers

1553
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,520
If the input is wrong

1554
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,200
What does "the painting will close forever" mean?

1555
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,240
That means there's a hidden door

1556
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,400
That painting has a hidden door

1557
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,160
Go shake those paintings

1558
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,160
Anything else?

1559
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,120
What's a "top hat"?

1560
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:44,960
Top hat remote

1561
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,280
That top hat—the one that exploded

1562
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,520
The one that went "boom," right?

1563
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,080
The one we saw go "bang"

1564
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:01,600
Look

1565
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,320
Is this the device?

1566
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,400
The fireworks inside would explode, right?

1567
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,080
It must be the hat remote control

1568
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,040
He inserted this

1569
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,520
into a balloon

1570
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,360
and pressing it would make it explode

1571
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:13,760
Right

1572
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:16,720
It's Director Yang

1573
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,440
Assistant Yang

1574
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,320
The more we talk, the more it fits

1575
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:19,960
Director Yang

1576
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,120
We'll also deviate in the future

1577
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,440
Is there anything else inside?

1578
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,200
What's the retracting mechanism?

1579
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,480
See it?

1580
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,560
It's a machine

1581
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,560
With a pull cord, right?

1582
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,400
Yes, this is fixed

1583
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,120
Winch

1584
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,600
That line, the rotating line

1585
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,440
The motor at the back

1586
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,160
That's the mirror

1587
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:41,680
Let me take a look

1588
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,280
Let's try it

1589
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:44,920
Is this it?

1590
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,000
Let's test if this releases it

1591
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:49,640
Here, you press

1592
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,160
Press it once

1593
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,320
Scared "to death"

1594
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,320
What?

1595
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,160
The remote can control the retraction

1596
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,840
So these are all the tools used

1597
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,840
Right?

1598
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,800
Under this mirror

1599
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,000
lies the "corpse"

1600
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,880
Then when all of us

1601
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,760
have walked past

1602
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,240
the winch

1603
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,680
automatically retracts the mirror

1604
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,160
So the "corpse"

1605
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,440
is revealed before us

1606
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:13,840
This is it.

1607
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,080
Alright, we already know this one. Let's go.

1608
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:18,720
We already know this.

1609
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,480
Okay.

1610
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,840
What is this painting number for?

1611
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,160
We should head to that corridor, right?

1612
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,400
The corridor has many paintings.

1613
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,440
The paintings have numbers.

1614
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,360
You have to see which one it looks like

1615
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,560
Where is spring

1616
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,920
Where is spring

1617
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,720
What's the next line

1618
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,520
In children's eyes

1619
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,320
In the eyes

1620
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,200
In the eyes

1621
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,000
These are eyes

1622
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,640
Eyes

1623
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,080
Assistant Yang's office

1624
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,560
It's in the children's eyes

1625
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,000
Behind a certain oil painting

1626
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,240
Isn't there a remote control?

1627
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,200
No, you can't just input anything with that remote

1628
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,400
Enter the painting's code to open the door

1629
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,520
If you enter the wrong code

1630
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,960
The painting will permanently close

1631
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,800
Thirteen has eyes

1632
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,440
Here it is

1633
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,360
All have eyes

1634
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,480
Spring is in this child's eyes

1635
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,080
Check which portrait has eyes or not

1636
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,840
None of these have

1637
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,600
These ones have

1638
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,480
Where is spring?

1639
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,160
Look

1640
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,400
It keeps going on and on

1641
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,120
Spring is in

1642
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,680
Where is spring?

1643
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,320
Where?

1644
00:55:59,440 --> 00:55:59,920
Is it possible

1645
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,400
To find a painting related to spring?

1646
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,640
Why does this point to the equator?

1647
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:13,800
The sunlight

1648
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,600
Directly shines on what line?

1649
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,720
This is China's climate

1650
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,840
When spring comes

1651
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,200
It should be monsoon climate, right?

1652
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,480
I feel this way

1653
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,440
This is common knowledge

1654
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,280
I think it's like this

1655
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:23,680
Right

1656
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,160
This one points downward

1657
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,400
This is wind blowing from the northwest

1658
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,200
Not spring, right?

1659
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,640
Related to solar terms

1660
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,840
Among the 24 solar terms, there's the Spring Equinox

1661
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,960
And during the Spring Equinox

1662
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,760
The sunlight

1663
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,240
Shines directly on the equator

1664
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,760
Only during Spring and Autumn Equinox

1665
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,440
Does it shine on the equator

1666
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,720
Impressive

1667
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,160
There's another one

1668
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,440
Does it also shine on the equator?

1669
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,120
This one too

1670
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,160
This one isn't

1671
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,280
This one doesn't shine on the equator

1672
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,520
Only those two shine on the equator

1673
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,080
Anyway, one is southeast wind

1674
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,400
One is northwest wind

1675
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,200
But we're certain

1676
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,360
Spring brings southeast wind

1677
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,600
The spring wind blows

1678
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,160
Spring must be south wind

1679
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:09,760
South wind, right?

1680
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,560
Because it's warm

1681
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,200
Yes, it's warm

1682
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,120
This is north wind blowing south

1683
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:12,760
This north wind to south

1684
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,040
That's south wind blowing north

1685
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,400
Then it must be this one

1686
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,680
Right? So it's 08, correct?

1687
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,800
Mirror

1688
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,520
Such a large mirror

1689
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,760
What is this thing? Speak up.

1690
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,080
I moved the puppeteer

1691
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,760
onto the stage

1692
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,440
I'm free now

1693
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,480
The formal wear he ordered

1694
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,600
was for someone 1.7 meters tall

1695
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,600
Her boyfriend's medical report states

1696
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,640
he's about 1.83 meters tall

1697
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:08,960
The "dead" one might not be the puppet

1698
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,160
I am the puppet

1699
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:10,760
Come save me quickly

1700
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:20,960
Brothers

1701
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,120
The "doomed" Song Huo

1702
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,360
Song Huo has "died"

1703
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,440
The dolls found at the scene

1704
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,440
Were they all delivered by you?

1705
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,600
Everyone involved in this will "die"

1706
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,880
We came here to save you

1707
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,920
If we fail

1708
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,880
We'll collectively lose our memories

1709
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,960
And start over

1710
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,480
The reason we

1711
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,600
could enter that inner cabin

1712
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,920
was because he's been guiding us

1713
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,920
through everything

1714
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,600
Who else knows his stage so well?

1715
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,600
To protect himself

1716
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,600
he played along with the scheme

1717
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,480
The "killer" must be

1718
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,240
among this group with us

1719
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,360
Can you figure it out every time?

1720
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,640
Are you mocking us too?

1721
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,760
No, I'm genuinely asking.

1722
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,560
If you keep being this rude,

1723
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,080
I might have to call Mom over.

1724
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,800
There's always someone who can rein you in.

1725
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,640
This is pure torture, I'm telling you.

1726
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,200
Mom is her kryptonite.

1727
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,680
I really want to ask,

1728
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,640
Are your deductions always correct?

1729
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,080
The probability is...

1730
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,400
Sometimes we're right, sometimes wrong.

1731
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,120
On average we reach about...

1732
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,480
30% accuracy rate.

1733
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,320
That low?

1734
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,560
What did you expect?

1735
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,160
Our win rate should be at least 40%.

1736
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:31,960
So high.

1737
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,120
A whole 10% increase.

1738
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,480
So what's your feeling this time?

1739
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,680
Do you think you can guess correctly?

1740
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,000
You can, right?

1741
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,440
Who do you think so far this episode...

1742
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,440
seems most like the "killer"?

1743
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,000
Probably someone who hasn't appeared yet.

1744
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,840
Look, she knows the truth.

1745
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,120
She said this person hasn't come out yet.

1746
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,920
Why would you think

1747
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,960
they've come out now?

1748
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,760
There's also Assistant Yang behind it.

1749
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,640
Assistant Yang.

1750
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,280
Assistant Yang and some others.

1751
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,840
Actually, what she said makes sense.

1752
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,640
We were actually convinced by her.

1753
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,920
Song Piaoliang, stop biting your nails.

1754
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,720
Don't be nervous.

1755
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,480
It's you.

1756
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,640
She never bites her nails.

1757
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,080
How do you know I never bite my nails?

1758
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,920
We've never seen you

1759
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,320
bite your nails before.

1760
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,240
Right.

1761
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,600
Were you paying this much attention to me before?

1762
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,360
Heard it from my brother, yes.

1763
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:32,800
Song Piaoliang

1764
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,040
is someone who doesn't bite her nails.

1765
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:34,640
He said that before he left.

1766
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,440
Your brother tells you about

1767
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,280
Song Piaoliang every day?

1768
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,400
Your brother has issues.

1769
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,840
Your brother pays a lot of attention to her.

1770
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,880
Your brother has problems.
