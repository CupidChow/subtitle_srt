1
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,760
Want to experience the same deduction game

2
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,120
as the Mystery Club in Apartment 11?

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,200
Want to play tabletop deduction games at home?

4
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,240
April 1, 2025

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,200
Apartment No. 11

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,520
will experience strong magnetic interference

7
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,800
I "traveled back" to

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,960
April 1, 2022

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,800
hoping to start everything over

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,480
and change the tragedy

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,720
So besides the "Meet You" project

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,400
there should be another "time traveler"

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,640
Who guided us here?

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,480
This is Teng Zhongjie's plan

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,800
A 50% discount coupon

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,560
He also "time traveled"

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,080
Investigating this symbol

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,760
means uncovering

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,920
the truth about my sister's "death"

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,440
is the breakthrough

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,800
He wants us to help investigate this

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,920
So that video

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,120
was made by Teng Zhongjie

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
Everyone will

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,040
"die"

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,800
This is an

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,160
organization that will "kill" everyone

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,800
Yes

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,600
Teng Zhongjie "died" inside

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,120
"Died"

31
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,720
He was investigating

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,480
three years ago

33
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,080
the "corpse burning" case in the grove

34
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,800
Xiao Bamei and Teacher Lou's suicide jump

35
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,520
are also related

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,000
The people who wronged you

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,440
Besides her, there are six others

38
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,280
The six of us

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,320
We are all "murderers"

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,320
Who is imprisoned inside?

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,000
It's me, Jingjing

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,840
Don't come closer

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,120
I just

44
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,200
protected her

45
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,680
I did imprison Xiaojing

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,640
Teng Zhongjie took his last breath around 12:40 AM

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,080
The "murderer" is Cao Yangguang

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,160
11 AM on the 28th

49
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,760
11 AM

50
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,800
fell into a coma

51
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,840
Then who was the person talking to us?

52
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,240
Over the past ten weeks,

53
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,000
six players have been repeatedly drawn into

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,080
a series of bizarre cases

55
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,520
gradually uncovering their own backgrounds

56
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,720
and the main storyline

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
All storylines have intertwined

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,680
As layers of truth are revealed,

59
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,960
the many mysteries of Apartment 11

60
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,200
have been solved one by one

61
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,960
But some questions remain unanswered

62
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,520
Today, the detective team will face

63
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,280
the ultimate case

64
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,960
to solve the final mystery

65
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,200
Will they

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,800
be able to uncover

67
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,840
the ultimate truth?

68
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,800
Tomato noodle soup

69
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,760
Here you go, uncle

70
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,840
Thanks, nephew

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,640
No leaving until you finish today

72
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,840
Thank you

73
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,040
Enjoy, everyone

74
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,240
Must have one bottle every morning

75
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,920
Must have one bottle every morning

76
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,320
Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring

77
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,720
With delicious high-quality fresh milk

78
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,440
And a subtle tea fragrance

79
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,960
Plus real fruit pieces you can chew

80
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,120
It's pure happiness

81
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,160
A wonderful day

82
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,360
starts with the super delicious

83
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,960
Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring

84
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,960
Thank you

85
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,560
Cheers

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,520
Yesterday we found your Xiaojing

87
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,720
and were so happy

88
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,560
Right

89
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,080
Congratulations

90
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,760
Celebrating Xiaojing's return

91
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Finally rescued

92
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,280
Wait

93
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,480
Why are you all in pairs now?

94
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,360
What do you mean?

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Didn't you find Fang Xiaomei?

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,120
I did

97
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,880
Here's the doll

98
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,600
We got married

99
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,800
And Zhenzhen...

100
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,880
Xiao Jing

101
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,800
It's me

102
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,720
Jing Jing

103
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,519
Don't come closer

104
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,680
We don't have this yet

105
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,640
Right, we don't have it

106
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,600
Lai Wan'ou is the time-space resetter

107
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,080
Right?

108
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,280
He's not the resetter

109
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,160
He doesn't have that ability

110
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,400
Didn't he also pick up a note?

111
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,280
January 2025

112
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,920
I really obtained a

113
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,560
paper describing how to "travel" through time

114
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,040
Yes

115
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,800
We haven't found out

116
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,240
who actually reset time-space

117
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,600
Right

118
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,240
But Lai Wan'ou said

119
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,400
that place on the third-floor platform

120
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,000
gives hallucinations every time you visit

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,440
That question mark statue

122
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Anyone who's been to the question mark statue

123
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,520
will remember some

124
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,720
things they've experienced before

125
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,800
On your first day here

126
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,840
you did go there

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,120
There's something there about

128
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,600
magnetic field anomalies

129
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,720
Yes, that's why you have confused memories

130
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,800
Whose phone is that?

131
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,720
It's mine.

132
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,880
Your sister-in-law is calling you.

133
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,360
What?

134
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,280
I'll get it.

135
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,440
Put it on speaker.

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,840
Hello, sis.

137
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,560
What's up?

138
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,880
Bro, it's me.

139
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,280
I just heard something happened to that Teng agent.

140
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,960
Yeah.

141
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,400
And?

142
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,560
He was also a regular at our foot massage parlor.

143
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,040
He was wearing a vital signs monitor too.

144
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,880
We can check...

145
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,680
the patch from his vital signs monitor.

146
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,680
Then we can log into that website...

147
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,440
to check...

148
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,160
his monitor's data.

149
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,800
I'll go get it.

150
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,640
Okay, go get it.

151
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,160
Alright.

152
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,400
Anything else, sis?

153
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
No, I'll get back to work.

154
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:49,920
Okay.

155
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,760
Alright, goodbye.

156
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,840
Bye, sis.

157
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll come for a foot massage sometime.

158
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,800
Sure.

159
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,360
Bye.

160
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,200
Bye.

161
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,000
Goodbye.

162
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
I'll go get it now.

163
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,240
Okay.

164
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,640
Earlier she mentioned the vital...

165
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,120
the vital signs thing.

166
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,000
That means we can verify...

167
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,840
when exactly he died.

168
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,560
Let's see if our theory is correct.

169
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,600
The "time of death."

170
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,160
Time of death.

171
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,880
I'm here

172
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,160
I've been searching for so long

173
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,560
Seriously

174
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,400
Teng Zhongjie's life sign monitor

175
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,960
Couldn't find it

176
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
But under his mattress

177
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,200
But under his mattress

178
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,280
There was this small box

179
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,280
Code

180
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,640
And this is the computer I got from the property management

181
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,200
Here, good

182
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,680
Thanks

183
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,320
Let's check

184
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,000
The life sign monitor

185
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,480
Open it

186
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,400
Enter the code

187
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,800
940483

188
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,440
Time of death around 12:40

189
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,720
That checks out

190
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,840
Right, it's Cao Yangguang

191
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,880
Last time we saw him was

192
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,800
Early morning

193
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,440
Thirty minutes

194
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,400
11 AM on the 28th

195
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,760
Fell into a coma

196
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,360
He was already in a coma by 11

197
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,440
Which means he

198
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,240
Was already unconscious

199
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,520
Right, long unconscious

200
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,720
Then who was talking to us?

201
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,840
When I went to his place

202
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,000
Teng Zhongjie told me

203
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,520
Have you forgotten about three years ago

204
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,200
When Teacher Lou jumped off the building

205
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,240
Are we sure what we heard

206
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,760
Was really Teng Zhongjie?

207
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,680
Should be

208
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,200
Yes, who were you talking to?

209
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,600
Didn't you say you communicated with him?

210
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,040
It's possible that person

211
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,800
Had already killed him

212
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,720
Just used a voice changer

213
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,360
Let me tell you

214
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,920
this voice changer probably

215
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,280
just isn't that amazing

216
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,400
So above his bed headboard

217
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,320
that installed thing

218
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Yes, the one by his bed

219
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,720
Four dots and a circle

220
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,800
It's a red mark

221
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,600
Exactly four dots

222
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,080
and then a circle

223
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,400
Looks like adhesive

224
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,560
marks from something being stuck there

225
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
Then how did he remove it?

226
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,800
How was it removed?

227
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,200
From dawn till morning there shouldn't be anyone

228
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,160
No one came after that

229
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,320
It was removed before 3 AM

230
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,240
Which means

231
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,720
who edited the records

232
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,679
might not be from the Cao family

233
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Cao Yangguang wouldn't need to drug Teng the agent

234
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,000
then stage a locked-room "murder"

235
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,280
It's not these two

236
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,440
Right, the culprit isn't from the Cao family

237
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,720
Or maybe we...

238
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,360
Aren't Cao Yangguang and his father both here?

239
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,640
Maybe I should go ask Cao Yangguang

240
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,560
Because the roads outside are blocked

241
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,720
I can't hand them over to authorities

242
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,520
So temporarily

243
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,840
kept them in the property management surveillance room

244
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,240
Go ahead

245
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,760
I'll go look for them in the property management surveillance room

246
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,640
I'm back

247
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,720
Has the person arrived?

248
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,000
They ran away.

249
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,480
Who ran away?

250
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,040
How strange.

251
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Both of them are gone.

252
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,640
Weren't they locked there?

253
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:20,960
Yes.

254
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,240
Right.

255
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,000
And then...

256
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,280
No idea how they escaped.

257
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,040
Only this tablet was left behind.

258
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Did they leave this?

259
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,960
This belongs to Mr. Cao.

260
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,320
There's Weibo.

261
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,520
Mr. Cao's Weibo.

262
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,560
He posted one...

263
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,440
shared video.

264
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,200
[Untranslatable code/phrase]

265
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,640
Since you're so eager for the truth...

266
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,720
come wait for me on the third-floor platform.

267
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,040
I'll show you the truth.

268
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,000
Let's go check out the third-floor platform.

269
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,240
I'm a little scared.

270
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,520
Don't be afraid.

271
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,040
Look, we've been here for so long.

272
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,760
and we're still perfectly fine.

273
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,360
Father Cao

274
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,400
Dad

275
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,280
His head was bleeding heavily

276
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,360
Since you're so eager for the truth

277
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,400
Then meet me on the third-floor platform

278
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,120
I'll show you the truth

279

How come another one "died"?

280
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,240
What?

281
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,640
Why did he...

282
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,120
A new video was posted on Weibo.

283
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,840
Who is it?

284
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,320
Cao's dad.

285
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,680
There was only one just now.

286
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,400
He posted again.

287
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,800
He posted...

288
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,560
Isn't he right here?

289
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,360
How could he post a video?

290
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,760
Prerecorded

291
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,280
Look, open it

292
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,840
I am Father Cao

293
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,520
I imprisoned

294
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,440
a female student in a secret room

295
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,320
for three long years

296
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,880
Don't come closer

297
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,640
It's him

298
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,960
which eventually drove her insane

299
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,720
and ruined her entire life

300
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,360
To cover up the truth

301
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,800
I also "killed"

302
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,560
Xiao Tengteng who was investigating this case

303
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,200
It's him

304
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,720
All these crimes mentioned above

305
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,760
were committed by me alone

306
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,600
Confession video

307
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,520
"Suicide" to escape punishment

308
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,400
Please spare my family

309
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,720
especially my son

310
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,920
He's exceptionally outstanding

311
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,040
Always been top-ranked since childhood

312
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,560
He has no issues whatsoever

313
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,520
As for me

314
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,880
I'm deeply sinful

315
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,320
and can only atone with "death"

316
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,200
This is the gallery

317
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,360
He jumped from the studio

318
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,680
So it's from upstairs here

319
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,320
The studio, right?

320
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,960
Yes

321
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,960
Got it.

322
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,360
Found a note in his pocket about coming to the bookstore.

323
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,280
And the bookstore owner's office.

324
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,400
What "come to the bookstore"?

325
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
It's how the letter ends.

326
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,560
Probably something like "If you want..."

327
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,200
"Or else..."

328
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,480
"Please come to the bookstore."

329
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,160
Similar to something like...

330
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,400
"If you want to save your son,"

331
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,040
"then come to the bookstore."

332
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,800
Right.

333
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,640
It has that watermark on it.

334
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
Tuiduo Bookstore.

335
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,120
Tuiduo Bookstore is the one on the 7th floor.

336
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,680
Leave it.

337
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,800
Then let's go to the bookstore.

338
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,240
Okay.

339
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,360
Right.

340
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,040
Let me handle...

341
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,720
today's emergency situation first.

342
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,120
Right.

343
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,680
Okay.

344
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,280
I'll leave it to you.

345
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,000
The layout has changed

346
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,640
No, it hasn't

347
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,360
It's the same

348
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,480
Only the things inside are gone

349
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,400
There's no memorial service

350
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,560
Right

351
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,080
There's an office keycard

352
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,640
Yes

353
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,120
Let's look for that office keycard

354
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,160
Where do we swipe it?

355
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,560
Is it the painter's office?

356
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:10,920
No

357
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,400
The bookstore

358
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,280
It's the bookstore owner's office

359
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,960
If that's the case

360
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,120
There is no office

361
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,840
Secret passage

362
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,800
I think it's inside here

363
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,200
It looks like

364
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,920
more like office curtains

365
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,840
Is the door on this wall?

366
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,200
This wall seems more intact

367
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,120
This thing feels like it might be...

368
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,440
Right

369
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
Take the book out

370
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,120
Is there something in one of these books?

371
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
I've got it

372
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,160
The door card has "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"

373
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,480
Here it is

374
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:45,880
Swipe it

375
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,800
That bottle

376
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
That...whatchamacallit gas

377
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,560
"No-Cry Gas"

378
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,800
It can stimulate the happiness molecules in your body

379
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Instantly making you forget all your worries

380
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,280
Giving you an unprecedented experience

381
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,600
This "emo" has been...

382
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,280
buying till the end

383
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,080
"Emo"

384
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,080
Don't cry

385
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,560
"No-Cry Gas"

386
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,320
Don't cry

387
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't cry

388
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,240
Absolutely don't

389
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,440
Don't cry

390
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,960
There must be a way forward

391
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,760
He has the key to the property management surveillance room

392
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,960
Property management surveillance room

393
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,400
Right

394
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,960
Five-year-old Yangguang

395
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,640
Six-year-old Yangguang

396
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,280
Seven-year-old Yangguang

397
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,880
Eight-year-old Yangguang

398
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,720
Nine-year-old Yangguang

399
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,120
Are those two Yueguang and Yangguang?

400
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,720
Yes, Yangguang and Yueguang

401
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,440
So you mean

402
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,080
This bookstore is actually

403
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,720
owned by Cao Yueguang's father?

404
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,120
Definitely

405
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,480
Yes

406
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,040
Wait, there's a note

407
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,920
On Yangguang's 100th day

408
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,880
We'll cut his baby hair

409
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,120
I want to keep his baby hair

410
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,600
As a memento

411
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,040
All I want in this life is for him to be happy

412
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,400
This is his baby hair, see?

413
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,720
Yes

414
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,600
Pass it around

415
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:10,960
Here

416
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,000
Take a look

417
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,160
You hold it

418
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,800
You can put it back now

419
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,800
Five-year-old Yangguang

420
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,040
Yangguang loves goldfish

421
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,400
Though he often overfeeds them to death

422
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,520
But I'll keep buying them for him

423
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,320
As long as he's happy

424
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,920
Killed them

425
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,160
Spoiled rotten

426
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,200
Even back then he was

427
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,920
"Killing" living things

428
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,440
Six-year-old Yangguang

429
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,600
Late at night, I found in the trash bin

430
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,480
among the leftover food

431
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,360
Yangguang's first lost tooth

432
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,120
As long as he's happy

433
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
His father loves him too much

434
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,320
Loves him to the point

435
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,760
of absurdity

436
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Loves him way too much

437
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,640
Here it is

438
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,080
This tooth

439
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,560
Here

440
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,320
No need to pass this around

441
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Just take a look

442
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,360
This is ridiculous

443
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,360
The tooth

444
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
Yangguang only has one defective kidney

445
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,080
And has the rare

446
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,120
RH-negative panda blood type

447
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,640
It took seven years

448
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,400
to find a matching kidney donor

449
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,360
Which was you

450
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,040
The reason I was adopted by the Cao family

451
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,320
was because we share the same blood type

452
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
You were to donate blood to him

453
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,640
Yes

454
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,160
If his kidney ever failed

455
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,560
I was meant to be a spare

456
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,880
Eight-year-old Yangguang

457
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,360
Yangguang injured a neighbor's child

458
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
while fighting over this RC car

459
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,240
I paid 100,000 in compensation

460
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,000
But it didn't matter

461
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,760
As long as he was happy

462
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,080
Ten-year-old Yangguang

463
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,760
Yangguang's favorite

464
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,200
two pet mice went missing again

465
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
I had to buy him new ones

466
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,000
As long as he was happy

467
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,280
To keep his lizard from leaving

468
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,560
Yangguang broke its legs

469
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,840
and put it under his bed

470
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,320
Whatever, as long as he's happy

471
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,800
Never mind, as long as he's happy

472
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,880
Anti-social

473
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,400
This person

474
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,080
The sunshine of nineteen years old

475
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,840
My son has grown up

476
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,800
He said he wants his own space

477
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,720
I would never set foot here

478
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,040
So this is the sunny place

479
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,600
No

480
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,080
No

481
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,720
That dark room

482
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,000
Where Xiao Jing was locked

483
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,320
Yes

484
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,800
Here refers to that space

485
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,480
Meaning his father never went inside

486
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:56,760
Right

487
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,640
Correct

488
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,400
Then how did that white dust get on his father's shoes

489
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,160
How did it get there?

490
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,360
Uncle, explain first

491
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,920
What's with your shoes?

492
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,480
This is from when I imprisoned Xiaojing

493
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,119
It remained

494
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,920
To make everyone suspect him

495
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,319
Yes

496
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,760
To partially clear his son's suspicion

497
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,680
Looking at it this way

498
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,119
He committed "suicide" to escape punishment

499
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,200
Taking the blame for his son

500
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,560
Then "death" would end everything

501
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,160
Just like Ku did back then

502
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,600
Wanted to take the blame

503
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,120
Take the blame

504
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,400
Originally it should have been me

505
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Who should have taken the fall for my brother

506
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,880
Ku was the one who "killed"

507
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,000
Then the brother jumped for him

508
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,640
This would end the investigation

509
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,760
No

510
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,960
He said today

511
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,840
Bai Song 1 Guo Zhou, Liu 1 Ku

512
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,760
If you want to know the truth

513
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,840
Come find me on the third floor platform

514
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,960
Bai Song 1 Guo Zhou, Liu 1 Ku

515
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,240
Since you're so eager for the truth

516
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,360
Then wait for me on the third floor platform

517
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,120
I'll show you the truth

518
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,000
He should have been waiting for us

519
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,680
He wanted to tell us something

520
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,280
What I mean is

521
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,760
Is it possible

522
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,920
That someone else "killed" him

523
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,200
Possibly

524
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,880
He might have jumped

525
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,040
Or might have been pushed

526
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,280
His father has

527
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,680
the floor plans for the entire Apartment 11

528
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,440
Every floor is included

529
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,200
Is he some invisible owner of this building?

530
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,600
No idea

531
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,280
He has everything

532
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,960
Look, floor plans from the 3rd to 9th floors

533
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,000
This is the rooftop

534
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,520
Fourth floor

535
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,000
My room

536
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,720
This is Unit 509

537
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,280
509

538
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,040
Teacher Lou's apartment

539
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,360
Even the abandoned power room is here

540
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,800
Unit 701, the Ju family, right?

541
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,080
He's got the eighth floor too

542
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,800
Zhenzhen Theater

543
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,000
Ninth floor is also his

544
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,760
The painter's studio

545
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,320
Every single space in our apartment

546
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:05,800
He knows them all intimately

547
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,880
Yes, he knows them inside out

548
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,280
Let's look at this first.

549
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,320
Child Protection Group

550
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,200
Who is Xiaoming?

551
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,000
Xiaoming's father.

552
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,640
I'm also a member of the Child Protection Group.

553
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,720
Your son is outstanding.

554
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,000
I truly admire

555
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,040
how you've raised your son.

556
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,600
We should exchange parenting tips more often.

557
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,720
Agreed, let's encourage each other.

558
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,080
We stay-at-home dads always get looked down on,

559
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,280
but as long as our sons excel,

560
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,560
it proves our worth.

561
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,040
Exactly.

562
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,480
This "obsessive" love

563
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,160
Yes.

564
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,000
Have you arrived at the bookstore?

565
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,280
I'm here.

566
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,240
How did you know?

567
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,840
You're the one who asked to meet.

568
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,720
The property surveillance key

569
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,400
was given by you.

570
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,720
Thank you.

571
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,000
I've already rescued my son

572
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,040
and hidden him away.

573
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,840
Rescued him.

574
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,160
Cao Yangguang, Cao's father -

575
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,360
both have disappeared.

576
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,720
Also,

577
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,520
I've already placed this

578
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,560
in your bookstore office.

579
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,720
They simply can't stand your son

580
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,440
being so exceptional.

581
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,640
If your son gets caught,

582
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,240
it would be such a shame.

583
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,920
How do I zoom in on this photo?

584
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,040
This is Yangguang.

585
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,200
Is this at the bookstore?

586
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,240
There's a clothes rack behind,

587
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,520
full of clothes, right?

588
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,640
And this looks like a bed.

589
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,800
No, he said "I've already placed it

590
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,000
in your bookstore office."

591
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,240
Isn't this the bookstore office?

592
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,120
What does he mean by "this"?

593
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,640
What exactly did he leave in the office?

594
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,360
This belongs to his son -

595
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,000
some crucial evidence perhaps?

596
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
And now he's returning it.

597
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,280
Wait a minute

598
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,440
This belongs to that guy

599
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,280
The house of that Teng the agent

600
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,000
Is this Teng the agent's house?

601
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,800
Right, aren't these dumbbells?

602
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,560
Plaid shirt

603
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,600
Dumbbells

604
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
And this is Teng the agent's bed

605
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,640
He captured him on camera

606
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,160
This location

607
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,440
is where the red thing was

608
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,360
It's a red mark

609
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,400
from something like a camera

610
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Right

611
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,480
I've already put this in your bookstore office

612
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,040
It's this Xiaoming

613
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,160
His father took it to save Yangguang

614
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,240
and removed this crucial evidence beforehand

615
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,320
then gave it to his father

616
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,920
Voice

617
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,840
Can you hear this?

618
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,280
Yes

619
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,440
I know what to do now

620
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,480
So "perverted"

621
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,080
Let me listen to it again

622
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,920
I know what to do now

623
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,280
He's using "no-cry gas"

624
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,200
Listen again

625
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,520
The first two sounds

626
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,040
Listen carefully again

627
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,920
That hissing sound

628
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,600
Right

629
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,320
Yes

630
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,800
Impressive

631
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,120
Impressive

632
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,000
Shine a light on it

633
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,440
0092

634
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,200
From 0091 to 0100

635
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,760
All are "e mo"

636
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,560
It's "e mo"

637
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:58,880
Alright

638
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,600
Let's look for something else

639
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,880
Humidifier

640
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,640
What?

641
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
It's all...

642
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,200
It's all "Bukuki"

643
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,600
"Bukuki"

644
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
When it turns into liquid form

645
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,400
it appears blue

646
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,240
Was it placed by himself or someone else?

647
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,760
After overdosing on "Bukuki"

648
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,480
hallucinations occur

649
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,200
leading to "suicide" by jumping

650
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,440
He might have been unaware of this

651
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,520
That possibility can't be ruled out

652
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,560
But he voluntarily had this spray

653
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,280
But that was something he could control

654
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,200
Using it when he wanted

655
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,520
This was beyond his control

656
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,320
Someone might have accidentally...

657
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,840
Yes, keeping him constantly in this state

658
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,400
Moreover, Xiaoming's father

659
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,920
had means to enter this place

660
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,280
Because he previously said

661
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,840
"Your things"

662
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,360
"I put them back in your office"

663
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,520
Right

664
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,120
If your son gets arrested

665
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,480
It would be such a pity

666
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,200
He's so outstanding

667
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,680
Why can't he make some mistakes?

668
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,640
Even if he has issues

669
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,960
We must protect him to the end

670
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,360
I know what to do now

671
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
The biggest problem right now is

672
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,680
who Xiaoming's father is

673
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,640
Bad publicity is still publicity, isn't it?

674
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,720
If you're unhappy

675
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,920
I have ways to make you happy

676
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,720
That fan of hers

677
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,960
has actually been guiding her

678
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,280
to use "No-cry Qi"

679
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,080
He's so outstanding

680
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,640
why can't he make some mistakes?

681
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,920
I know what to do

682
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,200
I know what to do

683
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,640
It's "e mo"

684
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,120
"e mo"

685
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,640
It's "e mo"

686
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,840
Who is "e mo" again?

687
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,600
Sister Bao, right?

688
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,680
The Detective Society will investigate

689
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,520
Exposing Sister Bao as the one who instigated

690
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,800
Xiao Bamei's "suicide"

691
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,520
That would be "e mo"

692
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,680
But Sister Bao has been arrested

693
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,520
The Detective Society will investigate

694
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,360
Exposing Sister Bao as the one who instigated

695
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,880
Xiao Bamei's "suicide"

696
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,840
And then Sister Bao

697
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,200
has now been taken away for investigation

698
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,640
There's a news alert

699
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,520
The viral sensation

700
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,000
Apartment 11 Investigation Team

701
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,440
turns out to be all villains

702
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,000
Trending topics

703
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,560
All members are villains

704
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,760
Bai Sanwan committed hit-and-run

705
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,800
and stole money

706
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,320
Song Piaoliang spread rumors that "killed" someone

707
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,360
Guo Baoyou's prank "killed" an elderly person

708
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,200
Ke Wuku deliberately robbed a female student

709
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,560
Zhou Keke exposed private information and smeared others

710
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,120
Liu Xialai got plastic surgery and gave false testimony

711
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,320
Our reputation is ruined

712
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,120
Reputation collapse

713
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:56,960
Here

714
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,040
That "emo"

715
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,240
"Emo" is really everywhere

716
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,360
Had been following Guo Baoyou's series

717
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,800
Originally thought they were beacons of justice

718
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,160
Investigation team

719
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,680
Actually committed such shameful acts

720
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,120
Click it

721
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,240
The camera is behind us

722
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,960
Property management surveillance room

723
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,920
He can access it

724
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,240
All suspects trying to clear their names

725
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,880
hastily accused the Cao family as "murderers"

726
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,240
ultimately drove Mr. Cao to jump

727
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,440
"Emo" is step by step

728
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,680
pushing us into

729
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,240
the eye of the storm

730
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,960
He's actually coming after us

731
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,520
Right

732
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,360
Who have we six offended?

733
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,960
The one you've wronged

734
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,280
Besides her, there are six more

735
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,680
Teacher Lou

736
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,520
One last time

737
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,480
After playing this melody you taught me

738
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,080
I should bid farewell to this hopeless world

739
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,640
Goodbye

740
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,280
This person

741
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,440
Assuming he's connected to Teacher Lou

742
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,000
He must be seeking justice for Teacher Lou's

743
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,600
this innocent "death"

744
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,120
Yes

745
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,480
As long as it's connected to Teacher Lou's "death"

746
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:11,960
The ones involved

747
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
are actually the nine of us

748
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,720
I don't think it's just this one thing

749
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,800
You have to look higher up

750
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,720
Something broader, right?

751
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,200
You have to look at everything

752
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,720
The widest scope

753
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Yes, because think about it

754
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,840
From the very beginning

755
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,520
he's been guiding us step by step

756
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,680
Xiao He

757
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,320
It's also possible

758
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,920
Xiao He is the mastermind behind it all

759
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,200
I'm currently preparing

760
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,520
for the legal qualification exam

761
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,200
as a trainee administrator

762
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,680
Everyone, quickly think about

763
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,800
who the real "culprit" is

764
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,160
Finally, it's here

765
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,400
There's really a "corpse"

766
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,160
What are you doing?

767
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,040
Always by our side

768
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,480
Knowing everything

769
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Take a look at his photo

770
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,120
The photo of him "falling to his death"

771
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,960
Where did he take it from?

772
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,840
He must have been

773
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,520
shooting from that art studio we saw earlier

774
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,320
He said it's right above.

775
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,040
Isn't this the edge?

776
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,600
Didn't he leave a beam there?

777
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,680
It has a windowsill.

778
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:32,960
Right.

779
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,360
The studio room has no eaves.

780
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,520
Going out leads straight below.

781
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,800
But this one is very close.

782
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,880
The main thing is it's very close.

783
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,160
Right.

784
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,680
It's very close right above us.

785
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,320
Fourth floor.

786
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,600
Very close directly above.

787
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,480
The fourth floor layout.

788
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,720
Which room is it?

789
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,200
The counter is here, right?

790
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
The counter is here.

791
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,040
It's room 408.

792
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,040
This Weibo post is from "e mo".

793
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,240
Just posted.

794
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,120
Just now.

795
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,320
So that means he's upstairs right now.

796
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:17,920
No.

797
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,640
We can only say at the time of "death".

798
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,840
He was there.

799
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,520
There's a chance he hasn't left yet.

800
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,880
Let's go check it out.

801
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,920
Let's go.

802
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,600
Then let's take him down directly.

803
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,720
Let's go to 408.

804
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,400
Go.

805
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,720
408, here we come.

806
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,360
We're all very smart

807
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,160
Really?

808
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,320
"Marriage Psychology"

809
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,480
"How to Make the Person You Love Love You Back"

810
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,320
Take one

811
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,960
I appreciate it

812
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,480
Every day you just show me

813
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,560
these strange things

814
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,280
No wonder my marriage and love life have failed

815
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,480
You're wearing such a big diamond ring

816
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,400
How is that a failure?

817
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,160
Where's 408?

818
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,920
Go that way

819
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
408

820
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,360
No, this is Old Liu's place.

821
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,320
This is my home.

822
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,640
What are you doing at my place?

823
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,880
Why is your door open?

824
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,920
Air it out.

825
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,080
The dog smell is too strong inside.

826
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,400
Maybe he took the photo from your place.

827
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:21,840
Come in.

828
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,000
Find me a window.

829
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,200
My room doesn't even have a bed.

830
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,520
And you want a window?

831
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,120
This is room 408.

832
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,920
Over here.

833
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,480
Let's go.

834
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,360
Seems I overthought it.

835
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,640
Blocked by this

836
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,760
Happy Home

837
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,440
Happy Home

838
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,240
Happy Home

839
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,200
Isn't this Happy Home?

840
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,840
At the entrance of Happy Home in 2007

841
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,960
Then once again

842
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,320
when we came back here

843
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,800
This place has changed quite a bit

844
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,600
This is Happy Home

845
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,720
I'm really curious

846
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,320
Why did they put this here

847
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,160
What's this door lock for

848
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,240
Little one

849
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,840
Right

850
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,320
Kids can open the door

851
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,160
Indeed

852
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,720
What's the password for "Happy Home"

853
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,080
I think it should be six digits

854
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,440
Enter the password and press 00# to confirm

855
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,800
Just try the "Happy Home" keypad

856
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,600
S

857
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,320
F

858
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
Z

859
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,200
J

860
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,320
9395

861
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,560
00#

862
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,640
A whole new world

863
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,200
Again

864
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,480
This music again

865
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,040
Slow down

866
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,840
Calm down

867
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,480
It's fine

868
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,440
This music again

869
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,880
Slow down

870
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,720
Calm down

871
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,200
It's okay

872
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,280
Stay calm

873
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,440
No problem

874
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,440
Don't be afraid

875
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,160
Everything's fine

876
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,920
You can do it

877
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,520
It's possible

878
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,280
We can make it

879
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,760
Here's a firecracker

880
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,120
Firecracker

881
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,440
That's a crayon, brother

882
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,360
This is a crayon

883
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,200
This isn't a firecracker

884
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,440
Someone as reckless as you

885
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,920
Do you really think they'd give you something like this?

886
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,120
Let me try it out first

887
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,520
This place is surprisingly dirty

888
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,080
Should we be wearing gloves?

889
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,840
Do we have any?

890
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,640
No

891
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,320
I'll go find some at the entrance

892
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,960
I just saw two here

893
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,160
Friends,

894
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,320
I have good news to share with you.

895
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,360
The door has been locked.

896
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,680
He lured us here

897
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,440
Then tried to take down all six of us

898
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,360
How is he always one step ahead?

899
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,920
This guy...

900
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,120
We're the ones being played

901
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,480
Let's search first.

902
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,520
There's a computer here.

903
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,720
What is this?

904
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,400
I don't know.

905
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,760
No password

906
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,440
Nothing here

907
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,160
The desktop is empty

908
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,920
Let's finish searching this room first

909
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,080
Guys,

910
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,640
Right now,

911
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
we need to find a key,

912
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,840
to open this door.

913
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,520
Let's finish searching this room first.

914
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,120
Only by searching can we find that key.

915
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,880
Here's a group photo

916
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,360
Isn't this Teacher Lou?

917
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,640
Let's see who else is in the photo

918
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,080
This is...

919
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,000
Lucky

920
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,640
Nanfans

921
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
You need to look at the names written here

922
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,320
Little Po

923
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,640
Sister Bao is...

924
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,280
Little Ni

925
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,880
Ah

926
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,400
Oh

927
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,240
E

928
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,680
Yi

929
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,960
Wu

930
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,640
Yu

931
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,840
They just used pinyin to name them

932
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,280
Right

933
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,120
Why is one person blurred out?

934
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,440
Little E

935
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,760
"E mo"

936
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,400
"E mo"

937
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,239
But this "E mo" kept buying till the end

938
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,280
"Bukuqi"

939
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,040
Ninth floor

940
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,840
Who's on the ninth floor?

941
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,920
"E mo"

942
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,840
"E mo"

943
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,000
Is there something on the back?

944
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,719
This is...

945
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,719
Let's open it and see.

946
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,600
Be careful.

947
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,400
Let's drink together.

948
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,120
The days of Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring tea

949
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,320
are a happy home.

950
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
The happiest times

951
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,800
because of delicious milk

952
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,880
meeting tea-scented fruit bits

953
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,320
are all memories full of love and companionship.

954
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:52,880
Happy Home

955
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,800
What does this have to do with Teacher Lou?

956
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
The person we wronged is Teacher Lou.

957
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,960
But the one taking revenge on us

958
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,600
is connected to Happy Home.

959
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,800
Let's see if we can find more clues or something.

960
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,400
This music again

961
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,000
Friends

962
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,080
Here's that song from inside the doll again

963
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,680
Last time with the doll

964
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,640
He said he heard that music here before

965
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,800
So I set that as the music inside the doll

966
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,960
Occasionally I would hear it in the apartment

967
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,280
this music

968
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:38,960
This song

969
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,360
It was indeed the music Teacher Lou was playing

970
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,640
I want to hear Teacher Lou play piano every day

971
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
Teacher Lou is good at everything

972
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,480
I wish Teacher Lou would come teach us every day

973
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,080
Auntie Lou's bedtime stories are so wonderful

974
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,920
Tomorrow

975
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,600
What story will she tell us?

976
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,120
I heard it's because her daughter "died"

977
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,280
That Auntie Lou founded this Happy Home

978
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,040
Auntie Lou is so pitiful

979
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,040
Auntie Lou and Teacher Lou are so kind to us

980
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,960
We should take good care of them in the future

981
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,600
So Loving Mother is actually Auntie Lou

982
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,280
When I turned ten years old

983
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,320
I met Loving Mother

984
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,600
Loving Mother found me

985
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,200
Discovered me

986
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,720
And brought me to this Happy Home

987
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,240
Grandpa sent me to Happy Home

988
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,280
Later Happy Home had some problems

989
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,000
Because

990
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,320
Our Loving Mother got sick

991
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,360
It was Alzheimer's disease

992
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,400
The elderly lady

993
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,880
Mom's memory has been getting worse recently

994
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
The doctor said it's Alzheimer's

995
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,440
So this whole series

996
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,800
Was all about this

997
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,000
So Loving Mother was Auntie Lou

998
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,680
Which means

999
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,920
This Teacher Lou

1000
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,040
Has been teaching them together with this mother

1001
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,640
Yes

1002
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,000
That's why they have such deep affection for him

1003
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,280
Then I went to their place

1004
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,240
and scared Lou's mom

1005
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,840
You caused Aunt Lou to fall

1006
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,560
Aunt Lou "passed away" because of that fall

1007
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,600
Mom "passed away"

1008
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,560
Mom also left me alone in the early morning

1009
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,440
You're guilty

1010
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,800
That's why these people hate you

1011
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,400
They're doing this to

1012
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,880
avenge Teacher Lou, Aunt Lou

1013
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,400
This is

1014
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:13,840
Take a look

1015
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,880
These are chrysanthemums

1016
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
They're here to commemorate them

1017
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:18,920
Yes

1018
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:25,760
Wait a moment

1019
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,640
There's something behind this

1020
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,040
Okay

1021
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,760
Press three times in a row

1022
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,640
Two quick presses each time

1023
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,560
For important information

1024
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,760
Save the conversation content

1025
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,640
Press four times in a row

1026
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,520
Two quick presses each time

1027
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,960
For emergencies

1028
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,040
Meet at the usual time

1029
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,320
Press five times in a row

1030
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,280
Two quick presses each time

1031
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,760
For critical situations

1032
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,840
Evacuate immediately

1033
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,760
This is a code

1034
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,480
Look at our photo

1035
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,000
She "died"

1036
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,600
This is his sister, right?

1037
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,080
Yes

1038
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,720
Isn't this Bamie?

1039
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,480
Successfully induced "suicide"

1040
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,720
This fan of Bamie's

1041
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,880
seems very much like the person who "killed" her

1042
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,840
He kept encouraging

1043
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,480
kept pushing her to investigate this matter

1044
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,200
handle this matter

1045
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,760
and even taught her how to handle it

1046
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,400
Right

1047
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,600
It's Bamie

1048
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,440
She "died"

1049
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,120
Two people "died"

1050
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,040
Who is this?

1051
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,720
Can't tell

1052
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,080
This is absolutely impossible

1053
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
We've definitely never seen this before

1054
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,160
There's a big one of these here

1055
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,920
big-character poster

1056
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,120
Put it on the table

1057
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,640
Bring the photos over

1058
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
The guilty ones

1059
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,600
So many people

1060
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,560
Violence

1061
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,480
Lies

1062
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,160
Jealousy

1063
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,040
Greed

1064
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,520
Snooping

1065
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,440
Impulse

1066
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,680
Isn't this Sister Bao?

1067
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:58,840
Isn't this Sister Bao?

1068
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,320
Executor

1069
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,680
Wait a minute

1070
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,240
I originally thought it was that violent person

1071
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,080
who "killed" Xiaojing

1072
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,600
and framed Teacher Lou

1073
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,160
That greedy person was bribed

1074
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,240
to help cover it up

1075
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,640
Never expected these three

1076
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,600
were the real culprits

1077
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,920
These three people:

1078
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,400
Cao Yangguang

1079
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,760
Cao's father

1080
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,320
Xiaokai

1081
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,720
Actually, I don't think

1082
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,400
it counts as locking her up

1083
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,080
I was just

1084
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,360
protecting her

1085
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,280
The secret he knew

1086
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,520
was probably that he found out

1087
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,400
I had Xiaojing locked up here

1088
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,440
Yangguang was the one who imprisoned Xiaojing

1089
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:43,760
Wasn't it him?

1090
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,280
It was you

1091
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,280
I locked her up

1092
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,120
Then she struggled with me

1093
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:48,880
During the struggle

1094
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,000
I accidentally pushed her

1095
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,640
Her head hit a rock

1096
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,160
and she

1097
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,200
"died" on the spot

1098
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,440
It's probably related to that trending topic earlier.

1099
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,280
Right?

1100
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,720
Yes.

1101
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:10,800
Wait a minute.

1102
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,880
What does "executor" mean here?

1103
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,080
Is she executing us,

1104
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,680
or have they already been executed?

1105
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,800
The executor carries out this act.

1106
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,960
"Killer."

1107
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,280
So we're the guilty ones.

1108
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,120
I think we should...

1109
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,840
match ourselves.

1110
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,120
Let's eliminate ourselves first,

1111
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,200
then exclude the remaining people.

1112
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,040
That would be the executor.

1113
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,840
We can assign it accordingly.

1114
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,200
Who represents violence?

1115
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,560
Bai Sanwan.

1116
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,400
What am I?

1117
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,280
No way.

1118
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,240
That's not right.

1119
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,280
Old Bai represents greed.

1120
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,040
Stealing money.

1121
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,440
Right?

1122
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,720
Yes.

1123
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,600
Exactly, that's me.

1124
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,720
After returning home,

1125
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
I realized I took the wrong bag.

1126
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,560
This bag had a set of three jade pieces,

1127
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,960
which seemed quite valuable.

1128
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,520
So I sold the jade.

1129
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,040
I acted impulsively.

1130
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,600
Mindlessly seeking revenge "killed" the old man.

1131
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,760
So I went there late at night.

1132
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,240
I planned to...

1133
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,520
I originally wanted to film something,

1134
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,240
but just as I set up my phone,

1135
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,160
I looked over...

1136
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,440
and there was another old lady there.

1137
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,200
And then the lies

1138
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,280
Fabricated evidence for family interests

1139
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,360
This was me

1140
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,680
Family interests

1141
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,520
I led that person

1142
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,240
to the vicinity of that grove

1143
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:29,840
Wanting to prove

1144
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,800
that he had been to that grove that night

1145
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,640
To frame him for this matter

1146
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,080
But never expected

1147
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,560
Who would have thought he was psychologically fragile

1148
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,120
and "committed suicide"

1149
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:42,760
Jealousy

1150
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,960
That was definitely not me

1151
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,280
You are this violence

1152
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,440
On July 30th

1153
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,640
I made up my mind

1154
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,720
We stole her phone and wallet

1155
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,480
And took that jade set of three

1156
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,680
Is Bamie this one?

1157
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,280
Self-proclaimed justice

1158
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,200
Exposing people's privacy

1159
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,400
She's just chasing clout

1160
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,240
Right

1161
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,720
She genuinely did it for the views

1162
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,960
So based on all the solid evidence

1163
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,200
We can reconstruct

1164
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,720
The last person the "deceased" saw before death

1165
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,920
Might have been Teacher Lou

1166
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,560
And she knew one of Teacher Lou's secrets

1167
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,800
Which led Teacher Lou to...

1168
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:21,960
Beautiful, huh

1169
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,640
You think you

1170
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,840
Aren't you suffering from unrequited love?

1171
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,640
Don't you like Teacher Lou?

1172
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,400
You're lovesick over someone you can't have.

1173
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,480
I...

1174
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,800
That Meimei Planet account posted

1175
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,520
showing her entering Apartment 11

1176
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,400
I also knew that on Tuesday

1177
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,080
she was going to Teacher Lou's class

1178
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,400
So I put two and two together

1179
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,320
I thought it must be

1180
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,000
her going to Teacher Lou's place

1181
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,440
You're just going by your own

1182
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,600
thoughts and assumptions

1183
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,760
I was wrong

1184
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,320
I'm sorry

1185
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,360
What do you do?

1186
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,040
Don't know

1187
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,160
I think I'm supposed to be this

1188
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:58,800
So I helped her

1189
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,440
by secretly photographing that person

1190
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,240
Don't know why

1191
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,640
he was wearing women's clothes

1192
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,520
just thought it was weird

1193
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:04,680
Right

1194
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,640
So I took this scoop

1195
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,400
and gave it to

1196
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,080
sold it to Bamie

1197
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,760
No, but he didn't claim moral superiority

1198
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,280
I didn't claim moral superiority

1199
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:12,880
No

1200
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,880
What does he think it is?

1201
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,360
He thinks he didn't claim moral superiority

1202
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,320
But you exposed someone's privacy

1203
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,200
The guy was crossdressing

1204
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,040
Yes, exactly

1205
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,000
By the way

1206
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,520
Believe me

1207
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:19,960
Right

1208
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,240
There's still one empty spot here

1209
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,520
The executor is this person

1210
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,920
Who is this person?

1211
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,520
We've definitely never seen this person before

1212
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,480
Then it's possible this person

1213
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,040
was "killed" by someone

1214
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,680
Impossible

1215
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,200
We don't know who this person is

1216
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,160
Maybe this is "e mo" themselves

1217
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,400
In his mind

1218
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,520
he's already "dead"

1219
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,240
He's already "dead"

1220
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,760
Yes, he's someone seeking revenge

1221
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,160
He is vengeance

1222
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,320
His heart is "dead"

1223
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,280
You can think of it this way

1224
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,920
Or after he completes this matter

1225
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,640
he will "commit suicide"

1226
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,440
Understood

1227
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,440
There's also a combination lock box here.

1228
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,880
I think it should be...

1229
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,480
First, we need to figure out the password.

1230
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,080
"e mo"

1231
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,400
Let's try "e mo" as the password.

1232
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,120
"e mo"

1233
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,800
E

1234
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,440
M

1235
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:13,920
O

1236
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,160
No, it's not just three digits.

1237
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,480
At least four to six digits.

1238
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,800
I think it should be a six-digit code.

1239
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:23,960
Isn't this Sister Bao?

1240
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,560
Executor.

1241
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,840
Sister Bao is Xiao Ne.

1242
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,480
Xiao Ne.

1243
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,320
X

1244
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:29,840
I

1245
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,360
AO

1246
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:33,800
That's it.

1247
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,120
Voice recorder.

1248
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,920
What is this thing?

1249
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,080
Push-strong receiver.

1250
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,960
Used with the push-strong listening device.

1251
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,320
Can receive all faint sounds within a two-meter range.

1252
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,800
All faint sounds.

1253
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,720
Plays the monitored content in real-time.

1254
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
Let's listen to the voice recorder first.

1255
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,400
It should be connected to the computer.

1256
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:57,760
Let's listen to it.

1257
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,960
Perhaps because of my countless prayers

1258
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,360
I truly obtained the "regret medicine"

1259
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,520
Hey you there

1260
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,080
Come play with the doll

1261
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,200
Let's think first

1262
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,680
The doll is telling

1263
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,520
About that moment when he moved heaven

1264
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,880
Week seven

1265
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,720
Perhaps because of my countless prayers

1266
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,800
I truly obtained the "regret medicine"

1267
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,080
Friends

1268
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,200
When we moved heaven

1269
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,840
There was no one else

1270
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,680
Except us six

1271
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,480
Used with the high-powered listening device

1272
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,960
Plays the intercepted audio in real-time

1273
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,720
Isn't this the high-powered bug?

1274
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,840
So we...

1275
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,480
have been under surveillance all along

1276
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,200
That's why he's always one step ahead

1277
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:01,880
Because he always knows

1278
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,760
what our next move will be

1279
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,240
He's always watching our location

1280
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:05,680
Right

1281
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,320
Listen again

1282
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,400
Perhaps because of my countless prayers

1283
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,040
I truly got a second chance

1284
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,320
What Goose means is...

1285
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,680
So in our previous timeline

1286
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,760
we succeeded in our revenge

1287
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,040
This timeline was altered by those relatives

1288
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,040
They can no longer reset the timeline

1289
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,240
Since we can't rescue Teacher Lou

1290
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,360
we have no choice but to continue our revenge

1291
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,000
Sister Bao

1292
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,080
I'm so happy

1293
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,000
This tells us that...

1294
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,040
Goose and Sister Bao have been eavesdropping on us

1295
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,280
Is it possible they're both called Goose?

1296
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,760
No, this sounds exactly like a lecture

1297
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,600
After playing this...

1298
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,400
Then what Goose means is...

1299
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,560
What the teacher means is...

1300
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,000
Right

1301
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,760
Goose is their leader

1302
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,760
Let's talk about what comes next first.

1303
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,280
Don't you think what she means is

1304
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,720
that we succeeded in the previous timeline,

1305
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,240
because all of them "died"?

1306
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,440
What Goose means is

1307
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,760
that in our previous timeline,

1308
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,400
we actually succeeded in our revenge.

1309
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,680
That is to say, last time,

1310
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,480
after Teacher Lou "died",

1311
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,480
he found us,

1312
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,560
and we already got our revenge.

1313
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,600
Everyone had jumped to their "suicide",

1314
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,000
committing "suicide" out of guilt,

1315
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
loneliness drove me to jump,

1316
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,280
mine was remorse,

1317
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,040
a love suicide,

1318
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,120
taking the blame,

1319
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,960
anxiety...

1320
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,400
Our previous jumps

1321
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,840
were all caused by their revenge.

1322
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,680
Isn't this Ba Mei?

1323
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,480
Successfully guided to "suicide".

1324
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,360
So that means

1325
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,080
they were originally going to "kill" us,

1326
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,880
and this time,

1327
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,120
because of our loved ones' protection,

1328
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,640
we didn't jump to our "suicides",

1329
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,120
so they have to keep coming after us.

1330
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,480
Right, they must "eliminate" us.

1331
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,080
Apartment 11, famous throughout the detective community,

1332
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:47,640
the Investigation Team,

1333
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,120
are actually all villains.

1334
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,920
"Goose" is step by step

1335
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,760
pushing us

1336
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,760
into the eye of the storm.

1337
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,040
Damn it.

1338
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,680
What should we do then?

1339
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,960
Come on, let's listen again.

1340
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,240
What is he pressing?

1341
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,840
Could this be some kind of clue?

1342
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,760
Listen again

1343
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,560
Press that several times

1344
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,360
Is that it?

1345
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,480
It says to press it three times

1346
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,440
Double-click quickly each time

1347
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,800
marks important information

1348
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,000
just see how many times he presses

1349
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,800
double-clicked ones

1350
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,800
then pressed three times

1351
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,560
Right

1352
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,200
Important information

1353
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,880
I get it now.

1354
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,120
So this thing of his

1355
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,040
is the hand, that clicking sound from the pen

1356
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,520
has been among us all along.

1357
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,360
Then when he starts clicking the pen

1358
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,760
that means important information.

1359
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,240
Really, could it actually be...

1360
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,480
among one of us?

1361
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,080
Every time we're just taking notes.

1362
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,760
What are you laughing at?

1363
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,280
I never click pens

1364
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,520
You really love clicking pens

1365
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,560
Both of you love clicking pens

1366
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,040
You two are on my left and right.

1367
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,920
I admit I love clicking pens.

1368
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,800
But that pen of mine

1369
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,320
is really just a pen.

1370
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,040
I don't believe it.

1371
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,440
It's true.

1372
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,000
If a secret is told,

1373
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,160
can it still be called a secret?

1374
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,920
This was when we were

1375
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,520
questioning Cao Yangguang.

1376
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,760
If a secret is told,

1377
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,880
can it still be called a secret?

1378
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,000
What I mean is...

1379
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,960
This Cao Yangguang has a thing for women's products.

1380
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,200
And he's also Xiao Jing's classmate.

1381
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,360
There's also a big secret.

1382
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,640
We need to investigate him.

1383
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Alright, next.

1384
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:44,600
Two.

1385
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:45,680
Three.

1386
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:46,800
Four.

1387
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:47,960
Five.

1388
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,720
Emergency evacuation!

1389
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,840
We're blocked by this.

1390
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,400
Happy Home.

1391
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,760
Happy Home.

1392
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,040
This is where we just came from.

1393
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,360
We've been recorded.

1394
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,400
Happy Home.

1395
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,800
Happy Home.

1396
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,800
Isn't this Happy Home?

1397
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,080
Because we're almost there

1398
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,000
So I pressed it ten times

1399
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,560
Let me tell you

1400
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,600
Everyone in your room needs to leave now

1401
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,720
We're coming in soon

1402
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,320
It's a whole different world

1403
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,120
So Sister Bao is in the building

1404
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,840
Sister Bao has been coordinating with him

1405
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,280
Right?

1406
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,560
Before we came in

1407
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,720
Sister Bao was right here

1408
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,040
Then before this person entered

1409
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,200
They had Sister Bao withdraw early

1410
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,280
So scary

1411
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,440
Don't do this

1412
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,760
I'm getting goosebumps

1413
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,400
You guys

1414
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,280
While we were moving inside

1415
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,640
You were making her retreat

1416
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,320
Who was clicking the pen earlier on the way?

1417
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:53,920
It was you

1418
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,640
No

1419
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,560
Could it be me?

1420
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:57,960
Don't do this

1421
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,440
We've come this far

1422
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,600
Don't mess this up

1423
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,560
I'll go find room 408 first

1424
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,240
Did I click it?

1425
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:03,920
Could it be...

1426
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,800
No one can escape responsibility

1427
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,360
This is the trust game

1428
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,040
Let me tell you

1429
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:08,760
Brothers

1430
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,680
Those criminals who "caused" Teacher Lou's death

1431
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,040
actually moved into Apartment 11 on the same day as you

1432
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,480
I'll get close to them as a good friend

1433
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,920
and seize the chance to take revenge

1434
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,760
Right

1435
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,160
The perpetrator might be one of us six

1436
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,560
One person among our group of six

1437
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,040
But this "killer"

1438
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,640
is infiltrating among us

1439
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,640
to clear his own suspicion

1440
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,360
Who?

1441
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,120
The question is whether we can corroborate each other's alibis

1442
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,280
I think the four of us

1443
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,480
can trust each other somewhat

1444
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,240
What makes you think we can trust each other?

1445
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,160
He's a repeat offender

1446
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,560
How can you prove that?

1447
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,080
How terrifying

1448
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,680
His reaction seems abnormal now

1449
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,080
What about me?

1450
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,280
What?

1451
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,400
He took something

1452
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,320
Don't!
