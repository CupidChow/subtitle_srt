1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,560
It took us back to 1988

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,760
We didn't actually "time travel"

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,840
This is actually 2022

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,400
Two people "died"

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,920
Today's "deaths" were

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,960
Little Wang and (Old Wang)

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,440
Right

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,360
Heaven has eyes indeed

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,080
"Meet You" - thank you "Meet You"

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,960
Is this the six of us?

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Could you tell us about it?

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,240
No

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,320
Why, grandpa?

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,160
Nephew

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,000
Dad, trust me

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,920
Don't go to Chuyang Alley

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,320
Disobey and you'll "die"

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,280
This link again

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,880
You'll all "die"

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,360
This season will unfold over eleven weeks of episodes

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,400
telling the stories that occur in Apartment No. 11 of Tui City

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,320
Six players will move in as new residents

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,440
and occupy Apartment No. 11

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,120
They will become entangled in bizarre cases

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,960
By forming the "Apartment Detective Team"

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,040
they'll visit different floors

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,880
befriend various long-term residents

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,760
solve their own identity mysteries

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,840
and uncover secrets behind each case

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,720
The first six cases

31
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,560
will unlock one new resident's story each week

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,400
The complex relationships between new and old residents

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,960
will gradually come to light

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,440
Starting from the seventh case

35
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,440
all storylines will intertwine

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,800
As truths are revealed layer by layer

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,720
every choice made by the new residents

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,200
will influence the story's direction

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,520
and the final outcome

40
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,560
In each case

41
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,480
the detective team must at the crime scene

42
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,000
identify the "victim"

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,320
and based on clues

44
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,960
pinpoint the relevant suspects

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,520
Warning

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,040
Suspects are not limited to

47
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,960
Apartment 11 residents and visitors

48
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,320
Among the deduction team

49
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,480
There may also be suspects

50
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,040
After gathering the suspects

51
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,840
The deduction team will interrogate them

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,440
And deduce again based on testimonies

53
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,960
Finally vote to identify the "real culprit"

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,320
Only the "real culprit" can lie

55
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,120
Only by finding the real "murderer"

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,800
Will players achieve victory

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,840
Players who vote correctly

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
Will receive a golden key

59
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,200
If a player is the "murderer"

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,440
Successfully escaping will earn a golden key

61
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,680
Song Piaoliang, why did you call us here?

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,600
Today I invited everyone to come do some crafts and have fun.

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,800
Your shop being here is kind of sad.

64
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400
Because there aren't any customers at all.

65
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,320
There's another one over there.

66
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,480
It won't open until next month.

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,000
The competition pressure isn't too bad.

68
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,640
The one opening next month isn't a noodle shop, right?

69
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,040
What kind of competition pressure?

70
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,080
What competition pressure?

71
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,200
I just wanted to know.

72
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,760
Anyway, this is my shop.

73
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,440
And today,

74
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,320
I invited everyone to do crafts.

75
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,600
These are rugs.

76
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,520
Bai Song, Guo Zhou, Liu Ku.

77
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes, and each of your

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,640
names

79
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,560
is missing one stroke.

80
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,240
Still missing one stroke.

81
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,600
Everyone can complete it themselves.

82
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,120
But before,

83
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,040
we didn't expect Ku would commit a crime.

84
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,280
So these were made earlier.

85
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Maybe we should cross his name out.

86
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,600
Wait, then shouldn't we also change

87
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,720
change our slogan?

88
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,560
Liu Ku.

89
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,000
Then we'll have to redo it, your rug needs to be remade.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,480
No, we can finish this first.

91
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,680
Then we'll mail it to him.

92
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,880
Let him in prison

93
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,520
think of us while in prison.

94
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,640
Come on.

95
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,600
Let's do it.

96
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,520
You demonstrate first.

97
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,080
Awesome

98
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,000
Your craft shop is really well done

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,160
Alright, your turn

100
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,320
Hold it steady

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,240
Just push it in harder

102
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,920
No good, what is this thing?

103
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,440
You...

104
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:20,720
Wait a second

105
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,360
Don't force it

106
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,280
Your lines

107
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,800
What is this?

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,240
It's broken

109
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,200
Look at this

110
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,000
Seems really difficult

111
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,000
Not what I thought

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,720
It's over

113
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,400
I'll get some drinks

114
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,880
Boss, I'm here to pick up

115
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,320
The things I left here

116
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,880
Okay, come on

117
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,480
This is

118
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,280
The name of my special drink is

119
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,880
Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Honeydew Ice

120
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,960
Boss Song, this special blend you've developed

121
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,120
looks quite good

122
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
Great, and the few cups you've already prepared

123
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,720
This is something I just developed

124
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,200
Real Fruit Grapefruit Four Seasons Special Blend

125
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,600
Thank you

126
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,760
This new product is called

127
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,920
Grapefruit Four Seasons Honeydew Ice

128
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,960
It contains premium fresh milk

129
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,000
With Real Fruit Grapefruit Four Seasons as the base

130
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,920
You can taste the subtle tea aroma

131
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,840
And real fruit pieces you can chew

132
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,760
Super delicious

133
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,320
How is it?

134
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,520
It's you

135
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,480
Really tasty

136
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,200
Amazing

137
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,920
Authentic

138
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,360
This taste is truly authentic

139
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,760
We old Tui City folks

140
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,960
Start every day with this routine

141
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,000
Just this one cup

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,520
Must have this cup

143
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,600
Alright

144
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,280
After this let's go back to sleep

145
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,720
Fine then

146
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,280
Maybe we should call it a day

147
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,320
Wait, we're not done yet

148
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,840
Shouldn't we finish this first?

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,440
Do it

150
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,040
Done

151
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,120
What's going on?

152
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,760
This doll

153
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,640
Stop messing with it

154
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,520
This isn't the one

155
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,960
Do not approach Song Piaoliang's Handicraft Shop

156
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,160
Do not approach the abandoned power distribution room

157
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
Do not attend the family reunion banquet

158
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,760
Do not go to work

159
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,120
Do not go to Chuyang Alley

160
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,160
These were all taken from the scene

161
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,960
and brought back

162
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,560
The scene

163
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,400
Don't you think it's just adorable?

164
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,360
I don't think it's cute at all.

165
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
In fact, I find it rather suspicious.

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,720
Zhao Zhao

167
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:39,920
What?

168
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,320
This person...

169
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,360
Zhao Zhao

170
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,640
Zhao Zhao

171
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
She looks completely distraught

172
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,560
It's okay, we...

173
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,920
Take it slow

174
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,560
Don't move around

175
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,840
What are you holding?

176
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,240
Right

177
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,120
What is this?

178
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,560
What thing?

179
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,120
What?

180
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,240
Missing Person Notice

181
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,800
Daughter

182
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Why have I been calling for twelve years

183
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,600
smartwatch

184
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,960
but still can't reach you?

185
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,360
Not even eighteen years old...

186
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,240
Mom is waiting for you to come home

187
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,800
Could someone please

188
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,240
is there anyone

189
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,600
Sister

190
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,480
Song Piaoliang

191
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
Could it be

192
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,440
relatives?

193
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Have you found your daughter?

194
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Your mother

195
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,800
Do you know her?

196
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,520
I don't know her.

197
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,640
You should know her.

198
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,120
I don't know her.

199
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,760
How come you still don't know her?

200
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,080
You should know her by now.

201
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,560
May I see what you're holding?

202
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,680
Yes, take a look.

203
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,120
This.

204
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,040
There's a doll exhibit on the second floor.

205
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,800
This is my child.

206
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,560
My child

207
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,680
named Zhao Budao

208
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,240
Who is this?

209
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,640
Why is he still holding this doll?

210
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,880
We have the doll your child was holding

211
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,480
this doll

212
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,840
Do you have it?

213
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,200
Is it this one?

214
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,560
Yes

215
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,160
Is this the one?

216
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,600
It's that one

217
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Is this the doll?

218
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,240
Yes

219
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,640
This is my daughter's favorite doll

220
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,760
Doll House

221
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,880
People turn into dolls

222
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,640
Humans become dolls

223
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,720
People transform into dolls

224
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,360
Doll Museum

225
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,240
The Doll Pavilion

226
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,600
People can turn into dolls

227
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,200
Humans can indeed become dolls

228
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,960
Disobey and you'll "die"

229
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
She said that

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,560
Who would turn into a doll?

231
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,120
What do you mean?

232
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,680
We need to go check it out.

233
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,440
Let's check out this doll exhibit on the second floor.

234
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,880
See if Zhao Budao is here.

235
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,120
Zhao Budao might be connected to that

236
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,400
"death prophecy" doll.

237
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,640
Alright then, let's

238
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,360
go to that doll exhibit.

239
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,480
It feels a bit scary

240
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,360
Yeah, definitely scary

241
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,800
I think so too

242
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,560
Help!

243
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,280
Old Bai, it's all up to you

244
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,680
Don't point at me

245
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,000
Nephew

246
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,560
Uncle

247
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,400
We're counting on you, Uncle

248
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,000
Nephew, we're counting on you

249
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,560
Life Doll Museum

250
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,280
That's really scary

251
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,800
What does this say?

252
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,920
Camera is activated.

253
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,240
This is the camera.

254
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,640
Right.

255
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,360
Please stand in the verification area.

256
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,960
Here.

257
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,720
Come here, the verification area.

258
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,640
You go first.

259
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,200
Aren't I the most senior here?

260
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,680
Bullying the elderly like this.

261
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,240
Verification failed.

262
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,880
Not me.

263
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,600
Just let her do it.

264
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,040
You try.

265
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,800
Just go ahead.

266
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,440
Your turn.

267
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,240
You people...

268
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,080
I didn't.

269
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,040
Verification failed.

270
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,160
See?

271
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,400
Verification failed.

272
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,760
Verification failed.

273
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,040
Why do we need verification?

274
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,280
Isn't it supposed to enter?

275
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,760
Can't get in.

276
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,880
This can enter.

277
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,720
Check from inside.

278
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,240
Push this side.

279
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,840
Wait a moment.

280
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,560
What's written on the ground?

281
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,160
What does "member invitation card" mean?

282
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,040
Here, take this.

283
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,960
Reach out and take it.

284
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,880
Hey, you there.

285
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,360
Alright, I'll do it.

286
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,480
Done.

287
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,000
Why is there a membership card on the ground?

288
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,960
Life Doll.

289
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,840
Inviting everyone to play.

290
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,160

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,000

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,720
For this event

295
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,240
Non-members can also participate

296
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,800
Verification will be conducted at the entrance

297
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
If you force entry without following rules

298
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,600
You might become a permanent exhibit

299
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,840
Who are you trying to scare?

300
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,480
Alright, I'm leaving

301
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:22,920
I'm going to become an exhibit

302
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,400
Don't

303
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,240
Don't go

304
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,160
Don't become an exhibit

305
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Old Bai, that doll of yours

306
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
It must be like this

307
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,240
That's how it is

308
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
So we need to go back and change clothes

309
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,960
Right?

310
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,360
Right

311
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,800
No

312
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,240
We don't have gothic outfits

313
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,000
Where can we change?

314
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,840
It's right here

315
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,320

B105, let's go

320
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,360
Party time

321
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,480
Who's the breakdance king?

322
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,920
Among us

323
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,600
Isn't this your specialty?

324
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,760
Isn't that Zhou Zengzeng?

325
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,520
Breakdance

326
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,600
Uncle

327
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,640
Yes, your uncle - breakdance

328
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,240
B105

329
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,720
This is the place

330
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,080
I see it

331
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,920
105 is here

332
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,000
Hello

333
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,120
Welcome

334
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,480
Hi

335
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,680
Let's play together

336
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,560
We heard that if you participate in that dance machine

337
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,680
and get an S rank

338
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,840
you can get gothic-style outfits

339
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,240
right?

340
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Hello

341
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,040
Hello

342
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,240
Hello

343
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,960
You are...?

344
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,600
Hello

345
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
What are you doing here?

346
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,080
She knows her

347
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
You don't remember me?

348
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,160
You really don't remember me?

349
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,720
I really don't remember you

350
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Try to think, is there...

351
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,640
...an aunt, or some relative?

352
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,920
I don't have any

353
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,280
I'm an orphan too

354
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,560
You two know each other?

355
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,200
We know each other

356
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,440
We're good friends

357
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,080
I'm Singer Zhang

358
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,400
Singer Zhang

359
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,800
I have some business to attend to

360
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,960
But I'll come find you again later

361
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,400
You'll come find me again?

362
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,040
I have things to do

363
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,640
I'll go first

364
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,720
Did you win these clothes by dancing here?

365
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,640
Yes

366
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,080
Alright

367
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll get myself a little dress too

368
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,720
Goodbye

369
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,160
You don't remember her?

370
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't remember her

371
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
This outfit

372
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,040
She got it when she was dancing

373
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,880
She scored an S

374
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,080
And won this outfit

375
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,920
Let's try too

376
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,800
Let's try to win one

377
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,520
How do we dance to this?

378
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,360
I don't get it

379
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,400
Bro, you try dancing

380
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,360
How does this work?

381
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,360
Oh no

382
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,800
Bro

383
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,120
Our dancing is really terrible

384
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,760
Just dance randomly

385
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,000
Okay

386
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,400
Let's go

387
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,000
We'll be like

388
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,440
Like

389
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:09,920
Cheerleaders

390
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,080
Like those in dance games

391
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Just swaying along

392
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,520
Yeah

393
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,280
I'm gonna do a Thomas flare

394
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,240
Why girl group dance?

395
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,480
What's wrong with this girl next to me?

396
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,120
Why are you dancing like Liu Genghong?

397
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,120
Working out here?

398
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,960
You're burning fat now

399
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,080
Don't take this opportunity

400
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,280
to talk about losing weight

401
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,280
After all your jumping around

402
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,920
My nephew jumps higher than you, Song Piaoliang

403
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,840
This is fat burning

404
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,760
You hit me

405
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,560
Song Piaoliang overtook you

406
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,000
I've been jumping so hard

407
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,760
and only scored 1000 more than him

408
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,640
As if others aren't trying hard too

409
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,520
You definitely can

410
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,280
I definitely can't

411
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,840
Come on

412
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,400
Wait a second

413
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,760
My younger brother can dance

414
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,440
I can't dance

415
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,680
You can

416
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,320
You and your brother

417
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,440
Bro, let's do the "Shehui Yao"

418
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,800
I just want to see the "Shehui Yao"

419
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,200
Here we go

420
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,280
Hurry

421
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,320
We're quite well-matched, aren't we?

422
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,360
Social Dance

423
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,320
Okay

424
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,040
The two of us

425
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,720
Stronger than them

426
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,240
Alright, come on

427
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,440
Come, I'll go with Ke

428
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,000
Ke and I will go

429
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,000
Okay

430
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,560
Okay

431
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,400
Beginner's recommendation

432
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,320
I want the hardest one

433
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,280
Did you ask me?

434
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,480
I'm the little sister

435
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,800
What is this?

436
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,200
What is this?

437
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,160
I want the hardest one

438
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,760
What kind of song did you pick?

439
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't even know what he's doing

440
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,320
Quite synchronized

441
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,320
Have you two practiced this?

442
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,520
Or is it just that...

443
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,320
...as long as you reach that circle?

444
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,160
You've already connected

445
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,760
Fourteen

446
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,400
Fifteen

447
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,760
Sixteen

448
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,280
Seventeen

449
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,320
Guo Baoyou

450
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,920
His score is really high

451
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,520
Do you practice a lot

452
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,120
at home normally?

453
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,160
You've got skills

454
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,200
Guo Baoyou

455
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,600
Guo Baoyou's good

456
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,360
S-rank

457
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,440
He must be S-rank

458
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,839
S

459
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,119
Boss

460
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,599
Double S

461
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,680
Too intense

462
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,400
Impressive

463
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,440
Daring to challenge the Dance King

464
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,280
Daring to challenge the Dance King

465
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,880
Then just use the changing room

466
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,840
in my shop

467
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,200
Okay

468
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,400
Okay

469
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,640
Okay

470
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
So beautiful

471
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:42,800
Really gorgeous

472
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,960
Amazing

473
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,200
Are you really going to the Life Doll Museum?

474
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,080
Yes

475
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,520
Why? Is it off-limits?

476
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,640
Are you residents here?

477
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,040
Haven't you heard

478
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
about the museum's legend?

479
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,560
No

480
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,760
What rumor?

481
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,360
Tell us about it

482
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:55,920
What kind of

483
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,800
legend?

484
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,000
Inside that doll museum,

485
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,240
some people entered and never came out

486
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,200
After midnight,

487
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,680
you can still hear voices talking

488
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,000
But there's actually no one inside.

489
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,000
I advise you all

490
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,560
to just turn back and go home.

491
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,360
We're the type who knows there are tigers in the mountains,

492
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
yet still head straight for them, alright?

493
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,840
Let's go. Bye.

494
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,600
The more confident we act now,

495
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,640
the faster we'll run later.

496
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,280
Who knows,

497
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,560
anyway I'll first let myself

498
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,640
feel relaxed and happy for now.

499
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,080
Because it's definitely going to be terrifying inside.

500
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,480
Right.

501
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,400
I can already sense it.

502
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,440
This feeling is like

503
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,320
doing the social dance.

504
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,080
Is it time yet?

505
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,800
Hello.

506
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,440
Hello.

507
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,640
Song Beautiful, come quick!

508
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,240
I'm currently researching designs

509
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,080
for Oreo black-and-white puzzles.

510
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,160
Oreos being black and white

511
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,440
can create many different ways to play.

512
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,280
Everyone's here,

513
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,040
we're all friends,

514
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,720
let's eat Oreos together

515
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,760
and share them.

516
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,280
Since you love Oreos so much,

517
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,760
you definitely wouldn't miss any

518
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
black-and-white truths.

519
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,320
Right?

520
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,800
Exactly.

521
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,680
This is my favorite Oreo -

522
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,480
twist it, lick it, dunk it.

523
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,840
So delicious it makes you fly.

524
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,160
Play together with Oreos,

525
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,760
solve cases easily without worries.

526
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,600
Why is she suddenly talking to the corner?

527
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,320
Why is this happening?

528
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,680
Very sudden.

529
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,560
Don't mind it.

530
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,760
Mind your own business.

531
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,000
It's already midnight.

532
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,840
Let's hurry inside.

533
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,040
Let's go, come on.

534
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,680
Nephew.

535
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,640
You go first, nephew.

536
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,880
Can you pass the verification?

537
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,320
Please verify one by one.

538
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,080
Verification successful.

539
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,040
Brother Three Bowls, you're here too

540
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,640
You're here for the new product launch too

541
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,560
What's your deal?

542
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,360
Aren't you...

543
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,520
I took the day off today

544
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,760
Today I'm a VIP member

545
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,840
There really are a lot of people

546
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,600
Hello everyone

547
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,000
Verification successful

548
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,280
Why hasn't it started yet?

549
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,720
Didn't they say it would start at twelve?

550
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,120
Can we not go in? What does this mean?

551
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,720
I don't know.

552
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,320
It's so dark here.

553
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,120
Is there any light?

554
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:48,920
We've been standing here for so long.

555
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,440
Is that a light up there?

556
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,240
Which one?

557
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,920
That one?

558
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,600
Someone turn it on.

559
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,440
It's on.

560
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,080
What is this?

561
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,600
Unauthorized intruders.

562
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,320
Permanently displayed.

563
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Repeat offenders.

564
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,560
Who is this? Look for yourself.

565
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:06,920
It's you.

566
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,440
Am I the only one here?

567
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,480
This is you, right?

568
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,080
Yes, that's definitely me.

569
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,040
This is you.

570
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,880
You've broken in multiple times.

571
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Who is this?

572
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,560
I don't know who this is.

573
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,440
It's the same one from earlier.

574
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,320
Sister, isn't it?

575
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,240
Yes, that mother.

576
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,000
That mother?

577
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,040
Your expression just now

578
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,760
Yes

579
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,840
Isn't that the auntie?

580
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,440
This verification gate has a switch.

581
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,120
Right.

582
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,760
Look.

583
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,360
Come on.

584
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,720
We won't look.

585
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,560
You look for us.

586
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:09,960
Me?

587
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,080
Come, Keke, look

588
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,120
Keke, look

589
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,320
Inside there's

590
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,120
You can't do this

591
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,320
Come

592
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,840
What is it?

593
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,000
Take a look

594
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,360
What?

595
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:27,920
There's nothing

596
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
There is

597
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,040
There's a figure

598
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,440
There's a figure

599
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,480
And he's wearing a hat

600
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,560
And a white robe

601
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,000
Someone's collapsed

602
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,200
Collapsed

603
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,280
Someone's down

604
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,880
Save them, quick

605
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,760
Go in and help

606
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,160
Hurry

607
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,200
I think we need to find a way to open this door

608
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,200
You've broken in multiple times

609
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,120
You must know how to get in

610
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,960
I don't know

611
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,720
Hurry up

612
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,280
Just tell us

613
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,240
Look

614
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,800
How did they even break in?

615
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,000
There's a 201 outside

616
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,720
Let me take a look

617
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,400
I'll go check

618
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,080
I'll go outside to look

619
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,360
Let's go

620
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,400
Nothing

621
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,360
Is this the thing?

622
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:23,760
This thing

623
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,120
Doesn't look like there's a door

624
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,720
Nothing here

625
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,880
This is a door

626
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,280
Yes, this is the one

627
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,960
This door should be movable

628
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,520
I saw that lady go through that door

629
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,120
It's an orange one

630
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,640
There's a house number on the back

631
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,400
It's 203

632
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,280
203 is over there

633
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,560
How did you open it?

634
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,000
Just move this aside and it opens.

635
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,960
Let's go in this way and take a look.

636
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,040
What exactly happened here?

637
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,320
Let's go.

638
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,680
There's a door here

639
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,800
Doll Museum back door

640
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:29,920
What

641
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,920
Scared "to death"

642
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,720
Day after day

643
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,880
It seems to be over there.

644
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,360
That corridor is over there.

645
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,560
That figure just now was over there.

646
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,400
This place is so scary.

647
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,240
It's terrifying.

648
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,800
Guo Baoyou, save me!

649
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,520
Is this the door?

650
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,720
This must be that corridor, right?

651
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,000
Should we open it?

652
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,520
Over here.

653
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,280
Hurry up and come here.

654
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,240
What kind of place is this?

655
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,280
Why did you slap me?

656
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,600
Excuse me

657
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,960
Where did that person go just now?

658
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,040
Doll

659
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,200
There's something else in the bag

660
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,640
What's inside the bag?

661
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,040
Spray

662
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,320
What is this?

663
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,040
Listen to it speak

664
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,680
I transformed the puppeteer onto the stage

665
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,360
I'm free

666
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,240
Transformed onto the stage

667
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,120
I transformed the puppeteer onto the stage

668
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,200
I'm free

669
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,240
There was nothing on the stage just now

670
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,720
Go take a look at the stage

671
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,680
Let's go

672
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,920
The stage is on the left, right?

673
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,000
This is the stage, isn't it?

674
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,320
This is the stage.

675
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:20,640
Yes.

676
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,760
Someone "died"

677
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,480
There was clearly no one on stage just now

678
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,320
Why is there someone "dead" now?

679
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,520
I moved the puppeteer onto the stage

680
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm free

681
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,320
The puppet "killed" someone

682
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,720
This place is too terrifying

683
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,440
Everyone, stay calm

684
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,120
Dolls definitely can't "kill people"

685
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,640
Right

686
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,680
For the safety of the apartment

687
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,800
I'm counting on the detective team

688
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,480
to investigate the scene first

689
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,120
And what about them?

690
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,880
Then I'll take them

691
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,840
to the property management's surveillance room

692
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,640
I think they also...

693
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,000
They're highly suspicious

694
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,560
That's right

695
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,000
Very suspicious indeed

696
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,880
I'll take them to check first

697
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
Then I'll bring along the Zhenguoli detective kit

698
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,680
for everyone

699
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,320
Okay

700
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,720
The Mischievous Magician

701
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,200
Business Instructions

702
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,760
We need to look at this first

703
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,080
Doll Museum

704
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,680
Security within the museum is handled by dedicated personnel

705
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,640
Every day at 11:00 AM

706
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,680
Authorized personnel open the museum's verification gate

707
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,720
Member customers at that time

708
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,640
may enter after verification

709
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,200
Do not trespass

710
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,760
Staff will conduct random inspections

711
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,640
Violations will be photographed immediately

712
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,560
and photos will be published

713
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,920
If accidentally separated from your group

714
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,480
please remain calm

715
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,520
Please tear off the price tag from the doll nearest to you

716
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,320
and stick it on your forehead

717
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,520
until you leave the doll exhibition

718
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,800
to prevent the dolls from mistaking you as an outsider and taking you away

719
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,360
Be wary of companions who got separated from you

720
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,840
especially if they keep

721
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,000
repeating the same phrase

722
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,880
During the new product launch group photo

723
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,320
each time dressed exactly like the dolls

724
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,880
Should we turn on the lights?

725
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,600
Could the light be on the "corpse"?

726
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,280
Come on

727
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,440
Let's examine the "corpse" first

728
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,880
Like this

729
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Let's move him outside

730
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,200
Alright?

731
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,840
Are you sure?

732
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,200
I'm sure.

733
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,920
Then let's do it.

734
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,320
Let's move on him.

735
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,280
Come on.

736
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,000
Here

737
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,240
There's a letter here

738
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,680
Speech script

739
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,960
Welcome everyone to

740
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,880
the venue of our new product launch

741
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,520
I am Doll

742
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,880
the designer of the Mischievous Magician

743
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,400
As you all know, my previous creations

744
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,200
were all lifelike

745
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,880
flexible, skin-like dolls

746
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,720
But today, what I'm introducing

747
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,240
the Mischievous Magician

748
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,800
is completely different

749
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,840
You could say it's the world's

750
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,680
most unique doll

751
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,160
It's a talking doll

752
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,360
that interacts with you in real-time

753
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,560
Its favorite phrase is

754
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,320
"I've transported my dollmaker

755
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,200
onto the stage

756
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,040
I'm free!"

757
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,880
"I've transported the dollmaker onto the stage

758
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,960
I'm free!"

759
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,280
The Mischievous Magician

760
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,520
is his new release today

761
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,200
Every time, dressed just like the doll

762
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,640
This is the puppeteer.

763
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,000
What

764
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,400
Hello

765
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,240
You are

766
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,320
I am Zhao Budao

767
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,320
She is Zhao Budao

768
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,080
Zhao Budao

769
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,480
Zhao Budao

770
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,240
My child's name is Zhao Budao

771
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,880
Your mother is looking for you

772
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,360
Yes

773
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
What are you doing here?

774
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,080
I just came to attend this press conference

775
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,520
Why hasn't it started?

776
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,080
Something's happened

777
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,040
Someone "died"

778
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,520
"Died"

779
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:03,880
"Died"

780
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,320
Someone "died"

781
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,760
Someone "died"

782
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,200
What's going on? Why are you only arriving now?

783
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,920
Do you know what time it is?

784
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,040
Yes, I'm a little late

785
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,960
Just a little late

786
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,080
It's not open anyway

787
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,200
Let's check this out first, okay?

788
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,640
Come on, quickly

789
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
I found a remote control

790
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,560
This curtain just went up

791
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,960
This was supposed to be a performance

792
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,080
What just happened?

793
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,600
We came to the doll exhibit to find you

794
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
The reception door was locked when we entered

795
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,080
We saw someone collapsed in the hallway

796
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,640
Then we tried to come in and save him

797
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,400
After entering through the back door

798
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,640
At first there was nobody on stage

799
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,600
We went to check the hallway

800
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
Only found a hat left in the hallway

801
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,760
And a doll

802
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,680
I moved the doll master onto the stage

803
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,240
I'm free now

804
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,880
When we returned to this exhibition hall

805
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,640
The "corpse" appeared on stage

806
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,560
Then you came in

807
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,920
Do you know your mom's been looking for you for a long time?

808
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,000
I didn't know

809
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,760
You can show her that flyer

810
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,720
I wanted to ask

811
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,360
Is this your childhood photo?

812
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,440
Is this you?

813
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,080
Yes

814
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,440
So where have you been these twelve years?

815
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,520
I got lost when I was six

816
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,120
Been missing ever since

817
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,760
Mom sent me to buy soy sauce

818
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,280
Then I couldn't find my way home

819
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,280
Where did you live afterwards?

820
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,080
Later went to an orphanage

821
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,400
This is a...

822
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,440
Was adopted by the orphanage

823
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,760
Classmate, so we're classmates then

824
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,560
We're all from the orphanage too

825
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
You too?

826
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,120
Yes

827
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,600
So we're all orphans, right?

828
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:40,960
What about you?

829
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,520
I am

830
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
We're all orphans gathered here

831
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,040
So why did you come here today?

832
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,840
Just came to see the exhibition

833
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,720
Because I like mystery novels

834
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,480
Enjoy seeing these...

835
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,200
Rather unusual things

836
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,560
Is this your first time here too?

837
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,160
Yes.

838
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,080
What a coincidence, you came right when someone "died."

839
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,560
But aren't you all here too?

840
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,040
Yes, coincidentally, we're always...

841
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,920
We're always present.

842
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,320
We're members of the deduction club.

843
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,480
We're part of the detective team.

844
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,760
Can I join you?

845
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,960
Sure.

846
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,800
Then let's work together now...

847
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
to find the "killer."

848
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,320
Zhao Budao.

849
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,560
Your name sounds quite ominous.

850
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,120
"Can't find the killer"...

851
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,640
Can't find.

852
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,520
With a name like that...

853
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,600
Let's examine the "corpse" together.

854
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,000
Right.

855
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,440
First, check what's on him.

856
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,760
He's wearing makeup...

857
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,360
like clown makeup.

858
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,360
There's a card here.

859
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,920
Hallway access card.

860
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,160
Look here.

861
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,680
The webbing between his thumb...

862
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,200
has ligature marks.

863
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,440
I think he was pulled...

864
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,520
with some kind of line.

865
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,840
He was hung up, right?

866
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,000
Probably.

867
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,200
Is it possible he was here...

868
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,560
There's a line on his neck.

869
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,320
Yes, see?

870
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,200
He was "strangled."

871
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,080
He was suspended.

872
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,880
There must have been a struggle.

873
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,400
Then "strangled" and dragged away.

874
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,760
"Killed" by a marionette.

875
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,360
What's wrong?

876
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,000
He has a birthmark.

877
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,080
A heart shape.

878
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,440
This foot is so chubby.

879
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,560
There's a heart-shaped birthmark on the foot.

880
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,040
Staff mobile phone charging station

881
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,639
There's a photo inserted here

882
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,960
Tea fruits meet "Meeting You"

883
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,280
The "Meeting You" project must succeed

884
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,440
In his phone

885
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,400
There's a reminder

886
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,159
It says

887
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,000
"Meeting You"

888
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,280
Hope everything goes well

889
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,760
This has nothing to do with the case

890
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,880
Meow meow

891
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,760
Thank you to the "Meeting You" organization

892
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,840
This "Meeting You"

893
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,719
What kind of organization is it?

894
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,840
Could you tell us about it?

895
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,719
No, I can't

896
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,600
Who's this?

897
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,639
This is the owner of this phone

898
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,280
That's the person

899
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,800
He also has a medical record

900
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,080
This person is named Lai Wan'ou

901
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,520
The diagnosis shows patient Lai Wan'ou

902
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,760
experienced a family member's suicide by jumping

903
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,200
and the fear of heights gradually developed into

904
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,840
PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)

905
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,640
Recommended to stay away from tall buildings

906
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,280
There's also a webpage

907
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,160
Look at this "Late Nightingale"

908
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:30,960
Singer Zhang

909
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
Here

910
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,600
Inside here

911
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,120
Why are there photos of Song Piaoliang?

912
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,080
See?

913
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,560
And they look very domestic and casual

914
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:40,880
These two

915
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,160
Clearly living together

916
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,920
Let's "interrogate" her

917
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,960
This person is named Lai Wan'ou

918
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,520
Lai Wan'ou

919
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:45,880
Ask her

920
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,560
What's your relationship with that doll called...

921
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,080
What exactly is your connection?

922
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,680
Stop pretending.

923
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,280
Cut the act.

924
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,520
Enough, stop searching.

925
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,680
Let's question her first.

926
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,680
Let her explain first.

927
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,280
Go ahead, speak.

928
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,080
What is this?

929
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,200
Everyone come here.

930
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,960
All of you, come here.

931
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
We found in this dollhouse...

932
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,600
we discovered a...

933
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,640
staff phone charging station.

934
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,200
This means...

935
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,480
Song Piaoliang has been living...

936
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,320
with this man.

937
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,800
Did you see that?

938
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,200
Take a look.

939
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,360
Everyone look.

940
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,720
Look at this.

941
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
He films you even when you're working.

942
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,120
Song Piaoliang is so beautiful.

943
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,080
You guys

944
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,320
What are you doing?

945
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,040
Come

946
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,960
Okay, thanks

947
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,000
Okay, thanks

948
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,920
What is this?

949
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,800
Can't reach

950
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,600
I saw you on that mystery-solving mini-program

951
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,080
that all the mystery enthusiasts in Tuishi are playing

952
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
I recognized you

953
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,520
You're amazing

954
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,280
I just saw you passing by downstairs

955
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,520
So I brought you one

956
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,920
We each got one

957
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,760
Do you think anyone seems suspicious?

958
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,160
Her

959
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,360
Wasn't I just with you guys?

960
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,560
Tell us your story

961
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:43,840
Yeah

962
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,840
See

963
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,360
She definitely has a story

964
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,760
Hurry up

965
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,560
Tell us quickly

966
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,560
Speak

967
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,320
Go ahead

968
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,080
What's going on?

969
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,440
Do you admit that guy

970
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,480
is your boyfriend?

971
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,960
Just someone you're emotionally involved with

972
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,320
Are you living together?

973
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,280
The child has grown up

974
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,040
You should discipline your sister

975
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,240
How can I control her?

976
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,320
I didn't even know, she never told me

977
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,120
Let's go then.

978
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,840
Let's go to Xiao Song's place.

979
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,360
No, you shouldn't just casually go to a girl's house.

980
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,200
I'll go.

981
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,280
Bro.

982
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,680
If your brother goes, you can't find fault with that.

983
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:30,920
Like this.

984
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,280
Then I think we should split up.

985
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,920
First, if your brother goes, no one can object.

986
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,240
Your brother's uncle goes.

987
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,280
You can't find fault with that.

988
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,280
Right, I'll go with our uncle.

989
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Uncle, let's go.

990
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,120
Then we'll take Budao with us.

991
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,360
Okay? Let's all go over there together.

992
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,240
Then I'll watch her.

993
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,480
You watch her.

994
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:43,840
Or you guys go.

995
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,440
You watch her.

996
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:44,680
Fine.

997
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,280
Let's go, Budao.

998
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,640
Let's go.

999
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
You guys stay here and look around.

1000
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,960
See if there's anything else.

1001
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,280
Not sure.

1002
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,040
Come on

1003
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,040
Let's loot this place

1004
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,760
This cabinet needs a password

1005
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,560
The others don't

1006
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,000
Isn't there a door here?

1007
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,440
Wait a moment

1008
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,400
It's a sliding door

1009
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,720
And ahead

1010
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,640
Look, do you see this?

1011
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,360
There's something up ahead

1012
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,680
You lift it upwards, right?

1013
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,480
If you lift it...

1014
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,760
Can you take the wind chime down?

1015
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,360
What do you mean?

1016
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,400
This trick again?

1017
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,720
How do I make it...

1018
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,920
Hang it over there

1019
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,080
It will do it itself

1020
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,320
Find the longest one

1021
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,840
It's hung over there

1022
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,120
Can it come back?

1023
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,400
Seems like it can't really come back, right?

1024
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,360
What about the room card?

1025
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,240
Give me the card

1026
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,400
Did it move?

1027
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,280
It's open

1028
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,720
Take a look

1029
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,600
What trick is this?

1030
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,840
What is this place?

1031
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,640
Performance props

1032
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,000
These are performance props

1033
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,560
There's a broken mirror

1034
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,000
Be careful

1035
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,480
There was a fight here

1036
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:46,960
Right

1037
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,320
Yes

1038
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,040
Wait a minute

1039
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,120
This thing on top is...

1040
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,760
This should lead to that stage, right?

1041
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,960
Bro, set up the ladder.

1042
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,280
Here.

1043
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,880
It's just a ventilation shaft, right?

1044
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,440
Isn't it?

1045
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,600
This must be...

1046
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,240
a passage for operating puppets.

1047
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,400
A puppet control passage.

1048
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,320
Because aren't puppets usually marionettes?

1049
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,040
They can control the front directly from backstage.

1050
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,000
Why is this glass broken?

1051
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,640
Is this...

1052
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,920
Is this the thing that's broken?

1053
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,560
Yes.

1054
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,160
See?

1055
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,360
But this mirror...

1056
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,080
has a rope hanging from it.

1057
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,920
What's this for?

1058
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,760
Above that mirror just now

1059
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,160
It's that

1060
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,040
It's a machine

1061
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,360
No, it's the pull rope, right?

1062
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,040
Winch

1063
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,720
It's fixed

1064
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,600
I understand now

1065
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,080
That winch

1066
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,920
must be related to this

1067
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,240
Because the ropes are identical

1068
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,560
Right

1069
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,360
And this

1070
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,440
It seems like something that can be pulled out

1071
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,240
This spot should be

1072
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,920
able to transport a mirror inside

1073
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,240
And this place

1074
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,840
can automatically retract it

1075
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,320
Which means

1076
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,400
this mirror was pulled over

1077
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,160
and then shattered when pulled back

1078
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,680
Yes, it broke when being pulled back

1079
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,840
But why did he transport the mirror there?

1080
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,240
Let me go check ahead

1081
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,240
Is there anything else up ahead?

1082
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,040
Bro

1083
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,320
You from there

1084
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,160
Throw me a small thing

1085
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,440
Be careful

1086
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,320
Bro, don't cut your hand

1087
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,120
Or wear gloves

1088
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,640
Coming over

1089
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,120
Reach out

1090
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,240
Done?

1091
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,680
Done

1092
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,240
Wait

1093
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,360
It's out, right?

1094
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,640
Okay, don't move

1095
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,120
Okay

1096
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,200
You almost crushed me

1097
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,120
Look

1098
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,320
It can come over

1099
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,800
Can it only reach this far?

1100
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,400
Yes

1101
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,840
It can go down this far

1102
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,960
Right, the rope is very long

1103
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,920
What's this used for?

1104
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,760
What can this mirror do?

1105
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,360
Is there something at the top?

1106
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,480
Where's big brother's remote control?

1107
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,120
You mean to lower it down?

1108
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:01,640
What's wrong?

1109
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,720
What did you press?

1110
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,280
This curtain...

1111
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,720
Why would he use this mirror?

1112
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,000
This mirror is a performance prop,

1113
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,040
but I just don't know

1114
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,000
what it's meant to be used for.

1115
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,880
What kind of performance requires this?

1116
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,840
And it must work in conjunction with

1117
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,400
these mechanisms inside it.

1118
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,040
Someone familiar with its operation

1119
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,840
could indirectly use this thing

1120
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,480
to accomplish something,

1121
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,080
but it's definitely not

1122
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,240
something that directly "kills" people.

1123
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:24,680
"A murder weapon."

1124
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:27,840
Wait a minute...

1125
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,920
It seems the curtain only comes down

1126
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,280
when the lights are turned off.

1127
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,560
Whenever the lights are on,

1128
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,880
the curtain automatically goes back up.

1129
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,160
There's one more problem

1130
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,920
When we passed by here earlier

1131
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,240
we didn't see this "corpse"

1132
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,040
The corridor is over there

1133
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,280
That figure we saw was over there

1134
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,840
If he were to put this mirror

1135
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,400
over the "corpse"

1136
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,880
we wouldn't be able to see it

1137
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,360
You said it's used

1138
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,680
to conceal the "corpse"

1139
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,000
I think it's definitely meant to hide the "corpse"

1140
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,000
Then when all of us

1141
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,920
have walked past,

1142
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,080
the winch automatically retracts this mirror

1143
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,600
back in place,

1144
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,040
so the "corpse"

1145
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,200
is revealed before our eyes.

1146
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,160
They're back

1147
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,200
Come quick, bro

1148
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,520
I've missed you so much

1149
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,480
What did you find?

1150
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,440
Why is there a mirror here?

1151
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,760
We found a secret room

1152
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,440
Not a secret room

1153
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,000
Just backstage

1154
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,840
Backstage

1155
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,800
Go take a look inside

1156
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,960
Right here

1157
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,560
Your sister has serious issues

1158
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,560
Your sister, seriously...

1159
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,240
It has this device

1160
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,040
Do you see on it

1161
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,360
there's a retractable line mechanism?

1162
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,120
It can retract it back

1163
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,600
This line

1164
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,680
When we entered

1165
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,800
there were broken glass shards on the floor

1166
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,960
Then behind here

1167
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,400
we found an intact piece

1168
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,840
This can be used to

1169
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,040
bring the mirror back from here

1170
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,320
When we first arrived

1171
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,400
it was like this

1172
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,320
Assuming when we came

1173
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,800
this mirror was placed here

1174
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,760
At that time these curtains

1175
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,520
were lowered

1176
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,200
These curtains

1177
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,760
only descend when

1178
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,600
all the room lights are off

1179
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,040
If I press the light switch

1180
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,960
they will rise up

1181
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,120
Actually this "corpse"

1182
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,320
was initially hidden behind this

1183
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,120
Then in that corridor

1184
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,120
after we entered

1185
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,800
it retracted this mirror

1186
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,280
Right

1187
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,080
Exactly

1188
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,920
The "corpse" was definitely

1189
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,040
always placed on the stage

1190
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,400
but initially it was concealed

1191
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:28,840
by some method

1192
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,200
covered up, we couldn't see it

1193
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,920
If there was a mirror

1194
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,840
with so many people present

1195
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,440
someone would surely say

1196
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,440
"There's a mirror on stage"

1197
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,160
"I can see myself"

1198
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,480
Right

1199
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,360
So the mirror's surface

1200
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,400
definitely wasn't facing this way

1201
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,520
There's a specific way to arrange it

1202
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,440
For example, like this

1203
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,760
It can simulate the opposite side, right?

1204
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,680
This wall here

1205
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,560
Exactly this wall

1206
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:05,920
No

1207
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,880
This is

1208
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,720
The numbers aren't consecutive

1209
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,800
Here it's 9-8-7

1210
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,720
Yes, 6-5-4

1211
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,880
Then place it over here

1212
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,360
No

1213
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,960
The reflection still shows the same thing

1214
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,440
The numbers on this side

1215
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,920
can be completely folded in half

1216
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,160
If we place the mirror

1217
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,640
on this side

1218
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,640
then when flipped over

1219
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,760
that position shows four, five, six

1220
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,320
which is correct

1221
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,840
like a cross shape

1222
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:35,840
it must

1223
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,240
be positioned at the number five

1224
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,400
right in the middle of five

1225
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,080
then the "body" can be placed here

1226
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,360
Yes, that's right.

1227
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,000
Restore the stage.

1228
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,160
Restore it and take a look.

1229
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,760
It folds perfectly, doesn't it?

1230
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,800
This vertical strip can cover...

1231
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,880
all those marks...

1232
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,600
and block the center crease.

1233
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,320
This line...

1234
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,720
perfectly covers the mirror's edge...

1235
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,560
and conceals it.

1236
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,160
Yes.

1237
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,360
You basically can't see inside.

1238
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,560
Impressive!

1239
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,120
We wouldn't have noticed...

1240
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,640
these details earlier.

1241
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,120
Okay, lower it down.

1242
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:26,720
Turn on the lights first.

1243
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,080
Lights.

1244
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,360
Should we say that we...

1245
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,120
...are all here now?

1246
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,200
Everyone's here.

1247
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,760
Here's the thing.

1248
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,280
We're in her room.

1249
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,040
We followed the clues and got in.

1250
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,040
605, right?

1251
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:37,560
Turn left.

1252
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,320
605.

1253
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,760
Should we knock?

1254
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,400
How do we get in?

1255
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:44,840
Let's go.

1256
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,400
Look, all those photos were taken right here.

1257
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,800
Yeah, she makes stuff right here.

1258
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,240
Come on, let's start searching.

1259
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,440
Her home has many anti-harassment items.

1260
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,680
There's pepper spray here.

1261
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,000
And a personal alarm.

1262
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,760
Pepper spray.

1263
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,720
So it's possible she's often being stalked.

1264
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,520
Frequently followed.

1265
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,920
And in your room,

1266
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,400
we found a pair of very baggy pants.

1267
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,080
All the clothes here are

1268
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:22,760
men's clothing.

1269
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,200
Right.

1270
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,920
I found a key.

1271
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,680
No, you're mistaken.

1272
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,560
This isn't a key.

1273
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,240
What is this then?

1274
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,680
It's that kind of

1275
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,360
similar to

1276
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,960
a bottle opener, screwdriver,

1277
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,480
a multi-purpose tool.

1278
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,160
Not a key.

1279
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,440
And under your pillow,

1280
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,920
we found a knife.

1281
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,280
Look, under Song Piaoliang's bed,

1282
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:44,920
What?

1283
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,880
A knife.

1284
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,760
Why do you keep self-defense items at home?

1285
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,040
Who are you protecting yourself from?

1286
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,720
Think about it, I live alone,

1287
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,240
with just one other man around.

1288
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,640
Protecting yourself from your boyfriend?

1289
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:56,960
Yes.

1290
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,280
Additionally, we discovered

1291
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,400
in her computer

1292
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,120
there was a consultation

1293
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,000
Yes, a consultation

1294
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,360
Doesn't her boyfriend have that illness?

1295
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:06,800
Right

1296
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,640
She's also ill

1297
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,440
She's also seeing a psychiatrist

1298
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,480
Her primary doctor

1299
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,600
specializes in schizophrenia and delusions

1300
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,360
Dr. Xin

1301
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,400
As you requested

1302
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,200
I've drawn the problems I'm facing

1303
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,680
Same as what I told you last time

1304
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,360
Get proper rest and keep observing

1305
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,400
Let's see what happens in these two months

1306
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:19,920
June

1307
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,160
I believe I love him

1308
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,600
Though I can't feel that love right now

1309
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,240
Let's give each other more time

1310
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,920
Having a boyfriend who plays video games

1311
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,000
Playing games together

1312
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,360
I really love him

1313
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,280
July

1314
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,720
Maybe if we do couple's crafts together

1315
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,280
I'll be able to love him more

1316
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,760
Making couple's crafts together

1317
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,840
We're truly the most perfect match

1318
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,880
Schizophrenia

1319
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,200
And then immediately after

1320
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,400
What Sister Budao is holding

1321
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:41,720
Look

1322
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,800
Look at this drawing

1323
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,280
This is a puppet

1324
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:46,960
This is a person

1325
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,480
This is a...

1326
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,280
Look, holding a knife to stab his chest

1327
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:49,880
Stab his heart

1328
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,640
But there are two men

1329
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,840
Could these two be the same person?

1330
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,720
Could be split personalities

1331
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,840
What kind of medicine is this?

1332
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,480
Let's see what it says.

1333
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,480
Vitamin capsules.

1334
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,640
Take one daily.

1335
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,080
For our health and happiness.

1336
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,440
The capsules contain blue powder.

1337
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:17,920
I don't believe it.

1338
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,160
It says the capsules contain blue powder.

1339
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,120
But here it's yellow.

1340
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:23,840
Which means...

1341
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,120
Someone switched the medicine, right?

1342
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,920
Right, this isn't legitimate medicine.

1343
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:27,840
Yes.

1344
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:28,960
Is this medicine for you...

1345
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,920
or your boyfriend?

1346
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,400
This is my medicine.

1347
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,080
Your medicine?

1348
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,600
Do you know what it's for?

1349
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,360
It says vitamins here.

1350
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,800
I thought I was taking this medicine.

1351
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,080
I never imagined your boyfriend...

1352
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,840
switched it with that "Lucid" drug.

1353
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,320
Really?

1354
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,280
What's this picture?

1355
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,720
"Lucid" drug.

1356
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,680
How to prevent people from forming...

1357
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,680
unwanted memories.

1358
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,320
We recommend our new drug...

1359
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,800
"Lucid" drug.

1360
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,080
Prevents formation of unwanted memories.

1361
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,800
Contains yellow powder.

1362
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,360
This is it, right?

1363
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,080
The medicine in this photo...

1364
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,880
Was it prescribed by her doctor?

1365
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,280
Wait...

1366
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,840
That doctor didn't prescribe this medicine.

1367
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,240
The doctor just said to get proper rest...

1368
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,360
and take it easy.

1369
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,600
Whose phone was this photo taken from?

1370
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,400
This phone might be...

1371
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,680
her boyfriend's phone from earlier.

1372
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:27,600
And then?

1373
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,880
After her boyfriend gave her this medicine...

1374
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,080
he told her it was vitamins.

1375
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,560
That's why she keeps having...

1376
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,640
these unwanted memories.

1377
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,840
Right.

1378
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,880
Because it can erase certain...

1379
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,400
memories you shouldn't have.

1380
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,040
Exactly.

1381
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,440
Let me start from the beginning.

1382
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,880
Actually, I started a relationship this year.

1383
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,280
Because I have life goals.

1384
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,920
I must get married and have children.

1385
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,680
before I turn thirty.

1386
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,440
So I met someone online.

1387
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,280
We've been dating since January this year.

1388
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:00,880
And I really thought...

1389
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,960
we were particularly compatible.

1390
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,360
Then I found out he lives here.

1391
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:04,800
Lives here.

1392
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,480
So I thought...

1393
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,280
I should just come over.

1394
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,160
So you moved here...

1395
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,080
because your boyfriend lives here?

1396
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,400
Love.

1397
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,080
Turning online friends into reality, right?

1398
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,120
It's called "meeting up," not "monetizing."

1399
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,440
What, are you going to sell him or something?

1400
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,800
Yeah, anyway, I moved here.

1401
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,520
Then on May 6th, something happened.

1402
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,880
So I didn't meet him.

1403
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,000
I met him the next day.

1404
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,880
But anyway...

1405
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,920
After spending some time together,

1406
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,240
I felt he was different...

1407
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:30,920
from the person I knew online.

1408
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,120
A bit different.

1409
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:37,960
Well played.

1410
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,120
What's wrong?

1411
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,880
Why are you unhappy?

1412
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,640
Nothing.

1413
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,160
Have a seat.

1414
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,640
This is how I've been with him...

1415
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,560
Why am I unhappy?

1416
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,320
Then I started...

1417
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,800
having these hallucinations.

1418
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,120
I always feel like...

1419
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,040
I'm dating...

1420
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,920
a man whose face I can't see.

1421
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,160
I'm dating this man.

1422
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,200
But when I do things with him,

1423
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,360
I feel extremely happy.

1424
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,360
We just click.

1425
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,800
I'm happy with the faceless man,

1426
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,760
truly happy.

1427
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,960
But with my real boyfriend, I'm unhappy.

1428
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,880
This boyfriend I met in real life...

1429
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,320
When I'm with him,

1430
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,200
I just can't handle it.

1431
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,440
I felt something was wrong,

1432
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,240
So first I went...

1433
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,720
to see my psychologist.

1434
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,000
But the doctor said nothing's wrong.

1435
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,200
Then recently I felt...

1436
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,440
I could clearly see...

1437
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,480
this man's face.

1438
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,360
The masked one?

1439
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,600
The blurry figure?

1440
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,960
I can see his appearance now.

1441
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,440
Why are you hiding?

1442
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,720
Trying to run away?

1443
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,000
Let's calm down a bit.

1444
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,760
No.

1445
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,800
My brother tried this trick before.

1446
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,480
Cool left.

1447
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,080
Look at this, how harmful it is

1448
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,120
Then I clearly saw his face

1449
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,160
And I also knew

1450
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,840
It wasn't my current boyfriend

1451
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,400
But there was one clue

1452
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,320
The person who's with me now

1453
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,400
is called Lai Wan'ou

1454
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,560
But the person I remember

1455
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,040
His name was Zhang Wan'ou

1456
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:12,640
Two people

1457
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,640
It's the two of them

1458
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,960
Because I previously talked with this man

1459
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,760
when we were chatting

1460
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,800
we also talked about dolls and such things

1461
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,040
But now this doll

1462
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,120
seems to be...

1463
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,640
When I asked him about these dolls

1464
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,840
he knew nothing about them

1465
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,120
Then I went through my current boyfriend's things

1466
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,560
and found he was searching online

1467
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,200
about how to make someone

1468
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,480
forget memories they shouldn't have

1469
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,960
Basically, to make you forget this person

1470
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,360
Yes, he kept replacing my medicine

1471
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,200
with this

1472
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,640
Change to this one

1473
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,200
He's such a big guy

1474
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,920
So strong and muscular

1475
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,000
I wouldn't dare mess with him

1476
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,720
So I went through his stuff

1477
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,680
Then I realized he might have...

1478
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,160
Well...

1479
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,400
It seems like he might have "killed" my real boyfriend

1480
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,120
(implied in previous line)

1481
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:13,920
It's that guy you met online

1482
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,040
the boyfriend you've been chatting with

1483
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,800
So this drawing here

1484
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,920
is what you imagined, right?

1485
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,760
Yes

1486
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,640
Because later I

1487
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,280
went through his stuff again

1488
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,120
and I found a photo

1489
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:22,840
He was in it

1490
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,880
This exact thing

1491
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,080
What do you mean "he was in this thing"?

1492
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:27,640
What the hell?

1493
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,400
This exact thing

1494
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,080
It's from his notebook

1495
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,840
He wrote "Case Closed" on it

1496
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,280
Got it, Brother Bai?

1497
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:43,800
I think

1498
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,440
This is the one she didn’t like

1499
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,280
The one she liked

1500
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,360
wasn’t he "taken care of"?

1501
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,640
Which means

1502
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,800
he "killed" the one she liked

1503
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,080
and then he "died" afterward

1504
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,520
So it’s very likely she "killed" him

1505
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,720
Look

1506
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,680
This... this is him

1507
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,080
This is from his notebook

1508
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,040
Right

1509
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,360
How about spraying this?

1510
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,520
How about spraying this?

1511
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,160
This is

1512
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,280
What's inside the bag?

1513
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:14,680
Spray

1514
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:15,920
Can we spray this?

1515
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,440
Spray a little

1516
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,520
Spray a bit more

1517
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,840
There's writing

1518
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,880
A string of numbers

1519
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,160
3505

1520
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,520
Make a call

1521
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,040
Hello

1522
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,920
Hello

1523
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,920
Who is this?

1524
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,720
I'm Lai Wan'ou

1525
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,840
Why are you calling me again?

1526
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,840
I've already taken the money and done the job

1527
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,760
I've already taken the money and done the job

1528
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,440
So the matter is already settled

1529
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:50,840
Right?

1530
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,240
Your voice doesn't sound like you

1531
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,800
Who exactly are you people?

1532
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,880
I'm Lai Wanou's relative

1533
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,920
Something happened to him

1534
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,160
And I wanted to ask

1535
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,120
What's your relationship with him?

1536
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,640
I'm Zhang Wanou

1537
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,800
And Lai Wanou is my boss

1538
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,440
Half a year ago

1539
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,560
I had an online relationship with a girl named Song Piaoliang

1540
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,120
We were in an online romance

1541
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,520
How dare you still talk to me?

1542
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,880
Why did you have an online relationship with me?

1543
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,640
After six months

1544
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,000
Someone else showed up instead

1545
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,840
I was originally coming to meet you in person

1546
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,000
But then Lai Wanou

1547
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,520
Suddenly gave me a large sum of money

1548
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,840
Told me to leave you

1549
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,960
So I took the money

1550
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,440
Gave him the chat account

1551
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,880
And then I left

1552
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,320
You gave him the chat account?

1553
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,320
How much did he pay you?

1554
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,880
You shouldn't have treated me like this

1555
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:37,840
Ask him for the account password

1556
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,120
What's your account password?

1557
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,720
Are you trying to withdraw money?

1558
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,440
No

1559
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,760
The password for that account

1560
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,600
you gave him - what is it?

1561
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,720
I don't really remember

1562
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,960
What password I set before

1563
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,200
There's one more thing

1564
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,320
You said "take money, do the job"

1565
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,800
Meaning you took Lai Wanou's money

1566
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,120
And then

1567
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,360
Left Song Piaoliang

1568
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:56,760
That was the job

1569
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,640
Still don't understand?

1570
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,680
Yes, what I did

1571
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,720
Was leave Song Piaoliang

1572
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,400
How much did he pay you?

1573
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:04,880
Let me hear it.

1574
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,040
Let me ask how much Song Piaoliang is worth.

1575
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,080
How much is she worth?

1576
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:07,760
None of your business.

1577
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,560
Alright, do you have anything to say to us?

1578
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,680
Song Piaoliang is with us right now.

1579
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,200
What are you trying to do?

1580
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,080
We haven’t met yet.

1581
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,560
Nothing to say.

1582
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,400
You had an online relationship before.

1583
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:19,800
You told people about that.

1584
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,960
Yes, you talked to me for half a year.

1585
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,000
I’m busy. Goodbye.

1586
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,520
You—

1587
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:24,960
Wait a minute.

1588
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,360
He hung up.

1589
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,040
Then you lied

1590
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,200
What?

1591
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,040
He's never met you

1592
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,720
Then how do you know what he looks like?

1593
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,400
Right

1594
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,000
But I've always had that hallucination

1595
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,080
I've seen him

1596
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,400
Just like you saw me earlier

1597
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,640
The one who came here

1598
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:53,840
You need to sing

1599
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,560
Come on

1600
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,960
Are you crazy?

1601
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,200
You're all crazy!

1602
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,280
I have that record of forced entry

1603
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,680
Because previously

1604
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:09,360
I have memories

1605
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,600
I came here with him before

1606
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,720
I came with Zhang Doll

1607
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,360
But

1608
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,720
What are you doing?

1609
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,440
What's going on?

1610
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:17,920
It's nothing

1611
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,520
Nothing's wrong

1612
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,640
I just came here with him before

1613
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,360
But

1614
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,480
What do you mean?

1615
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,560
Go on, continue

1616
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,080
I came with him before

1617
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,480
Come on

1618
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,360
Don't mind them

1619
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,200
Come on, keep talking

1620
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:32,880
Really, it's nothing

1621
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,720
I remember

1622
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,000
I came here with him before

1623
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,440
But that day when I came

1624
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,400
to investigate this matter

1625
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,560
I was stopped outside

1626
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,760
They wouldn't let me in

1627
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,720
Because isn't this place

1628
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,120
members-only?

1629
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,520
They said I wasn't a member

1630
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,440
So I couldn't enter

1631
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,960
Then the second time I asked them to check

1632
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,440
if there were any records

1633
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,720
They said there were none

1634
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,280
Then I asked them

1635
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,800
if there was someone named Zhang Doll

1636
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,720
who worked here

1637
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,640
They also said no

1638
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,480
So I have records of coming here twice

1639
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,200
That's her paranoia

1640
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,640
Delusions, not necessarily

1641
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,720
I'm not delusional

1642
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,200
She must have had this memory

1643
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,200
After taking that medicine

1644
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,360
It was deliberately erased

1645
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,560
But the staff didn't lose their memories

1646
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,000
Right

1647
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,560
She has no membership records

1648
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,560
But this place

1649
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,680
is where people come for dolls

1650
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,120
Right, because the owner of this place is

1651
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:19,640
Lai Wan'ou (proper noun)

1652
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,760
Lai Wan'ou's place

1653
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,160
Correct

1654
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,000
Where did you just use that card to enter?

1655
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,480
Haven't used it yet.

1656
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,360
That card just now—the one I gave you—where is it?

1657
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,520
Just saw another door at the end of the hallway.

1658
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,240
Can this card open the door?

1659
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,480
Let's go check out that room.

1660
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,000
That card...

1661
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,520
It's open.

1662
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,240
Come on.

1663
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,200
Look, it's so dark here

1664
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,200
I'm a little scared

1665
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:58,840
What's there to fear?

1666
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,400
I'm not scared either

1667
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,200
Nothing to be afraid of

1668
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:00,800
Exactly, no problem

1669
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,640
Then you walk in front

1670
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,040
It's not a "haunted house"

1671
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:03,680
This isn't a "haunted house"

1672
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,000
You don't understand the show

1673
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,080
You don't know much about the show

1674
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,200
What's this?

1675
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,480
It's moving

1676
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,280
Is this a real doll?

1677
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:15,920
No

1678
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,920
This is the soft kind

1679
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,240
The ones I made before were lifelike

1680
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,000
Flexible, skin-like dolls that can move

1681
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,360
There are many

1682
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:28,840
This one is

1683
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,960
The one at every crime scene

1684
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,680
Disobey and you'll "die"

1685
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,040
Disobey and you'll "die"

1686
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,240
What's this?

1687
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,160
This has our dolls on it

1688
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:50,760
This is me

1689
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,640
Yes, I've been wandering since age six

1690
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,480
Freely and unrestrained

1691
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,400
Living alone for twelve years

1692
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,080
I made you this way

1693
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,280
So your mother couldn't find you

1694
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,280
Even if you avoid heartless "scumbags"

1695
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,600
And distance from negative friends

1696
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,880
You still can't find satisfying love

1697
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:07,800
Became a girl group member

1698
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,400
But

1699
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,160
Couldn't produce

1700
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,200
Satisfying works

1701
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,840
It seems everyone has their own puppet

1702
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,160
Because

1703
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,000
Ours all have our puppets inside

1704
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,160
You're empty boxes

1705
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,000
Right, you two aren't puppets

1706
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,680
Let's play hide-and-seek together

1707
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,160
What do you mean?

1708
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,400
Hide quickly!

1709
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:26,920
Hide!

1710
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,800
Where should I hide?

1711
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,720
Please tear off the price tag from the doll nearest to you

1712
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,520
Stick it on your forehead

1713
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,600
Until you leave the doll museum

1714
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,960
To prevent the dolls from taking you away as an outsider

1715
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,160
The nearest doll's price tag

1716
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:39,920
Bai Sanwan's is here

1717
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,440
Ke Wuku

1718
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:40,760
Hurry!

1719
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,200
Guo Baoyou

1720
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:41,680
Take this

1721
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,320
Liu Xialai

1722
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,440
Guo Baoyou

1723
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:44,800
Here

1724
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,440
Song Piaoliang

1725
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:45,960
Here

1726
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:46,880
Zhao Budao, hurry!

1727
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,000
Let's play hide-and-seek together

1728
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,320
Hide quickly!

1729
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,360
No

1730
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,920
Are we supposed to go inside?

1731
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,680
Ten

1732
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,680
Nine

1733
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,280
Eight

1734
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:01,600
Seven

1735
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,000
Quick!

1736
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,600
Hide inside!

1737
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,120
Go up!

1738
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:04,880
Five

1739
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:06,240
Four

1740
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:07,520
Three

1741
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:08,800
Two

1742
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,000
One

1743
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,520
Are you all hidden?

1744
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,080
I'm coming!

1745
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,400
I'm locked inside!

1746
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,480
This door is locked

1747
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,360
Stick it on the back

1748
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,040
No

1749
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,320
No

1750
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,520
I want to go out

1751
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,160
I want to go out

1752
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:04,920
Can we go now?

1753
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:06,680
It's open.

1754
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:12,560
Liu

1755
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:12,960
Bai

1756
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,840
They're both down there

1757
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:15,920
Liu

1758
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:16,960
They came out

1759
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,400
Bro

1760
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,200
Damn, both of them are gone

1761
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:21,920
Someone got taken

1762
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:23,640
Are you guys there?

1763
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,000
Brother Bai

1764
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,000
Old Liu

1765
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,480
Come on, let's play a game

1766
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,040
Come

1767
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,720
Play games

1768
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,640
It's over—they're both gone.

1769
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,680
Brother Bai

1770
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,680
Old Liu

1771
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,320
Bro

1772
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,360
Someone was taken away.

1773
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,520
Did they really vanish?

1774
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,920
Where did you guys go just now?

1775
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,240
Where were you earlier?

1776
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,720
Be wary

1777
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,200
of companions who've been separated from you.

1778
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,200
Have you discovered

1779
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,160
the secret of the Dollhouse?

1780
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,560
You're just like me—

1781
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,440
all dolls.

1782
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,600
Soulless dolls.

1783
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,840
The Dollmaker is "dead."

1784
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,160
He "deserved" to die.

1785
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,440
Do you want to "kill"

1786
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,040
the incoming dolls?

1787
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,040
I do.

1788
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,000
Truth is, we're all the same—

1789
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,280
possibly being controlled.

1790
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,880
Your "murder" motive is strong.

1791
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,440
Song Piaoliang isn't the only one who trespassed illegally.

1792
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,400
He couldn’t have "killed" them.

1793
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,440
Back to the starting point again.

1794
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,160
Where is spring?

1795
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,320
Where can spring be found?

1796
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,680
