1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,960
Everyone, please come to Zhou Keke's laboratory.

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,920
The chocolate you're eating

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,400
was developed using this.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,200
Have one.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,240
Why don't you try this one?

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,320
Nephew, this blue one...

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,520
I think I should give it to you.

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,680
Mine looks like that...

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,200
No, do you have any paper at home, Keke?

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,680
There's a book.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,880
Both brothers want to buy it.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,080
The younger brother is one cent short.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,240
Pfft, next question.

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,200
Who is rice's mother?

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,800
It's me.

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,880
I know this one.

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,120
This is that QQ level.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,360
Xiao He, why are you taller today?

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,240
Really?

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,520
You're wearing lifts today, aren't you?

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Is it that for every person who "dies,"

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,800
you grow one centimeter?

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,160
So you're actually the "murderer."

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,840
Yes, I was only 1.6 meters before.

25
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,440
What's wrong with being 1.6 meters?

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,200
Let's talk outside.

27
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,680
Hello.

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,400
Each of you has your own tasks

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,760
He has more tasks

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,840
Because this is sufficient here

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,360
Someone like her whose mind isn't sharp enough here

32
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,520
Usually won't get assigned tasks

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,360
Hello

34
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,120
Hi

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,840
Everyone at 5 AM

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,200
Came to my room to wait for sunrise

37
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,400
So happy

38
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,320
So angry

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,760
Did you wake everyone up?

40
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,520
It was you guys

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,120
Who insisted on waiting for sunrise in my room

42
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,480
You at 5 AM

43
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,440
Trying to "kill" people?

44
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,120
Wearing a suit at 5 AM

45
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,000
Isn't appropriate either

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,680
Wait, I have a reasonable explanation

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,520
This outfit of mine

48
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,200
Explain it

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,520
You speak, you go first

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,920
I was just going to say that

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,160
I attended a "noble" cocktail party

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,800
Why didn't you invite us?

53
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,480
That means we

54
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,040
Aren't "noble" enough

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,039
In your eyes, we're not "nobility"

56
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,680
No

57
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,240
I was attending for someone else

58
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
For whom?

59
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
For the real "nobility"

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
Attended the "noble" cocktail party

61
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,120
Who's the real "nobility"?

62
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,240
The job I took

63
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,360
Was just being an extra

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,480
Yes, an extra

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,920
Liu Xialai left us many games

66
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,040
Should we play his games?

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,280
Where is Liu Xialai?

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,040
I don't know

69
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,280
He just said he left games for us

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,200
For us to play by ourselves

71
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,360
May I ask what this is?

72
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,800
Take a guess

73
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,680
Unscrupulous

74
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,560
That clever?

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,200
Indeed

76
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,000
Alright

77
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,920
Then guess again, what about this one?

78
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,160
Four X's

79
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,840
Eight crosses

80
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,400
Sprawled out

81
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,080
Sprawled out

82
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,640
This feeling

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,600
Yes

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,880
Impressive

85
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,320
You've got something

86
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,200
You guys really have this game figured out, I think

87
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
You're holding it upside down

88
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,440
And I still guessed right, didn't I?

89
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,840
Yes, I held it upside down and you still guessed right

90
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,120
No one really gave me the answers

91
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,960
There's a book

92
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,280
Two brothers both want to buy it

93
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,520
The older brother is short by five yuan

94
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,400
The younger brother is only short by one cent

95
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,880
But when they pool their money to buy one book

96
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,040
They still don't have enough

97
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,120
Do you know the price of this book?

98
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,560
And how much money does each have?

99
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
Why did we suddenly get a math problem?

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,680
Why did it switch to Olympiad math?

101
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,360
Older brother is short five yuan

102
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,600
Younger brother is short one cent

103
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,760
Pfft, next question

104
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,480
Pfft

105
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,120
This five yuan

106
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,640
See, five is an Arabic numeral

107
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,840
One, see - one cent

108
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,040
I think maybe we should change the question

109
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,080
Pfft

110
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,640
Skip the song

111
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,480
Skip the song

112
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,640
Who is rice's mother?

113
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,560
Who is rice's mother?

114
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,000
Rice

115
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,120
It's me

116
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,440
Rice's mother

117
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:00,880
Rice

118
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,280
Meow

119
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,080
Mom

120
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,840
Rice

121
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,920
Rice

122
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Don't you even know something this simple?

123
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,080
The logic of Apartment 11 is

124
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,960
Rice's mom

125
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
What's our dad's name?

126
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,640
Dad Liu

127
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,440
And mom?

128
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,880
Mom Liu

129
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,920
Our family all have A-B-B pattern names

130
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,519
My mom is called Mom Zhou

131
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,320
Right, and aunt is called Auntie Zhou

132
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,640
Probably "hua"... like "huashengmi" (peanuts)

133
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,880
Peanuts

134
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,280
Indeed

135
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,760
Indeed, so boring

136
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,040
True

137
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Why did he prepare so much?

138
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,640
Let him do it himself, call him

139
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,680
Where did Liu Xialai go?

140
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,160
Don't know

141
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
Went to push the wheelchair

142
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,640
Liu Xialai has big problems today

143
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,360
Three point five

144
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,280
Three point five

145
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,080
Its background is that distorted space

146
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,320
Three

147
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Five

148
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,080
It might just be background

149
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,920
Others are like this too

150
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,640
Is that so?

151
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,240
No

152
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,680
What are we supposed to guess from this "three point five"?

153
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,280
What's this guessing about?

154
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,960
Let me see, I'll give you an idiom

155
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,760
quickly and efficiently

156
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,560
You didn't even wait for me

157
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,680
I'm going to the restroom

158
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,440
And you're just like this

159
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:26,720
Seriously

160
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,360
Please have a seat

161
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,600
Let's finish guessing first

162
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,200
What does this mean?

163
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,640
This is the question you came up with

164
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,600
Yes

165
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,440
Then what does it mean?

166
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,400
What's the meaning of this?

167
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,280
Let me tell you

168
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,680
This is very mysterious

169
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,640
Too mysterious

170
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,840
A magical meaning

171
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,800
It seems at 5 AM

172
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,040
Everyone's indeed having trouble figuring it out

173
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,280
Neither fish nor fowl (idiom meaning dubious or shady)

174
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
Liu Xialai, where did you get so many

175
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,400
of these games?

176
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,760
Shouldn't you explain to everyone

177
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,880
Because I recently discovered that our

178
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
city has a particularly magical

179
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,400
place

180
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,880
called Yuanyu Island

181
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,440
You know what?

182
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,880
We don't know

183
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,200
Not sure if it is

184
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,080
Let me tell you

185
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,160
Up there is a

186
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,480
particularly wonderful place

187
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,360
with beautiful scenery and many

188
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,880
strange people

189
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,760
Right.

190
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,640
Not bad.

191
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,160
More than in our Apartment 11?

192
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Strange people.

193
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,240
Actually no.

194
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,000
The games they have there.

195
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Have lots of these puzzle games.

196
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,320
So I brought some back.

197
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,040
For us to play.

198
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,360
They're from Roundfish Island.

199
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,720
But we have smart people here.

200
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,400
Who keep solving them.

201
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,680
Yes, actually I think regarding.

202
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,640
Problem-solving.

203
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,240
We're more skilled at it.

204
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,400
You're absolutely right.

205
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,240
Theirs are too simple to bother with.

206
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,160
Is that so?

207
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,720
Come on, try one as an example.

208
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,080
I know this one.

209
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,720
This is the QQ ranking system.

210
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,680
What's your QQ level?

211
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,120
Your QQ level is already very high.

212
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,880
Three suns and four moons.

213
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,440
What does that mean?

214
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,600
You can't solve the puzzles you brought.

215
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,800
Of course I know.

216
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,560
Then tell us.

217
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,000
The answer is.

218
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,760
On the back of this board.

219
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,680
Three is three days and four nights.

220
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
Close.

221
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,880
Three days and four nights.

222
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,920
They say we're close, no need to copy

223
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,280
Three days and three nights

224
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,920
Getting closer

225
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,160
Almost there

226
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,280
Three-day, four-night luxury tour

227
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,360
Numbers aren't at the start

228
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,200
Meals and accommodation included

229
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,400
Numbers don't come first

230
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,120
Blow hot and cold

231
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,920
See, I told you I've been there before

232
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,440
Right?

233
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,400
Indeed

234
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,160
Truly impressive

235
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
We're so weak

236
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,040
I just saw Ke Wuku today

237
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,120
Up so early and dressed so handsomely

238
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,280
See, I've already explained

239
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,080
The way you look

240
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,040
Isn't much more casual than him

241
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm very casual

242
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
He's still more casual, yes

243
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Is this outfit expensive today?

244
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Average

245
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,800
Average, today's outfit

246
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,600
Can it be pulled, right?

247
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,960
So it can be tugged, correct?

248
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,880
Try not to tug it

249
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,840
Try your best not to tug

250
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,680
That's too much

251
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,440
While we're waiting for sunrise

252
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,280
I also want to show everyone

253
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,120
Some new chocolate flavors I've developed

254
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,640
This is sugar

255
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,520
I just ate one

256
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,280
It's not chocolate

257
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,640
It is chocolate

258
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,200
No

259
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,960
If I say it is, then it is

260
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,400
Yes

261
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,120
I'm your uncle

262
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,400
You should listen to me, nephew

263
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,760
Nephew, is this chocolate or not?

264
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,640
Exactly

265
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,240
That's right

266
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,800
Eat

267
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,160
He's mentally manipulating you

268
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,360
It is chocolate

269
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,799
Have one

270
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,640
I just want to see you guys

271
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Whether what you eat is sweet

272
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,559
Or still sweet

273
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,120
We're still relatively normal for now

274
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,560
The one I just ate was a bit spicy

275
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,040
Spicy

276
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,440
Right

277
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,880
A little spicy

278
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,840
Is it my recipe

279
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
That's developed something new

280
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,360
This is very problematic

281
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,680
I want to see you eat this green one

282
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,440
So curious

283
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,520
You always want us to

284
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,040
This green one is spicy

285
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,440
Why don't you try this one?

286
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,120
No thanks, Keke

287
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,360
You insist on making me eat

288
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,160
Bitter

289
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,760
It's over

290
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,120
Kewu, is it bitter?

291
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,120
Let him eat it

292
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Nephew, this blue one

293
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,200
I think I should give it to you

294
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,600
See how much your uncle loves you

295
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,200
Can't see it

296
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,440
Really can't do it

297
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
I can't handle any stimulation right now

298
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,280
Have one

299
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,640
Okay

300
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,160
Eat one

301
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,680
Vegetable root flavor

302
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,080
Mine tastes like that

303
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,560
Burnt

304
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,160
No, do you have tissues at home, Keke?

305
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,480
What flavor is this?

306
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,200
You want us to eat but you won't?

307
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,920
Come on

308
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,240
Pick three for him to eat at the same time

309
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,440
I really want to see you eat a whole plate

310
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,080
I want to watch you

311
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,360
You choose one

312
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,760
Your mouth tastes so strange

313
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,160
Not my taste, probably his

314
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,600
I

315
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,880
You taste so weird

316
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,960
A grassy taste

317
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:09,960
Vegetable root flavor

318
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Is it

319
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,160
I was just eating grass

320
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,800
Grass flavor

321
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,680
This is it

322
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,160
Stinky

323
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,360
You smell bad

324
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,360
Brother Bai

325
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,760
Have one

326
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,800
I ate it, I don't want to eat

327
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,280
Goodbye

328
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,800
Bro, what did you eat

329
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,120
What's wrong

330
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,160
It's very smelly, right

331
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
Not me

332
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,880
Now my mouth tastes like fart

333
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,520
Not me

334
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,240
Not me

335
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,520
That's really terrifying

336
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,240
Not me

337
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,040
What I just ate was preserved plum

338
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,800
I didn't ask you that day

339
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,960
That thing in your room

340
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,440
What's that room for

341
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,080
Wait, I taste

342
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,520
This barbecue flavor

343
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,880
Such a strange taste

344
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,640
That thing in his room

345
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,160
Isn't that where he showers

346
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,120
How could that be

347
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,520
Everyone please come to Zhou Keke's laboratory

348
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,840
The chocolate you just ate

349
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,600
was developed using this

350
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:05,920
No,

351
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,440
it wasn't developed in the bathroom

352
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,360
This is

353
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,680
not a bathroom

354
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,480
Can we wait until sunrise?

355
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,200
What?

356
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,960
The sun rises after five.

357
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,600
Shouldn't it be light by then?

358
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,680
What

359
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,640
Again

360
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,920
It's just that someone fell down

361
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,280
I clearly saw that girl's face

362
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,560
Last time we took the elevator down

363
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,720
Then the "corpse" disappeared, right?

364
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,320
Right

365
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,600
No, it's right here

366
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,280
There's nothing here

367
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,880
Then let's go this time

368
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,040
Don't jump! What are you doing?

369
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,240
This is the seventh floor

370
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,640
Nephew, this is the seventh floor

371
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,440
Let's go, then let's check it out

372
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,240
The "corpse" is gone again when we go down

373
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,880
No, so we just keep watching like this?

374
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,440
Let's split up

375
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,080
We'll keep watch here, right?

376
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,920
Didn't you want to go down?

377
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,000
You go take a look downstairs

378
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,320
We'll keep watch, Lao Bai, you go down

379
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,720
Nephew, you go

380
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,680
Go

381
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,360
We'll keep watch for you

382
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,840
Who would dare move this?

383
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,960
We'll shout at them immediately

384
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,640
No need

385
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,920
Are you all just going to watch here?

386
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,320
We're afraid one person's voice

387
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,240
won't be enough to stop them

388
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,360
Take your sister and go

389
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,040
Why am I being sent away too?

390
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,040
I suggest we all go back and get some sleep

391
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,920
Must be an illusion

392
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Possibly

393
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,640
Lack of sleep

394
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,560
Definitely an illusion

395
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,280
In the apartment

396
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,080
Has it really come to this?

397
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,240
The pressure in this apartment is too much

398
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,600
Starting to mess with our minds

399
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,280
Stop talking, I'm already...

400
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,960
Let's go check the "corpse"

401
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,360
Let's go

402
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,240
That's scary

403
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,040
Go

404
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,600
5:00 AM

405
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,520
There's someone ahead always wearing a suit

406
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,920
That's pretty creepy too

407
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,640
Very strange

408
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,280
Go

409
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,600
Go

410
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,880
Xiao He

411
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,920
What's wrong?

412
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,120
Look

413
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,440
Gone again

414
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,480
Look, the "corpse" is gone again

415
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,800
Nothing there

416
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,240
Bro

417
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,080
Look, it says "full" up there

418
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,120
Full

419
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,040
Full capacity

420
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,320
How's that possible?

421
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,960
Why wouldn't it be?

422
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,160
Don't you trust our Teng Agency?

423
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,000
Don't people jump down here every day?

424
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,840
What?

425
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,080
Have you seen anyone fall down?

426
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,040
Yes, we saw someone jump again

427
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,080
But every time we come down, you're here

428
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,680
You're really strange

429
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
Yeah, you're way too suspicious

430
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,000
So it must be your fault

431
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,400
I really didn't...

432
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,880
Did I hide them or something?

433
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,600
Possibly

434
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,440
It's definitely you, reflect on yourself

435
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,080
I almost believe it myself now

436
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,800
Hey Xiao He, why are you taller today?

437
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,680
Really?

438
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,400
Did you wear lifts today?

439
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,040
I've been wearing lifts all along

440
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,800
It's you guys who all collectively shrunk

441
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,720
Growing backwards, shrinking instead

442
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,920
Is this world moving backwards in time?

443
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,880
Is this reaction acceptable?

444
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,680
Yes, it is.

445
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,200
We're all shrinking together.

446
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
The longer we stay here, the more we shrink.

447
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,400
Shrinking more and more, growing backwards.

448
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,600
Could this world be moving backwards in time?

449
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,880
He's really tall today.

450
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,680
Key focus points

451
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,680
Isn't it about where the "body" is?

452
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,040
Where did the "corpse" go

453
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,880
It's gone

454
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,600
It's gone

455
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,200
Since it's gone missing

456
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,040
Let's pretend it never happened. Let's go.

457
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,880
Let's just head back.

458
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,600
Yeah, we can play for a while.

459
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,200
Kick the shuttlecock.

460
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,560
Yeah, kick the shuttlecock or something.

461
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,280
It's not that Xiao He got taller

462
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,960
It's probably that your legs feel shorter

463
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,400
Alright, let's do some morning exercises too

464
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,840
It's becoming

465
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,720
increasingly urgent

466
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,680
You must investigate quickly

467
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,560
the truth behind that symbol

468
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,520
There's a moon

469
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,120
It's very important

470
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,360
It's on the second floor

471
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,800
You just put a TV in this building

472
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,880
Specifically to intimidate

473
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,520
the residents, right?

474
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,320
Isn't that so?

475
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,440
What building?

476
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,800
I got scared too

477
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,400
This is the place

478
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,240
If you're running away, take me with you

479
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Going to the second floor, right?

480
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,680
Yes

481
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,360
But the problem is

482
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,880
Besides the link symbol

483
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,960
There seems to be an extra

484
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,600
Moon

485
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
That moon one

486
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,600
I know, let's take a break

487
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,200
Kewuku is telling us to take a break

488
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,800
Kewuku is telling you to take a break

489
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,600
Take a break

490
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,880
No, because Kewuku isn't...

491
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,000
I need to take a break

492
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,920
We must rest like this

493
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,040
Right, he just needs to rest first

494
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,240
Time to take a break

495
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,000
Your stomachs are upset today too

496
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Stomach ache

497
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,520
Wait for me

498
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
So you really don't trust me?

499
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,600
Why are you talking about my brother?

500
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,160
Let's go.

501
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,640
Go.

502
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,680
The me who holds you tight

503
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,440
Is richer than a king

504
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,760
Doll Museum

505
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,640
We've come back to the Doll Museum.

506
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,680
Should we change clothes first?

507
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,120
Right.

508
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,000
What does it mean that the surveillance here was removed?

509
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,120
Yes.

510
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,320
This removal looks quite obvious.

511
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,760
I'm here.

512
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,240
Come.

513
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,319
Zhenguoli Reasoning Kit

514
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,680
The surveillance in your neighborhood was removed.

515
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,920
Did you notice?

516
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,680
Where was it removed?

517
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,520
Here.

518
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,400
What's going on?

519
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
I'll go back and ask about it.

520
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,520
The property management surveillance area.

521
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,480
Other things are fine,

522
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,760
just worried if you have money to install new ones.

523
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,640
We should, aren't you here for this?

524
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,440
You leave everything to the residents.

525
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,040
Don't you have any capability yourselves?

526
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,800
Xiao He, will you be able to find a job in the future?

527
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,400
That's why I don't dare to quit.

528
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,560
But was Xiao He this tall before?

529
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,400
You're still (thinking about)

530
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,240
Really?

531
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Is it that for every person who "dies"

532
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
you grow one centimeter taller?

533
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,600
So you're the real "killer"

534
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,240
Yes, I was only 1.6 meters before

535
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,400
You're doing this to grow taller

536
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,360
What's wrong with being 1.6 meters?

537
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,040
Let's talk outside

538
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,280
I think this method

539
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,400
You could copy it too

540
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,520
I don't need this method

541
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,840
Don't need it

542
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,640
He "kills" one person

543
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,520
and becomes 10cm shorter

544
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,760
Originally he was 1.9 meters

545
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,600
"Killed" three people

546
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,080
Then we saw someone jump off a building

547
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,280
And then we came here again

548
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,440
to look for clues

549
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,160
Brother Bai starts explaining again

550
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,080
First, when we arrived we found

551
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,240
the surveillance cameras here were removed

552
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,760
Look

553
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,480
The cameras are gone

554
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,400
Very strange candles

555
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,600
One isn't lit

556
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,320
No idea what they're for

557
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,920
The mechanism must be here

558
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,160
There must be some mechanism

559
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,600
Alright, with your intelligence

560
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,200
where do you think it is?

561
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,880
With my intelligence, I...

562
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,320
Alright

563
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,240
This episode, all of us

564
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,240
got stuck at the first level

565
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,200
Okay, this episode ends here

566
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,080
What are they doing now?

567
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,320
They'll be coming over soon.

568
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
We don't need to worry about them.

569
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,720
I can keep this, right?

570
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,480
You can keep this.

571
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:54,920
Awesome!

572
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,880
But you can't call anyone.

573
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,520
I'm Xiao He.

574
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,800
I'll chat with Xiao He.

575
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,480
He might not respond.

576
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,320
Xiao He doesn't have a walkie-talkie.

577
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,640
Xiao He has a walkie-talkie.

578
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,160
But

579
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,760
Only for important messages

580
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,800
will we call him.

581
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,680
And I can always use the walkie-talkie

582
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,040
because I'm security.

583
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,000
So am I the security team leader?

584
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,440
You could be.

585
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,200
Sure.

586
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
We can do that.

587
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,480
Anyway, I'm the only one monitoring.

588
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,320
Okay.

589
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
I'm the leader.

590
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,200
Leader and member.

591
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,440
Hello

592
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,240
You must be

593
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,000
the security chief

594
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,160
Xiao Wen, right?

595
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,440
Xiao Wen

596
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,120
Captain of the security team

597
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,560
Hello

598
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,480
Hello

599
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,920
Come quick, come and see!

600
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,800
You're absolutely a "psycho"

601
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,240
Coco

602
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,280
You're definitely "sick"

603
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,840
What's that on you?

604
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,040
You really have one on you

605
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,680
I've always had this "no-no" thing

606
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,080
No, not this

607
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
Then this is fake

608
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,000
It's just stuck-on chocolate

609
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,200
What are you doing?

610
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,000
This is so cute

611
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,840
It smells so good

612
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,720
The two of us

613
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,320
But it really smells delicious

614
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,760
Really

615
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,280
Right?

616
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,920
You guys don't know any clues

617
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,600
Right?

618
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,400
We know

619
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,600
We're already close to the truth now

620
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Do you know something?

621
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,800
I don't know anything

622
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,000
That can't be

623
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,880
I'm just a security guard

624
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,640
Don't know anything

625
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,160
Just need to

626
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
Keep this place safe, that's all

627
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,320
You're a security guard

628
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,920
Keeping this place safe

629
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,880
Right

630
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,720
Keeping this place safe

631
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,760
Don't you really have any tasks today?

632
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,400
Why are you dressed like this?

633
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,200
I do

634
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,640
Going in one more time

635
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,040
That's the task

636
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,320
But you can't know yet

637
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,280
Each of you has a task

638
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,680
He has more tasks

639
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,760
Because there's enough here

640
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,280
Someone like her with not enough brains

641
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,560
Usually doesn't get tasks

642
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,240
You've been attacking me since last night

643
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm still your elder sister after all

644
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,200
Right

645
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,560
I'm an old sister

646
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,520
Old sister

647
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,440
What nonsense

648
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,560
Hello

649
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,240
Hello

650
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,280
You're the surveillance manager

651
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm a security guard

652
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,000
Right

653
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,120
Keeping this place safe

654
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,360
Maintaining security here

655
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,080
That's what they say

656
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,800
But there's no real safety here

657
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,800
Hello

658
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,560
Long time no see

659
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,400
Yes

660
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,240
Come

661
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,880
Take a walk

662
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,280
Just strolling around

663
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,720
So you're currently...

664
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,320
Someone "died" over there, right?

665
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:57,680
No

666
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,160
No

667
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,000
A few days ago

668
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,200
Someone previously "passed away"

669
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,600
So much for your security work

670
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,320
And you're supposed to protect the area

671
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
He just got here, didn't I say that?

672
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,400
I just started

673
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,400
Yes, he's new here

674
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,640
Old Bai, your shop...

675
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,360
This won't do either.

676
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,200
Your shop...

677
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,240
Opening next month? When exactly?

678
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,960
Open.

679
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,840
The reason I'm called Bai Sanwan is...

680
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,800
"Three bowls and you can't cross the ridge."

681
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,440
You sell alcohol?

682
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,200
After drinking, you'd be too full to walk.

683
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,240
Right.

684
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,760
Afraid it wouldn't be safe for you to cross the ridge.

685
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,440
Don't make everything so serious.

686
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,480
Since we've...

687
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,040
stayed up half the night...

688
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,880
Doesn't that mean the next day...

689
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,520
we can just go back to sleep?

690
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,080
And then we couldn't save Bamei, right?

691
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,200
Yes, we couldn't save her.

692
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,640
That's understandable then.

693
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,040
Because we were too tired.

694
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,640
Right.

695
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,000
No.

696
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,760
We have an obligation to try to save Bamei.

697
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,400
I think...

698
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
If those three try to save her...

699
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,400
I don't trust their abilities.

700
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
Our Apartment 101...

701
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,280
can't be missing even one person.

702
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,720
So you're all just waiting here for Bamui, right?

703
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,400
Yes

704
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,200
Let me predict something for you

705
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,360
Bamui will be passing by here soon

706
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,840
And then she'll jump off the building

707
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,760
Right, we'll just watch from here

708
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,640
Multi-camera live stream of her jumping

709
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,200
Yes

710
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,840
Yes, when she comes by

711
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,920
You'll go save her

712
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,600
Right

713
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,320
You'll catch her at the third-floor platform

714
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,000
Hello everyone

715
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,760
Hi everyone

716
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,520
You've worked hard

717
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,480
Brought you some midnight snacks

718
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Three bowls, he brought us three bowls

719
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,920
Yes

720
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,920
Here, Beautiful, take these to them

721
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,520
Here

722
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:45,960
Go ahead and eat

723
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,560
Thank you

724
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,200
What's this? Are they all the same?

725
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,480
Yes

726
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,400
Have you eaten yet?

727
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,000
We've already eaten

728
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,800
I

729
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,560
not hungry

730
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,800
Not hungry. You hungry?

731
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,520
I'm hungry

732
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,920
But I...

733
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,680
I'm on a diet

734
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,520
This portion is for...

735
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,400
I won't eat

736
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,240
Working hours

737
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,760
You won't eat? Afraid it's poisoned?

738
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,200
Actually...

739
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,800
It is poisoned

740
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,920
How about we share one bowl, Lao Liu?

741
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,040
Let's share one bowl

742
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,880
So frugal

743
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm afraid we can't finish it

744
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,360
Let's get one bowl to share

745
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:22,920
Don't waste it

746
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,560
Don't let it go to waste

747
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,280
I'll eat the egg

748
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,880
Eat

749
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,960
If you eat this egg

750
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,360
You must finish all three bowls

751
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,280
Or you'll "die" here today

752
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,720
You'll "die" here today

753
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,520
Have a seat

754
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,320
No

755
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Are you sure you won't sit?

756
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,080
No

757
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,840
You're not sure

758
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,240
Just sit down

759
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,840
I won't

760
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,800
Suit yourself then

761
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:51,920
Where's Ku?

762
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,280
What did he go do?

763
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,160
Don't know. Ku's...

764
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,440
Very suspicious

765
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,680
Ku went again

766
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,640
"Killing" people

767
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,320
His family's ancestral trade is "killing," right?

768
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,240
These brothers

769
