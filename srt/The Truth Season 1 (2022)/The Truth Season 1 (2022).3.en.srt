1
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,800
At noon on May 6th,

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,880
I received a message from my ex-girlfriend whom I hadn't seen in a long time,

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,640
from Jiajia.

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,320
I hurried to the Detective Theater on the eighth floor of the apartment to meet her.

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
After meeting her and getting ready to leave the theater,

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,840
I noticed the lights in the hallway had gone out.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,200
I slowly felt my way out in the dark.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,920
But in the pitch-black corridor,

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,800
I ran into some new neighbors.

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,560
They seemed to be heading in another direction.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,920
I was curious too,

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,160
so I slowly followed them.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,480
But I unexpectedly discovered

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,080
that Detective, who looked a lot like my girlfriend,

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
had been "assassinated."

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,520
It was only our first day living in this apartment,

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,160
and already two people had "died"?

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,560
To find out the truth,

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,280
we started investigating.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,560
We discovered inside the theater

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,720
there were four identical auditoriums.

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,680
Between the auditoriums,

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,960
they could be connected by one-way doors.

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,520
But one door was off-limits.

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,280
This door couldn't be used.

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,960
Why?

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,280
We also found

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,480
the theater staff room.

29
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,360
Using the information on the "True or False Love" poster,

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,480
the information provided there,

31
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,880
I used the premiere date to unlock the door's code.

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
Inside we found

33
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,000
Zhenzhen's dating schedule

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,680
and boyfriend ranking list

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,880
Also discovered Zhenzhen was using multiple identities

36
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,160
to secretly date different boyfriends

37
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,480
With this boyfriend she was Tongtong

38
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,600
This one was Maomao

39
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,040
And shockingly, I was on this list too

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,240
That's me!

41
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,520
Could the girl who "died" in the theater

42
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,680
named Zhenzhen

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
actually be my ex-girlfriend Jiajia?

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
We compared

45
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,000
the theater's audience counter records

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,360
with the photos

47
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,440
of boyfriends in the staff room

48
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,240
for cross-reference

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,680
We discovered Cao Yangguang

50
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,720
Screenwriter Song

51
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,600
as well as me and Bai Sanwan

52
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,440
were all likely at the theater

53
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,360
during the time of the incident

54
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,120
So the four of us became

55
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,600
suspects in this case

56
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,440
Later everyone came to my room

57
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,360
Unfortunately

58
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
my "escort 1000 girls home" project

59
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,600
was exposed to everyone

60
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,520
Though my intentions were good

61
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,560
they still misunderstood me

62
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,320
"You're not from security"

63
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,040
And then there's Jiajia

64
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,680
who exposed my immature

65
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,520
novel to the public

66
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
leading to me being cyberbullied

67
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,600
This was also discovered

68
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,240
After the cyberbullying

69
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,080
I drew an X on her photo

70
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,840
I admit I hated Jiajia

71
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,600
That's why I marked

72
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,400
her photo with an X

73
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Later we went to Bai Sanwan's room

74
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
to continue investigating

75
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
We learned that he and Zhenzhen

76
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,040
had briefly dated three years ago

77
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,560
Bai Sanwan, for Zhenzhen's sake

78
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,280
indirectly caused his brother's "death"

79
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,160
He rode this bike to deliver food

80
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,600
and then had an accident

81
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,440
Later, the two broke up.

82
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,200
Zhenzhen ranted online,

83
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,240
calling Bai Sanwan a "scumbag."

84
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,160
"Bai Sanwan, you scumbag!"

85
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,840
This year,

86
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,560
Bai Sanwan and Zhenzhen got back together.

87
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,320
It seemed they had reconciled,

88
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,560
but Bai Sanwan discovered

89
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,840
Zhenzhen wanted to expose him

90
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,400
for "causing the death" of a brother.

91
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,640
Bai Sanwan suspected Zhenzhen had been deceiving him

92
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,840
and wanted to ruin him.

93
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,120
He just wanted

94
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,520
to see her for who she really was,

95
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,400
what kind of person she truly was.

96
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,320
Later,

97
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,640
in the audience counter's

98
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,240
surveillance footage,

99
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,200
Zhenzhen was seen changing outfits

100
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,080
and entering different theater rooms.

101
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,320
But after entering Bai Sanwan's theater,

102
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,520
she never came out.

103
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,560
At that moment,

104
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,720
we spotted in the surveillance footage

105
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,440
a suspicious person

106
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,840
nervously running out of the theater.

107
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,080
A look at the face—

108
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,720
isn't that Teng Zhongjie?

109
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,800
Highly suspicious.

110
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,520
From then on,

111
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,800
the suspects in this case

112
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,480
became:

113
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,200
Cao Yangguang,

114
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,920
Screenwriter Song,

115
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,960
Bai Sanwan,

116
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,600
me,

117
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,000
and Teng Zhongjie.

118
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,040
This season will unfold over eleven weeks

119
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,080
telling the stories that occur in Apartment No. 11 of Tui City

120
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,920
Six players will move in as new residents

121
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,680
and live in Apartment No. 11

122
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
They will be drawn into bizarre cases

123
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,200
By forming the "Apartment Detective Team"

124
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,800
they'll visit different floors

125
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,600
befriend various long-term residents

126
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,560
solve their own identity mysteries

127
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,560
and uncover secrets behind the cases

128
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,480
The first six cases

129
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,160
will unlock one new resident's story each week

130
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,120
The complex relationships between new and old residents

131
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,600
will also come to light

132
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,000
Starting from the seventh case

133
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,400
all storylines will intertwine

134
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,520
As the truth is gradually revealed

135
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,400
every choice made by the new residents

136
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,880
will influence the story's direction

137
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,960
and the final outcome

138
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,320
In each case

139
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,160
the detective team must at the crime scene

140
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,920
identify the "victim"

141
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,840
and based on clues

142
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,480
pinpoint relevant suspects

143
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,200
Note:

144
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Suspects aren't limited to Apartment No. 11 residents

145
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,640
or visitors

146
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,320
Suspects might even exist within the detective team

147
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,760
After gathering suspects

148
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,520
the team will interrogate them

149
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,960
and re-examine based on testimonies

150
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,800
finally voting to identify the "culprit"

151
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,200
Only the actual "culprit" can lie

152
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,800
Only by finding the real "murderer"

153
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,000
do players win

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
Players who vote correctly

155
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,480
receive a golden key

156
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,880
If a player is the "murderer"

157
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,840
and escapes successfully

158
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
they'll receive a golden key

159
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,560
Movie viewing backend system

160
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,600
Okay, watch

161
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,680
Room 3

162
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,040
Who is this?

163
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,800
Someone wants to enter

164
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,720
Who is this?

165
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,400
Me

166
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,080
Teng Agency

167
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,520
Ran out

168
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,720
Panicked

169
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Scared, Teng the agent

170
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,320
What did you see inside?

171
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
What did you find?

172
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,080
And you clearly looked frightened

173
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,960
Baoyou, can you hear me?

174
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,040
This is Xiao He.

175
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,760
I can hear you.

176
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,120
How's your investigation going?

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,120
The suspects you wanted to question,

178
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,320
Cao Yangguang and Screenwriter Song,

179
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,200
I've already located them.

180
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,520
They'll be here shortly.

181
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,680
Since they all want to clear their names,

182
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,200
except for the "real culprit",

183
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,360
except for the "real culprit",

184
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,960
the others probably won't lie.

185
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,480
Moreover, they might have

186
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,760
evidence related to the case on them.

187
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,920
You can search them during questioning.

188
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,000
If there are suspects among you,

189
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,560
you can question each other too.

190
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,440
I've prepared the property's

191
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,240
monitoring room in the basement.

192
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,200
You can conduct

193
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,600
the interrogations there.

194
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,280
Additionally, I've set up a camera

195
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,880
so that

196
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,720
we can preserve video evidence

197
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,520
to hand over to the authorities.

198
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,040
Come to the property monitoring room quickly.

199
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,520
Please ask your questions

200
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,080
Excuse me,

201
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,560
First, why did you go to that room?

202
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,160
Going to that room...

203
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,320
When I was taking the elevator,

204
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,600
I saw Sanwan's figure

205
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,280
who seemed to have gone up

206
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,040
After that,

207
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,200
I wanted to go up and check

208
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,480
what Sanwan was doing there

209
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,880
About what time did you go up?

210
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,080
When I went up,

211
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,040
it should have been around 1:46

212
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,360
We had agreed to meet at 1

213
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,040
so I had already gone up at 1

214
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,960
I saw you at 1 o'clock

215
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,640
Then I did other things

216
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,840
After forty minutes,

217
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,480
you came up again

218
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,360
So I went up

219
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,200
After going up,

220
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,520
I opened the theater door

221
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,960
I turned left down the dark hallway

222
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,200
and felt my way forward

223
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,200
After about ten steps,

224
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,440
I felt something round

225
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
like a doorknob

226
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,000
After going up, you walked left about ten steps?

227
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,520
Yes

228
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,320
That was Room 1

229
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,920
But the video shows

230
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,880
he entered Room 3

231
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,360
But I didn't know which door number it was

232
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,600
Okay

233
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,080
After opening it, I went inside

234
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,640
After entering

235
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,560
I felt there were steps

236
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,400
So I walked down following them

237
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,960
Then I felt

238
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,120
I stepped on something sticky

239
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,200
Meaning those footprints on the ground

240
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,640
Were left by you

241
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,039
That's possible

242
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,039
But when I entered

243
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,600
I maintained my professional habits

244
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,000
I was wearing shoe covers when I entered

245
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,919
Indeed

246
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,440
So when I was leaving

247
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,400
Between the first and second doors

248
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,520
I carefully picked up the shoe covers

249
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,000
Rolled them up

250
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,040
Put them in a black bag

251
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,280
After pushing open the second door

252
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
I walked to the elevator

253
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,680
And threw them in the trash bin

254
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,360
Then I went down

255
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,120
After going down, I thought

256
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,880
About going to see so-and-so

257
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,360
To play with their dog for a while

258
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,600
While playing with the dog

259
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
I heard you screaming upstairs

260
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,960
That's roughly what happened

261
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,680
At around 1:40 something,

262
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,440
Zhenzhen "died."

263
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,440
There's one major issue:

264
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:17,960
Why is it that

265
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,280
the "blood" he found in Room 3,

266
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,200
but when we went there,

267
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,040
Room 3 had no "blood."

268
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,600
There was no "blood."

269
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
Only Room 1 had "blood."

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
You only went to this one room, right?

271
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,320
Right.

272
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,400
So,

273
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,240
so I think

274
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,000
there must be something wrong with the rooms.

275
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,320
Do you have any more questions?

276
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,200
If there's nothing else to ask,

277
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,240
should I just go sit back down?

278
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,920
Is there anything else you'd like to confess?

279
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,640
Anything you'd like to volunteer?

280
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,480
Then why didn't you tell us earlier?

281
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
You've been to that room.

282
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,200
I think

283
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,800
this doesn't seem that important.

284
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,360
After being in contact with her for so long,

285
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,600
did you notice any

286
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,160
significant changes in her personality?

287
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,720
Zhenzhen, I don't know her.

288
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,600
She's your tenant.

289
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,360
Yet you don't know her either.

290
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,280
No, I don't.

291
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,080
I rarely go upstairs.

292
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,640
Because usually

293
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,040
You see,

294
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,680
she's rented from me for three years.

295
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,440
All this time,

296
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,400
I've never once been to her place.

297
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
I can't appreciate

298
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,600
you young people's things.

299
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,760
If no one has

300
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,480
any more questions for me,

301
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,840
I'll go sit back down.

302
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,120
You can search me.

303
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,160
Body search.

304
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,640
Search Teng the agent.

305
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,840
Whatever.

306
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,640
Go ahead.

307
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,240
Got anything?

308
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,760
Just got these today.

309
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,520
Freshly collected.

310
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,840
Just some lousy membership cards.

311
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,280
Really.

312
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,360
Carrying all my belongings.

313
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,040
Sorry.

314
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,360
What's this?

315
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,520
Coupons.

316
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,480
This is my cafeteria meal card.

317
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,040
And this?

318
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,120
And a love letter.

319
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,520
Love letter?

320
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,000
This letter is from my sister Xiaomian

321
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
to Sanwan.

322
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,440
"My love for you"

323
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,320
Not Sanwan,

324
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,480
it's Sanhaiwan.

325
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,960
"I love your face,"

326
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,480
"with nose and eyes,"

327
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,600
"I love your noodles,"

328
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,920
"perfect texture, not sticky."

329
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,000
"I love riding with you,"

330
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,440
"perfect pace, super comfortable."

331
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
"Your bowl"

332
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,240
"can hold"

333
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,960
"my bowl of noodles?"

334
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,520
Where did you see this?

335
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,840
Then why isn't it with me?

336
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,880
It's with you.

337
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,240
My sister gave this to me

338
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,680
to pass on to you.

339
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,360
Just sit there then.

340
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,520
So Xiaomian likes her boss.

341
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,880
That's what this means, right?

342
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,600
You're having workplace romance?

343
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,880
No, we're not together.

344
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,200
Your sister is Xiaomian, right?

345
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,520
Yes.

346
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,280
Xiaomian likes Sanwan, right?

347
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,480
Xiaomian does like Sanwan.

348
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,560
She even

349
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
because of Sanwan,

350
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,440
quit her favorite job

351
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,400
to work at his noodle shop.

352
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,200
So with the "deceased" Zhenzhen,

353
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,840
do you have any grudge?

354
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,640
I have no grudge against Zhenzhen.

355
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,520
If you insist on talking about grudges,

356
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,960
I think my younger sister

357
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,000
is the one who holds a grudge against Young Master Guo.

358
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,680
She's angry that Xiao Guo follows her every day.

359
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,680
What she really wants is Sanwan to accompany her daily.

360
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,400
But Xiao Guo just happens to be that annoying obstacle.

361
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,920
So my sister never gets that chance.

362
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,320
No,

363
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,640
I wasn't talking about my sister.

364
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,520
I'm asking if it's possible

365
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,360
that for your sister's sake,

366
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,960
you would...

367
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,360
Then I'd have to "eliminate" Zhenzhen.

368
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,200
Because

369
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,960
he and Zhenzhen are a couple.

370
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,920
I haven't...

371
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,320
I haven't even solved my own problems yet.

372
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,720
Why would I take such a big risk

373
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,760
just to "eliminate" her?

374
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,440
Brother Teng,

375
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,120
Wait, then my situation is really strange.

376
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,840
I've actually been

377
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,400
quite good to Xiaomian.

378
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,680
I've never harassed her.

379
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,160
Actually, it's precisely because you're too nice to her

380
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,240
that she finds you annoying.

381
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,720
But why would she take this matter about me

382
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,360
and make it public?

383
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,600
Starting online bullying against me?

384
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,080
I must clarify this for my sister:

385
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,040
I just called her,

386
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,480
While she does find you annoying,

387
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
she didn't cyberbully you.

388
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,400
She didn't expose you

389
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,360
or reveal anything about you.

390
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,280
But it's already online

391
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,520
On that "Anti-Scum" alliance page

392
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,040
He's already listed there

393
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,800
Xiaomian definitely didn't do that

394
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,120
Xiaomian never lies to me

395
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,320
So that means Xiaomian didn't post it

396
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,120
Then it must be

397
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,440
Someone else using Xiaomian's account

398
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,560
Who would use Xiaomian's account?

399
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,120
It's possible

400
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Zhenzhen used Xiaomian's account

401
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,800
Love rival

402
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,920
I don't think that's the case

403
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,840
Because during this period

404
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,920
Zhenzhen and I were still together

405
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,720
Right, you were with Zhenzhen

406
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,200
And Xiaomian likes you

407
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,040
Zhenzhen found out Xiaomian likes you

408
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,360
So she wanted to ruin me

409
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
What kind of logic is that?

410
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,200
You see

411
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,560
You wouldn't have guessed

412
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,240
No, I wouldn't

413
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,920
But Zhenzhen figured it out

414
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Zhenzhen thought of it

415
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,360
Only then would it make sense

416
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,880
Actually, it's not very useful

417
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,800
No, I don't think Zhenzhen has

418
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,400
Any emotional

419
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,600
Feelings of love or jealousy

420
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,160
She just wants to

421
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
Eliminate all the "scumbags" in this world

422
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,720
She was once hurt by a "scumbag"

423
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,960
And now fears all "scumbags"

424
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,240
So the sequence must be

425
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,480
First you got exposed as a "scumbag"

426
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,720
Then Zhenzhen might want to expose you

427
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,680
Zhenzhen being with him

428
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,400
Must be because she found out

429
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,920
About him stalking Xiaomian

430
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,680
Right, but how did she know?

431
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,040
Then I think our current evidence

432
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,280
still isn't being examined thoroughly enough

433
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,560
I feel that

434
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,320
the computer we just looked at

435
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,800
still

436
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,360
wasn't examined carefully enough

437
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,600
Who can bring it over?

438
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,680
I'll go

439
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,160
You go

440
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,520
602

441
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,200
Kewuku

442
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,080
Sorry for the trouble

443
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,640
Okay, no problem

444
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,080
Thank you

445
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,880
Thank you for your honesty

446
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,520
It's my duty

447
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,720
To help everyone solve their problems

448
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,240
I also want

449
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,200
to find the real "culprit"

450
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,680
If it weren't for you

451
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,120
we wouldn't have come here

452
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,280
I have a small goal

453
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,680
to make my apartment's

454
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,400
occupancy rate reach 100%

455
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,920
I don't want any wrongful cases here

456
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,520
affecting my occupancy rate

457
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,960
Come

458
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's take a look at this first

459
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,880
Thank you

460
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,840
The forum?

461
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,720
Look

462
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,360
Stalker

463
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Posted by Xiaomian?

464
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,680
Then Zhenzhen replied below

465
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,600
Saying "Don't worry sisters"

466
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,400
"I'll help you get back at that scumbag"

467
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,600
See, she only did this after seeing

468
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,160
that he's a scumbag

469
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,120
That's why she did this

470
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,720
Yes, exactly

471
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,560
That's the sequence

472
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,240
Everything follows this order

473
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,640
Probably not Zhenzhen either

474
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,680
Then look

475
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,960
January 11th

476
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,920
The first one is you

477
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,960
The white one is

478
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,680
February 22, 2020

479
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,560
Who's the most recent?

480
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,440
The latest is

481
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,400
This real-name report

482
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,680
Right

483
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,560
This is February 3rd

484
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,080
February 3, 2022

485
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,960
Cao Tongzhuo

486
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,240
When was the screenwriter exposed?

487
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,920
The screenwriter wasn't exposed

488
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,880
The screenwriter hasn't been exposed

489
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,960
She didn't get to expose the screenwriter yet

490
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,560
Right

491
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,720
The call was made on May 3rd

492
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,200
Saying "Don't forget"

493
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,520
our previous agreement

494
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,000
"Don't interact with other guys"

495
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,680
Which was just yesterday

496
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,000
So the screenwriter is also suspicious

497
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,680
Because before it was posted

498
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,600
They could have stopped her

499
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,640
Right

500
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,800
I just want to ask about the screenwriter

501
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,080
If you don't obey

502
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,960
you'll be punished

503
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,680
I think we should question those two

504
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,120
First

505
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,760
Okay

506
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,600
Screenwriter Song first

507
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,000
Hello, President Ma

508
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,720
Come, Screenwriter Song

509
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,120
Please, this way

510
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,560
Over here

511
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,880
Don't ask for more money

512
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,160
"The Qiao Family's Descendants"

513
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,240
I've already sold it to Tencent Video

514
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,440
Be serious

515
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,040
What are you doing?

516
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,240
I have many things to attend to now

517
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,400
What exactly do you want?

518
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,200
What's this really about?

519
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Judging by appearances

520
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,640
You don't have that much business either

521
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,720
Phone

522
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,120
Give it to me

523
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,760
There should be records, right?

524
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,280
Yes, hand over the phone

525
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,080
Let's see who you're calling

526
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,400
Help us search him, okay?

527
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,000
Okay

528
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,920
Nothing here

529
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,360
On my person

530
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,600
Look

531
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,120
This is all I brought today

532
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,800
Right

533
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,160
This is the same

534
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,360
Exactly the same?

535
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,400
Mine is identical

536
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,160
Then the Tencent producer

537
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,840
Contract

538
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
I'll send you the contract to review

539
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,720
Let's schedule time to discuss details

540
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,440
Sold "The Qiao Family's Descendants"

541
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,319
to Tencent

542
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,480
Check the time

543
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,119
This afternoon

544
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,000
1:04

Congratulations

547
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,440
You have successfully registered as

548
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,079
a member of the forum's "Anti-Scum Men" Alliance

549

group member

550
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,000
Your login username is Xiaomian

551
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,960
Don't mess around

552
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,440
You're Xiaomian

553
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,040
You are Xiaomian

554
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,640
Why are you impersonating Xiaomian?

555
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,400
Why impersonate my sister?

556
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,720
And even expose me?

557
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,840
You even said

558
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,880
Let me tell you all

559
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,800
Five months ago

560
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,360
when I first started pursuing Jiajia

561
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,120
he was also pursuing Jiajia

562
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,960
so I began observing him

563
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,720
following him

564
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,880
He stalked Xiaomian

565
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,440
and many other girls too

566
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
You stalked me too, right?

567
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:43,960
I was observing

568
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,880
You actually stalked me?

569
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,840
This wasn't stalking you

570
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,040
I was protecting Xiaomian

571
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,720
What's Xiaomian to you?

572
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,480
Why would I protect Xiaomian?

573
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,640
Weren't you pursuing Jiajia?

574
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,560
You've made enemies with both Jiajia and him

575
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,760
Yet you still want to protect Xiaomian

576
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,280
You're no saint either

577
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,440
He just wants to

578
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,640
I was afraid he'd harm other girls

579
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,680
He's trying to achieve his goal indirectly

580
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,000
So who is Jiajia anyway?

581
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,200
Jiajia

582
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,040
is the one he likes

583
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,880
She's my ex-girlfriend

584
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,560
She's my girlfriend

585
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,360
Jiajia is Zhenzhen

586
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,000
Zhenzhen

587
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,760
Who is Zhenzhen?

588
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,080
Jiajia is Zhenzhen

589
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,640
How is that possible?

590
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,160
My girlfriend's name is Jiajia

591
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,240
How can she be called Zhenzhen?

592
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,920
Have you been to this building today?

593
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,600
Yes.

594
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,720
What time?

595
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,400
I received Jiajia's WeChat message at noon.

596
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,440
What time at noon?

597
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,840
Around 12 o'clock.

598
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,840
She asked to meet at 1 PM.

599
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,720
At Theater 4 of Zhenzhen Theater.

600
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,680
Did you see her?

601
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,840
I entered the theater at 1 PM.

602
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,320
Waited a while before she arrived.

603
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,080
When she came,

604
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,440
she was wearing that outfit I really like -

605
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,160
the retro Hong Kong style.

606
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,720
But strangely,

607
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,760
she forgot she was the one who asked to meet.

608
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,680
Haven't we already settled this?

609
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,040
Why did she want to meet again?

610
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,160
So I didn't even get the chance

611
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
to discuss the plagiarism issue.

612
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,800
She just left.

613
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,240
So nothing was resolved.

614
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,920
Right.

615
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,960
Which theater did she ask you to meet in?

616
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Theater 4.

617
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,920
After you entered,

618
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,200
did you turn left or right?

619
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,360
About how many steps?

620
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,200
Who remembers that?

621
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,320
Who remembers such details?

622
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,720
Why would I remember?

623
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
Because you're our gold medal administrator

624
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,440
During your meeting

625
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,680
did you experience a sudden power outage?

626
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,520
No

627
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,800
When your meeting ended

628
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,680
when you came out

629
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,080
was the building in a blackout?

630
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,480
When I entered the theater

631
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,600
the corridor lights were on

632
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,960
But when I came out

633
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,080
the corridor was dark

634
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,960
Don't know what happened

635
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,280
Do you remember what time you came out?

636
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,440
Phones weren't allowed in that theater

637
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,200
When I got my phone back after leaving

638
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,160
it was already 1:25

639
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,520
So you just met briefly

640
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,200
and then left?

641
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,240
Yes

642
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,920
Jiajia has been acting very strange recently

643
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,720
Five months ago

644
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,040
when we first got together

645
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,280
she was always well-behaved and obedient

646
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,480
But ever since she changed to that new WeChat

647
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,600
and phone number

648
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,680
she's been hot and cold with me

649
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,520
and even threatened to break up with me

650
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,160
By the way

651
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
you mentioned this WeChat issue

652
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,760
I just remembered

653
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,360
Tell her

654
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,000
not to forget

655
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,200
the agreement between you two

656
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,960
What agreement?

657
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,560
Isn't it about writing "The Qiao Family's Descendants"?

658
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,360
That was our joint creation

659
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,160
Weren't you writing

660
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,400
"Charlotte's Troubles"? No?

661
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,520
It's called "So Annoying"

662
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,200
"So Annoying"

663
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,760
That was plagiarizing his work

664
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,280
Yes, he copied it

665
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,200
I wouldn't call that plagiarism

666
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
That's called homage, understand?

667
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,840
Homage

668
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
The tribute only differs by four words

669
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,840
That still counts as tribute

670
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,680
Then

671
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,800
If she exposes your tribute act

672
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,280
and talks about it

673
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,240
exposes you

674
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,720
You'd punish her, right?

675
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,760
How would you punish her?

676
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,160
"Kill" her?

677
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,320
I didn't "kill" anyone

678
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,360
Then what's the punishment?

679
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,800
I never actually planned anything

680
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,240
Just empty threats

681
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,880
Right

682
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,160
After she changed her WeChat

683
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,960
you had a ten-minute call

684
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,320
What was that call about?

685
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,640
Just to confirm

686
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,560
whether she was really Jiajia

687
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,120
After confirming

688
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,240
she was indeed Jiajia

689
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,120
Don't know what happened

690
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,400
but she's like this now

691
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,080
What was she like before?

692
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,800
She used to be very obedient

693
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,760
a very compliant girl

694
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,600
24/7 without stopping

695
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,160
Suddenly

696
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,720
she turned into an ice-cold girl

697
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,080
Basically

698
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,720
The Jiajia you saw in Room 4

699
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
was she the Jiajia you knew

700
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,520
or a stranger?

701
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,480
It was the changed Jiajia

702
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,200
You saw a Jiajia too

703
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,680
I also waited before seeing her

704
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,800
We both waited a while

705
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,040
and barely spoke

706
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,480
She just said one thing to me

707
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,000
"Why did you ask me here?"

708
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,360
She asked you "Why did you ask me here?"

709
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:47,880
Yes

710
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,840
She asked me the same

711
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,760
She asked me too

712
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,680
"Why did you ask me here?"

713
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
I really shouldn't have gone up there today.

714
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,600
I should have gone to the foot massage place in the basement.

715
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
To get a foot massage.

716
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,840
My appointment was at seven.

717
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,720
Maybe we can go together later?

718
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,640
Do you have anything else to ask?

719
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,480
No, I need to go.

720
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,360
I'm very busy.

721
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,920
You're someone who...

722
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,000
spends every day paying tribute to classic works.

723
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,360
How busy could you possibly be?

724
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,560
Busy paying tributes?

725
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,240
Is there anything you'd like to confess?

726
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,960
What do you have to confess?

727
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,880
What could I possibly have to confess?

728
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,320
Alright then.

729
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,800
Screenwriter Song.

730
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,080
Why don't you go grab something to eat outside?

731
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,560
I'm really busy, please hurry up.

732
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:29,880
Honestly.

733
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,720
Fine, coming right away.

734
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,640
Goodbye.

735
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,200
Thank you.

736
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,120
The call was never hung up.

737
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,760
Thank you.

738
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,040
Indeed.

739
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,120
Actually, regarding Screenwriter Song,

740
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,920
I have a few things to say.

741
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,480
He essentially

742
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,160
plagiarized someone else's work.

743
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,520
It's a blatant

744
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,400
violation of someone's copyright,

745
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,120
an infringement.

746
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,880
Yes, absolutely.

747
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,040
It's intellectual property theft.

748
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,760
Calling it plagiarism

749
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,040
is giving him too much credit.

750
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,440
Of course.

751
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:02,880
Although he

752
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,400
published it,

753
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,960
he published it,

754
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,560
but it's pirated.

755
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,040
Just messed up four characters in the copying.

756
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,640
Right.

757
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,400
Should I call Cao Yangguang in now?

758
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,280
Okay.

759
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,600
Hello.

760
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,000
School heartthrob.

761
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,160
Hello.

762
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,920
This is the school heartthrob.

763
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,120
Come on, let's do a pat-down first.

764
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,200
Do you agree?

765
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,920
Sure.

766
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,720
Take out your phone.

767
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,600
Do you have a phone?

768
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,640
Yes, I have a phone.

769
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,640
Hand over the phone.

770
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,040
The search is really thorough.

771
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,440
Inside pocket.

772
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,680
His wallpaper is really cool.

773
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,880
Let me treat you to

774
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,240
a lightly tea-scented,

775
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,480
refreshing grapefruit with real fruit bits - Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring.

776
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,080
Promise me you'll drink it

777
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,560
Real tea, real fruit bits,

778
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,040
and tell the truth.

779
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,280
Okay?

780
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,600
Okay.

781
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,440
Why am I so popular wherever I go

782
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,520
and well-liked everywhere

783
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,600
Thank you, miss

784
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,360
Maybe we should take it back

785
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,600
Take it back, don't let him drink it

786
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm begging you

787
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,120
Please, I'm begging you

788
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,640
Spit it out

789
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,240
Sorry, I've already drunk it

790
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,880
Sorry

791
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,960
My apologies

792
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,720
What did you call him

793
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,520
An "average but arrogant guy," right?

794
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,000
No, a mama's boy

795
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,040
Mama's boy

796
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,240
This makes me so mad

797
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,960
Come on, what did he say

798
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,440
Yesterday at 5 o'clock

799
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:19,960
He said in the evening

800
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,280
What did you secretly photograph

801
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,840
Where are you

802
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,760
Let's meet and talk

803
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,000
Today at noon

804
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,440
Come to the 8th floor of Apartment 11 at 1 PM

805
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,840
Meet at Theater 3 of Zhenzhen Theater

806
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,720
I'll be waiting

807
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,760
Do you know this girl

808
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,000
Which girl

809
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,360
The girl who messaged you on WeChat

810
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,160
The name of the person who secretly photographed me

811
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,600
is Tongtong

812
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,480
Tongtong

813
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,080
Tongtong

814
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,680
Yes

815
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,440
She's one of my many admirers

816
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,000
When she filmed you

817
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,600
What were you doing holding those high heels?

818
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,000
I was cleaning the high heels

819
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,080
You think you were just cleaning them?

820
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,400
We need to show you the video

821
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,400
Were you really just cleaning them?

822
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,840
Do you enjoy cleaning both men's and women's shoes?

823
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,800
Not really

824
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,200
I prefer women's accessories

825
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,280
Because women's things

826
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,680
are always shiny

827
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,240
and particularly cute

828
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,480
Let me ask you

829
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,760
Whose were those red shoes?

830
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,120
Tongtong's

831
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,560
They were Tongtong's

832
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,240
What happened to those shoes afterwards?

833
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,880
Those shoes are now at my place

834
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,000
I kept them

835
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,840
So you're

836
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,760
this girl

837
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,800
Whether you like her or not

838
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,280
as long as you like her belongings

839
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,480
you can just take them, right?

840
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,200
That's right

841
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,720
Then why don't you go to

842
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,920
the women's department to clean them?

843
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,560
I think his behavior

844
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,200
is sneaky

845
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
If he's secretly taking others' belongings

846
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,160
for himself

847
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,320
then when the value reaches a certain amount, it's theft

848
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,720
But none of them said anything

849
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,520
Why are you in such a hurry?

850
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,320
Lock him up

851
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,440
Your attitude is completely inappropriate

852
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,640
Your attitude remains completely improper

853
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,600
I don't call it stealing

854
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,720
I'm just taking

855
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,840
They like me too

856
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,200
I'm just taking their things

857
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,280
No, this is illegal behavior

858
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,080
This matter has nothing to do with you

859
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,960
I don't want to say any more

860
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,360
Hey

861
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,480
Your earrings

862
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,360
So cute

863
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,600
You're so scary

864
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,640
I'll give you

865
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,520
I'll give you everything

866
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,040
Give you all

867
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,400
It's okay

868
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,680
Here you go

869
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,160
Anyway, the things I want

870
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,600
I always get in the end

871
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,440
What if you can't get it?

872
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,760
Up until now

873
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,840
There's nothing I couldn't get

874
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,280
If I can't get it

875
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,520
You just want to "kill" her, right?

876
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,680
That's not necessarily true

877
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,200
He made a call

878
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,880
At 1:15,

879
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,040
he called Tongtong

880
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,800
Tongtong didn't answer

881
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,160
Why did you call her

882
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,920
at that time?

883
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,400
Well,

884
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,720
it's because

885
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,360
at noon today,

886
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,040
Tongtong sent me a message

887
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,680
She asked to meet at 1:00

888
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,120
at Theater 3

889
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,360
So I went to Theater 3 at 1:00

890
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,040
I waited for a while

891
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
and Tongtong came to meet me

892
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,320
What did she say?

893
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,120
Because at that time I knew

894
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,760
she had secretly photographed me

895
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,280
Then

896
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,960
I was afraid she might know

897
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,720
my real secret

898
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,120
so I kept pressing her about it

899
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,240
"Do you know my secret?"

900
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,640
I know nothing.

901
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,320
She said she didn't know.

902
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,080
And,

903
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,800
she claimed I was the one who asked to meet.

904
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,880
I never asked to meet you.

905
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,040
Don't change the subject.

906
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,720
You're the one who invited me here.

907
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,680
Why did you ask me to come?

908
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,800
This is what puzzles me.

909
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,280
Because you've all seen the messages.

910
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,360
Clearly it was her who texted me

911
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,560
at noon.

912
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,880
But her expression seemed so genuine,

913
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,080
it made me feel

914
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,440
as if she truly didn't know

915
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
about this matter.

916
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,200
I really know nothing.

917
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,560
I won't bother you anymore.

918
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,200
Get out of my theater!

919
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,280
Then she ran out.

920
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,800
I quickly followed her.

921
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,360
When I reached the theater entrance,

922
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,160
I picked up my phone

923
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,720
and called her again,

924
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,240
but the call didn't go through.

925
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
What time did you meet her?

926
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,680
At 1 PM.

927
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,840
Right on time?

928
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,760
I arrived at the theater exactly at 1 PM,

929
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,320
but she came

930
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,760
a little later.

931
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,120
I'm not sure how many minutes later.

932
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,480
What time did she leave?

933
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,080
Fifteen minutes ago, right?

934
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,320
Definitely fifteen minutes ago.

935
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,400
He called at fifteen past.

936
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,720
Right.

937
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,120
Aren't you afraid

938
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,640
that she might reveal

939
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,320
your real secret?

940
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,240
This secret isn't actually

941
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,280
a real secret to me.

942
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,760
The reason I came to see her

943
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,280
was to find out

944
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,320
whether she really knows

945
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,760
my true secret.

946
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,720
If she finds out

947
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,880
about my real secret,

948
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,040
then everything is over.

949
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,280
Do you know what

950
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,360
then everything is over

951
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,440
your real secret

952
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,840
Why does he keep repeating himself

953
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,720
No, we just want to know

954
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,680
what the real secret is

955
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,720
The secret is out.

956
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,040
Can it still be called a secret?

957
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,040
That makes sense

958
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,440
Quite reasonable

959
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,000
You're right

960
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,920
But you know what

961
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,800
The person you like has "died"

962
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,800
The person I liked has "died"

963
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,960
Do you like Tongtong?

964
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,760
I don't like her

965
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,640
I just like the things she wears

966
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,560
Then let me ask you

967
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,120
In your opinion, this Tongtong

968
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,800
Is she

969
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,880
A little girl who clings to you

970
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,440
Or the very independent type

971
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,160
A strong woman

972
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,400
She seems more independent

973
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,760
I remember when she came to see me today

974
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,280
She was dressed all in black

975
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,680
And wearing black boots

976
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,440
Different from her usual pair that I love

977
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,800
The red high heels

978
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,880
Could there be more than one?

979
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,000
Twins

980
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,560
You mean

981
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,920
Two people

982
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,040
Yes, because remember

983
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,800
Xiao He mentioned before

984
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,320
Sometimes she would greet him

985
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,040
Other times she wouldn't

986
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,400
When I first met Zhenzhen

987
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,240
I thought she was

988
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,560
A very warm girl

989
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,280
But later sometimes

990
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,760
She would ignore me

991
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,000
Very strange

992
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,280
Could Zhenzhen be

993
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,840
There are two

994
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,400
Are there two Zhenzhens

995
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:05,840
Twins

996
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,960
I think that's possible

997
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,080
And I know

998
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,800
Jiajia has a

999
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,560
unique feature

1000
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,720
Because when I first met Jiajia

1001
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,400
I accidentally hit her

1002
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,800
with a basketball and knocked her down

1003
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,520
After she fell

1004
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,120
her head hit the steps

1005
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,080
I took her to the hospital for stitches

1006
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,800
She has a scar

1007
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,360
Jiajia is the one with the head scar

1008
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,680
Jiajia is the one with the head scar

1009
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,840
That "corpse" we saw earlier

1010
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
did it have a head scar?

1011
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,640
Didn't check

1012
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
I forgot

1013
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,200
No one mentioned it could be two people at the time

1014
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,600
Do you know

1015
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,040
if Tongtong has any scars?

1016
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,640
Specifically if her head was ever injured

1017
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,200
I genuinely don't know about that

1018
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,960
When I met her

1019
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,400
she was perfectly healthy

1020
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,440
He only noticed the high heels

1021
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,680
Were the high heels damaged anywhere?

1022
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,400
The heels were perfectly intact

1023
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,040
They looked beautiful to me

1024
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,400
Do you have any interesting websites

1025
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,200
you'd like to share with us?

1026
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,240
Interesting websites

1027
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,880
I'd like to share with you

1028
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,440
Like those "scumbag" sites

1029
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,320
Yes, the anti-"scumbag" alliance

1030
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,560
What "scumbag" alliance?

1031
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,000
I know absolutely nothing about that

1032
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,960
I think this matter

1033
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,320
is best left alone by you

1034
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,440
This matter has nothing to do with the case.

1035
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,760
Maybe we should put this aside for now.

1036
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,200
Alright.

1037
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,800
I think...

1038
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,520
Although he did commit theft in this aspect...

1039
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:29,920
He stole...

1040
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,440
Right.

1041
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,160
But he left at fifteen...

1042
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,000
There's also proof that he was earliest...

1043
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,080
If you've ruled out...

1044
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,320
Because it was before that time...

1045
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,560
Right, he definitely didn't do that.

1046
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,720
So asking about...

1047
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,000
his other private matters...

1048
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,800
really isn't very meaningful.

1049
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,360
He, since you're familiar with him anyway...

1050
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,920
If in the future...

1051
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,040
we live here...

1052
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
and there are other secrets...

1053
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
we can ask him again.

1054
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,280
Then please go back now.

1055
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,320
Okay.

1056
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,800
You...

1057
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,520
do you know me?

1058
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,160
Do you know me?

1059
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,360
Why do you know each other?

1060
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,560
How do you know each other?

1061
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,720
It's nothing.

1062
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,240
No, it's nothing.

1063
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,040
Does anyone have any other questions?

1064
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,800
Alright.

1065
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,160
Okay.

1066
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,640
No questions here.

1067
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,800
If there are no more questions, I'll take my leave.

1068
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:20,960
My phone.

1069
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,760
Here.

1070
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,080
Here you go.

1071
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,680
Thank you, miss.

1072
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,920
This tastes really good.

1073
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,840
Let's hurry up and go.

1074
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,320
I don't want to investigate this case anymore.

1075
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,000
Mom, I want to go home.

1076
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,720
Guo Baoyou is coming

1077
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,480
Let me tell you

1078
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,920
He's the most suspicious one, actually Guo Baoyou

1079
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,800
Zhenzhen "died"

1080
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,760
Where did Guo Baoyou go?

1081
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,600
You scared me

1082
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,480
Stalker

1083
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,040
This is Zhenzhen

1084
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,520
I can explain

1085
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:10,960
I can

1086
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,400
What time did you see Jiajia?

1087
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,440
Jiajia

1088
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,680
It was around 12:50 for me

1089
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,800
Definitely before 1 o'clock

1090
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,120
Then I entered Room 2

1091
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,600
Room 2

1092
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,360
I waited for her quite a while

1093
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,120
Quite a while

1094
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,560
What time did you see her?

1095
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,960
I can't say exactly when I saw her

1096
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,320
I can only say

1097
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,320
The time when I went out to check my phone

1098
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,120
Because I didn't bring my phone into the room

1099
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,920
Right?

1100
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,160
When I went out to get my phone, it was 12:35

1101
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,200
In the room, I saw her

1102
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,600
After seeing her

1103
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,360
I remember I spoke first

1104
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,480
I said could you stop posting online

1105
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
those terrible articles I wrote

1106
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,560
and exposing them?

1107
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,200
You deserve it

1108
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,760
She didn't answer my question

1109
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,280
Instead she asked me

1110
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,000
She said

1111
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,840
Why did you ask me to come?

1112
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,320
I was surprised

1113
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,960
You're the one who asked me to come

1114
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,000
You tell me why I'm here

1115
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,880
If there's nothing, I'm leaving

1116
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,640
No

1117
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,440
You...

1118
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,640
She left, so I left too

1119
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,440
Could it mean...

1120
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,440
The one who made the appointment wasn't

1121
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,560
I think it's very possible

1122
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,120
No, so she (Zhenzhen) must definitely be

1123
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,280
There are at least two people

1124
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,560
If there are more, it might be three people.

1125
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,639
Because there's also Tongtong.

1126
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,800
Right, Zhenzhen.

1127
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,239
Tongtong.

1128
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:30,560
And

1129
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,040
Mao Mao

1130
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,480
Xiao Xiao

1131
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,120
Jia Jia

1132
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,159
Five

1133
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,120
Yes, she (Zhen Zhen) has five names

1134
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,600
But today, probably only three appeared

1135
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,679
I think it's just two

1136
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,639
Judging by personality

1137
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,159
Because he (Guo Baoyou) was also said to be quite gentle

1138
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,440
You also encountered two of them

1139
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,800
The one I met was more independent

1140
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
I've already mentioned this

1141
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,639
Then we broke up

1142
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,120
But after finally coming back

1143
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,600
She (Zhenzhen) reverted to how she used to be

1144
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,120
So

1145
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,800
Therefore

1146
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,480
Thus

1147
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,400
Any more questions?

1148
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,040
Nothing more to ask

1149
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,120
The questioning is over

1150
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,020
I think Brother Wan

1151
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,300
You should at least

1152
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,540
Go sit over there

1153
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,460
Okay, no problem

1154
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,220
You'll need to stay for a while

1155
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,940
Because through the surveillance footage

1156
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,340
we clearly saw

1157
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,700
you entering that room

1158
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,260
Come on, guys

1159
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,180
Brother Bai

1160
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:25,820
Tell us

1161
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,620
The surveillance footage clearly shows

1162
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,380
you went in when the lights were on

1163
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,060
That's right

1164
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,460
I admit

1165
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,580
She went in when the lights were off

1166
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,340
I admit

1167
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,820
Then you came out when the lights were off

1168
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,580
Correct

1169
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,820
But she never came out

1170
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,820
Yes, she never came out

1171
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,260
But I really didn't see her

1172
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,900
How long did you stay in the room?

1173
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,780
Until I went out to make a call

1174
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,940
From 1:00 to 1:50

1175
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,980
you kept waiting for her in the room

1176
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,020
Kept waiting in the room

1177
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,820
Waited for fifty minutes

1178
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,020
But you never saw her

1179
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,700
Waited fifty minutes

1180
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,940
before going out to call her

1181
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,500
That's right

1182
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,780
The lights were off when I left

1183
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,100
But exactly when they went off

1184
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,620
I don't know

1185
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,020
But according to our footage

1186
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
you must have seen her

1187
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,620
Because after you entered

1188
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,540
Zhenzhen went in

1189
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,140
Brother Bai

1190
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,660
You arrived at the theater at 1:00 sharp

1191
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,100
Correct

1192
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,900
Then you left at 1:50

1193
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,300
Right

1194
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,300
What time did you go upstairs?

1195
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,460
I was outside at 1:35

1196
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,420
I stepped on the "blood" at 1:46

1197
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,660
So now we just need to

1198
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,380
find a way to verify

1199
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,580
everyone's departure times

1200
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,180
This way

1201
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,780
we can establish their alibis

1202
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,820
What time did you leave Theater 3?

1203
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,500
1:15

1204
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,260
When I came out and got my phone

1205
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,260
it was already 1:25

1206
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,540
I went out and got my phone at 1:35

1207
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,660
When I went upstairs

1208
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,940
it should have been around 1:46

1209
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:52,860
Okay

1210
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,580
Here's how the timeline looks now

1211
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,940
Song can be ruled out

1212
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,220
because he left the theater at 25 past

1213
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,980
Then Cao can also be ruled out

1214
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,780
because he left the theater at 15 past

1215
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,820
Guo can theoretically be ruled out too

1216
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,900
because he left at 35 past

1217
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,620
after getting his phone and leaving the theater

1218
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,220
So if the crime occurred

1219
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,820
So if the crime occurred

1220
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,460
between 35 and 45 past

1221
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,060
then at that time

1222
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,580
you were the only one present

1223
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,820
making you the only one

1224
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,900
with the opportunity to commit the crime

1225
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,100
That's exactly what I'm talking about

1226
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,020
I said it's because of Brother Teng

1227
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,660
I said it's because of Brother Teng

1228
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,860
He was in Room 3

1229
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,420
where the "bloodstains" were found

1230
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,420
But when I went there

1231
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,700
to my Room 1

1232
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,700
there was nothing

1233
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,220
I just checked the surveillance again

1234
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,740
It clearly shows

1235
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,060
him entering Room 3

1236
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,420
And then

1237
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,620
Wait, there's another issue

1238
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,500
We just saw

1239
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,540
the "dead" Zhenzhen

1240
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,660
was wearing a red dress, right?

1241
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,460
The Zhenzhen who entered your room also wore red

1242
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,380
Right

1243
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,900
Yes, that's what the camera shows

1244
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,260
The camera shows someone in red entering

1245
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,260
Right?

1246
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,980
Logically speaking

1247
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,180
she shouldn't have "died" in Room 3

1248
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,820
because she was wearing all black, right?

1249
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,220
Right

1250
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,380
Yes, all the evidence points to him

1251
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,860
I turned left down the dark hallway

1252
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,180
After walking about ten steps

1253
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,700
After going up, turn left

1254
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,620
That's Room 1

1255
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,140
But the video shows

1256
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,020
him entering Room 3

1257
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:24,420
Why?

1258
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,340
The "blood" he found was in Room 3

1259
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,220
But when we went there

1260
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,700
there was no "blood" in Room 3

1261
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,820
Only Room 1 had "blood"

1262
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,180
So personally

1263
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,260
I suspect

1264
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,140
I suspect

1265
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,740
Could it be possible that

1266
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,820
my room's location changed

1267
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,140
or the camera's position changed

1268
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,420
or the room numbers changed

1269
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,140
There's something wrong

1270
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,980
Look

1271
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,460
First

1272
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,220
You see

1273
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,940
It's circular, right?

1274
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,700
This is the inner ring

1275
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,460
And this is the outer ring

1276
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,380
Four rooms

1277
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,740
Since there are two doors here

1278
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,300
What I suspect is

1279
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,780
When I enter Room 1

1280
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,580
It starts rotating

1281
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,540
It rotates

1282
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,540
My Room 1 rotates to Room 3

1283
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,900
And Room 3 rotates to Room 1

1284
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,780
So when I enter

1285
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,620
It rotates away

1286
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,500
Then it rotates back

1287
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,340
Zhenzhen enters

1288
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,860
Let's assume

1289
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,660
The central camera remains fixed

1290
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,820
So this camera

1291
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,900
Always faces this door

1292
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,660
Which is Room 1

1293
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,940
No matter what number it is inside

1294
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,740
When it rotates here

1295
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,940
For the camera, it's still Room 1

1296
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,020
Yes, exactly

1297
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,620
I think this line of reasoning should be correct.

1298
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,740
Will it really rotate?

1299
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,340
This room

1300
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,300
It's difficult

1301
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:48,820
Right

1302
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,300
Although I don't have evidence

1303
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,500
I'm just speaking from a logical perspective

1304
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,220
to address this issue

1305
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,740
So have you noticed

1306
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,900
any changes inside?

1307
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,140
Nothing at all

1308
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,340
I think there are changes inside

1309
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,540
One unlikely reason is

1310
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,300
it must be outside

1311
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,100
because after you enter

1312
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,580
when you come out

1313
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,100
its number wouldn't remain unchanged

1314
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,740
since you wouldn't know

1315
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,340
where it has rotated to

1316
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,340
if you suddenly exit

1317
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,580
you'd cause a complete numerical chaos

1318
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,220
No

1319
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,420
The room he first entered

1320
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,540
might be Room 1

1321
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,580
But what we saw

1322
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,900
wasn't necessarily Room 1

1323
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,220
when Zhenzhen entered.

1324
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,460
Right.

1325
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,140
If we assume this room

1326
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,420
can rotate,

1327
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,020
he entered Room 1,

1328
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,140
but after rotation,

1329
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,340
though we see the same door,

1330
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,980
the interior has shifted.

1331
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,460
There are two doors inside.

1332
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,020
The camera

1333
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,340
films the inner door, right?

1334
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,540
No, it films the outer one.

1335
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,860
The outer door.

1336
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,420
But the issue is when he exits,

1337
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,180
he still comes out

1338
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,580
from this numbered door.

1339
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,820
There might be a rotation,

1340
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,060
then rotation back,

1341
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,820
but how could it

1342
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,380
perfectly time every

1343
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,860
entry and exit moment

1344
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,820
to coincide with

1345
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,340
when it rotates back?

1346
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,100
I have a suggestion

1347
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,420
Let's go back to the crime scene

1348
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,060
and search it again

1349
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,460
About our earlier assumption

1350
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,540
regarding the room's rotation

1351
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,820
or the camera positions

1352
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,260
or the door number placements

1353
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,300
Didn't we have another box

1354
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,140
that wasn't opened?

1355
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,100
Right

1356
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,580
And do you remember

1357
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,020
we saw small footprints

1358
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,060
cat's paw prints

1359
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,580
Yes

1360
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,380
And on that

1361
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,260
that jar

1362
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,100
was labeled as stage props

1363
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,860
and was red

1364
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,620
That puddle on the floor

1365
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,140
was from the cat breaking it

1366
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,180
Because the cat's footprints

1367
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,420
led in that direction too

1368
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,060
Right

1369
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,140
What the cat broke

1370
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,700
you said was dye, not "blood"

1371
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,940
What you stepped in wasn't "blood"

1372
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:43,940
Come on

1373
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,940
Let's go take another look, okay?

1374
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,780
Okay

1375
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,620
Everyone should receive one

1376
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,180
Wait a moment

1377
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,380
Don't rush

1378
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,860
I have a flashlight

1379
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,060
It's probably just a tripped circuit

1380
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,620
Wait a moment

1381
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,780
I'll turn that light on

1382
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,780
It's open

1383
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,380
Zhenzhen just appeared

1384
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,620
Zhenzhen was just here

1385
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,140
Wearing a red dress

1386
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,540
She didn't "die"

1387
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,140
She never "died" at all

1388
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,380
So there are two people

1389
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,540
Zhenzhen just appeared

1390
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,060
wearing a red dress

1391
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,460
She didn't "die"

1392
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,060
She never "died" at all

1393
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,300
So there are two people

1394
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,140
Let's go check the eighth floor again.

1395
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,340
Is there anything else we need to look for?

1396
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,140
Work schedule.

1397
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,740
Where is the elevator's trash bin?

1398
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,420
This isn't...

1399
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,980
There are his shoe covers.

1400
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,980
Let's first take a look at the crime scene

1401
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,060
Crime scene

1402
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,220
Check if there's a scar on the back of her head

1403
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,220
Excuse me (for this intrusion)

1404
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,700
Where on the head was hit by the basketball?

1405
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,340
Quick, which one?

1406
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,340
Isn't this quite clear? This one

1407
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,540
This is the hairline

1408
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,340
This one

1409
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:54,900
No

1410
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,780
I don't want to investigate cases with them anymore

1411
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,060
No scar

1412
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,100
No scar

1413
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,580
Which means she's not Jiajia

1414
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,620
Look at this

1415
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,180
This one can move

1416
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,220
This is it

1417
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,940
I was just wondering what this thing is

1418
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,020
I poked at it

1419
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,700
A is A

1420
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,380
And this part can rotate

1421
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,300
She still lives here

1422
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,660
There's a computer here

1423
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,060
Theater performance props

1424
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,300
Let's check another room

1425
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,020
See if there's anything

1426
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,380
Okay

1427
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,020
Her A here

1428
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,460
Let's go to number two first

1429
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,580
Right

1430
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,620
Pull this out

1431
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,060
B

1432
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,020
Look, it says B here

1433
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,300
The previous one said A

1434
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:57,780
This is B

1435
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,220
Same thing

1436
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,700
Are all the props identical?

1437
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,860
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

1438
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,420
There are seven

1439
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:02,700
Same

1440
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,540
Yes, seven in each room

1441
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,620
Are the colors the same?

1442
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,100
This panel is a different color

1443
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,380
The last one was red

1444
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,060
Right

1445
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,460
Now it's yellow

1446
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,340
The panels are different colors anyway

1447
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,740
Come on, let's keep going

1448
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,940
This one must be green

1449
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,220
What color?

1450
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,020
Blue

1451
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,380
So they're primary colors?

1452
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,180
Red, yellow, blue

1453
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:26,540
Yes

1454
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,540
What do you get when you mix primary colors?

1455
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,220
Black

1456
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,300
You can calculate that?

1457
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:30,740
Yes

1458
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,460
Red, yellow, blue

1459
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,660
Red, yellow, and blue can be mixed

1460
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,540
To make other colors

1461
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,860
Right

1462
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,740
Let's open D first

1463
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:41,820
Green

1464
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,620
She invited everyone to different rooms

1465
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,860
Different colors

1466
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,260
Right

1467
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,660
Isn't this just ABCD?

1468
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,060
What does this even prove?

1469
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,460
It just proves they're different

1470
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,060
First, I have another question:

1471
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,620
Can this room rotate?

1472
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,220
I think

1473
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:10,380
I think

1474
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,900
the middle layer can rotate

1475
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,100
I think it can rotate

1476
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,420
I believe this wall with the door

1477
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,020
can rotate

1478
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,300
There's probably a gap in the middle

1479
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,300
I got it

1480
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,380
Let's stand on the carpet

1481
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,100
and try pushing this thing

1482
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,020
Right, because there's empty space there

1483
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,580
Okay?

1484
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,740
Come on, one person per side

1485
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,860
One person each

1486
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,580
Come on

1487
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,020
One each

1488
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,660
I'll count us down

1489
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,100
No, wait

1490
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:34,820
Hold on, bro

1491
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,820
Do you want to go inside?

1492
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,500
I'll go in

1493
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,020
If you leave, you won't be able to reset it

1494
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:39,900
Can I still get out?

1495
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:41,900
Okay, let's rotate it first

1496
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,900
Anyway, the inside is blue

1497
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:43,580
We'll remember

1498
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,180
Come on

1499
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,340
Okay, three two one

1500
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,940
Three two one

1501
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,100
Three... two... one...

1502
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,780
Wait a moment

1503
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,860
Is it backwards?

1504
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,220
Backwards, okay

1505
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:12,940
Stand over here

1506
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,020
Okay, one two three

1507
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:15,900
Once more

1508
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,700
One two three

1509
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,540
One two three

1510
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,260
One two three

1511
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,380
One two three

1512
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,180
It's moving

1513
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,220
It's going

1514
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,260
We can push it

1515
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,500
It moved

1516
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,340
It's moving

1517
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,900
One two three

1518
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,980
One two three

1519
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,860
One two three

1520
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:51,380
One two three

1521
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,740
One two three

1522
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,540
You go ahead

1523
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,420
One two three

1524
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,780
No

1525
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,460
How long do we need to keep moving this?

1526
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,460
One two three

1527
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,420
One two

1528
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,740
You call three

1529
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,860
One two three

1530
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:09,660
Pushed to the end

1531
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,300
It's at the limit

1532
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,620
This must be the end

1533
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,180
I think there should be a switch

1534
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,180
Let's look around

1535
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,180
Here

1536
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,660
One two three

1537
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,460
One two three

1538
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,220
One two three

1539
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,060
Find anything?

1540
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:32,780
There's a switch

1541
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,540
Two switches

1542
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,420
For corridor use only

1543
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,020
This one's for theater use only

1544
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,380
So one is controlled outside

1545
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,740
And one is controlled inside

1546
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,100
Corridor control switch

1547
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,980
Don't stand here

1548
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,100
What?

1549
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,220
It can rotate anytime

1550
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:02,900
Amazing

1551
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,820
It's so impressive

1552
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,700
The room isn't moving

1553
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,340
It's this outer door that's moving

1554
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,220
Moving this middle part

1555
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:09,500
Right

1556
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,420
That's why you can't feel it

1557
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,020
Exactly

1558
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,700
This is so cool

1559
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,180
What did Zhenzhen do before?

1560
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,380
Zhenzhen also studied some mechanics

1561
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,820
Otherwise this thing would cost 500,000

1562
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,380
Spending 500k like this is really impressive

1563
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,740
We were just saying

1564
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:26,300
No way

1565
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,180
It couldn't be something like a turntable

1566
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,140
Who didn't believe it earlier?

1567
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:30,740
Sorry

1568
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,020
Me

1569
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,700
I'm sorry

1570
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,700
We didn't think it would go that far

1571
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,620
Wouldn't be done so extremely

1572
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,580
Didn't expect it to be this extreme

1573
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:39,900
Stop

1574
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,380
Stop

1575
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:40,980
Stop

1576
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:41,540
It stopped

1577
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,420
Just as I thought

1578
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:50,580
So

1579
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,140
Actually, it's already rotated

1580
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,180
180 degrees

1581
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,100
Guys

1582
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,660
The moment to witness the miracle has come

1583
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,180
Entering through Door 3 leads to Room 1 (A)

1584
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,500
Still Room 1 (A)

1585
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,940
If there really is a "killer"

1586
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,940
We need to follow this rotation logic

1587
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,300
To rearrange these people

1588
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,180
Right

1589
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,380
Bai Sanwan entered through Door 1, right?

1590
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,780
Why does Zhenzhen go to every room?

1591
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,260
Guo Baoyou

1592
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,140
Door 2

1593
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:22,540
Cao Yangguang

1594
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,700
She asked to meet me at 1 o'clock

1595
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,860
At Theater 3

1596
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:25,980
She asked to meet me at 1 o'clock

1597
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,820
At Hall 4 of Zhenzhen Theater

1598
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,660
Zhenzhen must know about this

1599
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,780
She came in and out

1600
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:49,180
She could have orchestrated it herself

1601
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,380
Here's how we see it

1602
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,300
Right now, this is Room A

1603
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,380
So I didn't enter Room A

1604
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,140
This is Room 1

1605
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:55,860
When I came to Room 1

1606
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,100
it was completely undisturbed

1607
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,300
So when he arrived

1608
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,740
the room had already rotated to C

1609
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,140
Right

1610
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,420
Meaning you were in C

1611
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,860
When you first came, you entered C

1612
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,500
Exactly

1613
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,260
I entered through Door 1

1614
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,660
into Room C

1615
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,580
Before you arrived

1616
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,220
it had already rotated to that state, correct?

1617
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:15,580
Yes

1618
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,180
Then Teng Zhongjie entered through Door 3 into Room A

1619
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,100
That's why he stepped on the "blood"

1620
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:22,580
Correct

1621
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,780
If we believe

1622
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,060
he's innocent

1623
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,020
then it must be Cao Yangguang across from you

1624
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:28,700
who "killed" her

1625
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,580
Because the only rooms

1626
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,140
that were swapped were these two

1627
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,700
Only these two were rotating

1628
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,460
So actually

1629
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,220
the "body" has always been

1630
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,140
in Room 3 (Room A)

1631
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:38,540
Because Room 3 (Room A)

1632
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:38,940
was never entered by anyone

1633
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,900
No one went in

1634
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,020
Only our Teng Zhongjie entered once

1635
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,220
Are you suggesting

1636
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,780
that I did it?

1637
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,260
It's not impossible

1638
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,540
Teng Zhongjie was there alone

1639
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,860
putting on an act by himself

1640
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,300
Why would he

1641
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:58,940
stand there

1642
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,420
and try to lock us in?

1643
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,100
With that overhead lighting

1644
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:02,780
He looks suspicious

1645
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,740
He looks like a "murderer"

1646
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,900
This yellow button

1647
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,980
is specifically for theater use

1648
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,540
hasn't been used in the theater yet

1649
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,020
Try pressing it

1650
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:15,540
You take this

1651
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,260
Three, two, one

1652
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:16,740
Hold it down

1653
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,580
It's moving outside

1654
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,500
Brother Teng, pull the door down

1655
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,340
Open the door and see

1656
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,020
It's moving

1657
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,620
It's rotating

1658
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,220
There's something

1659
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,380
Stop

1660
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,300
Stop

1661
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,020
Slow down

1662
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,340
Agile movements

1663
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,820
There's a note here

1664
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:49,860
Here's a note

1665
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,660
I feel like I'm in a martial arts movie

1666
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,180
This is my younger sister (Jiajia)

1667
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,500
Her recent favorite flavor

1668
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,180
Many of her belongings

1669
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,940
Have been replaced with related items

1670
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,820
If I drink more of this

1671
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,180
Will I understand her better?

1672
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,660
Then what's inside this box?

1673
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,180
There's a letter

1674
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,020
The elder sister Zhenzhen is independent

1675
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,020
And skeptical about love

1676
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,020
While younger sister Jiajia

1677
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,980
Always remains hopeful about love

1678
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,740
Enjoying zero-distance romance

1679
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,740
Using the sisters' two completely different

1680
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,700
Perspectives on love

1681
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,580
As inspiration

1682
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,020
Younger sister Jiajia created

1683
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,900
The play "True and False Love"

1684
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,180
On stage

1685
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,300
Zhenzhen and Jiajia

1686
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,420
Play the same role

1687
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,060
Through seamless costume changes

1688
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,220
And special stage design

1689
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,420
Creating complete surprise for the audience

1690
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,580
That there are indeed two sisters

1691
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,660
And the one who "died" wasn't Jiajia

1692
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,780
Because there's no scar

1693
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,540
It was Zhenzhen who "died"

1694
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,860
And the key

1695
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,300
We found the key to open that box

1696
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,500
There was a box we didn't open earlier

1697
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:58,940
Right

1698
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,540
Let's open it

1699
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,220
There's a note here.

1700
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:07,940
Sister (Zhenzhen)

1701
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,260
Four people want to meet you today.

1702
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,420
1:10 PM

1703
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,180
Cao Yangguang at Theater 1.

1704
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,300
1:20 PM

1705
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,500
Screenwriter Song at Theater 2.

1706
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,780
1:30 PM

1707
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,380
Guo Baoyou at Theater 4.

1708
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,540
1:40 PM

1709
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,540
Bai Sanwan at Theater 1.

1710
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,540
Arrive on time.

1711
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,620
This was written by Jiajia.

1712
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,020
Right.

1713
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,820
Then why are the meeting locations different?

1714
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,740
Zhenzhen told me.

1715
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,620
She asked me to come to Gate 1 at 1 PM.

1716
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,900
I arrived at Theater 2 before 1 PM.

1717
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,100
She scheduled with me at 1 PM.

1718
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,020
To meet at Theater 3.

1719
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,300
She scheduled with me at 1 PM.

1720
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,060
To meet at Theater 4 of Zhenzhen Theater.

1721
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,260
Another big question is.

1722
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:54,820
Zhenzhen didn't know.

1723
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,260
That she scheduled with them at 1 PM.

1724
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,420
To meet at the theater.

1725
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,020
Why did you ask me to come here?

1726
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,460
I didn't schedule with you.

1727
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,980
She actually forgot she scheduled with me.

1728
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,940
We just walked halfway around.

1729
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,500
Let's walk around some more and see.

1730
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:12,780
Right.

1731
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,620
Brother Teng, close the door.

1732
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,660
Brother Teng, come in.

1733
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:15,980
It's fine, you guys keep looking around.

1734
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:16,460
Let's go.

1735
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,380
Then be careful, bro.

1736
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,220
Let's go.

1737
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,380
We can still look around.

1738
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,380
The train has departed.

1739
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,460
No need to see me off.

1740
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,460
You came all the way to the station.

1741
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:33,580
It was 1 just now, right?

1742
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:33,860
Yes.

1743
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:34,900
Outside the door was 1, correct?

1744
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,060
Outside is 1.

1745
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:42,740
Look

1746
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,340
Everything

1747
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,420
It's this door moving

1748
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,180
The number is rotating

1749
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,460
Right, only the middle

1750
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:47,220
This middle door is moving

1751
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:47,900
This bearing

1752
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:48,780
This middle ring

1753
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,380
There's another one

1754
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,260
Another wooden crate

1755
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,140
Quick

1756
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,980
Did you get it?

1757
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,340
Did you get it?

1758
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,500
Brother Teng

1759
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,380
Brother Teng

1760
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,260
So near yet so far

1761
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,580
Brother Teng thinks the subway journey isn't over yet

1762
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,020
Combination lock

1763
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:07,900
Four letters

1764
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,420
I think it's related to what we just saw.

1765
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:15,940
This one.

1766
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,820
Because it says

1767
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:17,380
This is my younger sister (Jiajia)'s

1768
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,540
recent favorite flavor.

1769
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,460
She's replaced many of her belongings

1770
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,060
with things related to this.

1771
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,420
If I drink more of this,

1772
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,860
maybe I'll understand her better.

1773
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,180
Then you should drink some.

1774
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,020
Won't you understand her better if you drink it?

1775
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,020
After drinking - "Ding!"

1776
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,820
What's the password?

1777
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,020
Could it be on the bottle bottom?

1778
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,940
There's a poem on the bottom.

1779
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,420
Immortals float jade cups,

1780
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,020
Tea greener than moss.

1781
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:41,460
True energy reaches the woods,

1782
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,140
Fruits pierced by birds' pecking.

1783
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:43,940
This riddle

1784
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,220
must mean something.

1785
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:46,940
So,

1786
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,260
"Real Fruit Grains Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring"

1787
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,500
Not only has light tea fragrance,

1788
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,020
but you can chew real fruit pieces.

1789
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,940
I feel refreshed after a sip.

1790
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,660
Real tea, real fruit - truly delicious.

1791
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,500
Now my thoughts are clear.

1792
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,820
It might be...

1793
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,140
It's "real tea real fruit".

1794
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,820
The acrostic poem, right?

1795
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,460
Let's try.

1796
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,740
ZCZG

1797
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,740
Real Tea Real Fruit

1798
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,500
Awesome!

1799
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,180
Well done!

1800
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:11,540
Okay.

1801
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,340
What could be here?

1802
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,420
A bowl.

1803
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:15,340
The bowl you gave her.

1804
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,500
The bowl you gifted.

1805
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,460
Zhenzhen.

1806
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,220
You used this to confess to her.

1807
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,540
Yes, when I confessed,

1808
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:24,140
I said I'd make noodles for her forever.

1809
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,780
This tablet computer.

1810
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,220
Video

1811
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,100
Take a look

1812
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:36,500
Jiajia

1813
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,660
I've told you a hundred times

1814
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,500
Screenwriter Song doesn't love you at all

1815
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,140
He's emotionally manipulating you

1816
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,220
Controlling you, using you

1817
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,100
"The Qiao Family's Descendants"

1818
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,620
This script was clearly written by you

1819
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,700
Yet it bears his name

1820
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,700
What's mine is his

1821
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,020
I'm no good at anything

1822
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,940
No one will love me except him

1823
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,820
I can't lose him

1824
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,460
So don't try to stop me and Screenwriter Song

1825
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,820
You've always had boys flocking around you since childhood

1826
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,060
Love comes so easily to you

1827
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,420
It's because of your presence

1828
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,740
No one ever notices me

1829
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:13,100
So don't ruin things between me and Screenwriter Song

1830
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,620
As long as he loves me

1831
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,460
I'm willing to give him everything

1832
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,460
Look at yourself

1833
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,660
See how pathetic you've become

1834
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,620
Real love goes both ways

1835
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,180
Not about control and suppression

1836
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,700
If you keep being stubborn

1837
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,180
You should know

1838
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,020
I can make Screenwriter Song

1839
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:27,980
just like other "scumbags"

1840
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,860
lose everything and be disgraced

1841
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:30,420
Don't push me

1842
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,580
I'll do anything for Screenwriter Song

1843
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,820
Zhenzhen has been running

1844
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,780
the anti-"scumbag" alliance.

1845
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,140
Right.

1846
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,220
Who was the one that just "died"?

1847
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,140
It was Zhenzhen who "died".

1848
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:45,580
Yes.

1849
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,660
She was working on that

1850
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:47,220
Jiajia said,

1851
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,860
"I'm capable of anything."

1852
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,420
Jiajia is a love-struck fool, right?

1853
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,140
For Screenwriter Song,

1854
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,340
she turned against

1855
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,260
her sister (Zhenzhen).

1856
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:57,300
So,

1857
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,660
there is no "killer" among us.

1858
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,900
They couldn't even tell Zhenzhen and Jiajia apart.

1859
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,500
They didn't know who to "kill".

1860
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,300
Also,

1861
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,580
"Real Tea Real Fruit Grapefruit Meets You"

1862
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:12,740
I've fallen for

1863
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,300
"Real Fruit Bits Red Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring".

1864
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,060
I ordered two more boxes.

1865
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,420
Here's the purchase record.

1866
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,340
Where were they delivered to?

1867
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:20,460
Have those two boxes arrived?

1868
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,820
Did you take a kickback?

1869
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,140
They've arrived.

1870
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,260
I'll go check later.

1871
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,020
The younger sister (Jiajia) actually always wanted

1872
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,020
to understand her sister (Zhenzhen) better.

1873
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,140
So she also followed her sister (Zhenzhen)

1874
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,100
in buying this.

1875
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,060
It wasn't the sister (Zhenzhen), right?

1876
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:34,540
No.

1877
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,540
There was a small note

1878
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,380
from the sister (Zhenzhen)

1879
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,300
wanting to understand the younger sister (Jiajia) better.

1880
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,020
The sister (Zhenzhen) wanted

1881
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:38,900
to understand the younger sister (Jiajia) more.

1882
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:39,580
This is what the younger sister (Jiajia) recently

1883
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:49,980
Arrest someone

1884
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,100
Let me go

1885
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:05,700
It's over for me.

1886
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,740
My body still feels numb.

1887
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,740
Me too.

1888
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:15,660
That startled me.

1889
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:17,660
No...

1890
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:20,220
I'm sure I was scared by them

1891
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,580
Why are you grabbing me?

1892
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:26,780
Here, I'll grab her

1893
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,460
You grab her

1894
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,140
You do it

1895
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,060
We need to talk with you

1896
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:29,620
We caught up with her

1897
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:37,180
Then let's go inside and talk.

1898
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:38,740
Alright, let's go in

1899
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:39,580
We'll go in first

1900
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,420
Let's see what happens

1901
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,300
You hold her

1902
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,300
I'll hold her, I'll carry her

1903
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:42,980
You hold her, don't let her run away

1904
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,740
Carry her

1905
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,940
Which room is this?

1906
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,460
This is the one

1907
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:54,540
Don't let her fool you

1908
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,620
This person is full of tricks

1909
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,060
Teng Zhongjie (proper noun)

1910
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,580
That's quite frightening

1911
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,340
That was really terrifying just now

1912
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,940
This person runs pretty fast

1913
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:09,580
Lower leg

1914
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,100
Who shouted?

1915
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:12,980
Just now,

1916
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,300
it was you, bro.

1917
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,220
You're the loudest.

1918
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,340
It's over for me.

1919
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:32,620
So beautiful

1920
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,220
looks

1921
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,980
You're really beautiful.

1922
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,020
It'd be a shame if you "died."

1923
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,140
"Died."

1924
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:40,660
It's someone else

1925
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:41,500
They're coming

1926
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,940
You can sit down and talk

1927
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,340
Three bowls

1928
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,740
Keep an eye on that door over there—three bowls

1929
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:47,620
I'll sit here

1930
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,900
Right, we'll sit by this door

1931
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:49,740
Don't let her escape

1932
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,620
Do you know who I am?

1933
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,140
Jiajia

1934
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:53,940
You're Jiajia

1935
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,140
That's right

1936
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:57,220
Why were you in the surveillance room?

1937
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,460
I noticed you were investigating

1938
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,500
my sister Zhenzhen's "death"

1939
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,700
So I wanted to hear what you've found

1940
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:02,900
Why did you "kill" your sister Zhenzhen?

1941
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,100
I didn't "kill" my sister Zhenzhen

1942
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,540
You didn't "kill" your sister Zhenzhen?

1943
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:08,900
Then how did your sister Zhenzhen "die"?

1944
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,660
I don't know

1945
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,340
Did you know your sister (Zhenzhen) "died"?

1946
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,740
I only found out at 2 PM today

1947
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,180
when I returned to the theater

1948
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,340
I want to ask you

1949
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:21,780
why did you tell your sister (Zhenzhen)

1950
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,500
that four people would come

1951
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,820
at different times today

1952
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:24,620
to different rooms?

1953
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,100
I never said that

1954
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,620
You gave her a note

1955
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:32,820
Then I understand

1956
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,540
How many of you twins are there?

1957
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:35,300
How many twins?

1958
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,780
How many sisters are there actually?

1959
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,700
Twins

1960
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,020
Twins

1961
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,340
How many sisters?

1962
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:42,380
What note?

1963
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,260
Let me see it

1964
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:44,980
Is she trying to destroy evidence?

1965
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,220
Cover her mouth

1966
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:46,460
Give it to her

1967
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,580
You hold it for her to see

1968
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:50,740
How do you explain this?

1969
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:51,260
Don't move

1970
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,300
Put your hands down

1971
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,740
Are you trying to stuff it in your mouth to eat it?

1972
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:01,780
Did you write this?

1973
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,380
The handwriting looks somewhat like mine.

1974
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:07,540
But I didn't write it.

1975
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,060
Did you arrange this meeting?

1976
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:11,860
You didn't arrange it.

1977
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,660
Not me.

1978
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,740
I didn't write that note.

1979
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:17,100
This person even forged her handwriting.

1980
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:22,180
So you were the one who asked to meet me?

1981
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:23,140
It wasn't me.

1982
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:24,740
Because my phone was broken.

1983
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:26,820
Your phone was broken?

1984
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,940
My phone broke three days ago.

1985
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:29,620
May 3rd.

1986
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,700
Just got it repaired today.

1987
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:37,060
The person Screenwriter Song contacted was...

1988
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:37,940
Her sister (Zhenzhen).

1989
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,580
That's why he said she became colder.

1990
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:39,940
Right.

1991
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,500
She also said three days ago she changed her number.

1992
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,860
Added him with a new number.

1993
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:43,340
Yes.

1994
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,140
The "Anti-Scum Men" alliance website.

1995
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:49,260
Did you create it?

1996
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,100
My sister (Zhenzhen) created it for me.

1997
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,140
Your sister (Zhenzhen) created it for you?

1998
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,380
Before that...

1999
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,420
On that website...

2000
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:57,940
All the exposed "scum men"...

2001
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,300
Did you know them all?

2002
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,740
I haven't seen them all.

2003
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,060
They all dated you?

2004
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,060
They all dated you?

2005
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:05,540
No.

2006
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,420
Have you forgotten we used to date?

2007
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,220
I never dated you.

2008
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,820
Weren't we the kind of friends who shared everything back then?

2009
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,300
Crosstalk, skits, magic, acrobatics

2010
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:17,940
Chatting about everything under the sun

2011
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:19,740
But I only saw you as a friend

2012
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:20,980
I wasn't in a relationship with you

2013
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,540
You're overthinking it

2014
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,420
That's more like it

2015
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,580
You thought you were in a relationship

2016
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:30,380
Because Sister Zhenzhen told me

2017
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:31,300
You're a "pervert"

2018
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,220
And told me to stay away from you

2019
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,740
You're a "pervert"

2020
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,540
A real "pervert"

2021
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,220
Good, keep your distance from him

2022
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,460
I'm your fellow townsman

2023
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,060
How could I be a "pervert"?

2024
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:44,860
In China's entertainment industry

2025
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,220
Is it easy to find fellow Tianjin people?

2026
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:46,980
Tell me

2027
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:47,940
about this matter

2028
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,420
Is there anything else you want to confess?

2029
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,140
The beginning of all mistakes

2030
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:57,300
was because of

2031
01:05:58,180 --> 01:05:59,380
that bowl you gave me

2032
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,140
The last day of 2019

2033
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:11,180
You gave me a bowl at the theater entrance

2034
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,060
Because before

2035
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,420
I often saw

2036
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:14,900
him coming to the theater for performances

2037
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:15,580
But I didn’t know

2038
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,100
he came for me

2039
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:20,220
And that was also my

2040
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:22,860
first time someone confessed to me

2041
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:32,420
So

2042
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,300
I accepted your confession

2043
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,420
Do you remember when you confessed to me

2044
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,580
what you said?

2045
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:41,340
I'll make noodles for you for a lifetime

2046
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,100
Right

2047
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,100
But then what you said next

2048
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,660
shocked me

2049
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,140
You said

2050
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,300
Thank you Zhenzhen

2051
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:50,780
Yes

2052
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,100
So it turns out

2053
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,220
you've always liked

2054
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,140
my older sister (Zhenzhen)

2055
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,940
But I feel unwilling to accept this

2056
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,020
Why is it that my sister (Zhenzhen) and I

2057
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:04,820
look exactly alike

2058
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,220
yet since childhood

2059
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:07,820
no one has ever paid attention to me

2060
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,180
So I concealed

2061
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:15,740
my identity as the younger sister (Jiajia)

2062
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:19,460
I admit I was selfish

2063
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,220
but

2064
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:23,660
because I felt

2065
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:26,980
every day with you was so happy

2066
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,220
that's why I hid the truth

2067
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,740
I can understand

2068
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:36,300
But

2069
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,020
After we had been together for thirty-three days

2070
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:41,900
you broke up with me

2071
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,100
You said it was to make me

2072
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,180
stay true to my independent self

2073
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,820
But I didn’t want that

2074
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:49,980
Later

2075
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:51,140
you disappeared

2076
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,500
I was heartbroken for a long time

2077
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,900
and even fell into depression

2078
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:59,020
Then I told my sister (Zhenzhen)

2079
01:07:59,020 --> 01:07:59,980
that you were a "scumbag"

2080
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,540
So my sister (Zhenzhen) formed

2081
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:03,780
an "Anti-Scumbag Alliance" for me

2082
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,420
Then later

2083
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:09,460
my sister (Zhenzhen) met you again

2084
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,540
What I never expected was

2085
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:13,420
this time

2086
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,300
you fell in love with Sister Zhenzhen again

2087
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:19,939
Sister Zhenzhen originally thought

2088
01:08:19,939 --> 01:08:20,899
that all my suffering

2089
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:22,340
was caused by you

2090
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,500
So she deliberately

2091
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,380
approached you to get revenge for me

2092
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:27,380
(no translation needed - continuation of previous line)

2093
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:29,540
But unexpectedly

2094
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,420
Sister Zhenzhen also fell in love with you

2095
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:37,060
I originally intended

2096
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:38,620
to clear up

2097
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,660
the misunderstanding between you and Sister Zhenzhen

2098
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:41,700
But

2099
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,220
I never imagined

2100
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:48,140
Sister Zhenzhen would suddenly "die"

2101
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:55,140
So first I want to say I'm sorry

2102
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:07,180
I feel a bit unnecessary

2103
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:10,220
Please come back quickly

2104
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:12,859
You can sing them a theme song

2105
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:14,939
It's time for the interlude

2106
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:15,660
(no translation needed - repetition of previous line)

2107
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:16,620
Hurry

2108
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:23,100
What I told you before

2109
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,100
Now that you've heard her say it

2110
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,460
You can easily connect the dots

2111
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:26,580
What I said

2112
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:28,060
was correct

2113
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:28,979
That's exactly how it is

2114
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:31,060
You truly loved her sister Zhenzhen

2115
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:31,819
From beginning to end

2116
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,020
With unwavering devotion

2117
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,100
You just didn't expect

2118
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,060
When you confessed your feelings

2119
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,460
It wasn't to her sister Zhenzhen

2120
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:39,020
How could I have known

2121
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,660
Right, you probably didn't understand either

2122
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:41,060
Yes

2123
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,660
You had a big argument with Zhenzhen

2124
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,140
Because of your relationship with Screenwriter Song

2125
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:45,979
Yes

2126
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:48,020
Because I told Zhenzhen

2127
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,340
Screenwriter Song would treat me well

2128
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:50,620
But Zhenzhen didn't believe it

2129
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:52,979
So that day we had

2130
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,260
a huge argument

2131
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,260
I also think that day

2132
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:58,060
I got a bit too emotional

2133
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,220
I know Zhenzhen was just

2134
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,100
trying to protect me

2135
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:00,820
looking out for me

2136
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:01,380
But that day

2137
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,300
we really did have a major fight

2138
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:05,940
I understand

2139
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,140
Then who do you think "killed"

2140
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:07,900
your sister (Zhenzhen)

2141
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,100
I don't know

2142
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,420
Would sister (Zhenzhen) have "committed suicide"

2143
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,740
to help her younger sister (Jiajia)

2144
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:15,860
and then frame him for it?

2145
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:16,860
That's impossible

2146
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:17,700
If she "killed herself"

2147
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,540
to help her

2148
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,060
why would she need to frame him?

2149
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:21,380
I don't know

2150
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,340
You know even though it's really

2151
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,300
You know this part is really

2152
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:25,580
Your sister is still fine

2153
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:26,620
Don't pull this act

2154
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:27,140
No

2155
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,340
This part is really touching

2156
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:30,500
But watching them, I just can't handle it

2157
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,540
It's over

2158
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:32,100
Are we family?

2159
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:32,740
You're not

2160
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,220
Born of the same root

2161
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,500
What are you doing here?

2162
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,020
Why the rush to torment each other?

2163
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,620
After generations of descendants

2164
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:40,700
You'd turn your back on family

2165
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:41,180
Begin

2166
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,380
You're so happy

2167
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,100
Three bowls

2168
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:46,660
Are you happy?

2169
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,580
The person I truly loved has already "died"

2170
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,140
Go keep her company there

2171
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:51,180
You're not a good person either

2172
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:51,620
Fine

2173
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,660
What you lost was just love

2174
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,140
But what she lost was her sister (Zhenzhen)

2175
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:56,860
She suffered a double loss

2176
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:57,980
Lost her sister (Zhenzhen)

2177
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,020
Family love and romantic love

2178
01:10:59,020 --> 01:10:59,580
Right

2179
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:00,540
But she has Screenwriter Song

2180
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:01,420
She's not at a loss either

2181
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:05,140
Screenwriter Song

2182
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:05,860
We've found something

2183
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,620
Are you actually two sisters?

2184
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:08,700
I didn't know

2185
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,500
About you being two sisters

2186
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,660
Why keep it a secret?

2187
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,260
Because we needed to perform

2188
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,660
To maintain mystery for the audience

2189
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,420
So you're from out of town, right?

2190
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:23,580
Aren't you staying here?

2191
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,060
You...

2192
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:24,780
Yes

2193
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,980
One ID card for two

2194
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:27,700
Two rooms booked

2195
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,340
Two rooms booked

2196
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:28,900
Correct

2197
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:29,660
What's going on here?

2198
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:32,540
Here's the thing

2199
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:34,020
First, regarding the handwriting

2200
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,500
Someone who could forge her handwriting

2201
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,900
Must be someone very close to her

2202
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:44,020
I'm a "pervert"

2203
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:45,300
Stop looking at me

2204
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,700
To write a good novel

2205
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,060
You fabricated all of this

2206
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:50,100
I think it's Screenwriter Song

2207
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,260
So it is Screenwriter Song?

2208
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:52,940
Because Screenwriter Song co-wrote the script with her

2209
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:55,020
So he's very familiar with her handwriting

2210
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:55,980
Yes, that's possible

2211
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,180
"The Qiao Family's Descendants"

2212
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,140
I did write it

2213
01:11:58,140 --> 01:11:59,540
But I put his name on it

2214
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,980
I think Screenwriter Song is the prime suspect

2215
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:09,460
Let's follow the rotation order

2216
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:10,500
Let's analyze this first

2217
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,140
Okay

2218
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:11,900
Jiajia

2219
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,300
Have a seat

2220
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,700
You sit

2221
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:16,860
Sit down, you can't leave anyway

2222
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,340
Sit here

2223
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:33,980
Don't run

2224
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:50,780
Sherlock Holmes once said,

2225
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,780
when you have eliminated all possibilities,

2226
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:57,380
what remains, however improbable,

2227
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,860
must be the truth.

2228
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,540
There's no escape this way either.

2229
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:12,500
May 6th, 10:30 AM

2230
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,380
"Suicide"

2231
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,420
There's a "blood" mark on the door

2232
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:18,340
Cat

2233
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,060
So what we need to do now is

2234
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:22,540
figure out how to reconstruct this "murder" method

2235
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,780
Something's suspicious, let's go

2236
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,420
Where's the "corpse"?

2237
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,140
The bottle's gone and so is the person

2238
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:33,460
Neither her sister nor her have "died"

2239
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:34,940
Someone's pulling from inside, right?

2240
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:35,980
Playing tough, huh?

2241
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:37,300
She's over there

2242
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:37,940
Hurry, let's go

2243
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:39,020
What's she doing here?

2244
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,500
Controlling all of this

2245
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,980
The "killer" can go anywhere

2246
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:43,260
When he was scaring us

2247
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:44,260
He was standing right behind us

2248
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:45,780
Then why didn't he call out to us?

2249
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,460
Moreover

2250
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:47,220
I might not believe you

2251
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,580
The "killer" could be lying

2252
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,700
You don't have to believe me

2253
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,380
But the question is - what's my motive?

2254
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,740
Can't the three bowls be completed?

2255
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:53,740
This crime process

2256
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:54,580
All three of us could be involved

2257
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:56,140
This is clearly trying to frame me

2258
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,540
Bai could also be framing herself

2259
01:13:58,540 --> 01:13:59,460
A scheme within a scheme

2260
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,620
Even if you have just a 1% chance of being the culprit

2261
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,100
You can't be completely ruled out

2262
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:06,740
He's really highly suspicious

2263
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,820
Tune in to Tencent Video every Friday at 6 PM

2264
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:26,820
