1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,080
Guo Baoyou,

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,600
why did you invite us here today

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,040
for a big wedding ceremony,

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,680
How do you know he's your father?

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,920
So I have to come up with

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,600
a rare prop,

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,640
Believe it or not, I'm going to take it out.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,560
I don't have

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,200
to either.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,280
This is my dad.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,480
Why does my dad look like this?

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,280
Congratulations,

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,120
Congratulations

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,200
What kind of happiness?

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,040
Are you sick?

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,160
Why are you wearing my dress secretly in the middle of the night?

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,680
What's that?

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,480
X

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,240
XL's. Look

20
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,640
how beautiful his daughter is.

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,160
Look at you.

22
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,880
Look at you.

23
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,280
You know what?

24
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,920
I guarantee that the child will be mine.

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,560
But it may not be yours.

26
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,000
You said that very well.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,520
Yes.

28
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,200
Come and swipe your card.

29
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,720
Why?

30
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,120
You have to pay for the meal.

31
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,800
I don't have to brush it.

32
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,440
You can return it,

33
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,320
Return it. I won't eat it.

34
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,640
I'll eat it for her.

35
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,520
Just give me half of it.

36
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,760
You're too curly.

37
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,480
I didn't lose weight.

38
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,640
Then you don't eat staple food?

39
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,160
After eating here,

40
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,440
I have to get the 58 yuan back.

41
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,440
Teach him a lesson.

42
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,600
Since you dare to open the buffet,

43
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,600
haven't you heard that there will be another resident?

44
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,360
That's all for my schedule.

45
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,200
Will the next episode be Di Sanxian?

46
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,720
Hui Guo You.

47
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,160
He's from the south,

48
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,000
stir-fried meat,

49
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,560
Then learn the pronunciation of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

50
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,640
Guo Baoyou,

51
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,160
Coco,

52
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,600
Miss Song.

53
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,480
What are you doing?

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:49,960
Brother Bai,

55
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,760
what's going

56
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,680
on today?

57
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,440
He wants to beat me up.

58
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,480
What if he wants to beat me up?

59
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,440
What are you doing?

60
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,400
You scared the hell out of me.

61
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,080
Have a seat.

62
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,760
Wait a minute.

63
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,920
We'll set off when we're all here.

64
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,440
Why is it so strange?

65
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,680
I found that since the first night,

66
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,440
our White Three Bowls

67
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,920
has become very strange.

68
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,960
One night just now,

69
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,520
you can wait three nights later.

70
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,880
It's a coincidence that

71
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,520
we've been separated for a long time.

72
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,400
I didn't expect that

73
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,680
I would come here to acknowledge my ancestors.

74
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,400
I'll go here.

75
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,360
Okay,

76
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,080
Hello, Liu,

77
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,000
Liu Xia,

78
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,120
Hello.

79
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,440
Long time no see,

80
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,520
what long time no see,

81
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah, we only have one month.

82
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,640
It's just been a month.

83
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,600
It's been a long time.

84
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,280
We haven't seen each other for a month.

85
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,240
We haven't seen each other for a month.

86
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,320
Have a seat.

87
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,720
Okay,

88
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,400
I.

89
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,640
I'm so excited.

90
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,240
What's going on today?

91
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,520
Didn't she tell you?

92
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,800
Congratulations

93
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
on the big pro-marriage scene,

94
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,920
Congratulations

95
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,960
Like what?

96
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,280
We don't want to be like this,

97
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,160
Congratulations,

98
00:02:59,520 --> 00:02:59,880
Hello.

99
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,080
Hello,

100
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,720
what's going on?

101
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,360
Wait a minute. I'm scaring him.

102
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,680
Hello, Ke Wuku.

103
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Hello.

104
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,480
We're all here.

105
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,400
We're all here.

106
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,200
I can't wait.

107
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,840
Can't you explain to us

108
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,800
why you invited us here today?

109
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,760
When I

110
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,080
was little,

111
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,040
I was separated from my dad.

112
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,680
I lost it.

113
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,520
I didn't lose it.

114
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,600
It's just that I can't find my parents.

115
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,480
Because here's the thing,

116
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,560
I saw my dad's picture these days,

117
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,000
How do you know he's your father?

118
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,880
Yeah, maybe not.

119
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,680
You see, you have to take out

120
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,320
a rare prop,

121
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,360
What is this?

122
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,800
This is an ancestral jade pendant of our Old Guo family,

123
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,480
do you know?

124
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,920
Is this really a fish?

125
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,560
Is it a fish? No way.

126
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,320
Fish flower?

127
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,640
Fish,

128
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,800
But my father's surname is not Yu.

129
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,560
Don't talk nonsense.

130
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,760
And here's the thing,

131
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,480
my dad and I,

132
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,680
Each of us has one.

133
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,280
It's not like a scene between two brothers.

134
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,080
Then he gave me one,

135
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,000
and I saw an owner

136
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
wearing the same one.

137
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,760
Maybe it's your brother?

138
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,840
Maybe.

139
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,840
It's not like

140
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,320
there's no twin brother.

141
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,120
We are twin brothers,

142
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,200
and we might have

143
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,080
a genetic mutation, right?

144
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,880
I'm going to take out the jade pendant.

145
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,040
I'm actually wearing it too.

146
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,160
No.

147
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,279
Why do I have so many dads?

148
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,280
Isn't this a father recognition ceremony?

149
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,680
Dad is sitting here.

150
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,120
It's all dad.

151
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,720
There's another possibility,

152
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,920
Because he has become popular recently, right?

153
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,680
Am I right?

154
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,920
By the way,

155
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,520
why did you suddenly become popular?

156
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,360
I'm fine, too.

157
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,880
Because I'm

158
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,360
good at writing, right?

159
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,360
I took the two big events

160
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,440
that happened here last month,

161
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,560
Two cases. Yeah,

162
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,320
I'll write it down,

163
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Then you're riding the wave,

164
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,920
Yes.

165
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,160
Aren't you going to give us a share of the payment?

166
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,400
There's the story of Liu Xia,

167
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,280
and the story of Bai San Wan.

168
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,720
I wrote the story of Liu Yuning,

169
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,520
and the story of Bai Yu,

170
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,840
I didn't write down their real names

171
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,320
Liu Yuning and Bai Yu.

172
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,520
That sounds good, too.

173
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,320
I think I can

174
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,240
write these two characters well,

175
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,560
The lawyer's letter

176
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,480
from Liu Yuning and Bai Yu,

177
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,400
More useful than them.

178
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,520
It still works, right?

179
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,080
I'm an alias, right?

180
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,120
The above is pure fiction.

181
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,480
If there is any similarity, it is purely coincidental.

182
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,840
So you don't know anything.

183
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,480
You are eight years old.

184
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,840
Then he was thrown into an orphanage.

185
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,920
I haven't met your dad.

186
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,880
I haven't seen her yet.

187
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,720
No, I haven't.

188
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,840
Just looking at a photo,

189
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,120
should we take a look at the photo first?

190
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,920
I don't even know

191
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,760
what your father looks like.

192
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,640
All right. I'll introduce you to him.

193
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,360
When I look at the photos, I think they're familiar,

194
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,040
but I don't know why they're so familiar,

195
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,800
We'll see how familiar it is later.

196
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,640
Here

197
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,800
Here we are

198
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,480
Owner's style,

199
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,040
see?

200
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,680
This...

201
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,000
This is my dad,

202
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,360
I didn't expect

203
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,920
my dad

204
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,640
to grow up like him now,

205
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,480
That's it.

206
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,560
My dad looks like this.

207
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,320
Look at him, right?

208
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,360
I can't wait right now,

209
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,240
I think,

210
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,400
I want to see him.

211
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,360
Look at him.

212
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,440
Look at my dad.

213
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,040
Look at your dad.

214
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,680
Okay, let's go.

215
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,840
Your father is quite bossy.

216
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,880
He does feel that way.

217
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,640
Let's go.

218
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,640
What's wrong with you?

219
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,200
Who's sick?

220
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,400
You're sick,

221
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,280
What's wrong with me? Why are you wearing

222
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,720
my dress in the middle of the night?

223
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,120
Let me see if it's a dress?

224
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,760
That's XXXXXL.

225
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,160
Why are you wearing it?

226
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
Who's wearing a skirt?

227
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,440
On the bed,

228
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,760
I thought it was a quilt,

229
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,040
I've always felt like I lost

230
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,640
those clothes at home,

231
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,400
Shoes,

232
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,720
I asked you to give it to another woman.

233
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,840
You ruined it for me.

234
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,360
Right?

235
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,280
I bought it for you.

236
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,680
I have the right to deal with it.

237
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,400
Got it?

238
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,120
I find that you are a big man.

239
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,840
She knitted sweaters for me every day when she came home,

240
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,240
and even sneaked into my skirt,

241
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,480
Successful men

242
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,760
have to be like me.

243
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,720
I want to earn money to support you.

244
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,760
In order to make a good impression on you,

245
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,600
I did it to earn money to support you.

246
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,440
Do I want this for you?

247
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,600
If I need a man from you,

248
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,760
why do I still

249
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,880
need a man from you?

250
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,840
Yeah, I'm telling you,

251
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,400
wait in line

252
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,800
to find me

253
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,200
and see if we leave today,

254
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,040
I'll get the certificate from someone else tomorrow.

255
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,120
If I can marry you,

256
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,560
look how beautiful that girl is.

257
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,000
Look at you.

258
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,960
Look at you.

259
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,760
Who gave birth to it?

260
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,680
I gave birth to him.

261
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,400
You know what?

262
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,000
I guarantee that the child will be mine.

263
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,880
But it may not be yours.

264
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,880
You're right.

265
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,800
I'm angry.

266
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,560
Why haven't they come in yet?

267
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,800
Yeah. When are you coming in?

268
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,680
We have to fight for a long time.

269
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,040
I'm angry.

270
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,720
I don't want to argue with you.

271
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,480
I'm angry, too.

272
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:36,800
I'm telling you,

273
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,640
Watch our son come later,

274
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,440
son,

275
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,200
Okay, I guess

276
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,880
they probably don't know,

277
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,600
When will you come in?

278
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,880
Let me tell you,

279
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,320
we.

280
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,360
Tidbits,

281
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,040
Tidbits,

282
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
You guys are so funny.

283
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,120
Let's record a tidbit.

284
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,040
You know,

285
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,480
you asked me to quarrel with a talented girl from Peking University,

286
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,760
How hard is it for me?

287
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,080
You know,

288
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,040
quarreling with a crosstalk performer,

289
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,800
How hard is it?

290
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,320
Forget it. Let's stop arguing.

291
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,160
Have a good life.

292
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
I think so, too.

293
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,800
We made up.

294
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:10,960
But you said,

295
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,600
considering the starting point of the show,

296
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,360
They quarreled like this,

297
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,560
knowing that it was a fake couple

298
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,040
who told others to quarrel,

299
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,880
It has to have a reason to quarrel.

300
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,600
What do you want them to hear?

301
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,120
That means

302
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,680
our family is happy and harmonious,

303
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,880
Actually, what I said is right.

304
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,160
Just say you only wash clothes

305
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,120
and cook every day,

306
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
Weaving sweater hook insoles,

307
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
you are right about this point.

308
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,240
Why should I disturb you?

309
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,440
I don't think I've done enough.

310
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,679
Yes.

311
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,159
Not enough?

312
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,200
What do you mean?

313
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,920
I'm not good enough for you.

314
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,280
Let's not pass.

315
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,880
Am I right?

316
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,680
My daughter-in-law has to be gorgeous,

317
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,400
Yes.

318
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,480
It has to be glamorous.

319
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,720
My beautiful wife.

320
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
I want to make you

321
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,920
the most beautiful woman in the world,

322
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,640
-Let's go this way. -Yes.

323
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,680
I'm hungry.

324
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,560
Let's go eat.

325
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,440
Let's go.

326
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,240
Dinner's ready.

327
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,840
Smells so good.

328
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,840
Come on,

329
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,680
Come on

330
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,040
If you arrive, you can just swipe your card,

331
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,120
and we'll eat.

332
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,880
I had a lot of money last time.

333
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,640
Our meal is still 588 yuan each.

334
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,080
You didn't?

335
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,800
You don't

336
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,360
have money?

337
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,040
You have 120.

338
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,560
120.

339
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,080
You're 22,

340
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,440
and you can't eat.

341
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,240
I ate soil.

342
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Did you bury that person?

343
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,880
You want to eat dirt?

344
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,520
Do you dare to touch the soil recently?

345
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,760
If you dig it out,

346
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,480
it's really my fault.

347
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,840
I checked,

348
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,760
and the reason why you don't have money,

349
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,280
Because agent Teng,

350
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,800
he had a meal,

351
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,840
Deluxe buffet?

352
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,240
Why?

353
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,960
Copies are available for 250 yuan each.

354
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll leave it to you.

355
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,080
Eat up.

356
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,120
You can eat it after you brush it.

357
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,000
How much is it?

358
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,880
Eighty-eight.

359
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,080
Okay. You can go fetch some food.

360
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,040
Aren't you going to eat?

361
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,480
We want to eat,

362
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
we don't have money,

363
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,040
You can eat it.

364
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,160
You have 100,

365
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,800
Come and swipe your card.

366
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,480
Why?

367
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,760
You have to pay for the meal.

368
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,040
Why?

369
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,000
58 yuan for a meal. Wait

370
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,640
a minute.

371
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,960
If I don't eat this meal,

372
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,480
I can't.

373
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,400
You eat,

374
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,040
but I don't have to eat.

375
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Return it to me.

376
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,600
I won't eat it.

377
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't return it.

378
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,480
I don't want to eat.

379
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,240
Don't return it.

380
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,840
I'll eat it for her.

381
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,120
If he wants to eat,

382
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,320
we are not afraid of body (getting fat).

383
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,840
Is there any money left in my card?

384
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,440
There's 30 more. Brush

385
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,560
these 30.

386
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,480
Then I'll use her card to swipe it.

387
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,160
Thank you.

388
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,240
You,

389
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,800
Just eat mine.

390
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,640
I didn't want to eat either.

391
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,160
Really?

392
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,880
I didn't eat it, either,

393
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,720
Okay,

394
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,480
I can brush two people.

395
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll brush yours.

396
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,880
Okay, Coco and I

397
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,840
have 40 yuan left.

398
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,200
It's touching.

399
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,800
It's so touching.

400
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,920
In the end, what if Ke Wuku

401
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,480
doesn't have food to eat?

402
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,880
If it's zero for Ke Wuku

403
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,120
Let's go

404
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,680
Ke Wu is cool and pretty

405
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't you want to eat?

406
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,480
Let me see.

407
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,040
What's there to eat with shredded carrots?

408
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
There's nothing to eat with sweet potatoes.

409
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,800
You don't need to pay for this.

410
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,880
Which one?

411
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,600
Fruit.

412
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,800
Fruit is free.

413
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Song Meili, you're so smart,

414
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,160
you don't pay,

415
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,560
Then ask,

416
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,160
do you need money for this?

417
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,720
Do you need money?

418
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,800
You don't need money.

419
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,560
Do you need money?

420
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,240
You don't need money.

421
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,240
Then I'll eat this.

422
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,320
It must be free of charge.

423
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,280
Aren't you a top writer?

424
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,680
Why is there no money in the card?

425
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,200
Yes.

426
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,040
He just said that

427
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,920
the agent came two days ago,

428
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,120
Then he swiped my card

429
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,920
and put it on my account.

430
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,600
So Agent Teng is your father.

431
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,800
I have so many dads,

432
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,360
no.

433
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,760
So in the end, your father was him.

434
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,120
Well,

435
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,000
how's the food today?

436
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,160
It looks good.

437
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,040
Not bad.

438
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,520
As long as you're satisfied.

439
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,280
I don't know how it's going after eating,

440
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,440
but Ke Wuku is here,

441
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,560
Money first. He doesn't

442
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,560
have money either,

443
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,000
Do I have money?

444
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,400
Take a look.

445
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,160
Why do I only have two yuan left?

446
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,760
Kewuku,

447
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,880
because maybe we can put it together now,

448
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,360
I can't make up for your meal.

449
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,400
Sure,

450
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,120
you can eat this meal first.

451
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,480
What is this?

452
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,480
Baozi,

453
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,840
thank you.

454
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,000
Changsha cuisine,

455
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,240
just give me half of it.

456
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,560
Yes.

457
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,600
You two

458
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,880
have to share one bun.

459
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,760
Yes, because he (loses weight)

460
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,640
Because he's on a diet today,

461
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,040
no,

462
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,720
Why are we suddenly losing each other?

463
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,480
He's on a diet today.

464
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,680
You're too curly.

465
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,280
Who's on a diet?

466
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,000
I didn't lose weight.

467
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,160
Then you don't eat staple food?

468
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,680
You won't eat this,

469
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,040
Song Mei Li, right?

470
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,360
Let him eat.

471
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,480
Give me the meal.

472
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,160
We're in line with the rules,

473
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,560
and there's no flaw.

474
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,600
So you killed the housekeeper, right?

475
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,640
Song Meili, are you so strict?

476
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,760
No,

477
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,000
it must be her.

478
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,840
I thought about it just now,

479
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,240
and you're suspected of having a wife.

480
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,440
Actually, there are some.

481
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,040
Her Ladyship also has a problem.

482
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,480
Because Mrs. Kyu found out,

483
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,360
the housekeeper told her

484
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,680
not to get pregnant on purpose,

485
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,080
I used to think,

486
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,920
I can't have a baby.

487
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,320
Maybe there's something wrong with her body,

488
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,840
but she didn't find anything wrong.

489
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,320
Then one day, I found out that

490
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,560
the housekeeper had been secretly giving me

491
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,320
birth control pills,

492
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,000
But I don't know,

493
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,760
but he always tricked my wife

494
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,960
into taking birth control pills.

495
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,320
Yeah, she loves kids. Her wife

496
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,840
has always wanted kids,

497
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,680
One question is,

498
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,120
why didn't he let her have a baby?

499
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,720
If you have a child,

500
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,000
are you pregnant now?

501
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,640
You can hardly

502
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,440
work anymore.

503
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,520
I can't work anymore.

504
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
He still loves money.

505
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,920
He never loved Mrs. Kyu.

506
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,440
But the child has been "dead" for a long time.

507
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,560
This is a "murder"

508
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,040
that has been plotted for ten years

509
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,480
That's why it's at this point, right?

510
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,480
It's possible that Guo Baoyou is here.

511
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,680
Mrs. Ku thought he was his son,

512
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,120
and she hated the one she misunderstood.

513
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,840
That's right.

514
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,840
She has already decided it in her heart.

515
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,520
This family is also very tired.

516
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,120
Then poison Guo Baoyou to death.

517
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:35,960
Yes.

518
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,400
She should have killed Guo Baoyou.

519
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,720
It's really possible.

520
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,960
Her child is gone.

521
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,320
And then she won't even think about

522
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,200
you being here.

523
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,200
Shouldn't that be "killing" him?

524
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,720
And don't you think

525
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,040
Mrs. Gu is only

526
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,560
… Only she is qualified to inherit his (housekeeper's)

527
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,840
inheritance.

528
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,720
She shouldn't have

529
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,440
let the marriage ceremony begin.

530
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,120
She wants to make more money.

531
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,360
Yeah, his marriage ceremony is just

532
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,440
to have one more anchor,

533
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,200
If you really admit him,

534
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,480
will you do a live broadcast for him?

535
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,640
But there's nothing I can do.

536
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,280
You have to do it.

537
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,480
You're so pitiful.

538
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,160
To put it bluntly, you're just a chess piece.

539
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,560
To a cash cow,

540
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,360
The point is that

541
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,320
I became a lot of sons today,

542
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,280
You're the son of the "Grumpy" today.

543
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,480
My dad had a bumper harvest today,

544
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,320
Dad,

545
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,120
Because that pendant is mine,

546
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,680
I'm your real father.

547
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,760
The housekeeper is my dad.

548
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,280
Yes.

549
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,080
So your father is dead.

550
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,360
He's gone.

551
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,560
My dad.

552
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,320
Dad,

553
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,800
Son,

554
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,800
The funniest thing is,

555
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,520
everyone says it's your father.

556
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,120
But everyone knows,

557
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,840
who is your father?

558
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,080
You didn't expect to be lucky enough to love you so much.

559
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,480
I've had a crush on him for so long.

560
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,960
And when I saw you today, you said,

561
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,320
"The posture of heaven and man. ",

562
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,360
You look

563
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
so handsome.

564
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,160
I've never seen

565
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,640
such a talented and handsome person,

566
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
It's the ideal of the human world.

567
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,200
He should know, right?

568
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,000
You knew it all along, didn't you?

569
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,800
It's a little too safe to keep healthy.

570
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,280
The point of keeping healthy,

571
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,920
it should be,

572
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,960
Those who have been punished by the law once,

573
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,800
will know that

574
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,120
they can't do anything illegal next time.

575
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,040
It's more likely to be artistic.

576
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
Because he "killed" a man

577
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,080
and hasn't been locked up.

578
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,360
He might want to "kill" the second person.

579
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,080
He made a mistake.

580
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,960
If you add another mistake,

581
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,880
I guess it's literature and art.

582
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,720
Maybe,

583
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,840
but how is he going to commit a crime now?

584
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,800
We haven't figured it out yet.

585
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,920
What I mean is that no one thinks

586
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,080
it has nothing to do with him.

587
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,800
That gas,

588
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,240
how dare you bring it up

589
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,360
and expose yourself?

590
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,880
I just think that with this modus operandi,

591
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
anyone can do it.

592
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,200
I have to get the 58 yuan back.

593
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,000
Teach him a lesson.

594
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,480
Let's teach the buffet a lesson.

595
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,840
Tell them not to have buffet dishes.

596
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,080
Since you dare to have a buffet.

597
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,599
I think today when Ke Wuku

598
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,079
decided that the killer

599
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,960
was a girl,

600
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,440
After judging it,

601
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,839
no one

602
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,160
can answer it.

603
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,839
If he is not judged to be male,

604
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,480
how can a girl go to the toilet?

605
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,240
The one who stood up and flushed the toilet

606
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,920
with his feet,

607
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,119
I can only flush the toilet by induction.

608
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,160
There's a button

609
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,720
in the back. Don't you remember?

610
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,800
When I open it,

611
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,119
the button will only come after I open it.

612
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,880
There was no button on it when you didn't lift it,

613
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,440
and when you went into that bathroom,

614
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,320
Who opened the door first?

615
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,160
I kicked the door,

616
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,600
but I wasn't the first one to go in.

617
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,440
Yeah, I just want to

618
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,560
be in someone else's mansion,

619
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,240
Every time Bai kicks the door,

620
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,000
Kick,

621
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,480
Cool,

622
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,200
Who will kick the door?

623
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,840
Kick it away.

624
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,120
Can you kick it?

625
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,640
Kick,

626
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,000
Kick it.

627
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,560
Kick it.

628
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,840
Brother,

629
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,960
doesn't Brother Bai usually open the door at home?

630
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,520
It's all kicking the door.

631
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,120
It's all kicking the door.

632
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,520
Their door depends on

633
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,680
kicking. You can kick it next time.

634
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,280
I'll kick it.

635
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,120
I'll kick it next time.

636
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,400
Yes.

637
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,120
I don't care if he's inside.

638
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,840
Because if I kick you,

639
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,560
you won't be easily

640
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,600
poisoned by gas.

641
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,720
Because when I kick it in,

642
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,120
basically,

643
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,320
We might be pissed off by you.

644
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,160
Yes.

645
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,200
You're the poison gas!

646
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,840
Who was the first to find out?

647
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,280
The housekeeper didn't come out in the toilet,

648
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,920
and no one found out,

649
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,320
No. He let out a cry.

650
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,920
He made a noise.

651
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,080
At that time, we ignored it.

652
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,480
Are you sure that the person who died

653
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,400
was indeed the housekeeper?

654
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,080
We were informed.

655
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,320
Of course, only the housekeeper

656
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,400
needs you to recognize He.

657
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,200
We don't even know him.

658
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,640
He seems to be giving us

659
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,440
a new way to play,

660
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,120
Actually, it really makes me think,

661
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,800
this apartment,

662
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
In fact, their staff

663
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,520
is very likely to be

664
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,120
a bunch of abnormal "murderers"

665
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,000
with problems

666
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,200
I think we're like

667
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,240
a group of people being tested,

668
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,120
After we came here,

669
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,920
we saw someone die.

670
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,120
Someone jumped off the building,

671
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,720
but they couldn't see it.

672
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,400
Yes.

673
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,120
And these paper clips in our apartment

674
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,840
are marked like this.

675
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,520
They're like an organization,

676
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,720
the world of Truman.

677
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,000
That's right.

678
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,880
I think this is a studio.

679
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,200
I suspect there are monitors everywhere.

680
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,880
He's looking at us.

681
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,320
I've always suspected that

682
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,880
even though we live here,

683
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,240
But people are watching us everywhere.

684
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,720
Don't be like this.

685
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,160
You two,

686
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,440
if you really suddenly start to

687
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,360
get into this situation,

688
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,400
I'm a little scared, you know?

689
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,000
I started to panic.

690
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,520
No.

691
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,080
No

692
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,840
When we were in my room,

693
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,280
we heard a woman crying,

694
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,880
Do you remember?

695
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,680
Why is there a woman crying?

696
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,800
I haven't answered many doubts.

697
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,960
Yeah, and my brother

698
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,440
said he heard it occasionally,

699
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,560
There's a girl crying.

700
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,360
Apartment 11

701
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,160
has always been weird.

702
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
I always hear women crying in the middle of the night.

703
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,560
And that cat,

704
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,760
yeah, Meow,

705
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,360
Why are you always at the crime scene?

706
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,440
He's not here today.

707
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,520
It's not allowed to enter the mansion today.

708
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,080
It's too dangerous.

709
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,840
If it were here today,

710
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,440
it would be dead, too.

711
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,840
There's poison gas,

712
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:30,960
Yes.

713
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,840
No, we're impulsive, too.

714
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,240
He kicked the door open and went in.

715
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,160
No, it's written.

716
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,040
The gas will dissipate in five seconds.

717
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,440
Let's not be so reckless next time.

718
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:38,920
It's all that kind of,

719
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,280
let's hurry up in the future,

720
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,520
When the door opens at the end of this episode,

721
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,360
they're all dead,

722
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,240
The end of the play.

723
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,760
"The murderer" thought,

724
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,040
"I didn't mean to" kill "these people,

725
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,320
I didn't mean to destroy the door.

726
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,160
What's going on?

727
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,440
The murderer said,

728
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,120
I just want to memorize one person's murder case.

729
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,320
But we have a clear idea today,

730
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,760
really?

731
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,120
Yes.

732
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,520
Clearly,

733
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,720
everyone is a murderer.

734
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,920
Just arrest them all.

735
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,560
In the end, you see Guo Baoyou.

736
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,800
That's awesome.

737
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,080
No. Then he'll be taken away.

738
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,040
How will he come in the next episode?

739
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,760
Didn't you hear that there's a new resident?

740
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
Everything is ready.

741
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,800
It's his last episode.

742
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,560
That's all I have.

743
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,360
Will the next episode be Di Sanxian?

744
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,680
Disanxian,

745
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,400
Guo Baoyou,

746
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,160
His brother is here.

747
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,840
The twins

748
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,360
go back to the pot.

749
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,720
But he's a southerner,

750
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,840
he's a southerner,

751
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,480
Stir-fried meat. Then

752
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,760
learn the pronunciation of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

753
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,800
Young man,

754
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,160
no matter what about literature and art,

755
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,280
He will be taken away eventually.

756
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,240
Because he killed someone.

757
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,840
Success?

758
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
Success.

759
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,520
His acting is a bit too good.

760
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,880
Yes, I just want to make money.

761
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,920
When are you going to

762
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,520
leave here.

763
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,480
Or just,

764
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,800
I want to earn enough money.

765
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,480
How much do you earn enough?

766
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,560
How much money do you think

767
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,880
you can be satisfied with?

768
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,080
Later on, he was a bit miserable,

769
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,400
and he acted too well.

770
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,040
In the end, he portrays himself

771
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,920
as a nobody,

772
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,880
He said that I just want to earn some money,

773
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,840
an ordinary person,

774
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,680
Want to make money?

775
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,480
One more question,

776
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,680
I think he is also

777
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,520
very likely,

778
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Because when he was a kid,

779
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,360
he killed him, didn't he?

780
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,320
Then he will feel very guilty.

781
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,160
That's why he feels even more guilty.

782
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,080
Because he doesn't have the money to help him.

783
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,240
When he was little, he spent 100 thousand yuan

784
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,640
to treat his mother.

785
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,200
Is it because

786
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,160
you can't get 100 thousand back?

787
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,520
I can't get it back from the housekeeper.

788
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,480
So he died.

789
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,240
I'm so depressed.

790
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,200
So he thought

791
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,640
it was the housekeeper who killed him when he was a kid,

792
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,760
I was really lucky to find out

793
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,600
the "real killer",

794
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,040
The most unlikely "murderer"

795
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,880
is the "murderer",

796
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,160
I think it's possible to be lucky.

797
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,600
So what do you think now?

798
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,080
Full staff again,

799
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,000
entire personnel

800
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,600
You're back

801
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,920
and all of you are suspected.

802
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,640
So everyone feels guilty

803
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,400
and has made mistakes.

804
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,320
Everyone is like this.

805
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,640
Actually, there are some secrets.

806
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,600
You haven't found it yet.

807
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,320
Lock Tencent Video,

808
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,880

809
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,080

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,800

811
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,040

812
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,160
night at 6: 00,

813
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,720
See Jiageng's Diary of Apartment 11.

814
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,400
In the middle of the week, there were a lot of short videos of the preview tidbits,

815
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,760
which were swiped every day,

816
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,120
Let me show you a 360-degree exploration of Apartment 11,

817
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,520
and open the Tencent video soon.

818
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,480
Search .

819
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,000
Immerse yourself with the bulldozers.
