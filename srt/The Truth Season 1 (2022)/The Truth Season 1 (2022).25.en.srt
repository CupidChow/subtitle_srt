1
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,520
I invited you all to do manual work today,

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,520
but what are you going to do?

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,840
Are you going to tear down my shop?

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:27,960
That's great.

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,680
Your handicraft shop is really good.

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,640
You can kill people at a glance.

7
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,360
I told you we could negotiate.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:34,840
What's wrong?

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,320
When we were

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,000
little-minded,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,280
He's been hit hard.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,320
Basically, the limbs are back-mounted.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,640
Both of them are sound.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,640
How can we earn money?

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,880
I can't believe you're talking about our pain.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,800
I'm poor, too.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,040
Where did you get your clothes?

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,800
You went to Columbia now.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Do you still need this money?

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
She's in the third brother's room,

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,400
can we let the audience feel it,

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,920
We're growing up,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,160
I feel like I'm in parallel time and space,

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,360
I've seen my own brain.

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,000
Am I right?

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,720
But I can't see it clearly.

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,240
It's blurry.

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,760
It's so vague.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,800
Don't follow the crowd.

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,560
I'm comparing myself.

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,920
I'll pay for a bowl of fried rice for you tonight,

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,480
and I'll pay for another bowl of instant rice for him.

33
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,720
Let me get you

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,560
some food.

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,240
I'm an idiot.

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,440
That's great.

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
This is my shop anyway.

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,360
And today I invited you all

39
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,120
to do manual work.

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,000
Sure.

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,840
Why are you

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,600
tearing down my shop.

43
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,880
Your shop is really

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,320
making things worse for a family

45
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,440
that is not rich.

46
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,720
cocoa

47
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,320
You came to

48
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,440
our 11th apartment to design this.

49
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,600
Or I've been following you before.

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,120
Of course it grew up with me,

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,680
didn't it?

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,360
You've gone too far.

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's separate it from the characters. Okay,

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,360
no.

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,440
How do you use it?

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,200
This is the one I made before.

57
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,440
This is so dangerous. Don't you think

58
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,360
you've done this before?

59
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,040
I haven't done it before.

60
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,760
I've seen this online. Yes.

61
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,000
This is the carpet.

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Look at it. Turn around.

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,560
You can turn it around.

64
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,800
What are you doing now?

65
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,440
you guys

66
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,160
"Psycho! "

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,680
Bai Song 1 Guo Zhou Liu 1 Cool,

68
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,680
in each of your names,

69
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,800
There's still one more stroke left.

70
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,360
One stroke short.

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,920
You can make up for it yourself.

72
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,600
You can hit the carpet yourself.

73
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,200
But before,

74
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
I just didn't expect

75
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,240
that being cool would be a crime,

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,600
Paint it off

77
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,200
or my brother,

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,040
Draw a fork directly.

79
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,920
A straight fork.

80
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,280
If you draw a fork like this,

81
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,440
just ask Mimi to take it away.

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:23,960
If you scratch it,

83
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,640
isn't it Miaomiao?

84
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,280
Meow,

85
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,160
meow, scratch it.

86
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,880
Then we have to

87
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,440
change the slogan.

88
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,840
Change the slogan Why?

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,640
After all, it's a new person.

90
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Well, when you go in,

91
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,800
think about the smart star

92
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,480
Bai Song 1 Guo Kuzhou,

93
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,640
Liu Le,

94
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,240
there's one that's a little cooler, right?

95
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,760
This is a bit confusing.

96
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,400
How about this?

97
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,200
Bai Song 1 Guo Zhou

98
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,160
came down and found it bitter,

99
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,080
What a

100
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,720
long name.

101
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,360
I'm coming down.

102
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,480
Bai Song 1 Guo Liu 1 Ke,

103
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,760
what is Liu 1 Ke?

104
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,320
Liu's first major means that

105
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,880
one major will be retained if he misses the grade.

106
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,360
I just failed one subject.

107
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,280
That's even worse. No,

108
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,800
it's a carpet, right?

109
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,520
Yes, that's fine. We'll be

110
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,240
trampled under our feet when we're done.

111
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,400
It can also be used as a tapestry. If you take it off,

112
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,920
you can use it as a tapestry

113
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,360
and then hang it up after stepping on it.

114
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,360
You … Are you the "murderer"? Why do you keep breaking up the stage

115
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,840
today?

116
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,800
Look at you,

117
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,560
you're already biting me.

118
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,240
How do you know what's going to happen today?

119
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,760
I admit it.

120
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,640
Because of today's "murder case. "

121
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
We made it together.

122
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,560
You know that, right?

123
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,200
Just vote.

124
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,240
It's not plugged in.

125
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,720
Plug,

126
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
There's electricity.

127
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,080
Plug in the red one.

128
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,160
Oh no, I'm stalling for time.

129
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,960
Really? Do you have a stomachache?

130
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,120
Later, the elevator fell down again.

131
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,280
My stomach is upset. Wait for me.

132
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,240
That's great.

133
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,960
Your handicraft shop is really good.

134
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,560
This machine is a good one.

135
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
It can kill people at a glance.

136
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,000
All right.

137
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,880
That's great.

138
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,240
Where can I change into Gothic clothes?

139
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
B105

140
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:24,920
Underground. Let's go.

141
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,000
B105 is here.

142
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,760
Hello,

143
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,120
welcome

144
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,640
to your place. Business is bad.

145
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,400
I haven't seen this for a long time.

146
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Why is the business so bad?

147
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,960
I don't get it.

148
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,240
I got it.

149
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Brother, you have a gift for catching dolls.

150
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,120
What do you think?

151
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,640
Is it possible that

152
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,920
the machine is not twisted too tightly,

153
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,960
No.

154
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,240
What are you doing?

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,720
Picking dolls,

156
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,560
okay?

157
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
It's a little off. Try it again.

158
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,720
To the left. I think

159
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,440
it's okay. Is it that good?

160
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,040
Is he that good?

161
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,520
Did you catch it?

162
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,040
Really?

163
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,080
I caught him again.

164
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,080
Let me do it.

165
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,440
I'll give it a try.

166
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,880
Come on.

167
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,200
Why was it so close?

168
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,760
It should work this time.

169
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,400
He'll be out soon. I think so,

170
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,800
right?

171
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,760
Am I right?

172
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,560
I want to give it a try.

173
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
I missed.

174
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:50,960
You do it.

175
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,840
Are you under so much pressure lately?

176
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,440
Nephew,

177
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,160
is the kid

178
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
already under so much pressure?

179
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,880
I can do this.

180
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,559
What song?

181
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,360
I don't know.

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,480
Then what are you doing?

183
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,440
Wrong

184
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,240
Zhou Shen doesn't have a good sense

185
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,360
of rhythm. I'm not Zhou Shen.

186
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,920
Mengmeng.

187
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,720
Amazing.

188
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,000
All right. Come on.

189
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,160
Boss,

190
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,120
I have two dolls,

191
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,000
Can you get changed?

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,520
These two dolls,

193
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,320
you grab three dolls,

194
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,480
Let me change a suit for you.

195
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,320
Brother,

196
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,160
Forget it. It's too easy

197
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,760
to catch the doll after thinking about it.

198
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,720
No, I still have to dance. I'll dance,

199
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,800
but if I take one,

200
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Because my brain hasn't been working well since I was a kid,

201
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,760
and my limbs haven't been coordinated.

202
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,920
If I jump and score points,

203
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,120
then I'll catch three dolls.

204
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,400
Can you just change my clothes?

205
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,200
If you're really bad at dancing,

206
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,360
I'll give you an A, okay?

207
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,880
I don't think I can do it.

208
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,680
I told you we could negotiate.

209
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,640
What's wrong?

210
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,160
Later,

211
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,720
we can negotiate,

212
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,760
We are our brains

213
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,280
since we were little,

214
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,240
When I was little,

215
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,560
I was badly hurt.

216
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,240
Basically, the limbs are back-mounted.

217
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,960
Both of them are sound.

218
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,800
It has nothing to do with that.

219
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,960
Don't talk.

220
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,080
It has nothing to do with that.

221
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,400
No,

222
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,760
and then if we jump to B,

223
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,920
And then three dolls.

224
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,560
Can you give each of us

225
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,360
a suit of clothes?

226
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,480
In this way,

227
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,960
as long as one person jumps to S,

228
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,400
I'll give you six sets of clothes,

229
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,160
okay?

230
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,720
Come on.

231
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,680
Brother Ku,

232
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,160
come on!

233
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Why is it a girl group dance?

234
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,320
What's wrong with the woman next to me?

235
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,960
You dance like Liu Genghong.

236
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:50,960
Hurry up!

237
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,880
I'm your little sister.

238
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,040
It consumes 3. 1 kcal. Don't use

239
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,880
dolls anymore, okay?

240
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,640
No more dolls.

241
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,800
No more dolls.

242
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
As for the three of us,

243
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,360
we can change directly

244
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,280
in the dressing room of my shop.

245
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,560
Okay,

246
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:51,920
Okay,

247
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,200
Okay.

248
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,680
Come on, let's eat first.

249
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,440
Let's eat

250
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,520
Are you hungry at this hour?

251
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,240
Come and eat.

252
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,080
I'm hungry.

253
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,480
Let's eat.

254
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,240
Let's take a look. Today,

255
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,160
please swipe your card.

256
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,040
swipe one's card

257
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,120
The deal failed.

258
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,080
Cary is only 42 years old,

259
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,160
There's only 42 yuan left.

260
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,520
Come on, look, I have

261
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:20,960
100,

262
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,520
one hundred

263
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,160
Credit card deduction fee, please swipe your card.

264
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,320
This time, the consumption is 58 yuan.

265
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,720
She got 42 when she brushed

266
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,480
58 and 42 when she brushed it.

267
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,920
You can lend him 16 yuan.

268
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,480
Can you help me spread it out?

269
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,760
Give me back 160 in reality,

270
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,640
Okay,

271
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,320
Come on

272
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,600
Remember to give you

273
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,280
160. Do you have a card?

274
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,200
I don't have a card.

275
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,840
Come on. I'll treat you to dinner.

276
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,200
Okay,

277
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay,

278
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,640
I didn't take my bag.

279
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,640
Meal card?

280
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,240
Do you have a card?

281
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,680
You still need money

282
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,800
to eat. How do you earn money?

283
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,640
It's our money.

284
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,040
My brother

285
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,200
didn't treat you to dinner.

286
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,440
Let me see. How much is it?

287
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,480
I'll pay 100 yuan.

288
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,280
Give this to me.

289
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,640
Do you have a card?

290
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,360
There should be.

291
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,800
How much is it?

292
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,720
I'm 100 yuan,

293
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,560
too. Let's raise some money, right?

294
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,200
Brush 58 first.

295
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,640
Okay,

296
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,400
This brush is forty,

297
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,720
Come on,

298
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,600
80, right?

299
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,840
No,

300
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,600
swipe two cards,

301
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,240
Yeah, two cards,

302
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,200
40 for this one and 18 for this one,

303
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,640
Okay,

304
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,440
All right. You can eat.

305
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,280
That's how we help each other every day.

306
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,600
How do you earn money?

307
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,040
Right?

308
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,800
We don't even know, anyway,

309
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,000
every time we brush it, we get rich,

310
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,240
I can't believe you're talking about our pain.

311
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,280
We live in this apartment,

312
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,640
and we don't even have a chance to make money.

313
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,200
No source of income,

314
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,000
no source of income,

315
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,960
You lose every day.

316
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,200
There are still a few who haven't brushed it yet.

317
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,880
I didn't brush it.

318
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,600
It's also 100 cards

319
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,320
without deduction.

320
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,960
Please swipe your card.

321
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,720
For this consumption,

322
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,400
Also,

323
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:01,960
lend it to me.

324
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,680
Okay. Use this

325
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,240
to brush 40 for me.

326
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,600
If you brush 40, then 18 will be left.

327
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,120
If you brush this,

328
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,480
then 18,

329
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,640
I grew up eating hundreds of meals.

330
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,120
You eat a hundred meals seriously,

331
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,840
Okay,

332
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,760
I'm full. Today,

333
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,280
take it.

334
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,920
You really had a good meal today,

335
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,560
an old fan of the sea king,

336
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,440
Fragrant pork,

337
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,400
stewed chicken with ginger,

338
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,160
Fried ear tip with dried wax incense,

339
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,680
today's dishes are also hard dishes.

340
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,920
You don't eat rice?

341
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,800
You want to roll "Die" for me

342
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,120
It's really strange to come out to eat in this dress,

343
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,240
and the earl in the castle has to eat too.

344
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,120
That's what you mean, right?

345
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,080
Even the earl in the castle has to eat lunch boxes.

346
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
He's also a cook,

347
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
an earl in an old castle,

348
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,840
It's also about cooking

349
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,960
and getting a buffet plate.

350
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,640
I'll cook first. I'll eat first

351
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,840
as a toast.

352
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,640
Bai is always the one

353
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,960
who eats the most actively,

354
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,120
Let's go after eating.

355
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,560
Search

356
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,120
Vote for "murderer",

357
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,800
who is also the most active one.

358
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,080
Now I know

359
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,840
who the murderer is.

360
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,440
You know it again?

361
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,400
You know it again.

362
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,120
Let's vote.

363
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,640
You can leave after you vote.

364
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,200
Really?

365
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,720
-You can go first. -Okay,

366
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,080
okay,

367
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,280
Don't push him.

368
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,760
He can really walk?

369
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,200
He can really walk?

370
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,920
He's really capable.

371
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,600
When she said we were all dolls,

372
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,000
I thought,

373
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,280
I think it's very possible.

374
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't think it's possible.

375
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
Yeah, actually, it's very possible

376
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,360
for her,

377
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,920
I'm sure you can explain it.

378
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,760
The doll she said is in quotation marks.

379
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,640
We are manipulated,

380
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,280
Yes.

381
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,000
The walking dead are human beings,

382
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,640
we are manipulated

383
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,680
without our consciousness,

384
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,120
You're just like me,

385
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,000
dolls,

386
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,920
I see.

387
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,520
She's expounding on a social phenomenon,

388
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,520
we're all a bunch of people

389
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,320
who follow the rules,

390
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,880
Like a soulless doll.

391
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,200
Is that what you mean?

392
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,560
Either you are dolls

393
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,040
or dolls,

394
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
We are dolls,

395
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,240
including why do we live here?

396
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,920
Because we're orphans.

397
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,040
Yes, because everyone is an orphan.

398
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,600
Even if we die,

399
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,440
no one cares, right?

400
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,120
But now we

401
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,880
care about each other,

402
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,080
We care about each other,

403
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,560
we care about each other,

404
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,800
We still have our bulldozers?

405
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,560
You care about us,

406
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,000
that's right,

407
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,560
You.

408
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,920
Amazing.

409
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,000
Thank you, Bulldozers.

410
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,040
Support for us.

411
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,840
Up to now,

412
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,000
in fact, we don't have any evidence

413
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,880
to prove that a dead person,

414
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,960
It's just a doll. Isn't there

415
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,360
something painted on his face?

416
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,720
Yes.

417
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,440
Yeah, we can't prove it at all.

418
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,040
You'll see it soon.

419
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,560
Yes.

420
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
There is a possibility

421
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,960
that the "dead" person,

422
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,040
He's just a doll man.

423
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,880
No, it's crucial.

424
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,080
The love on his feet,

425
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,080
That might confirm,

426
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,840
who is he?

427
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,200
Yes.

428
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,200
The one that will confirm

429
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,720
his identity.

430
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,160
When you're with him,

431
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,680
you don't know the love on your feet.

432
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't know.

433
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,240
Why don't you know?

434
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
Aren't you already living together?

435
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,960
He's your boyfriend.

436
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,280
I don't think his feet are normal.

437
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,640
He usually wears socks

438
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,560
when he's with you. He's cold,

439
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,359
He always said that

440
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,319
he was afraid of catching a cold on his feet.

441
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,079
I'm afraid of catching a cold.

442
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,120
Are we in the exhibition hall?

443
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,840
There's one more box. The password box

444
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,720
hasn't been opened.

445
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,920
Is there a password box

446
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,760
on the doll rack under the doll rack?

447
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,840
The doctor who was the first to come in

448
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,360
got it under his doll.

449
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,800
Yes.

450
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,160
Under the doctor,

451
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,320
we haven't been to Assistant Yang yet,

452
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,360
Where is Assistant Yang's office?

453
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,520
Where is Assistant Yang's room?

454
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,040
I think he's in the Life Doll Hall,

455
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,440
isn't he an assistant here?

456
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,600
Then it should be over there.

457
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,480
I think I found a space just now.

458
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,840
I didn't open it.

459
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
It's in that hall,

460
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,840
you mean the one in the corner?

461
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,360
I forgot that there's a door somewhere.

462
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,000
Not in the corner.

463
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,840
We didn't come in.

464
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,280
No,

465
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,640
my friends,

466
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,120
And I found a problem,

467
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,760
their clothes

468
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,160
don't seem to come from the same source as ours.

469
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,280
We got the clothes for dancing "S".

470
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,120
But Nanny Zhao said

471
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,040
she bought it,

472
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,240
It doesn't matter.

473
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,800
No problem. This one is fine.

474
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,000
It's because we don't have money.

475
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,120
That's why I have to go dancing.

476
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,240
We are dancers.

477
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,440
Is this such an explicit reason?

478
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
Where did you get your clothes?

479
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,440
It's not that

480
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,160
it's so obvious

481
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,680
every time she thinks about it,

482
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,840
It's like,

483
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,800
I'm really thinking,

484
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,240
I feel like I'm going to be killed.

485
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,120
No,

486
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
it doesn't matter where she got her clothes,

487
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,360
Yeah, I'm poor, too.

488
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,120
Where did you get your clothes?

489
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,400
With our own efforts,

490
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,640
you went to Columbia University.

491
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,560
Do you still need this money?

492
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
-She's at Hua Hua Hua. -Hua

493
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,200
Hua,

494
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,880
Brother Ge Lun,

495
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,880
why do you always make up "Peach in Hu Jia"

496
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,120
I really didn't see it when I was a kid.

497
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,040
"Peach in Hu" This one,

498
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,400
"Nutcracker"

499
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,320
It's the Nutcracker.

500
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,760
"Nutcracker Box"

501
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,560
or "Nutcracker".

502
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,360
Clip?

503
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,880
Clip.

504
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,520
We've been working on that mirror.

505
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,680
Well,

506
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,120
you've almost restored

507
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,480
the method of "killing people".

508
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,560
It's almost restored.

509
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,040
No.

510
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,560
We only restore how he hid the body.

511
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,360
How can I kill him

512
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,080
without restoration? He was strangled, right?

513
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
Even if we are not sure,

514
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,000
how did the "dead"

515
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,520
hand get it?

516
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,120
I'm not sure.

517
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,200
I don't think that person is human.

518
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,040
It's possible, right?

519
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,440
Not necessarily human.

520
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,240
It's just a doll.

521
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,920
Isn't it a touching doll?

522
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,960
Otherwise, why would he say that?

523
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,960
Pretend to make yourself disappear.

524
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,920
Yes.

525
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,720
Let's break it again.

526
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,760
What are you breaking?

527
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,080
Yes.

528
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,160
Why are you facing a doll?

529
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,080
You've been studying there for a long time.

530
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,600
Yes.

531
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,760
Maybe we'll go to see Assistant Yang later.

532
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,440
Assistant Yang died in his office.

533
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,080
Maybe

534
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,520
I'm full.

535
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,640
I don't know why,

536
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,920
but who did I suddenly think of just now?

537
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,480
Agent Xu,

538
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,240
for what?

539
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,080
What pure K?

540
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,960
Not that one.

541
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,120
It's tight,

542
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
So tight,

543
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:30,920
So close

544
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,360
It's so tight. He said it's so tight.

545
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,000
It doesn't make sense. I think of him.

546
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,840
I don't know why, just now,

547
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,880
in the dark,

548
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,000
He was crushed by three bowls at the throat of his fate.

549
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,680
There he is.

550
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,480
So tight

551
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,040
That's not true. He's

552
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,640
so tight,

553
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,840
Then he sprayed hot air on everyone,

554
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,160
why is he still angry?

555
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,880
He's always angry,

556
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,960
so it's hard to be sprayed with hot air by one person.

557
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,800
He's been,

558
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,640
Yes.

559
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,000
I just.

560
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,640
I've been hiding.

561
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,320
Was he trying to scare us?

562
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,720
He was trying to scare us.

563
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,680
You caught me.

564
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,600
What a good nephew.

565
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,520
Here we go again.

566
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,040
In that case,

567
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,560
Zhou Ke and I are in the same generation,

568
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,000
Am I right?

569
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,960
I'm much taller than you. No,

570
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,920
we're in the same generation.

571
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,160
We can be

572
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,640
the uncles and aunts you want to call.

573
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,280
In that case,

574
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,880
Bai Sanwan is the youngest,

575
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,560
He's young in the clan,

576
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,640
not necessarily young.

577
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,840
He's Song Meili's brother.

578
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
I didn't say that.

579
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,040
He's been my brother since last week.

580
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,960
Okay, so is your brother.

581
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,080
Anyway, you two are of the same generation, right?

582
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,280
You're still young.

583
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,800
Is there any way to play?

584
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,360
after all

585
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,400
If you keep doing this,

586
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,760
I'll go up and "kill" Assistant Yang,

587
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,280
You're going to "kill" Assistant Yang now,

588
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,640
right?

589
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,080
Kill one.

590
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,920
I don't care about the second one.

591
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,320
Do you think I'm Ke Wuku?

592
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,520
My brother told me before he left,

593
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,920
that he really likes this reasoning group,

594
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,760
This apartment?

595
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,200
Yes.

596
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,040
And then "kill people"?

597
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,480
Yes. So I'm sorry.

598
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,760
Although you didn't find the real murderer,

599
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
he also turned himself in.

600
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,200
It's a great honor for everyone.

601
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,080
You even mocked me.

602
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,760
Can you figure it out every time?

603
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,040
You're mocking us too.

604
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,160
No, I'm really asking.

605
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,960
If you keep being so rude,

606
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,480
I'm thinking of inviting my mom here

607
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,200
to have everything come down.

608
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,040
This is a "punishment" I'm telling you,

609
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,600
Mom is her shackle.

610
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,080
I really want to ask,

611
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,040
are you doing the right thing every time?

612
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,480
The odds are that

613
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,800
we pushed it right or wrong,

614
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,520
Generally,

615
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,880
the correct rate can reach 30%.

616
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,720
Is it that low?

617
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,960
Or what?

618
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,560
What's our winning rate? It's 40, right?

619
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,360
It's so high.

620
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,520
It's 10% higher.

621
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,880
How do you feel this time?

622
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,080
Do you think you can guess correctly?

623
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,400
You can do it, right?

624
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,840
So far in this episode,

625
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
who do you think is the most like the "killer"?

626
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,400
You haven't come out yet, have you?

627
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,240
Look, she knows the truth,

628
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,520
she said she hasn't come out yet,

629
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
Why do you think

630
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,360
you're coming out right now.

631
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,360
There's Master Yang

632
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,200
behind it. It's Director Yang.

633
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,920
Assistant Yang,

634
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,800
the more you say it, the more you look like it.

635
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,440
Director Yang,

636
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,600
we will follow the lead in the future.

637
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,520
Assistant Yang,

638
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,160
Assistant Yang and some others,

639
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,720
Actually, what she said makes sense.

640
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,520
I can't believe she persuaded us.

641
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Song Meili, stop biting your hand.

642
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,600
Don't be nervous.

643
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,360
It's you.

644
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,520
She never bites her nails.

645
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,960
How do you know I never bite my nails.

646
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,800
We've never seen you

647
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,200
bite your nails before.

648
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,120
Yes.

649
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,480
Did you pay so much attention to me before?

650
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,320
I don't think your brother has seen it.

651
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,360
Yes.

652
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,720
I heard from my brother that it's right.

653
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,160
Song Meili

654
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,400
doesn't like to bite her nails.

655
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,000
Before he left,

656
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,800
your brother told you every day,

657
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,640
About Song Meili,

658
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,760
what about your brother?

659
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,200
Your brother pays a lot of attention to her.

660
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,240
If there's something wrong with your brother,

661
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,200
have you decided on your new group name?

662
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,480
Orphan 101,

663
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,400
Orphan 101,

664
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,200
Really?

665
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,280
Orphanage 11,

666
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,480
welfare home 11,

667
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,600
all the misfortunes for me,

668
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
It all started with orphans.

669
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,160
Yes.

670
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,160
Yes, you are.

671
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,200
Or it's just

672
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,360
a test.

673
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,120
Examination-oriented education,

674
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,680
I'm an orphan from the past,

675
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,360
Guys, I'll give you

676
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,360
five more minutes to eat,

677
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,360
Why are you in such a hurry?

678
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,480
Why are you eating so fast?

679
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,200
From now on, when he comes in to fetch food,

680
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,760
we can't let him be the first to fetch it.

681
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,480
He ate so little,

682
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,440
and every time he felt,

683
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,000
He has a lot of money.

684
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,880
He ate rice today.

685
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,000
I was staring

686
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,600
at it. I ate it.

687
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
What are you doing? Are you Rice Police?

688
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,360
Since there are more than three people eating rice,

689
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,160
I can eat it.

690
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,200
Do you remember what Ms Ma said?

691
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,280
Don't follow the crowd.

692
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,040
I'm comparing myself.

693
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,680
I'll pay for a bowl of fried rice for you tonight,

694
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,480
and I'll pay for another bowl of instant rice for him.

695
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,960
Sure,

696
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,840
I'll get you some food,

697
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,680
Come and fetch some food.

698
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,400
That's enough.

699
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,000
Brother Liu didn't even eat,

700
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,840
Brother Liu didn't have enough,

701
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,920
Brother Liu, you can't go hungry.

702
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,400
Come on,

703
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,200
Brother Liu, you can't go hungry.

704
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,680
Bring me the rice cooker.

705
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,960
I'm an idiot.

706
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,240
I'll have some corn.

707
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,760
Did you notice that?

708
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,960
We only get the best

709
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,520
when we're not reasoning,

710
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,400
When you ask a question,

711
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,280
the modus operandi is,

712
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,320
The modus operandi is ingenious.

713
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,680
In the process of committing the crime,

714
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,040
he used a clever technique,

715
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,840
Where on earth is this mirror?

716
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,680
Is there anything else you want to ask?

717
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,960
You should explain it yourself.

718
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,360
What's your timeline?

719
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,200
What were you doing before eleven o'clock?

720
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,640
be at home

721
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,840
That's right.

722
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,000
You're right and reasonable.

723
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,920
You're pushing me.

724
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,440
It's him,

725
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,200
it's me,

726
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,120
Can we let the audience feel that

727
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,640
we are the kind of growth type,

728
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
The first episode can be silly,

729
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,960
we have to be more and more powerful.

730
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,000
You can be a little more silly in the second period,

731
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,320
and a little more clear in the third period, right?

732
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,920
We're counting on you in this episode Zhao Bu

733
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,760
What are you counting on me for?

734
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,600
We need you to help us turn the tide.

735
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,000
Find that kind of crucial evidence.

736
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,240
We're adults now.

737
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,280
What's in your head?

738
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,080
Didn't you count?

739
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,040
I seem to have seen my own brain

740
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,240
in parallel time and space.

741
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,880
Am I right?

742
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,600
But I can't see it clearly.

743
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,120
It's blurry.

744
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,640
It's so vague.

745
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,400
It's too small.

746
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,600
Really,

747
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,320
your head is too small.

748
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:11,840
It's too small.

749
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,520
Vaguely,

750
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,040
It's so vague.

751
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,640
Where do we want to go later?

752
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,600
Assistant Yang's office,

753
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,040
we have to find his office

754
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,520
in that doll shop first, right?

755
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,240
Parallel time and space,

756
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:24,960
Okay,

757
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,480
Hold on.

758
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,920
-I didn't say anything. -I didn't say anything.

759
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,840
You're about to tell me.

760
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,360
No,

761
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
don't stop treating us to dinner tonight.

762
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,160
Keep pushing it in there.

763
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,080
We talked in the group,

764
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,000
I said who was the last to arrive at the scene,

765
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,760
Who will treat you to dinner?

766
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
Because he was the last to arrive yesterday.

767
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,920
That's right,

768
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,320
Yes

769
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,800
Let's have dinner together.

770
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,040
Do you have time?

771
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,560
Okay,

772
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,360
Okay, let's go together.

773
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,240
Okay, then you spend money,

774
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,000
because you're the last one to get there,

775
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,640
If you spend money,

776
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,360
the person will come here for one day.

777
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,040
How could you do this?

778
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,240
You only came for one day and you didn't let her invite you.

779
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,240
I'm a doll. I should go back.

780
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,920
It's time for me to stand in the closet. Now

781
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,280
I'll hit you and sing that song,

782
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,680
Press

783
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,000
A father who has to be strong all his life,

784
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,520
why is his doll,

785
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,600
He's singing this song.

786
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,200
He's looking for Dad,

787
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,800
Yes.

788
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,920
I'm looking for my mom.

789
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,640
Didn't you have a kid

790
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,280
who listened to folk songs before?

791
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
Shan Ge,

792
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:16,960
you mean that?

793
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,480
No.

794
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,200
Can you sleep?

795
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,840
Mom,

796
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,280
go to sleep,

797
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,800
It's time for you to sleep.

798
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,160
I threw it in the mountain.

799
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,000
I can't find you. If Lao Bai

800
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,920
is singing on this mountain

801
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,280
in the northwest,

802
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,200
Like Po,

803
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,960
wearing a scarf,

804
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,040
Shan Dandan,

805
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,960
my child,

806
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,000
When I was sleeping,

807
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,560
something suddenly occurred to me,

808
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,640
Now you remember something.

809
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,720
It suddenly occurred to me that

810
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,880
all the music I heard today,

811
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,840
Are they all children's songs?

812
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,680
-It's not yours. -It's not yours. -It's

813
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,760
not

814
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,440
his song. Wrong,

815
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,040
wrong,

816
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,560
wrong,

817
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,520
It's my fault.

818
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:57,840
No,

819
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,520
I mean the background music we heard,

820
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,480
When will we hear it today?

821
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,680
Background music,

822
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,440
,

823
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,040
Right?

824
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,960
, throw away

825
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,480
the handkerchief,

826
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,440
Yes.

827
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,440
What else?

828
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:10,920
It's gone.

829
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,800
You are a beam of light in the night,

830
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,440
night,

831
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,640
Night,

832
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,640
doll

833
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,840
It might be a little bit to the other side.

834
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,560
It's just a child's interest. Do you have to

835
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
explain it

836
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,280
rationally like this?

837
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,680
Why don't we go to the scene to search,

838
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,520
and find out what evidence we have?

839
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,960
Okay,

840
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,520
Let's go.

841
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,920
I'm leaving.

842
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,880
Now that our program is finished,

843
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,120
let's start a talk show

844
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,400
with eight people.

845
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,040
Nothing.

846
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,560
Sit down and talk.

847
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,120
Just sit and talk.

848
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
I'm telling you,

849
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,000
you don't have to do anything.

850
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,640
Isn't our show

851
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,840
a talk show?

852
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,800
It's just a talk show.

853
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
This is a talk show, right?

854
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,640
There's a door here,

855
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,320
and you can't afford to pay for it

856
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,360
if you kick the house again.

857
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,720
Don't kick in the door again, okay?

858
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,320
Am I right?

859
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,720
Lock Tencent Video,

860
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,400

night at 6: 00,

865
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,000
See Jiageng's Diary of Apartment 11.

866
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,680
In the middle of the week, there were a lot of short videos of the preview tidbits,

867
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,040
which were swiped every day,

868
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,400
Let me show you a 360-degree exploration of Apartment 11,

869
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,800
and open the Tencent video soon.

870
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,760
Search .

871
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,280
Immerse yourself with the bulldozers.
