1
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,520
Over the past six weeks,

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,040
six players were drawn into six cases,

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,280
gradually uncovering their own backgrounds.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,640
Now, the main story officially begins.

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,800
All storylines intertwine and merge,

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,040
as the truth is peeled back layer by layer.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,200
The many mysteries of Apartment No. 11

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,800
will also be revealed one by one.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,160
The deduction team will face the challenge of an extended case,

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,000
with escalating difficulty.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,520
Subsequent cases are intricately linked,

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,840
and their choices

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,520
will determine the story's final outcome.

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,520
I am Bai Sanwan

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,080
the "Bai Song 1 Guo Zhou, Liu 1 Ku"

16
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,120
group's big brother

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,600
moved into Apartment 11

18
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,000
It was truly a magical experience

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,080
May 6, 2022

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,600
Bai Song 1 Guo Zhou, Liu 1 Ku

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,760
met here

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,320
The Bai Song 1 Guo Zhou group

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,040
was formed

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,840
Liu 1 Ku

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,160
But at that time, we never expected

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,720
that in this apartment

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,960
we would continuously encounter

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,360
bizarre events

29
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,440
and intricate cases

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,280
Let's recap our first case.

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,920
Who was involved again?

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,680
Zhenzhen "died".

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,160
Who were the suspects again?

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,880
Bai Sanwan.

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,640
Guo Baoyou.

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,360
Teng Zhongjie.

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,400
Song Bianju.

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,120
Cao Yangguang.

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,560
What about the second case?

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,280
Song Huo "died".

41
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,920
Suspects:

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,680
Fake Fang Xiaomei.

43
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,120
Hao Baojie.

44
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,280
And including me.

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,120
And the real Fang Xiaomei.

46
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,000
Plus a stand-in.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,560
Zhang the stand-in.

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,400
Third case:

49
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,639
The butler "died".

50
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,440
Ju Xiangying.

51
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,520
Suspects:

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,400
Ju Chenggong, Mrs. Ju.

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
And Ju Xingyun.

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,280
Ju Wenyi.

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,000
Ju Yangsheng.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,160
Guo Baoyou.

57
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,320
What about the fourth case?

58
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,960
The "victim" was

59
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,880
Deputy Manager Fu.

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,000
Suspects:

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,600
Xu Zhongjie.

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,440
Hao Baojie.

63
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,480
Deputy Manager Shen.

64
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,240
Boss Fei.

65
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,480
And our previous good friend

66
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,240
Ke Wuku.

67
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,120
Then the fifth case:

68
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,320
The "victim" was Old Wang.

69
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,080
Little Wang.

70
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,680
Suspects:

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,440
Sister Cai.

72
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,480
Uncle Li.

73
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
Uncle Zeng.

74
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,040
Sister Hua.

75
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,440
Zhou Keke also had a "motive".

76
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,440
Then the sixth case:

77
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,520
The "victim" was Assistant Yang.

78
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,800
Suspect

79
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,560
Lai Wan'ou

80
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,360
Song Piaoliang

81
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
Singer Zhang, Mother Zhao

82
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,080
Zhao Budao

83
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,360
On the 71st day of living in the apartment,

84
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,320
July 15, 2022,

85
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,080
we learned an

86
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,480
unbelievable truth.

87
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,440
We also encountered

88
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,840
the most bizarre case since moving in.

89
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,560
For over 40 consecutive hours,

90
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,800
it became the longest two days

91
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,480
the detective team had ever experienced.

92
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,600
These two days began

93
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,760
when everyone gathered at Zhou Keke's place,

94
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,880
waiting for a sunrise

95
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,800
that never came.

96
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,640
Everyone, come to my room at 5 AM to watch the sunrise together.

97
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,040
I'm so happy!

98
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,400
I've recently written

99
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,560
a new novel

100
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,720
and would like to share it with everyone.

101
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,440
It's called "The Eternal Strange Tales."

102
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,680
Great, thank you.

103
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,040
Why does it sound like a ghost story?

104
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,520
Yes.

105
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,120
Don't open it here.

106
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,560
Is that not allowed?

107
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:35,760
Is it not okay?

108
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,560
If you open it here, you'll see that all the pages are

109
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,080
blank.

110
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,840
Only when I return to my own room

111
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,760
hide under the covers

112
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,360
and when no one is around can I watch it

113
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,480
Right, it can only be watched when no one's around

114
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,440
When someone's present, it will

115
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,920
because mine is anti-peeping

116
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,600
Mine has anti-peeping features

117
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,000
"Immortal's Strange Tales"

118
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,160
The first

119
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,280
costume murder mystery novel

120
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,600
Sure

121
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,760
We're at the apartment

122
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,840
There are still many, many unexplained issues

123
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,600
So my ex-boyfriend

124
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,080
can really foresee the future?

125
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,200
You should know that

126
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,079
You're the one who should know

127
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,560
How would I know what he said

128
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,480
How should I know

129
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,720
That "Yuzumi" organization

130
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,280
And that's my father

131
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,920
Your grandfather

132
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,360
My father, your grandfather

133
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,160
He said there's a "Yuzumi" organization

134
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,760
That's why we

135
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,800
know so many people

136
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
or rather some relatives

137
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,840
And who did your father know again?

138
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,400
My father knew Gu Yangsheng

139
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,640
They all knew Gu Yangsheng

140
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,800
So why would our relatives be in

141
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,000
that "Yuzumi" organization

142
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,280
That "Yuzumi" organization

143
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,400
what kind of organization is it really?

144
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,480
Why is it only the six of us

145
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,200
can see the woman in red jumping?

146
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,200
Why can dolls predict the future?

147
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,720
I have the ability to predict the future.

148
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,280
Why does the wall...

149
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,680
...have a woman's crying sound coming from it?

150
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,520
I always hear a woman crying at midnight.

151
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,160
Why do so many people mention...

152
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,840
...their most important person jumping off a building?

153
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,760
I never thought you, who was once so important to me...

154
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,160
...would end your life by jumping off a building.

155
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,320
The most important you left me forever.

156
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,800
I experienced my dearest one jumping off a building.

157
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,360
What were you thinking at that moment you jumped?

158
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,520
When the most important person jumped off...

159
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,240
I didn't see it.

160
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,520
Two months later, you committed suicide.

161
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,960
But you...

162
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,320
...didn't want to tell us anything.

163
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,840
I can't say this.

164
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,480
I can only say it was someone very close.

165
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,400
It's inconvenient.

166
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,320
I think that has...

167
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,760
...nothing to do with this. I don't want to talk about it.

168
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,000
Why is that mysterious symbol...

169
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,040
...closely tied to the detective group's life and death?

170
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
You all...

171
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,320
...will...

172
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
...die.

173
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
What exactly is...

174
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,160
...the reason for all this?

175
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,960
But what happened next...

176
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,880
...left us no time to think about all this.

177
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,520
While we wait for sunrise, I called...

178
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,280
...and I also want to show everyone...

179
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
...some new chocolate flavors I developed.

180
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,120
Some are fart-flavored, I remember, right?

181
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,600
Fart-flavored is okay.

182
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,880
You eat this one.

183
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,000
No, you eat this one.

184
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,200
I got a toothpaste-flavored one.

185
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,800
I just ate something with a really strange taste

186
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
I just ate something with a really strange taste

187
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,960
Fart flavor?

188
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,600
The one I just ate was also a bit spicy

189
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,080
Spicy

190
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,520
Yeah

191
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,000
A bit spicy

192
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,960
Could it be my recipe

193
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,280
Has developed some new (issues)

194
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,440
That's definitely problematic

195
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,920
I think Zhou Keke's chocolate

196
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,600
Friends

197
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,440
What's up?

198
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,680
You can really pair chocolate with this

199
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,160
Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring Tea

200
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,280
Just drink these two together

201
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,360
Because you know what?

202
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,880
Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring Tea

203
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,160
Contains super delicious premium fresh milk

204
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,200
With a light tea aroma

205
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,080
And real fruit pieces you can chew

206
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,240
When tea aroma meets fruit pieces

207
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,720
The milk becomes even more delicious

208
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,160
Isn't it great?

209
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,240
Right?

210
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,920
I think your place

211
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,000
Has endless delicious food and drinks

212
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,040
Have a few more pieces

213
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,280
Let it melt in your mouth, yes

214
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,080
Chocolate

215
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,080
Becomes even sweeter

216
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,600
Awesome

217
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,440
Right?

218
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,840
When will this sunrise come?

219
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
Watch the sunrise

220
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,200
Watch the sunset

221
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,760
Watch the twinkling stars

222
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,160
Stop singing, that's enough

223
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,880
Don't sing anymore

224
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,320
Why?

225
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,960
Because if you keep singing

226
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,600
Harry Potter flying on a broomstick

227
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,840
Sorry

228
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,720
Sing about sunrise

229
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Sing about sunset

230
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,320
Harry Potter flying on a broomstick

231
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,560
Sorry

232
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
Can we wait for the sun?

233
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,920
What?

234
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,680
The sun rises after five

235
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,360
Shouldn't it be light by now?

236
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,160
When the sun comes out

237
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,480
Climbing the hillside

238
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,560
What

239
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,520
Again?

240
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,720
It's just someone falling down

241
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,080
I clearly saw that girl's face

242
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,040
What was that?

243
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,640
What's wrong with you?

244
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Every time I come to your place, I see someone

245
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,360
Just now, something else fell down

246
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,600
A person wearing a red hoodie

247
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,400
Again

248
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,000
This time I saw the face clearly

249
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,160
Saw it clearly

250
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,120
Why didn't I see anyone jumping?

251
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,560
Let's go take a look then

252
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,720
Run

253
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,840
The wind is so strong

254
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,120
I've grown stronger

255
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,200
The wind can't move me anymore

256
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,200
Xiao He

257
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,600
What's wrong?

258
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,400
Look

259
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,560
It's gone again

260
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,640
Look, the "corpse" is gone again

261
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,880
There's nothing there

262
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Just like what happened when we first moved in

263
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,400
Even the location is the same

264
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,400
So what happened?

265
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,960
So what happened?

266
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,800
You're pretending not to see it again

267
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,160
Who can handle this?

268
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,000
See what?

269
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,880
What are you doing here?

270
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,920
I'm studying here

271
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,040
It's almost 6 AM now

272
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,920
Are you okay?

273
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,760
5 AM is the perfect time for studying

274
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,680
What?

275
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,920
Did you see someone fall?

276
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,240
Yes, we saw someone jump again

277
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,600
Just like on our first day

278
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Same location, right here

279
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,560
Right here

280
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,000
There was someone in red lying there

281
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,840
I really didn't see it

282
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Did someone fall?

283
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,640
Didn't see anything

284
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,280
Bro

285
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,160
Look, it says "Full Occupancy" up there

286
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,360
Apartment No.11 occupancy rate

287
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,040
has reached 100%

288
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,120
One hundred percent

289
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,640
Full capacity

290
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,120
Completely full

291
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,600
It's fully occupied

292
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,600
How is that possible?

293
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,560
Then let's go back.

294
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,720
Alright, let's do some morning exercise too.

295
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,080
Right?

296
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,240
More and more...

297
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,880
What?

298
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,400
More and more...

299
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,640
It's becoming more urgent.

300
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,400
Do you know what the jumper looks like?

301
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,960
You must investigate this as soon as possible.

302
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,800
This again...

303
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,480
The truth about that symbol.

304
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,480
There's a moon.

305
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,040
It's very important.

306
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,320
It's on the second floor.

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,960
Since it has already given a warning,

308
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,000
in this kind of situation,

309
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,400
maybe you should go check the second floor.

310
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,320
Right, we actually got a clear look just now.

311
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,480
We saw the girl's face, right?

312
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,040
Saw it.

313
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,000
We roughly know what she looks like.

314
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,280
Long hair, right?

315
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,760
Long hair, and her eyes were that kind.

316
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,080
But the issue is,

317
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,560
besides the linked symbol,

318
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,760
there seems to be one more.

319
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,040
The one with the moon.

320
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,960
Everyone, please go to the hall on the second floor.

321
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,520
Wait for me.

322
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,240
Then I'll go get

323
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,320
the Zhenguoli reasoning kit.

324
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,560
and then come find you.

325
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,320
Okay.

326
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,880
Alright.

327
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Let's go.

328
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,360
What now? Something's happened again, seriously.

329
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,400
Come

330
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,600
Zhenguoli Deduction Kit

331
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,320
We quickly

332
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,640
found the moon symbol from the video

333
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,200
on the second floor

334
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,720
What is this?

335
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
Here it is

336
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,800
There's a moon and stars

337
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,040
Shaped like a boat

338
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,160
This is the symbol, right?

339
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,520
Everyone was excited

340
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,400
Yes, this is it

341
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,960
We're getting closer to the truth

342
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
But what we didn't know was

343
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,920
we were also getting closer

344
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,040
to the conspiracy

345
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll take it down

346
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,560
Let me get it down

347
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,160
Why did you...

348
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,120
No need for such big reactions

349
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,040
I really can't reach it

350
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,160
So the "killer" could easily

351
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,240
put this thing up

352
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,520
This confirms his

353
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:04,920
his height

354
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,520
No

355
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,480
So you're the "killer"

356
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,120
You two are the "killers"

357
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,760
Both of you are the "killers"

358
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,600
The door is open.

359
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,240
What is this place?

360
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,360
I don't know.

361
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,200
Let's go, Lao Bai.

362
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,880
Brother Bai.

363
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,520
We found the symbol, you know?

364
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,160
Nephew.

365
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,200
Go.

366
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,320
I am the recorder.

367
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,000
Who am I?

368
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,800
You are my nephew.

369
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,440
What does this mean?

370
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,240
Very strange candles.

371
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,120
The color looks just like those in Zhenzhen Theater.

372
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,680
No idea what they're for.

373
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,480
205.

374
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,880
How did we get in here again?

375
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,680
Whose room is this?

376
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,840
Right, who's on the second floor?

377
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,120
Do we have anyone living on the second floor?

378
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,040
No, we don't.

379
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,920
Come on, let's take a closer look.

380
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,000
This door is locked.

381
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,040
Can't open any of them.

382
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,720
It needs a key.

383
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,680
This must be related.

384
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,200
I think these candles are suspicious.

385
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,040
Let's check that thing...

386
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,760
This should be its power cord.

387
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,520
Can anyone tell me

388
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,960
what the scenery inside is like

389
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,160
I want to know too

390
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,760
You can't see it either

391
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,440
What's the view inside like

392
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,320
What's inside

393
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,000
What's in there

394
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,800
I genuinely can't see

395
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,720
Here, thank you

396
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,280
I thank you

397
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,600
Okay, thanks

398
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,720
So polite

399
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,400
Only I can't see

400
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,680
This mechanism must be here

401
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,400
There must be some mechanism

402
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,800
It's related to that symbol

403
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,280
At night?

404
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,120
What do the stars at night mean?

405
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,320
The moon

406
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,840
Sleep

407
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,400
Just turn off the lights

408
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,000
Darkness

409
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,600
Sprayed all over my face

410
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
It's related to that symbol

411
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,960
At night?

412
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,760
Cover everything

413
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,200
Cover everything

414
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,960
Come on, hurry up

415
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,520
Get to work

416
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,080
Three

417
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,600
Two

418
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,120
One

419
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,640
The door opened

420
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,600
No way

421
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,120
No

422
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,960
So stupid

423
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,400
It's related to that symbol

424
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,240
This color

425
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,720
Blown out

426
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,680
Can really be blown out

427
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,000
Broken

428
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,480
Did it blow out?

429
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,920
Did it go out?

430
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,320
A beam of light in the darkness

431
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,760
Okay, I'm going to start

432
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,600
You're going to start?

433
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,520
I'm scared shitless

434
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,920
Sorry, we're back again

435
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,280
After blowing out a candle earlier

436
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,080
We found a secret passage

437
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,520
The Ferryman's Realm

438
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,840
Wait a minute

439
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,880
Should we think about this?

440
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,000
No need to think, let's go

441
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,520
Xiao Song

442
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,160
You go

443
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,960
You go

444
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,880
Lock her in there, bro

445
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,480
This is...

446
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,880
Okay, come in

447
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,920
So fragrant

448
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Can't see your hand

449
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,560
Fragrant

450
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,720
A place for making incense

451
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,600
Can't see anything here

452
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,160
Should I turn it off?

453
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,840
Is there a light?

454
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,800
There should be a light

455
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,400
Turn on the light

456
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,160
Lights on

457
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,000
Turn on the lights first

458
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
This is the circuit breaker

459
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,120
It's on

460
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,520
Turned on

461
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:55,720
On now

462
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,560
This is the Insomnia Convenience Store

463
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,360
You need aromatherapy to sleep, right?

464
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,440
Everything here helps with sleep

465
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,320
Sleep Aid

466
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,280
This is a place to help you sleep

467
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,360
This is their "Landing on Roundfish Island"

468
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,200
What is the switch?

469
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,600
The Little Prince looked at them

470
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,200
They all looked like his flower

471
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,840
Exactly the same

472
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,560
There's a group of tadpoles in the pond

473
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,800
The rabbit mocked the turtle for being slow

474
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,520
The turtle said

475
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,880
"I will win someday"

476
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,360
Proper rest gives you abundant energy

477
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,840
To welcome a new day

478
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,800
Goodnight, Roundfish Island

479
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,560
There's another room inside here

480
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,920
This is

481
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,240
There's nothing here.

482
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,599
Impossible. There must be something in this room.

483
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,680
Xiao Bamei, dig around.

484
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,200
Xiao Bamei

485
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,440
This is the "deceased."

486
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,000
This looks very similar

487
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,720
"the deceased"

488
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,079
Right

489
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,600
Isn't it?

490
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,640
The main writer of the public account

491
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,400
Chief writer

492
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,240
What's wrong?

493
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,120
Someone "died"

494
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,800
Someone "died" again

495
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,080
No

496
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,440
The person who just "died"

497
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,000
Looks exactly like "the deceased"

498
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,120
Yes

499
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,040
Named

500
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,880
Xiao Bamei

501
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,560
Her name is Xiao Bamei

502
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Isn't there a big computer here?

503
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,720
Turn on the computer.

504
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,920
There's a computer and a notebook.

505
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,360
What's inside it?

506
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,000
Phone.

507
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,520
Direct zone.

508
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,760
What area code? Zip code?

509
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,720
Insomnia Convenience Store.

510
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,120
Same symbol here too.

511
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:11,960
Password

512
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,600
Who did what?

513
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,400
Did someone outside turn off the lights?

514
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,480
Brother Bai is on your left.

515
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,080
Circuit breaker.

516
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,920
Is anyone there?

517
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,560
Is there someone here?

518
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,440
Outside

519
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,160
The circuit breaker isn't working

520
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,520
It's broken

521
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,400
The floor with the main switch

522
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,960
I know, flipping it won't help

523
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,920
Who are you?

524
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
I am me

525
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Then who am I?

526
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,320
Useless

527
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,520
Forget it, go back

528
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,480
Let's go, we'll sleep for a while

529
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,520
Anyway, it's a sleep aid center

530
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,360
Then let's sleep

531
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,240
You are a beam of light in the darkness

532
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,000
One, two

533
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,120
How many of us are there?

534
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,000
One, two, three, four, five, six

535
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There are six of us, right?

536
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,400
Right

537
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,080
No extra people

538
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,840
No

539
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,040
What are you doing? Who are you trying to scare?

540
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,520
Let's stand closer to the light

541
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,080
For a while

542
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,320
Let's crack this password first

543
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,320
So that symbol means

544
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,680
Insomnia Convenience Store

545
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,480
Where's Lao Bai?

546
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,040
Nephew

547
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,800
Nephew

548
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,280
He's gone again

549
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,960
He's just waiting there for us to come over

550
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,360
To scare us

551
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,400
I don't dare to go over

552
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,640
He's going to scare us again, he's so annoying

553
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,680
If we ignore him, he'll—

554
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,160
We'll ignore him

555
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,120
Let him squat there by himself

556
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,840
Make him feel awkward

557
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,360
Let him be embarrassed

558
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
But the problem is he scares us

559
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,880
We'll still get scared

560
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,320
We won't be scared

561
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,560
We're brave kids

562
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,440
Someone's here.

563
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:52,920
What?

564
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,640
Someone's here

565
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,960
She's trying to scare us

566
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,720
Let me tell you

567
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,840
No, I'm not trying to scare you

568
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,640
Why are you here?

569
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,040
Who?

570
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,520
Who are you?

571
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:30,880
Who are you?

572
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,960
I'm Bamei

573
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,240
You're Bamei?

574
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,680
I am Bamei

575
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,520
It's dangerous here now

576
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,160
You must go inside

577
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,920
Listen to me

578
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,760
Hurry up

579
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,800
Get inside quickly

580
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,960
Didn't she already "die"?

581
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,240
Didn't she "die"?

582
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Wasn't she supposed to be "dead"?

583
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,120
What's this thing?

584
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,720
This is for you

585
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,240
For us?

586
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,040
You go in first, be good

587
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,320
You want to...

588
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,760
You come in too, what are you doing?

589
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,120
Come on

590
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,560
Let me explain the situation

591
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,200
The people here have found us

592
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
It's all very dangerous

593
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,920
And don't turn on the lights

594
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,520
Don't turn on the lights yet

595
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,080
Because if we all get caught

596
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,400
we're basically all done for

597
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,240
Why are you lighting yourself like this?

598
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,600
Right.

599
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,480
You're so peculiar.

600
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:07,880
No.

601
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Because if we light it this way,

602
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,360
everyone's face might look oily.

603
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:10,960
Oil.

604
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,200
Oil.

605
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:11,880
Oil.

606
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,680
We're not oily.

607
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,720
We don't get oily.

608
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,520
I'm oily.

609
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,680
Let me tell you, this place is very dangerous.

610
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,240
If someone comes in later,

611
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,120
No, you come in too.

612
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,920
Let's hide together.

613
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,400
I'm going somewhere else.

614
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,040
Listen to me.

615
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,440
We're in this together.

616
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,280
We're a team.

617
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,400
We're family.

618
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,960
You're just rapping here.

619
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,080
We're family.

620
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,960
We're family.

621
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,120
Thank you so much.

622
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,560
I'm really hot now.

623
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,040
Since we're family,

624
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,440
then today it's 19 yuan

625
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,080
per order.

626
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,120
Okay, I'll pay.

627
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll pay.

628
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,760
Later I'll do a Thomas flare for you.

629
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,320
Come in.

630
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:41,800
Let me tell you

631
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,920
When we all get captured together later

632
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,680
you'll understand

633
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,560
Let me explain the current situation

634
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,560
This place

635
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
What did you say?

636
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,360
This place

637
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,240
What are you saying?

638
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,680
There's a secret in this place

639
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,200
What?

640
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,160
What do you mean?

641
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,680
I mean, what kind of secret?

642
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,720
You need to stay here and find this secret

643
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,960
There are many people outside trying to capture us now

644
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,880
Who wants to capture you?

645
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,720
The people here

646
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,200
Because they've already discovered me

647
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,680
They haven't discovered you yet

648
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,320
I'm going to distract them now

649
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,000
Thank you

650
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,240
We can't let him capture all of us together

651
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,880
No

652
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,120
Don't

653
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Not acceptable

654
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,840
We can't let you go alone as bait

655
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,480
The reason is

656
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,040
Even though we just met today

657
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,880
I feel a deep bond with you all

658
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,720
That's really not necessary

659
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,760
What I mean is

660
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,320
Let's go together

661
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,920
Together

662
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,480
Since that's the case

663
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,600
All of us

664
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,120
No

665
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,000
You can't all come

666
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,840
Together

667
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,400
No

668
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,480
Because there's a high chance I'll be captured

669
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,120
And then I'll be...

670
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,720
No way

671
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,120
Here's what we'll do

672
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,520
Let Song Piaoliang go with you

673
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,280
Right

674
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,840
You go

675
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,960
Go on, we're sending you off

676
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,120
Sent off

677
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,960
Bye

678
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,880
Just gave away a beauty for free

679
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,280
You guys really

680
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,240
You're so ungentlemanly

681
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,720
Are you sure you know each other?

682
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,480
You're being so ungentlemanly

683
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,120
Come on

684
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,760
Hurry up

685
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,240
Let me just say

686
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,520
If I get captured

687
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,280
You must come save me

688
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,200
Let's lure them in deeper, okay?

689
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,040
You have to rescue me

690
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,240
This is absolutely not a threat

691
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,240
Just a sincere request

692
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,080
Okay

693
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,480
Don’t think hiding in the dark will save you

694
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,960
Where are you?

695
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:15,760
Where is everyone?

696
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,520
Come out, where are you?

697
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,320
Don't think turning off the lights

698
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,520
means we can't find you. Where are you?

699
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,320
Where are you? Come out!

700
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,160
Here.

701
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,320
Grab him!

702
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,160
Over here!

703
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,120
We've finally found you.

704
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,760
Don't be so rough.

705
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,240
Stop being so rough.

706
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
Take him to the treatment room.

707
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,080
Help me!

708
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,560
What are you doing?

709
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,040
Old Bai

710
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,360
This reckless brute

711
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,000
Stop!

712
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,000
What are you doing?

713
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,600
Leave that person here!

714
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,280
This reckless fool

715
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,120
Old Bai

716
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,680
Bai Bai

717
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,840
The person you saw jumping off the building

718
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,600
Was it her?

719
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,680
Yes, the person we saw jumping
was this woman

720
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,280
It was this woman

721
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,400
It's strange how she appeared here

722
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,040
Didn't you take some notebook earlier?

723
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,600
The notebook is here

724
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Whose notebook is this?

725
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,120
We got this from Bamai

726
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,480
What is this?

727
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,440
This is for you all

728
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,360
The first page says:

729
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,320
"The owner of Sleepless Convenience Store is Lai Wan'ou"

730
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,600
Lai Wan'ou is the owner here

731
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,600
Then she said she never expected

732
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,400
there were so many secrets hidden here

733
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,880
I sneaked into the treatment room

734
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,200
Originally planned to stay hidden there

735
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,880
to investigate when no one was around

736
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,080
but was still discovered

737
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,320
I must find another chance to go in again

738
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,440
Then the photos she took

739
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,240
The photos should be of that...

740
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,840
the room

741
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,320
the storage room

742
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,040
Yes, green

743
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,720
box

744
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,800
That means there's a treatment room inside

745
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,280
Right?

746
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,240
Then she said

747
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,360
"Why would she have

748
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,400
photos of all seven of us?"

749
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,480
All seven of us

750
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,240
including Bamai

751
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,040
We're all connected

752
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,160
Though we just met today

753
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,160
I feel a deep bond with you all

754
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,800
What common trait do we share?

755
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,080
First of all, we're orphans.

756
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
But what could Xiaobamei

757
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
have in common with us?

758
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,040
She's also an orphan.

759
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,320
That means she's an orphan too.

760
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,400
I don't think it's about being orphans.

761
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,800
I just want to ask - are we still alive?

762
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,400
If we're talking about commonalities,

763
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,760
it's that we're all still alive.

764
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,720
That doesn't count as a commonality.

765
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,480
We saw that

766
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,640
she was a "dead person",

767
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,760
then suddenly she came back to life.

768
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,480
She's alive again.

769
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,400
Does that mean we've "died" too?

770
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,360
Are we also "dead people"?

771
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
No

772
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,280
I'm not sure anymore

773
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,320
if we're even still alive

774
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,520
Is there any information on the computer?

775
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,440
Try turning on the computer

776
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,120
The password hint is "boss"

777
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,440
Try if "doll" works

778
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,680
Isn't this his...?

779
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,440
It's open

780
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,720
Opened. There are chat logs here.

781
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,400
March 1st

782
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,800
Young people nowadays

783
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,360
are increasingly suffering from insomnia

784
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,800
The reasons are typically these:

785
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,960
High work and life pressure

786
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,400
Plagued by anxiety

787
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,920
Poor lifestyle and eating habits

788
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,720
Third, poor sleeping environment

789
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,600
Fourth, TV and electronic entertainment devices

790
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,480
causing sleep procrastination

791
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,760
creating a vicious cycle

792
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,480
Our products here

793
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,240
can help solve these sleep problems

794
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,960
Of course, poor sleep means bad mood

795
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,920
Our store's most powerful

796
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,400
is still that flagship product

797
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,480
That symbol

798
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,400
You all

799
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,520
will

800
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,640
"die"

801
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,960
That symbol appeared

802
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Using it can make you forget your troubles

803
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,160
and gain happiness

804
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,520
But only qualified

805
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,000
loyal members can purchase it

806
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,640
Boss, what exactly is this?

807
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,280
It's called

808
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,800
"No-Cry Gas"

809
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,760
Some kind of gas

810
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,040
No wonder it's in a bottle

811
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,600
That spray thing

812
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,640
is called "No-Cry Gas"

813
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,200
The paperclip symbol

814
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,480
There's another one

815
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,120
Is this Bamei in the footage?

816
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,480
Yes

817
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,920
Everyone keep an eye on this person

818
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,040
We must catch her today

819
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,760
She's the first one to "die"

820
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,720
Tomorrow

821
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,960
Look at this place

822
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,480
July 15th

823
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,720
It's tomorrow

824
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,880
That means July 16th

825
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,000
She hasn't "died" yet

826
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,920
She will "die" tomorrow

827
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,480
If I get taken away

828
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,200
Remember to come save me

829
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,840
She's the first one who will "die"

830
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,720
It's tomorrow

831
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,120
Roger that

832
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,280
What are these four people's names?

833
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,080
Nini

834
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Xiao Zhang

835
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,040
Xiao Song

836
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,800
Xiao Yu

837
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,320
Xiao Song and Xiao Yu, you two are suspicious

838
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,440
I feel like it's not exactly

839
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,720
These people are going to team up

840
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,560
To "kill" this person

841
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,680
I accidentally learned about their future

842
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,800
And what will happen

843
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,480
So I want to change some people's fates

844
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,640
Disobey and you'll die

845
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,080
Assuming the boss is Lai Wan'ou

846
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,440
What Lai Wan'ou has been doing is

847
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,840
Trying to protect all those who will "die"

848
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,400
Everyone keep a close eye on this person

849
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,480
We must capture her today

850
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,400
She's the first one who will "die"

851
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,000
It's tomorrow

852
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
He's also predicting the future

853
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,880
He wants to protect her

854
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
Capturing her today

855
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,560
Is forcibly protecting this person

856
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,360
Right, it's actually to protect her

857
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
It's just that the tone

858
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,320
Makes everyone think we might harm her

859
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,680
Right

860
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,280
She said after infiltrating

861
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,120
She obtained many secrets

862
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,240
And they're all related to us

863
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,280
Right, we need to find this treatment room

864
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,480
In that little notebook

865
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,080
Isn't there a drawing of the treatment room?

866
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,560
Right

867
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,880
It looks very similar to that place

868
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,560
In the storage room

869
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,600
But this doesn't look like a treatment room

870
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,160
This is the place

871
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,120
I feel there's a hidden compartment

872
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,520
I think there's something suspicious here

873
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,440
Does it depend on how these are arranged?

874
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,160
There must be a connection

875
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,000
Arrange them like this

876
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,160
Put two in the middle

877
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,080
What about the top?

878
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Just line them up at the top

879
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,040
It can't possibly move

880
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,320
Let's compare it like this

881
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,160
See how it differs from the picture

882
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,360
Her pose was like this

883
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,120
Let me try to imitate it

884
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,640
She was like this

885
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,520
What do you see from there?

886
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,840
From there I just see outside.

887
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,000
Then just look outside.

888
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,640
Look back.

889
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,760
Me and her...

890
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,160
What's different about our postures?

891
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,640
She is...

892
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,280
Switch your legs.

893
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,920
Same as hers.

894
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,040
Switch legs like this.

895
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,520
No, yes.

896
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,080
Just switch them.

897
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,760
Switch them, yes.

898
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,800
She's squatting like this.

899
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,200
The surveillance should be fine.

900
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,320
Look.

901
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,400
The wall here is very short.

902
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,640
This might work.

903
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,680
It can move

904
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,000
This definitely can move

905
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,320
Right

906
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,440
Here

907
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,280
Counseling room

908
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,560
Treatment Room

909
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,840
She said after sneaking in

910
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,920
she obtained many secrets

911
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,160
Please enter your employee ID to open the door, therapist

912
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,560
Should be useful

913
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,560
Front desk Xiao Zhang has a call

914
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,520
Customer Service: Doudou

915
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,960
Convenience store Xiao Liu

916
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,120
Song Huo

917
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,440
Nini

918
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,280
Assistant Chen

919
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,360
All their phone numbers are here

920
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,280
Has employee ID

921
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,920
That... whatever gas

922
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,000
From today onward,

923
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,120
I will be taking over the Sleepless Convenience Store.

924
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,560
The previous owner's product,

925
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,080
"No-Cry Gas" with undisclosed formula,

926
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,320
will be temporarily suspended from sale.

927
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,640
All staff are strictly prohibited from selling

928
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,400
"No-Cry Gas" privately.

929
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,640
June 1st

930
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,800
Our happiness is

931
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,000
HA gas + PPY molecules

932
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
= "No-Cry Gas"

933
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,000
HA gas

934
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,480
"No-Cry Gas"

935
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,240
can stimulate your body's happiness factors,

936
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,240
instantly making you forget your worries,

937
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,480
providing you with an unprecedented experience.

938
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,680
Normally appears as a colorless, odorless gas,

939
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,480
can be liquefied.

940
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,680
When liquefied, it appears transparent blue.

941
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,240
When atomized into mist,

942
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,720
the effects remain the same as the gaseous form.

943
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,920
Transparent blue

944
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,120
It can be liquefied.

945
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,960
Medicine Purchase Registry

946
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,280
Members-only purchases

947
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,920
The earliest records date back to 2006

948
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,040
So many people bought it

949
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,560
All residents of the apartment

950
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,320
Xiao Xiao Wang

951
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,560
Mrs. Ju

952
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,400
Xiaoxiao Wang told a friend

953
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,440
I've been feeling down lately

954
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,240
Fortunately, with this

955
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,440
I can temporarily forget

956
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,240
those unpleasant things

957
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,840
What is this thing?

958
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,480
It's related to my

959
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,040
unspeakable experience

960
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,120
But this e mo kept buying until the end

961
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,920
Ninth floor

962
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,040
Who is on the ninth floor?

963
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,920
e mo

964
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,160
Demon

965
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,720
e mo first bought it

966
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,520
in 2007

967
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,240
Only his name was

968
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
the one who kept buying

969
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,560
This is

970
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
a flyer, right?

971
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:51,880
Yes

972
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,040
Didn't we once see it

973
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,800
in Hao the cleaner's trash bag?

974
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,600
I think we saw

975
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,800
a torn blue half of this?

976
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,480
There's something here

977
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,120
"Please call to purchase"

978
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,640
Look at this symbol

979
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,600
The one used to threaten us

980
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,960
There's a phone number on it

981
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,280
Should we try calling this number?

982
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,199
Do we have a phone?

983
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,080
Isn't this a phone?

984
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,440
Hello, the number you dialed is not in service.

985
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,000
You can't buy it by calling this number.

986
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,639
Isn't it currently suspended from sale?

987
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,880
After they possibly changed owners,

988
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,760
the hotline number was also changed.

989
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,000
The formula for "No-Cry Gas" remains undisclosed.

990
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,080
Sales suspended.

991
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,440
Let's quickly figure out a solution.

992
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,719
Can we get this employee ID number?

993
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,719
Let's try calling his therapist's number.

994
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,679
That could work too.

995
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,159
Just call randomly.

996
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,159
Ask for his employee ID number.

997
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,600
Brother Zhang

998
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,880
Sister Zhang

999
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:01,920
Sister Zhang

1000
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,680
Hello

1001
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,280
Can you hear me, Sister Zhang?

1002
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,080
Who are you?

1003
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,760
I'm in the treatment room

1004
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,040
Why is it in Hokkien?

1005
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,840
Hokkien

1006
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,920
Hello?

1007
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,600
Who are you?

1008
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,360
I don't know who I am either.

1009
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,400
What did you say?

1010
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,600
Let me ask you...

1011
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,960
Let's get down to business.

1012
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,840
She hung up.

1013
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,000
See? I told you.

1014
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,560
Why was she speaking Hokkien?

1015
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,560
Call again.

1016
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,520
What's your employee ID number?

1017
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,080
Right.

1018
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,720
What are you doing?

1019
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,720
I just called you

1020
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,960
Asked for your employee ID but you wouldn't tell me

1021
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,520
You're not my boss

1022
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,400
Why should I tell you?

1023
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,120
She said "You're not the boss"

1024
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,600
Why should I tell you anything?

1025
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,520
I'm the boss's girlfriend

1026
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,960
So there's definitely no way

1027
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,360
to get this information from her

1028
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,600
Receptionist Xiao Zhang has a phone

1029
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,560
Let's ask her colleague instead

1030
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,440
We're all from the same company anyway, right?

1031
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,520
I insist on asking her

1032
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,320
Fine

1033
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,040
I'm determined to ask her

1034
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,800
I'll see this through to the end

1035
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,320
I'm working hard to learn Hokkien now

1036
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:29,760
Let me tell you

1037
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,120
Is intensive study going to be enough?

1038
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,160
Wait a moment, don't rush

1039
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
Can you hear me?

1040
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,000
Let me tell you

1041
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,280
No, even Hokkien doesn’t need to be

1042
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,240
this sarcastic, right?

1043
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,040
I have so many friends

1044
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,240
I really want to know your employee ID

1045
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,160
Does she actually understand?

1046
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,080
Just tell me

1047
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,680
Your employee ID is really important to us

1048
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,920
Why do you want my employee ID?

1049
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,600
You tell me

1050
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,200
I’m the boss

1051
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,520
I’m going to make tea, goodbye

1052
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Try another one

1053
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,840
Who should I call

1054
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,520
Assistant Chen

1055
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,480
Hello

1056
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:21,920
Hello

1057
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,040
Hello

1058
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,840
Is this Assistant Chen?

1059
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,960
Yes

1060
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,920
Can you tell me

1061
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,880
What is Therapist Zhang's employee ID?

1062
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,080
I don’t know

1063
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,560
You don’t know? How could you not know?

1064
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,720
No, you don’t know?

1065
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,400
How do you even do your job?

1066
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,920
I don’t know what you’re talking about

1067
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,040
What kind of workplace is this?

1068
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,840
A mess

1069
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,160
I think it’s better to ask customer service

1070
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,640
Right?

1071
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,640
Hello, are you Nini?

1072
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,440
Which one?

1073
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,520
What?

1074
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,800
Can you speak English?

1075
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,480
Is this Wenzhou dialect?

1076
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,560
I can't understand at all.

1077
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,880
I don't quite understand.

1078
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,960
Speak slower.

1079
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,520
Slower, please.

1080
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,840
I might be able to understand.

1081
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,160
What kind of organization is this?

1082
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,640
Can't even find a single fellow townsman.

1083
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,840
Is it from Sichuan?

1084
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,680
Definitely not from Sichuan.

1085
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,560
This seems more like Jiangsu/Zhejiang area.

1086
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,360
Very similar.

1087
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:28,880
From Jiangsu/Zhejiang region.

1088
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,760
Jiangsu/Zhejiang style.

1089
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,000
Okay.

1090
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,680
You hang up.

1091
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,240
You rest now.

1092
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,760
Go rest.

1093
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,160
Nini called.

1094
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,880
Assistant Chen called.

1095
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,600
Then call Xiao Song.

1096
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,920
Xiao Song is here.

1097
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,560
Then open the door.

1098
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,960
I can't open it.

1099
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,640
Which one?

1100
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,800
I'm the boss, lower your voice.

1101
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,800
I can't hear you.

1102
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,360
Stop shouting, keep your voice down.

1103
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,000
I need to talk to you.

1104
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,400
I can't hear.

1105
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,640
He's hard of hearing.

1106
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,240
What kind of talk is this?

1107
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,120
Therapist Zhang.

1108
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,440
What was her employee number again?

1109
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,480
I'll give it to you.

1110
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,440
Which one?

1111
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,360
That Therapist Zhang.

1112
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,240
I need to pay your salaries.

1113
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,080
Is he a sheep?

1114
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,640
I think...

1115
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,280
We can't keep being polite.

1116
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,120
We need to scare him.

1117
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,720
Scare him.

1118
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,760
Just scare him directly.

1119
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,480
What are you doing?

1120
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,200
Xiao Liu.

1121
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,440
Tell me your employee number quickly.

1122
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,280
Who are you?

1123
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,680
It's urgent.

1124
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,840
Never mind who I am, I need it.

1125
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,480
From Hunan.

1126
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,240
I don't know.

1127
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,360
What employee number are you talking about?

1128
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,640
Goodbye, I won't talk to you anymore.

1129
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,440
I'll hang up first.

1130
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,160
I don't want to talk to you.

1131
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,560
I'll hang up first.

1132
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,600
I'm so pissed off.

1133
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,800
Try another colleague then

1134
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,040
Who?

1135
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,920
The receptionist

1136
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
Xiao Zhang

1137
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,880
Xiao Zhang

1138
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,560
Who is it? What do you want?

1139
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,720
I'm the boss's wife

1140
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,360
This works

1141
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:58,960
This will do

1142
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,880
From Northeast China

1143
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,280
Sis, why are you making things up?

1144
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,360
The boss's wife doesn't talk like this

1145
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,800
The boss said

1146
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,320
Uh... that thing...

1147
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,240
Uh...

1148
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,720
How did you survive in the Northeast, bro?

1149
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,360
How come you didn't get a word in?

1150
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,480
I haven't even spoken yet.

1151
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,280
They spilled everything before you even spoke.

1152
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,240
Hello Xiao Zhang

1153
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,800
I'm your boss

1154
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,040
Boss, why won't you stop?

1155
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,200
calling

1156
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,520
Do you even let people work?

1157
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,560
No, what I mean is...

1158
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,800
I'm preparing to pay your salaries

1159
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,400
Just tell me directly what you want

1160
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,960
I'll be direct - I said I'll pay you

1161
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,640
So I want to know about Therapist Zhang

1162
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
What's her employee ID?

1163
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,840
Our employee IDs are all written up there

1164
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,880
Where? You wrote it?

1165
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,520
I don't even know you

1166
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,480
Why should I tell you?

1167
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,960
Where are you from?

1168
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,040
I'm from Shenyang

1169
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,680
You're from Shenyang?

1170
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,960
You're from Shenyang? Why didn't you say so earlier?

1171
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,560
I'm from Dandong

1172
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,000
Our employee IDs are all written up there

1173
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,120
I'm from Shenyang

1174
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,240
I'm from Shenyang

1175
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,160
Which one are you?

1176
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
I don't understand

1177
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,800
Where are you from?

1178
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,800
I don't know

1179
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Which province are they from?

1180
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,760
This is their area code.

1181
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
That's his employee ID.

1182
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,520
Got it.

1183
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,920
Therapist Zhang speaks Hokkien.

1184
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,080
So we need a Fujian employee ID.

1185
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,560
Fujian's area code is her employee ID.

1186
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,520
Right.

1187
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,440
This should work, right?

1188
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,160
Then try them one by one.

1189
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,280
It must be in Fujian.

1190
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:31,760
Yes.

1191
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,320
Remember? The one by his computer.

1192
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,760
0591 is not

1193
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,720
How about trying Xiamen

1194
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,800
No

1195
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,960
0596

1196
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,200
No

1197
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,800
0598

1198
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,040
Are you sure that was Hokkien just now?

1199
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,760
I don't understand

1200
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,040
It is Hokkien

1201
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,760
Definitely Hokkien

1202
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,400
Which one?

1203
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:07,880
Quanzhou

1204
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,760
Come on

1205
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,440
There's a computer

1206
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,400
It's surveillance

1207
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,200
Xiao Bamei

1208
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,280
Bamei

1209
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,120
You must come save me

1210
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,560
We're on the same side

1211
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,000
Remember to come save me

1212
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,360
Where is she locked up?

1213
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,000
What compression channel?

1214
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Decompression channel?

1215
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,720
There's a paper

1216
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,440
It says this institution

1217
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,120
has basic therapy and intensive therapy rooms

1218
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,840
Basic therapy room

1219
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,040
provides specialized sleep therapy for regular patients

1220
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,600
Special therapy room for patients with anxiety disorders

1221
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,200
To protect privacy

1222
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,960
Intensive therapy room

1223
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,280
is not located within this institution

1224
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,600
disguised under other signs

1225
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,360
She's in the intensive therapy room

1226
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,120
Here's a microphone

1227
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,680
Hey, Xiao Bamei

1228
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,400
Can you hear us?

1229
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,760
Then sing a song for her

1230
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,960
You are a beam of light in the darkness

1231
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,400
A beam of light in the darkness

1232
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,360
You are a beam of light in the darkness

1233
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,600
You are a beam of light in the darkness

1234
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,040
You can hear us, right?

1235
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,080
Then prove it

1236
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,960
You need to follow our lead

1237
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,160
Left

1238
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,000
Right

1239
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,040
Walk

1240
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,960
Turn

1241
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,760
Continue

1242
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,680
This is a bunch of "lunatics"

1243
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,240
No

1244
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,760
She said she can't speak

1245
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,080
We came here

1246
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,560
We came here to cut it open for you

1247
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,000
Where are you?

1248
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,320
Actually, she doesn't know either

1249
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,600
There's one outside

1250
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,120
A sound?

1251
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,720
What sound?

1252
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,880
Let's follow the sound to find someone

1253
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,240
There's someone outside

1254
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,280
Put on a hat

1255
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,000
Put it on

1256
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,440
He has an earpiece, he has headphones

1257
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:23,880
Right?

1258
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,680
Someone's patrolling outside

1259
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,960
There's someone outside dressed like you

1260
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,640
Wearing a hoodie

1261
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,160
You're terrible at Pictionary

1262
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,040
People are dancing outside

1263
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,040
There's a dance party outside

1264
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,640
I'm hungry

1265
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,440
I'm angry

1266
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,800
Or is it from a movie/show?

1267
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,200
My stomach's growling

1268
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,960
Getting mad

1269
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,200
He's got an earpiece, he's got headphones

1270
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,040
They're raving outside

1271
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,920
We must rescue her

1272
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,120
You must explain this clearly to us

1273
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,440
Go Xiao Bamei! You can do it!

1274
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,040
Go for it!

1275
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,560
There's a song playing outside

1276
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,440
还是个影视

1277
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:00,760
Or maybe...

1278
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,280
A song

1279
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,080
A song

1280
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,160
Children's song

1281
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:04,640
Is it a children's song?

1282
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,480
Is it a children's song?

1283
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,120
It's a children's song

1284
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,640
A girl wearing a hoodie

1285
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,080
Strolling around shopping

1286
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,880
"Little Red Riding Hood"

1287
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,680
I walk alone on the country path

1288
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,760
And also

1289
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,000
Horse riding

1290
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,360
"Gangnam Style"

1291
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,720
I have a little donkey

1292
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,680
I never ride it

1293
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,360
One day on a whim

1294
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:28,920
Is this it?

1295
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,600
Can we meet again?

1296
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,120
I've prayed before Buddha for thousands of years

1297
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:39,840
What?

1298
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,560
No

1299
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:42,640
Come on

1300
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,120
Riding a donkey

1301
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,200
Riding a donkey while reading a script

1302
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,200
Horse

1303
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,000
Horse riding

1304
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,360
White Dragon Horse

1305
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,160
Hooves pointing west

1306
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,760
Yes

1307
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,760
This is the one, right?

1308
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,760
"Journey to the West"

1309
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,520
"Journey to the West"

1310
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,480
By the roadside

1311
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,080
I found a penny

1312
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:10,440
No

1313
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,280
Growing, growing trees

1314
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,960
Planting the sun

1315
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,760
La la la la

1316
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,520
Planting the sun

1317
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,280
La la la la

1318
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,160
La la la la

1319
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,480
Planting the sun

1320
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,800
Planting the sun

1321
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,840
I'm a little newspaper vendor

1322
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,400
We'll come find you as soon as possible.

1323
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:46,800
Okay

1324
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,480
Okay, before we arrive

1325
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,520
you must maintain a good

1326
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:48,920
Mental state

1327
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,800
Keep yourself happy

1328
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,560
and maintain a relaxed mood, okay?

1329
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,320
We will definitely find you

1330
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:51,840
Stay strong

1331
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,760
Why are these people trying to capture Bamei?

1332
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,560
Arrest her

1333
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,320
Take her to the treatment room

1334
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,440
Why will she "die" tomorrow?

1335
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,080
She's the first one destined to "die"

1336
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:03,760
It's happening tomorrow

1337
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,800
The Sleepless Convenience Store

1338
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,880
What secrets is it hiding?

1339
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,880
We're all in this together

1340
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,120
And how does it concern the six of us?

1341
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,200
Everything is shrouded in mystery

1342
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,480
Right, we need to find this treatment room

1343
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,880
Perhaps once we rescue her

1344
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,840
we'll get our answers

1345
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,600
What are you doing?

1346
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,840
Although the rescue mission has been full of laughs

1347
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,880
Wait, no

1348
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,120
it should be full of difficulties

1349
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,040
But we genuinely want to save her

1350
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,320
Let's go

1351
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,840
Have we heard this song somewhere before?

1352
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,400
The arcade

1353
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,320
That's the place

1354
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,880
Go, to the basement

1355
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,920
B105, let's go

1356
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,160
Dakaiyan Street

1357
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:46,720
Listen

1358
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,520
Really good

1359
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,520
What are you doing?

1360
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,520
Hello there

1361
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,680
Here to play again?

1362
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,040
You

1363
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,200
Is there something you need?

1364
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,720
There's something wrong with you, kid

1365
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,640
Why are you listening to this exact song?

1366
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,760
Who played it for you?

1367
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,320
I've always been playing this song here.

1368
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,720
Listen to me, be careful.

1369
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,960
Let's just watch this.

1370
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,320
Pet Club

1371
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,040
Using other signs as a disguise.

1372
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,720
Is this the place, Bamui?

1373
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,120
Yes.

1374
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:39,760
Yes.

1375
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,400
Right here.

1376
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,480
She's here.

1377
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,280
Bamui

1378
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,040
Bamui, Bamui

1379
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,840
Cute little sister

1380
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,840
Then there must be a password.

1381
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,040
That thing has always been there

1382
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,480
What thing?

1383
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,280
Voice recorder

1384
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,240
Listen to this

1385
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,200
Please save me quickly

1386
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,160
I was just screaming for help

1387
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,760
Until my voice went hoarse

1388
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,880
But I secretly recorded

1389
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,960
The conversation of the people who caught me

1390
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,320
You must find a way to help

1391
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:18,720
You know what?

1392
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,120
Last time I played the coin pusher at the arcade

1393
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:20,960
I won three times in a row

1394
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,920
The winning numbers

1395
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,160
Happened to be my birthday

1396
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,200
What a coincidence, right?

1397
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,240
Master

1398
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,520
How did you do it?

1399
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,680
While eating Oreos and playing

1400
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,680
The touch was super smooth

1401
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,920
Let's not just stand guard here

1402
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,240
Let's go play the coin pusher

1403
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,200
What if this woman escapes?

1404
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,280
The password is my birthday

1405
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,360
How could she possibly guess that?

1406
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,520
Besides, she can't reach the keypad anyway. Let's go

1407
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,040
Winning three times was his birthday

1408
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,440
And the door password is his birthday

1409
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,240
How do you play this?

1410
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,880
Got any coins?

1411
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,280
I see you're very interested in the pet shop

1412
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,600
Let me tell you a story

1413
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,120
Come on

1414
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:52,840
Tell us a story

1415
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,840
That pet shop

1416
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,160
It's called a pet shop

1417
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,880
But it's really strange

1418
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,720
I've never seen any pets inside

1419
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,680
Instead, there are many people coming and going

1420
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,280
When they come out

1421
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,480
They're holding a white bottle

1422
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,120
Called something like

1423
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,440
"No Cry Gas"

1424
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,160
Seems to make people happy

1425
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,800
If you ask me

1426
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,120
some people are obsessed with

1427
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,600
unrealistic fantasies

1428
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,280
and rely on those sketchy products

1429
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,680
You’d be better off coming to my arcade

1430
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,800
eating Oreos

1431
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,760
dancing a bit

1432
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,520
twist, lick, dunk

1433
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,800
and adjusting your mindset

1434
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,760
Our mindset is just fine

1435
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,560
Keeping a playful spirit is true happiness

1436
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,560
Want one?

1437
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,120
Sure

1438
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,000
Thanks

1439
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,040
Want an Oreo?

1440
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,560
Yes

1441
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,200
Oreos are so good

1442
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,240
You need to win three in a row—that’s

1443
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,520
The key is where to log these three wins

1444
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,600
No, you have to knock these three down

1445
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,320
It should be

1446
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,680
You’re so rich

1447
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,440
Pick up

1448
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,200
There's one more

1449
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,600
Twist it

1450
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,160
Congratulations

1451
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,120
You've won Oreos and 10 Oreo coins

1452
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:09,800
What's that?

1453
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,280
90s songs

1454
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,800
Free song play trial card

1455
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,120
Three free claw machine attempts

1456
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,840
Three-time trial card

1457
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,280
That's not related

1458
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,360
What does he mean by winning three times in a row?

1459
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,720
Winning three times in a row gives reward numbers

1460
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,120
It happens to be my birthday

1461
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,160
90s songs

1462
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,080
Ten Oreo coins

1463
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,000
Three-time trial card

1464
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,120
The password is my birthday

1465
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,680
Is he from the 90s?

1466
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,920
October 3rd

1467
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,800
Or the 90s

1468
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,400
March 10th or something

1469
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,320
Let's try

1470
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,040
90

1471
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,360
0310

1472
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,240
Then try 901003

1473
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,240
Done

1474
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,320
Good morning

1475
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,080
I'm alone

1476
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,640
I need to verify if you're Xiao Pamei

1477
00:51:59,400 --> 00:51:59,880
Fake

1478
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,760
She's fake

1479
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,240
Not saving her

1480
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:01,880
Let's go

1481
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,280
Go

1482
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,080
Don't waste time

1483
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,640
Fine, let's go

1484
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,160
This is Xiao Pamei

1485
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,640
This is how she talks

1486
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,960
Your voice is already ruined, right?

1487
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,240
Do you want

1488
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,000
You need to drink Zhenguoli Hongyou Sijichun

1489
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,120
for your throat to get better

1490
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,200
Intensive Treatment Room

1491
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,280
This is a stress-relief paradise

1492
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,640
To protect patients' privacy

1493
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,840
we've disguised the facade

1494
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,880
as a pet shop

1495
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,080
so patients can come and go without worries

1496
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,080
Release all your stress here

1497
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,240
and freely express your emotions

1498
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,560
I mean

1499
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,560
Finally, we can talk

1500
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,360
So nice, this thing is amazing

1501
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:45,800
Let me just say

1502
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,120
Can we untie this first?

1503
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,200
Scissors, everyone

1504
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,480
No scissors

1505
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,680
We don’t need scissors for this

1506
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,520
I can untie it with my hands

1507
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:52,960
You

1508
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,720
Are so rich

1509
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,000
Alright, let's take this bracelet away

1510
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Then we'll put it here for them

1511
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,920
Actually, we could just

1512
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,440
chop it off

1513
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,080
and be done with it

1514
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,400
Though that would be a bit bloody

1515
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,960
Close your eyes

1516
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,600
Alright

1517
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:15,760
Wait a second

1518
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,960
I'm really glad you came to rescue me

1519
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,000
I feel our friendship

1520
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,520
has grown much deeper now

1521
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,680
You might have misunderstood

1522
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,480
But

1523
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,320
So I've decided

1524
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,000
to tell you something amazing

1525
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,880
About why

1526
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,320
we were at the Sleepless Convenience Store earlier

1527
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,560
I was investigating

1528
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,800
an incident there

1529
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,120
The Sleepless Convenience Store's

1530
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,120
consultation room

1531
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,200
has a door

1532
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,600
that hides their secret

1533
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,280
But when I went back

1534
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,800
the door had a combination lock

1535
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,560
locking it

1536
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,040
And there's also a cabinet

1537
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,080
blocking the door

1538
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,680
So what you need to do

1539
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,360
is go inside and find that secret

1540
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,240
What's the combination?

1541
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,120
I don't know

1542
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,240
I couldn't open it

1543
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,320
We saved you for nothing

1544
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,160
This trip was a waste, wasn't it?

1545
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,480
Fine, you go back first

1546
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,080
What do we get for saving you?

1547
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,720
The combination is inside the cabinet

1548
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,840
I really have to go now.

1549
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,280
Wait a moment.

1550
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,760
Just wait.

1551
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,320
You said you share something in common

1552
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,440
with the six of us - what is it?

1553
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,080
Tell me.

1554
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,600
I don't know.

1555
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,920
You wrote it but you don't know?

1556
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,600
Have you taken some drugs?

1557
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,120
No.

1558
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:17,960
You've taken drugs too.

1559
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,480
"Push for clarity"

1560
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,200
"Push for clarity"

1561
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,760
No, I haven't had time to investigate yet.

1562
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,160
Who were those people who just captured you?

1563
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,040
They're...

1564
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,800
the people inside.

1565
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,120
The group from the Sleepless Convenience Store.

1566
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,360
Seize her!

1567
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,440
Take her to the treatment room.

1568
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,120
Help!

1569
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,920
Get in.

1570
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,280
Help me!

1571
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,160
Shut up.

1572
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:33,960
Get inside.

1573
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,080
Quick, restrain her.

1574
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,120
Is anyone there?

1575
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:36,840
Behave yourself.

1576
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,360
Stay put.

1577
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,120
Have you seen the six of us

1578
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,200
in a parallel universe?

1579
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,480
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1580
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,800
I have more important matters now.

1581
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,320
I really must go - it's urgent.

1582
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,560
I saw that girl's face clearly.

1583
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,360
I'm Bamie.

1584
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,360
This is the "deceased."

1585
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,480
You must

1586
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,720
investigate immediately

1587
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,360
the truth behind that symbol.

1588
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,720
We're all connected.

1589
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,640
Does that mean we're "dead" too?

1590
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,480
Are we also "the deceased"?

1591
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,720
The plan was initiated by Lai Wan Doll

1592
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,240
After the plan succeeds

1593
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,800
We must closely monitor

1594
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,200
every move of the target

1595
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,400
Restrict the target's freedom of movement

1596
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,240
Detain her

1597
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:25,960
to prevent

1598
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,040
history from repeating itself

1599
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,760
Something terrible happened

1600
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,080
Heartbreak

1601
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,920
Loneliness

1602
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,280
Fear of punishment

1603
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,560
This is the sin of each one of us

1604
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,360
This guy

1605
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,480
Troubles never come singly

1606
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,960
Everyone?

1607
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,400
It was Lai Wan Doll who gathered

1608
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,160
these people together

1609
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,560
The families of us six share similar misfortunes

1610
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,960
It's the six of us

1611
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,480
who are also experiencing memory confusion

1612
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,440
This Lai Wan Doll is something else
