1
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,440
I really don't want to play this game anymore

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,920
This is so frustrating

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,520
What would you do if you went back?

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,120
I vote for you

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,480
Look how angry you've made us honest people

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,920
Isn't this just bullying honest people?

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,960
What's written under this camera

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,560
Loser

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,040
Loser

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,800
His laser light is a bit too low

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,159
Right?

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,640
By the time I walk over there, I'll already be sticking out

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,720
The person gets smaller as they walk away

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,880
So you can't go back

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,960
Because you're too tall

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,240
Making your own special effects, huh?

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,800
Turn around

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,880
A bit reluctant to leave

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,720
Reluctant?

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,600
Smiles faintly

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,800
Disdainful, utterly disdainful

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,080
Alright, Bai Sanwan turns around

23
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,600
He drives the cart

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,360
Uncle

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,200
I've come to join you

26
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,960
Nephew

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,600
That moment of turning around

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,960
Do a Thomas flare or something

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,320
Headspin, starting on the ground

30
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,200
No

31
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,320
Is this part outside of the show?

32
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,560
Happy birthday to you

33
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,680
Don't eat the cake, or you'll "die"

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,880
This is a real birthday

35
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,800
Let's go

36
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,400
Then let's take all the clues with us

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,800
We'll discuss in the property management's surveillance room

38
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,280
Go

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,720
The voting results just showed

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,880
There are two people you currently suspect the most

41
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,880
Liu Xialai

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,360
Zhou Keke

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,440
Let's verify

44
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,160
It's open

45
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,480
Yes

46
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,000
What

47
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,320
It's him

48
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,880
Then let's all go to the third floor

49
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,520
Let's see what everyone

50
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,840
will ultimately choose

51
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,240
Okay

52
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,840
Go

53
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,880
Take this question mark with us

54
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,120
Let's set out together

55
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,200
Here, you wear it on your head as we go

56
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,240
Uncle

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,480
Brother Liu, I'm really sorry, Brother Liu

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,040
But why were you in such a hurry later?

59
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,640
You were being a bit too... you know

60
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,320
The more anxious he gets, the less I suspect him.

61
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,680
Don't you understand his mindset by now?

62
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,560
Same here.

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,160
He's panicking.

64
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,840
Uncle took advantage of our kindness.

65
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,080
Thank you.

66
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,560
Qiao Simei.

67
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,960
He exploited our goodwill.

68
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,680
Did you notice?

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,160
I really don't want to play this game anymore.

70
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,400
This is so frustrating.

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,920
Seriously.

72
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,200
This proves you two are truly siblings.

73
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,680
You've won our affection.

74
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,840
But you've lost the friendship.

75
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,520
Should we go back?

76
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,800
We need to save Teacher Lou.

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,440
Save Teacher Lou.

78
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,560
Yes, we must prevent these things from happening.

79
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,320
If we go back this time,

80
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,360
on the evening of July 30th,

81
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,240
we must make sure to send her home.

82
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,040
I definitely won't write that

83
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,880
terrible, boring novel of mine anymore.

84
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,960
Xiaojing is more important than anything.

85
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,400
If you go back this time, what would you do?

86
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,720
I'd definitely stop my brother first.

87
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,160
He must not "kill anyone."

88
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,720
My brother...

89
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,640
I need to properly educate my brother.

90
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,120
If you went back, what would you do?

91
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,720
I'd support you.

92
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,000
The point is he wrote it, then crossed it out

93
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm so "dead" angry, I saw it

94
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,280
Damn

95
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,120
Both of us wrote (two)

96
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,080
I was the one who erased it

97
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,800
Truly worthy of the Qiao family, really

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Old Bai really is...

99
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,800
What's wrong with me?

100
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,480
I was watching you the whole time.

101
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,240
The more you watch me,

102
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,920
the more suspicious you seem.

103
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,680
No, because you're not usually like this.

104
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,200
Right.

105
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,520
Because I'm too nervous.

106
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,080
Yes, he's nervous.

107
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,840
Both of them are acting strange, you know?

108
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,200
He's completely silent now.

109
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,040
He's not someone who stays silent.

110
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,960
At the last moment, I was just...

111
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,160
I forgot everything that happened before.

112
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,440
I was only thinking about that matter.

113
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,360
At that time you said...

114
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,280
You stood up.

115
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,080
That is, among the six of us,

116
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,240
five are related to this case.

117
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
There's one person...

118
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,440
who's related to Teacher Lou.

119
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
There's one traitor.

120
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,360
Traitor.

121
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,560
No one mentioned this at the time.

122
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,440
You suddenly stood up...

123
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,960
and started talking about some "mole" or whatever.

124
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Okay, fine, it's you.

125
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,920
Both of us are somewhat reckless people.

126
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,640
Don't let your bluntness ruin you, really.

127
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,360
At that time he looked...

128
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,560
like a very hardworking good person.

129
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,680
No, he was particularly anxious, you know?

130
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,560
He was pulling...

131
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,200
Because after finding he couldn't pull this side,

132
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,080
he started pulling your side.

133
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,600
I believe him.

134
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,680
Right?

135
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,760
Yes, I was moved by him.

136
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,839
It's fine, not important.

137
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,839
What matters is participation.

138
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,920
Actually, it's partly my fault.

139
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,520
My later speech...

140
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,880
didn't convince you two.

141
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,320
My fault.

142
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,360
Do you know why I chose Keke?

143
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,160
His gaze

144
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,040
It's when that "killer"

145
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,520
gets accused of being the "killer"

146
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,880
and he says "It really wasn't me"

147
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
The tone of that phrase is crucial

148
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,800
Right

149
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,440
He is

150
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
"Really wasn't me"

151
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,760
That kind of

152
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Anyway among the three of them

153
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,840
I think the more suspicious ones

154
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,640
are still those two

155
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,840
Yeah

156
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,480
But he was indeed acting unusual

157
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,680
But you were acting strange too

158
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,320
I'm always loud and energetic

159
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,160
No, but you can usually come up with

160
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,200
"I'm a variety show entertainer"

161
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,840
I'm a

162
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,040
Old Liu definitely is

163
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,200
Now my name is

164
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,960
Liu Xiashui

165
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,480
Liu Xialai

166
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,120
can you speak

167
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,400
Northeastern English

168
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,800
July

169
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,760
That month wasn't delivered

170
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,320
July

171
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,880
July

172
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,920
He's getting a bit carried away, you know

173
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,320
Yes

174
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,000
He's getting carried away

175
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,360
He's really getting worked up, you know

176
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,240
No, the key is they're sitting diagonally

177
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,480
They keep glaring at each other

178
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,360
He keeps looking at me, I want to laugh

179
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,000
You know

180
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,680
It's fine if you laugh, I'm telling you

181
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,520
If you laugh

182
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
It's totally fine if you laugh

183
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,040
The problem is

184
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,560
I thought we

185
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,280
I'm an actor

186
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,760
Need to have conviction

187
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Can't keep breaking character

188
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,640
No, you keep doing that

189
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,040
Like this

190
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,880
No, it's been like this the whole time, you know

191
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,160
So we're choosing to go back?

192
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
Go back

193
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,720
I plan to with my brother

194
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,440
We jumped down from above

195
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,960
Yes

196
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,960
They want to go back thirty years

197
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,400
To when they didn't exist

198
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,520
Come on

199
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,640
Holding our return tickets

200
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,760
Goodbye, Zhou Keke

201
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,120
Goodbye

202
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,680
Let's go, friends

203
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,160
Goodbye, Zhou Keke

204
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,440
Keke

205
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,720
Uncle, I'll remember you forever

206
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,680
Let me tell you, uncle

207
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,320
How pitiful

208
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,400
What kind of place is this?

209
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,360
This is that...

210
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,480
Time tunnel

211
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,360
Just walk inside then

212
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,760
Go

213
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,240
Let's go

214
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,760
Let's go

215
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,960
You're in such a hurry, Guo Baoyou

216
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,040
You're so impatient

217
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,520
My Jingjing is waiting for me over there

218
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,400
I must go back

219
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,480
I need to save her

220
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,000
Teacher, we need to film each person individually

221
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,720
Just a short clip

222
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,000
How nice it would be if we were recording this in Yantai

223
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,840
Uncle

224
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,400
I'm so miserable

225
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,400
Have you been suffering today?

226
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm about to "die"

227
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,520
Since when did you know?

228
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,120
I knew since the day before yesterday

229
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,840
So you've known for quite a while

230
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,360
That's why he's acting so strange today

231
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,040
I'm not acting strange

232
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,360
I'm just afraid of the dark and couldn't figure it out

233
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,880
He was in that room

234
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,160
When we were putting up those posters

235
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,440
He didn't say a word

236
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,080
I was dumbfounded

237
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,040
No one prompted me, how could I speak up?

238
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,200
At the time I thought

239
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,720
He couldn't bear to push us

240
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,440
I thought he was being kind, right?

241
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,320
So sad

242
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,640
Look how angry you made this honest person

243
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,600
Isn't this bullying honest people?

244
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,920
It's showing on his face again

245
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,080
It's all over his face

246
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,200
This answer will affect

247
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,720
your mood for the next six months

248
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Let me tell you

249
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,360
I'm okay

250
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,760
This really is my uncle

251
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Really

252
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,800
Placing justice above family loyalty

253
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,840
It's my uncle

254
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,080
It really hurts

255
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
Yes, I can tell

256
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,240
Very contagious

257
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,040
So I got infected too

258
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,800
Not contagious at all

259
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,720
It's real

260
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,520
Because

261
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,080
Yes

262
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,160
Trust between people is fragile

263
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,040
But just

264
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,640
So you know

265
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,440
During my third case

266
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,000
After using the "murder" method

267
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,600
I didn't enter the room during the final review

268
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,000
Because I didn't want to tell you

269
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,760
That I once had "murderous" tendencies

270
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,000
I've used this method before

271
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,760
Why?

272
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,840
Trust between people

273
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,799
From that day on

274
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,400
You would never trust me again

275
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,559
You would always

276
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,960
Think I'm the "killer"

277
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,919
How wonderful for me

278
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,559
You've always trusted me

279
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,440
Mainly because you're not smart enough

280
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,360
You didn't get the "killer" script

281
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,000
Only those two got the "killer" script

282
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,640
Right

283
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,800
And him, it's already over

284
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,120
Haven't you seen me always pretending to be the "killer"

285
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Brother Bai is

286
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,280
Always dreamed of getting the "killer" script

287
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,800
What kind of place is this

288
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,080
Old Bai locked us in here

289
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
Now that you know the truth

290
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,680
Then you can just wait to "die"

291
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,120
Old Bai is trying to escape

292
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,080
He's really leaving

293
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's get ready for the interview

294
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,080
Bye-bye

295
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,600
Bye-bye

296
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,840
Shenshen went for the interview first

297
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,640
Bye-bye

298
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,840
Bye-bye

299
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,200
Alright

300
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,040
Bye-bye

301
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,120
This laser light is a bit too low

302
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,480
Right?

303
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,000
When I walk over there, my head already sticks out

304
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,480
So you can't go back

305
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,560
Because you're too tall

306
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,520
So you can't go back

307
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,400
You should appear smaller as you walk away

308
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,840
People appear smaller as they walk away

309
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,120
Making your own special effects, huh?

310
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Then you don't need to

311
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,000
You do

312
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,000
You do

313
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,040
Neither of us is better than the other

314
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,480
Which teacher will go first?

315
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:57,800
Come on

316
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,920
Come on, Ke Wuku

317
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,520
Go ahead

318
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,160
You go first

319
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,080
Camera rolling, recording

320
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Ready

321
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,480
Three

322
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,360
Two

323
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,840
One

324
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,400
Action

325
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,120
Good

326
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
Turn around

327
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,280
A bit reluctant

328
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,280
Reluctant?

329
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,000
That's enough

330
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,880
Give a slight smile

331
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,200
Disdain, very disdainful

332
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,600
Yes

333
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,160
That's called a disdainful turn

334
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,360
Okay, let's do it again

335
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Teacher, let's try this

336
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,280
Turn your head more this way

337
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,480
Try turning to the right

338
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,120
Start dancing in the time tunnel

339
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,040
Dancing

340
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,960
Dancing

341
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,200
Hello everyone, we are

342
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,160
Start recording

343
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,000
Three two one, action

344
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,800
Good

345
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,600
Turn around, turn your body more

346
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,960
A bit stiff

347
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,560
It's got that music video kind of shot

348
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,680
Why are we being so unfriendly?

349
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,560
Next

350
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,160
Okay, I'll go

351
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,760
Go

352
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,160
Come on

353
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,880
Let me tell you about this aspect

354
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,520
Big bro must have strong conviction

355
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,200
Walk to about...

356
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,040
...where your toes reach the oil drum

357
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,720
Right here

358
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,160
Yes

359
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,360
Then the turning point

360
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,640
Here

361
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,640
Look at the camera

362
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,320
Good

363
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,440
Action

364
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,800
So his turning point...

365
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,040
...should align with the top of his head

366
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,720
You guys are awkwardly positioned more outside

367
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,680
While we're standing more inside

368
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,040
We're right in the frame

369
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,600
We've basically walked to the very edge

370
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,120
Centered, yes

371
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,320
Ready

372
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,000
Three two one, action

373
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,280
That was too fast

374
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,160
In a hurry

375
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,840
Really in a hurry

376
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,760
He's catching a ride

377
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,680
Uncle

378
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,520
I came to join you

379
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,400
Nephew

380
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,360
How many levels do I need to rise to catch him

381
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,080
What's up?

382
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,240
Handsome, Brother Bai

383
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
Slow down, the focus isn't right

384
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,440
Three, two, one, go

385
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,200
Coming

386
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,960
Nice, Bai Sanwan's turn

387
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,560
Alright, you got this

388
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,800
So cool

389
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,280
Cool

390
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,360
Here I come

391
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,120
Come on, Old Liu's turn

392
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,040
Okay, let's go

393
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,440
You gotta do one too

394
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,040
That turn move

395
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,520
Do a Thomas flare or something

396
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,880
Headspin, start on the ground

397
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Three

398
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,800
Two

399
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,240
One

400
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,720
Go

401
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,400
Okay

402
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,160
Next teacher

403
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,800
Who goes first? Definitely that joke first

404
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,440
What I said earlier today was correct

405
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,080
Right?

406
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,000
You

407
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,760
No, they have one point

408
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,320
What I think is particularly reasonable is that

409
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,800
Come here, puppet

410
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,440
If you don't "die"

411
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,120
You'll definitely really "die"

412
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,840
If I don't "die"

413
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
None of you can come back

414
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,160
You convinced me

415
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,880
I think this makes perfect sense

416
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,200
Go ahead

417
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,640
You two

418
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,160
Hurry up and go

419
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,640
I'll do it

420
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,200
Wherever I walk and look back

421
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,280
It's about the same as reaching the oil drum position

422
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,000
What's written under this camera

423
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,320
Loser

424
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,960
Loser

425
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,720
Loser

426
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,760
No

427
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,600
Stop talking

428
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,840
Now it's discrimination

429
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,240
We

430
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,360
No

431
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,680
He's starting to discriminate

432
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,560
If none of us vote for you

433
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,160
How awkward would that feel

434
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,880
Yes

435
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,560
I have no presence

436
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,120
Can I now

437
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,080
"Quit" this drama I previously filmed

438
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,840
I feel like acting in a play with you

439
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
has affected me

440
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,320
Big bro, I was wrong

441
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
I won’t do it again, please don’t be angry

442
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,120
As expected, siblings

443
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,040
Why does Teacher Guo set the bar so high?

444
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,200
Who is he reluctant to part with?

445
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,560
Jiajia is my girlfriend.

446
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,880
Xiaojing is my girlfriend.

447
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,400
(I) found my father whom I haven't seen for eighteen years.

448
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
Next teacher, please.

449
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,680
Teacher Song.

450
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,600
Come, let me see how you walk. Come on.

451
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,680
Turn around for me.

452
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,720
You must swing that wig around.

453
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,400
Swing your hair.

454
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,360
Make sure to swing it in slow motion.

455
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,280
Swing it!

456
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,520
Where did Guo Qilin turn just now?

457
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,320
I need to be further back than him.

458
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,280
I'll enter the frame when you turn around.

459
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,280
Okay, ready, action.

460
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,200
Walk forward.

461
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,560
Okay, go.

462
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,120
Why are you... You're walking the red carpet.

463
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,200
Lingering for so long.

464
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,400
None of your business.

465
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,680
Pretend to take photos.

466
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,760
Turn around in one swift motion.

467
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,240
Take a look.

468
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,120
You're walking the red carpet.

469
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,040
Then foreign reporters point their big cameras at you.

470
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,200
Hurry up and go.

471
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,400
Let's go.

472
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,520
Go.

473
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,320
In the end, perhaps

474
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,760
Zhou Keke might have to film one too

475
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,880
Actually, he went with us

476
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
Do you think it's possible

477
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,320
That after we leave first, we'll discover

478
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
Right, that he's all alone

479
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Forgot about one thing

480
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:39,920
Right

481
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,840
Wait

482
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,440
He ran over

483
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,960
He went to save us

484
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,360
Yes

485
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,800
After we left, it started

486
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,400
Our room is going to be rented out

487
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,080
Sincerely (For Rent)

488
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,600
July 30, 2019

489
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,280
Three years ago

490
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,200
Then Keke will come too

491
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,760
702

492
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,680
702 is his

493
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,320
Keke's Room

494
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,960
Here's what we'll do

495
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,160
I'll move into 702

496
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,480
Let's switch rooms this time

497
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,840
Unbeatable sea view

498
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,800
Come, everyone come see

499
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,560
This is our rare seaside room

500
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,600
If we move to 702, we'll

501
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,720
Let's switch rooms this time

502
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,120
Right, let's all go to 702

503
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,680
Seaside room

504
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,440
That works too

505
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:14,880
Okay

506
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,520
You're the mastermind behind this, right?

507
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,600
I suppose so.

508
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,800
But I never expected...

509
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,520
...that I'd be the mastermind.

510
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,880
It's making me feel awful.

511
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,440
This is so hard—how do I pretend not to know?

512
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,360
It hurts so much—why did I have to lie?

513
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
It's just too painful.

514
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,880
Help me.

515
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,119
Hello

516
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:12,760
Friend

517
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:14,960
Hello everyone

518
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,760
We came up to say hello

519
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,800
We'll be neighbors from now on

520
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,359
We can look out for each other

521
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,119
Okay

522
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,000
Thank you

523
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,640
No problem

524
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,800
That's a wrap

525
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,840
Thank you everyone

526
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,960
We've finished filming

527
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,560
Production is complete

528
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,280
It's wrapped, right?

529
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,080
Thank you for your hard work

530
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,600
The story of Apartment 11

531
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
comes to an end here

532
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,160
I'm sorry

533
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,080
Forget it

534
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,320
If apologies worked

535
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,240
what would we need Old Bai for?

536
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,600
Right

537
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,120
Let's go

538
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,680
Keep it up

539
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,720
Camera rolling

540
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,680
Okay, camera rolling

541
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,080
Are we ready?

542
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,920
Liu Yuning's interview

543
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,760
INTO1 Zhou Keyu's interview

544
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,640
Slate

545
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,000
Zhou Shen Episode 10 slate

546
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,640
After finishing this season's recording

547
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,720
Let's briefly evaluate

548
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,960
our friends

549
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,760
A quick evaluation of our friends

550
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,000
Let's start with Zuer

551
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,440
She's a very cheerful girl

552
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,120
She always has this

553
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,560
carefree

554
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,680
All burdens seem

555
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,080
to lighten around her

556
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,920
So being with her

557
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,400
you get infected by

558
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,680
her happiness

559
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,080
As for Teacher Song

560
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,320
he maintains his habit of

561
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,760
dropping shocking remarks

562
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,320
You can try guessing my name

563
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,200
"Chou" (ugly)

564
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,040
You like stalking women

565
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,600
Your brother likes stalking men

566
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,680
He already knows your secret

567
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,880
Then you'll have to "silence" him

568
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,160
My logic is crystal clear

569
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,080
In many cases

570
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,800
She also provided

571
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,000
Some crucial evidence

572
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,880
Throughout this process

573
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,200
She's been growing continuously

574
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,440
I feel quite happy

575
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,920
To have this opportunity to collaborate with her

576
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,480
The "killer" put the plant nutrient

577
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:01,880
label

578
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,640
on the "Drive You Crazy" bottle

579
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,480
It was the cat that broke it

580
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,600
Because the cat's paw prints

581
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,840
Also went this direction

582
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,200
Right

583
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,320
Xiao Wang originally intended

584
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,560
To follow the plan below

585
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,000
If he fails three times

586
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Burn it directly

587
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,920
But there must be someone else

588
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,560
Who would "eliminate" Xiao Wang too

589
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,160
Using a brick

590
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,680
To "take out" both of them

591
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,240
As for Guo Qilin

592
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,440
Guo Qilin is truly amazing

593
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,960
All the puzzle-solving

594
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,440
Including logical reasoning

595
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,360
Is extremely meticulous

596
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,760
I'm impressed by him again

597
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,880
Really outstanding

598
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,240
Zhang Ti might know

599
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,520
About this structure on the 5th floor

600
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,680
But he might not know

601
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,840
About this structure on the 6th floor

602
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
There's a bloodstain on the door

603
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,680
Take the bottle to see if it can be opened

604
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,120
It opened

605
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,600
I really like Qilin

606
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,720
Moreover, he's

607
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Someone who makes people feel secure

608
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,920
Most of the time

609
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,800
As soon as it gets dark

610
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,680
If Guo Qilin were beside me,

611
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,360
I would grab his clothes.

612
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,560
In that moment, you'd feel that

613
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,320
he's right next to me,

614
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
and he's also scared,

615
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,720
so I feel safe too.

616
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Just watch as it turns around,

617
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,800
you can turn it around now.

618
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,840
Power outage

619
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,800
No, I'm scared

620
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,520
I'm scared too

621
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,480
No need

622
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,640
I think Guo Qilin

623
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,320
has this kind of magical power

624
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,880
He makes you feel

625
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,560
very safe

626
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,320
Liu Xialai

627
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:24,960
is very serious

628
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,680
and actively searching for clues

629
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,800
There's something here

630
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,520
What?

631
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,080
I don't know

632
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,080
I found a remote control

633
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,120
This must be useful

634
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,880
Let me smell it

635
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,480
Sorry, everyone

636
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,120
Here we go again

637
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,280
He's also someone who's always

638
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,320
trying his best to keep the atmosphere lively.

639
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,800
If you keep talking, I'll swallow this key.

640
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,560
Can you reveal some future information

641
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,080
to us?

642
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,480
Sure.

643
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,920
The next Double Color Ball numbers are...

644
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Our Keke is very gentle,

645
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,760
she never talks tough.

646
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,040
Right before leaving,

647
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
"Teng Zhongjie, you're so mean!"

648
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,640
"How amazing to have such a perfect ex-boyfriend!"

649
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
Seriously, why should I keep playing with you guys?

650
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,880
Just... go ascend to heaven already.

651
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,400
Right?

652
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
This is actually his way of showing care,

653
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,120
he wants everyone to be in

654
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,200
a relatively comfortable environment.

655
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,960
As for Teacher Bai Yu,

656
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,360
suddenly showing respect

657
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,080
because we've been taking advantage of him for half the season.

658
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,680
When you first meet Teacher Bai Yu,

659
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,640
you might think he's introverted

660
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,280
or even that

661
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,680
he won't initiate conversation.

662
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,640
But as you get to know him better,

663
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,080
you'll discover he's actually very cheerful

664
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,600
and quite a boyish guy.

665
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,040
An Hong,

666
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,160
I miss ya.

667
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,960
Let's put on a little act later.

668
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,480
You're all gonna "die."

669
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,480
Another doll.

670
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,000
Often he'll joke around with you

671
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,880
or play some pranks on us.

672
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,280
No NPCs come to scare us -

673
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,640
it's always Bai Sanwan who scares us.

674
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,920
What's this?

675
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,880
This unlucky guy always pulls this stunt

676
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,640
Hope he never grows up

677
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,360
Wish he could stay forever

678
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,840
just keep that childlike side

679
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,800
Zhou Keke

680
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,560
He's quite interesting

681
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,640
And then

682
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,920
always carrying his doll around

683
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,200
because it's named Zhou Biaobiao

684
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,840
That's right, I'm Zhou Biaobiao

685
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,800
Match successful

686
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,360
Look at this

687
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,000
I actually believed it

688
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,560
This sound came from you

689
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,040
Not me

690
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,000
It was him

691
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,920
Guo Baoyou

692
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,560
You need to discuss with everyone

693
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,600
Otherwise after your discussion

694
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,560
No one will understand

695
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,720
With Zhou Shen, since before

696
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,760
we were actually quite close

697
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,720
But I didn't know before

698
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
he was so timid

699
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,640
The production team asked me

700
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,800
"How's your courage?"

701
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,400
I didn't believe I'd be the worst

702
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,160
But after arriving

703
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,080
I found Zhou Shen was about the same as me

704
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,760
Luckily there's someone equally timid

705
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,440
keeping me company

706
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,080
I'm afraid someone's behind me

707
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,040
There is someone, don't know who

708
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,120
I'm scared someone might suddenly appear behind me

709
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,880
What's this?

710
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,520
It's grass

711
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,360
The light's on

712
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,200
It's lit

713
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,120
But look

714
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,640
The real mastermind was him

715
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,000
This was completely unexpected

716
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,360
Hidden depths

717
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,880
Ke Wuku gives off

718
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,360
a similar vibe to Bai Sanwan

719
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,280
Everyone can notice

720
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,520
In earlier episodes when Ke Wuku laughed

721
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,200
it was either

722
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,600
"Okay"

723
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,040
or just

724
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,400
But in later episodes

725
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,720
after getting to know him better

726
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,280
Ke Wuku actually

727
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,480
started making that kind of laughter

728
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,120
You'll notice that

729
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,160
he's gradually starting to relax

730
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,400
just an ordinary guy

731
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,840
Okay

732
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,440
an average confident man

733
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,120
How do you survive in Northeast China, bro?

734
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,280
Before one wave subsides

735
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,520
another wave rises

736
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,200
You

737
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,680
INTO1's Zhou Keyu is

738
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,520
quick-witted

739
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,280
Sometimes when he speaks

740
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,000
and thinks

741
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
he's quite smart

742
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,440
If he's facing the mirror

743
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,960
he needs to turn left to face the window

744
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,600
If he's facing

745
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,520
the sensor cabinet

746
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,920
he needs to turn right to face the window

747
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,520
There's someone

748
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,440
who learned about

749
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,760
Song Huo and Zhang's stand-in's plan

750
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,280
plan

751
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,000
So when Song Huo went to the meeting

752
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,800
he cut the power

753
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,440
It seems only when the lights are off

754
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,280
will the curtain come down

755
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,200
As soon as the lights are on

756
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,480
the curtain automatically rises

757
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,840
Kewuku's rational thinking ability

758
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,000
was something I hadn't anticipated

759
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,040
Yes, it was quite an unexpected discovery

760
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,760
INTO1 Zhou Keyu's preparation interview

761
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,040
End clapperboard

762
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,840
Guo Qilin

763
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,600
"Let's Begin Deduction"

764
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,800
Final interview

765
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,200
End

766
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,760
Zhou Keke's filming is complete

767
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,840
Wrapping up

768
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,760
Three, two, one

769
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,480
Apartment 11, here we come

770
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,240
Bai Song 1 Guo Zhou team formed

771
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,760
Liu 1 Ku

772
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,400
Three, two, one

773
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,320
Say cheese

774
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,880
It's time to say goodbye

775
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,880
Goodbye

776
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,640
Goodbye

777
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
How could it play as

778
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,320
suspenseful background music

779
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,160
It's their birthday

780
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,920
Nowadays it's very popular to sing that song at birthdays

781
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,680
"Say goodbye to all your troubles"

782
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,840
Say goodbye to all your troubles

783
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,360
Say hi hi

784
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,000
As soon as she enters

785
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,680
Just wish her a happy birthday

786
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,600
Where did Song Zuer (Song Piaoliang) go

787
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,360
She went to celebrate her birthday

788
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,920
When she comes in later

789
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,640
Say something

790
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,600
Scold her once

791
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,200
Act like a diva

792
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,040
I don't care, I'm gonna scold her anyway

793
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,160
Maybe we should talk about this later?

794
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,200
She might have been kidnapped

795
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,320
Let's go save her

796
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,200
That's unlikely

797
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,800
No

798
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,040
Let's just properly celebrate her birthday

799
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,440
Can't even let someone have peace on their birthday

800
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,040
Only appearing for five seconds on her birthday

801
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
My birthday

802
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,480
That's it

803
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,320
I think we could do it this way

804
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,120
Hello everyone

805
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,640
It sounds like firecrackers

806
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,080
Firecrackers

807
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,920
No, it's not about silencing people

808
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,240
No

809
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,440
Is this something outside of the program?

810
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,680
This is too weird

811
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:55,480
Happy birthday to you

812
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,760
Kinda creepy

813
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,520
Happy birthday

814
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,760
Make a wish

815
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,160
Your breathing is uneven, look at this

816
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,640
How strange

817
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,160
You scared me "to death"

818
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,680
Got lipstick all over my teeth

819
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,800
Our Zuer's lipstick doesn't smudge

820
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,560
What's wrong with you?

821
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,520
But this cake is beautiful

822
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,160
Thank you

823
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,200
Happy birthday

824
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,400
Happy birthday

825
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,760
Come on, won't you try some?

826
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,920
Have a taste

827
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,880
Must give to our eldest brother first

828
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,440
It's fine

829
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,200
Eldest brother

830
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,960
Eldest brother eats first

831
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,440
What are you doing?

832
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Eldest brother eats first

833
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,560
We'll let eldest brother eat first

834
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,120
Here

835
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,000
Here, eldest brother

836
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,200
This is really... I'm speechless

837
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Here, our second eldest brother

838
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,160
Second brother, you try some

839
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,200
You're the second brother, right?

840
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,560
I thought you were applauding for my beauty

841
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,200
Surprised me today with sudden applause

842
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,360
You always amaze us

843
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,520
There's a little girl here

844
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,720
It even has eyelashes

845
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,640
Even the eyelashes are edible

846
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,680
Really?

847
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,880
Can we eat these eyelashes?

848
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,600
Liu Xialai

849
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,320
Little girl

850
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,360
This can be scraped off

851
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,520
Guo Qilin (Guo Baoyou)

852
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,360
Do you hate me this much?

853
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,440
This kid will... if touched

854
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,840
Don’t eat the cake, or you’ll "die"

855
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,040
Don’t eat the cake, or you’ll "die"

856
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,480
This is a real birthday

857
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,120
Real birthday

858
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,320
It's so delicious

859
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,240
Just wanted to give a blessing

860
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,480
Just wanted to put up a banner

861
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,960
Banner

862
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,360
She came in and didn’t notice at all

863
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,520
This is a birthday scene

864
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah

865
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,240
Yeah, you can see it as soon as you enter

866
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,120
She came in and didn’t notice at all

867
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,080
She said

868
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,720
And then suddenly

869
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,080
Right.

870
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,840
Suddenly, firecrackers started going off here.

871
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,800
I can't even hear myself speak.

872
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,440
The most eco-friendly firecrackers in history.

873
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:05,880
Yeah.

874
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,280
Thank you, everyone.

875
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,160
Happy birthday.

876
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,200
Happy birthday.

877
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,600
Welcome to Apartment 11

878
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,040
I am

879
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,880
the trainee manager of Apartment 11

880
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,480
Xiao He

881
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,840
Workers unite, work spirit alive

882
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,720
I always hear at midnight

883
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,840
a woman's crying

884
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,680
Sister (Zhenzhen) suddenly "died"

885
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,960
Zhenzhen

886
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,800
Who is Zhenzhen?

887
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,400
Anyway, the things I want

888
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,600
I always get in the end

889
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,160
I got plastic surgery, so did you

890
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,640
I got plastic surgery, so did you

891
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,400
You're "sick"

892
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,080
As far as I know

893
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,000
I know nothing about this

894
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,120
I'm Manager Ying

895
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,080
I didn't "kill" that person

896
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,800
It's related to an experience of mine

897
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,200
that I can't talk about

898
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,440
It's related

899
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,680
Surprise

900
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,880
Do I look like a nine to you?

901
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,000
Don't look for dad

902
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,720
Had motive

903
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,280
Admit it

904
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,760
Has nothing to do with me

905
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,040
I believe bad people should get their comeuppance

906
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,960
It stinks

907
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,880
Keep him away from me

908
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,920
They were "killed" by fire today.

909
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,160
Let's give them a warning first.

910
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,080
If you try to run away,

911
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,960
they'll catch you.

912
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,720
Wait.

913
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,480
Welcome.

914
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,960
I can't acknowledge you,

915
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,120
because I can't prove myself yet.

916
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,640
Inside this doll museum,

917
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,440
some who entered never came out.

918
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,680
As long as I "kill" that doll maker,

919
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,560
my daughter can be revived.

920
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,160
Only when the doll maker "dies"

921
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,800
will the dolls become uncontrollable.

922
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,880
I'm Zhao Budao.

923
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,240
I can actually foresee your futures.

924
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,200
The people inside,

925
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,400
that group from the Sleepless Convenience Store...

926
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,640
Don't think turning off the lights

927
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,880
means we can't find you. Where are you?

928
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,120
If you don't want this exposed,

929
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,800
then clean it up thoroughly for me.

930
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,840
You show no respect to me as security.

931
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,080
That woman's "death"

932
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,160
has nothing to do with me.

933
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,000
Bamei is the villain.

934
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,120
I'm an orphan.

935
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,920
Give it to me.

936
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,080
What suits me belongs to me.

937
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,840
I accidentally pushed her,

938
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,440
and right then

939
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:50,920
she "died."

940
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,800
Don't come any closer.

941
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,680
I'll take her and calm her down.

942
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,000
Maybe he found out

943
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,760
that I locked Xiaojing here.
