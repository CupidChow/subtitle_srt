1
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,560
I'm Guo Baoyou, a mystery novelist.

2
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,400
I've already moved into

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,160
Apartment 11 for a week now.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,360
Looking back, this week felt incredibly long.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,240
May 6th, 10:30 PM.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,120
"Suicide."

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,840
Aren’t you all curious about that woman

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,320
in red who jumped off the building?

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,440
Zhenzhen was "stabbed to death" in the theater.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,440
Along with the other new residents,

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,800
during the evidence collection,

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,400
we identified suspects:

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,200
Bai Sanwan,

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,280
Cao Yangguang,

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,160
Screenwriter Song,

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,960
and me.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,920
Every suspect

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,120
had some connection

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,240
with the "victim," Zhenzhen.

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,520
To uncover the truth, our detective team

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,680
discovered that the doorframe between the room and hallway

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,520
could rotate.

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,920
This door can actually spin—

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,200
there’s a gap in the middle.

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,160
We deduced this was one of

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,480
the "killer’s" methods.

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,480
It moved!

28
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,840
One, two, three.

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,680
The truth is gradually coming to light

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,280
Through continuous reasoning and review

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,920
There's something

32
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Stop

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,200
Another wooden box

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,760
Hurry

35
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,240
We, Bai, Song, Guo, and Zhou

36
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,520
Have identified the "culprit"

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,920
It's screenwriter Song

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,640
This season will unfold over eleven weeks

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,680
to tell the story of Apartment No. 11 in Tui City

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,600
Six players will move in as new tenants

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,720
and reside in Apartment No. 11

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,400
They will be drawn into bizarre cases

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,240
By forming the "Apartment Detective Team"

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,320
they'll visit different floors

45
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,160
befriend various long-term residents

46
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,040
solve their own identity mysteries

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,120
and uncover secrets behind the cases

48
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,000
The first six cases

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,840
will reveal one new tenant's story each week

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,680
The complex relationships between new and old tenants

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,240
will gradually come to light

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,720
Starting from the seventh case

53
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,720
all storylines will intertwine

54
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,080
As truths are uncovered layer by layer

55
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,000
every choice made by the new tenants

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,480
will influence the story's direction

57
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,800
and final outcome

58
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,840
In each case

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
the detective team must at the crime scene

60
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,280
identify the "victim"

61
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,600
and based on clues

62
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,240
pinpoint relevant suspects

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,800
Note:

64
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,320
Suspects are not limited to

65
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,240
Apartment No. 11 staff and visitors

66
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,600
Even within the detective team

67
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,760
there may be suspects

68
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,320
After gathering suspects

69
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,120
the team will interrogate them

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,720
and re-examine based on testimonies

71
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,240
finally voting to identify the "true culprit"

72
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,600
Only the "true culprit" is permitted to lie

73
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,400
Only by finding the real "culprit"

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,080
can the player be considered victorious

75
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,120
Players who vote correctly

76
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,040
will receive a golden key

77
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,480
If the player is the "culprit"

78
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,720
successfully escaping will grant them a golden key

79
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,720
Make yourself at home

80
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,160
Treat it like your own place

81
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,640
Here

82
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,160
Have a banana

83
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,240
Wait, you called us here early in the morning

84
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,000
at 10:30 AM for what?

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What's going on?

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Exactly

87
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,720
I'm still half-asleep

88
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,480
Haven't even changed clothes

89
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,480
So last week,

90
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,640
how did we feel?

91
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,440
Were we truly able to...

92
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,960
live up to the title of "detectives"?

93
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,520
Sorry,

94
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,280
I think the four of us did live up to it.

95
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,200
Yes, exactly.

96
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,240
The four of us did meet the standard.

97
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,120
The four of us.

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,840
What does this have to do with you?

99
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,440
At least he didn't "kill" his own teammate.

100
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,480
Right?

101
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,120
I just moved in.

102
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,440
He voted out his own lover.

103
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,600
I love the older sister (Zhenzhen).

104
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,720
I'm the younger sister (Jiajia).

105
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,040
This is my first time...

106
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,360
someone has confessed to me.

107
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,840
I love the older sister (Zhenzhen).

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,279
The person I voted for today is...

109
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,720
Jiajia.

110
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,200
"Scumbag."

111
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,000
"Scumbag."

112
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,120
"Scumbag."

113
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,320
But I love the older sister (Zhenzhen).

114
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,280
How dare you call him that?

115
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,200
You're the "pervert" here.

116
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,000
No,

117
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,680
that's not...

118
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,480
How could I be a "pervert"?

119
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,800
So I think we need to improve...

120
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,600
our detective skills.

121
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,080
That's why I'm leading everyone in a deduction game.

122
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,080
This reasoning game

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,960
is called "Sea Turtle Soup"

124
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,760
Have you played it before?

125
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,240
I know

126
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,760
You know

127
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,000
Does everything except writing

128
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,320
Right?

129
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,480
Exactly

130
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,040
I'm doing this for

131
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,280
gathering material and inspiration

132
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,280
Right, you're into mystery stories, aren't you?

133
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,640
Yes

134
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,280
Mystery novels

135
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,160
Of course I write

136
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,800
Then I

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,960
Then I'll pose a question

138
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,160
Go ahead

139
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,600
Because the older brother didn't like ice cream

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,200
he "killed" his younger brother

141
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,600
Is it because

142
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,240
the younger brother loved ice cream?

143
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,160
Yes

144
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,640
Really?

145
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,640
Did the ice cream seller say

146
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,760
"If you don't eat ice cream..."

147
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,160
Irrelevant

148
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,280
A "crime of passion"?

149
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Irrelevant

150
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,800
Did the younger brother love his older brother very much?

151
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,920
Irrelevant

152
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,000
The three of us are irrelevant

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,240
People unrelated to this matter

154
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,440
Let's go home first, okay?

155
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,720
Come on

156
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,880
Did the younger brother

157
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,160
"die" because he couldn't get ice cream?

158
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,920
What's this about?

159
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,560
What?

160
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,760
Why is there a woman crying?

161
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,600
Is she crying or laughing?

162
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,560
Check if there's anyone at the door.

163
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,080
At the door?

164
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,480
There's nothing at the door.

165
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,040
It's not from the door.

166
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,680
It's coming from this hallway.

167
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,360
It seems to be coming through the pipes.

168
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,920
Last week,

169
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,960
Hao the cleaner said

170
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,080
he often hears a woman crying.

171
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,800
Is it the same one?

172
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,560
This Apartment 11

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,680
has always been strange.

174
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,640
I often hear at midnight

175
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,600
a woman crying.

176
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,080
Then let's sit and keep talking.

177
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,160
Sit.

178
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,960
It's nothing.

179
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,840
I think we misheard.

180
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,480
Brothers are not human.

181
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,320
Right?

182
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,400
No.

183
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,200
You sit down.

184
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,040
Sit down.

185
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,120
Don't cry.

186
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,040
It's her.

187
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,840
We found out, it's her.

188
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,440
It's nothing.

189
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,560
I think we misheard.

190
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,920
Let me repeat the question.

191
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,000
So,

192
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,040
Because the older brother doesn't like ice pops,

193
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,560
the smart doorbell detected someone lingering.

194
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,280
What

195
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,840
What

196
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,360
Nothing there

197
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,760
Right

198
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,720
That was the electronic peephole

199
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,520
It captured something

200
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,200
Is this the one that beeps?

201
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,800
Press this?

202
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,520
This one?

203
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,000
Play

204
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,280
Click

205
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,840
This isn’t from just now

206
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,040
What time is this?

207
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,600
This is from just now

208
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,720
10:49

209
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,880
He's looking inside

210
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,040
It's a guy

211
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,640
This person often appears at my doorstep

212
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,560
Do you know him?

213
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,560
Do you know him?

214
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,200
Do you know him?

215
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,840
I don't know him

216
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,040
Is he your younger brother?

217
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,520
You like following women

218
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Your brother likes following men

219
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,480
He wants to send a thousand boys home

220
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,120
It says

221
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,800
Send a thousand girls home

222
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
You're the first one

223
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,760
I'm the first one? That's so unfortunate

224
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,240
Yes

225
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,360
No, this person really

226
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,480
often appears at my doorstep

227
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,320
But

228
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,120
Does he just take a look and leave every time?

229
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,760
Yes, haven't you encountered him?

230
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,440
No

231
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,400
We don't have a peephole

232
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,480
Did he leave something

233
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,520
at the door?

234
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,720
Has he ever left anything for you?

235
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,760
Like little notes or something?

236
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,280
No, nothing at all

237
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,679
No

238
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,400
He

239
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,799
How frequent is this?

240
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,720
I've lived here for a week

241
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,840
He's come about four or five times

242
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,560
Have you had any conflicts with anyone?

243
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,720
No conflicts

244
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,000
What conflicts could there be?

245
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,520
Then why would he come to look at your place?

246
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,400
He didn't come to ours

247
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Everyone's

248
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,560
paying property fees

249
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,720
Everyone's

250
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,360
Just right

251
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,000
Saves me from notifying everyone

252
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,680
What's wrong?

253
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,560
Even Xiao He could startle us

254
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,680
The way you three were just now

255
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,640
Perfectly synchronized

256
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,320
Here's the thing

257
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,880
In my door's peephole

258
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,640
in the recording

259
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320
someone just came to check on us

260
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,280
Do you know him?

261
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,120
These eyes

262
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,640
Do you know this person?

263
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,120
You know him

264
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,520
Who is it?

265
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
He's one of our service staff

266
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,400
If you're going to be like this

267
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,560
We won't pay the property fees

268
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,000
This has scared us all

269
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,760
We just didn't pay

270
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,320
That's why this happened

271
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,400
This is intimidation

272
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,600
That was someone you sent to threaten us

273
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,360
He is

274
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,720
an employee from a delivery company

275
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,360
named Song Huo

276
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,680
Did you order something?

277
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,600
No, I didn't

278
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,280
Really didn't?

279
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,320
Right, I finished decorating earlier

280
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,760
He didn't knock either

281
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,640
No knock at all, completely silent

282
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,800
Yes, he just took a look at my place

283
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,480
Should we call and ask him?

284
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,280
Then I'll ask him

285
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,800
What exactly was he delivering?

286
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:27,880
Hey

287
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,080
Hey

288
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,600
Was that a man or woman screaming?

289
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,960
A cat

290
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,640
The sound afterward was a cat

291
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,840
At first it was a man being...

292
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,520
Hey, Song Huo

293
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,880
Call again to check if he's okay

294
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,320
Alright

295
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,120
I just heard on the phone...

296
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,520
I think I heard some static noise

297
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,320
Did you guys hear it?

298
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,680
Did you?

299
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,440
Speak louder

300
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,800
I heard it

301
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,680
I'll try calling again

302
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,840
Then I heard screaming

303
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
First there was a scream

304
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,040
Then a "zzt zzt" sound

305
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,920
Followed by a cat's meow

306
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,000
Can't get through

307
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,280
Damn it

308
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,000
Wait a bit longer

309
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,920
He might have just fallen

310
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,360
Okay

311
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,480
What's wrong with this Song Huo?

312
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,000
Let's call the police.

313
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,360
Let's not investigate blindly this time.

314
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,680
Let's call the police.

315
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
You should move out of this apartment.

316
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,480
Let's call the police.

317
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:30,880
I...

318
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,320
We should kick her out of this apartment.

319
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay?

320
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,120
You're not suitable to live here.

321
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,840
I...

322
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,080
I'm in favor of calling the police.

323
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,960
Let's call the police.

324
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,600
We...

325
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,160
Let's leave it to the law.

326
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,040
Let the law handle it.

327
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,560
Xiao He.

328
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,040
Xiao He.

329
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,400
I'm Deputy Manager Fu from property management.

330
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,560
The sixth floor suddenly lost power.

331
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,280
Go check immediately.

332
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,600
What's wrong with the circuit?

333
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,760
The sixth floor.

334
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,840
The sixth floor is out of power.

335
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,280
The sixth floor is my room.

336
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,040
It's my room.

337
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,120
It's also my room.

338
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
The entire sixth floor lost power.

339
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,440
There was static noise on the phone again.

340
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,720
Could it be Song Huo on the sixth floor?

341
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,520
Got electrocuted?

342
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,360
Possibly.

343
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,960
Let's go.

344
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,920
The power's out. You're in danger now.

345
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
How about this

346
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,160
I have a flashlight

347
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,640
Then I'll go to the first floor

348
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,760
to get something for everyone

349
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,160
the Zhenguoli reasoning kit

350
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,760
Then I'll come find you later

351
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,520
Then we'll check the sixth floor

352
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,880
Okay, I'll find you later

353
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,920
Let's go

354
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,440
Goodbye, Barley

355
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:25,960
Goodbye

356
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,520
Stay at home

357
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:26,920
Watch the house

358
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,720
Stay home and behave

359
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,800
Wait

360
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,080
Don't be like this

361
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
Bro

362
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:52,960
Bro

363
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,200
Slow down

364
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,400
You're a major suspect

365
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
No, can we just hold on a bit?

366
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,520
No, just hold on

367
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,040
Come on

368
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,000
Just grab my clothes

369
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,600
Kewuku, it's up to you

370
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,640
Just hold onto my clothes

371
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,880
Don't control my hand

372
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,720
Just hold onto my clothes

373
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,920
My clothes fell off

374
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,960
Either put your clothes on properly or...

375
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,280
Fine

376
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,960
Why is he always scolding me?

377
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,760
He's always scolding me

378
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,560
I think there's something about this box

379
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,960
There must be something inside, right?

380
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,600
Wait a moment

381
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,040
Bro, can you not be so rough?

382
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,440
Bro

383
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,280
What?

384
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,760
There's someone ahead.

385
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,560
Why is there a cat here?

386
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,840
I'm terrified of cats.

387
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,400
You fear cats, we fear you.

388
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:01,840
Friend...

389
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,040
Are you a resident here?

390
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,040
Are you a resident here, friend?

391
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,200
What are you doing?

392
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,120
We want to come in.

393
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,640
Stop talking.

394
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,240
You can't come in.

395
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,040
We just want to come in.

396
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,640
The power's back.

397
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,480
You can't come to my place.

398
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,080
No, why do you want to come to my place?

399
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,880
I don't even know you.

400
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,840
Power's back on.

401
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,200
Electricity's restored.

402
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,640
Sorry, miss.

403
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,680
Aren't you afraid of cats?

404
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,760
We'll help you catch the cat.

405
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,000
That cat is our friend.

406
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,560
So scary.

407
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,040
Why is there cat meowing again?

408
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,560
No.

409
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,120
Let us help you catch the cat, okay?

410
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,200
We'll help you catch the cat.

411
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,360
This is a cat.

412
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,240
When we called Song Huo,

413
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,400
there seemed to be faint cat meows in the background.

414
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,560
Cat meowing.

415
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,120
I heard there's a cat in her room.

416
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,760
There might be some connection.

417
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
Where is this sound coming from?

418
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,640
Too terrifying.

419
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,280
Where did you see the cat just now?

420
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,480
I didn't see it.

421
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,320
I only heard it meowing.

422
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,920
What do you do for a living?

423
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,640
What do I do?

424
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,280
Can't you tell?

425
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,880
I'm obviously a big influencer.

426
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
So arrogant.

427
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,440
Why are you so arrogant?

428
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,880
It seems to be inside here

429
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,080
Right over here

430
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,800
It's right inside here

431
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
Here

432
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,200
There might be some secret hidden inside.

433
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,600
Why is there a hole here?

434
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,200
Because (one day) a hole suddenly appeared.

435
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,120
Then I thought it was really strange.

436
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,240
So I went to find the security guard.

437
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,040
And had it sealed up.

438
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,320
Kick.

439
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,800
Cool.

440
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,000
Of course (I thought) it was weird.

441
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,640
No, seriously, why is there a hole here?

442
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,800
Alright then,

443
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,360
you go inside.

444
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,240
You go look for the cat first.

445
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,000
Meanwhile, I'll go call security.

446
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
to fix this place up.

447
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,120
I think

448
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,760
first we need to figure this out.

449
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,000
Before one problem is even solved,

450
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,120
another one pops up.

451
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:53,960
Come on.

452
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,960
Can everyone go in?

453
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,920
Leave someone to watch our backs.

454
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,119
Hey, you there.

455
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,680
Guo Baoyou.

456
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,400
Baoyou's here.

457
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,720
We always end up scaring ourselves.

458
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,400
Can you handle it?

459
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,000
I can.

460
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,839
Bro, turn on the light.

461
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,880
Bro, switch on the light.

462
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,560
Turn it on.

463
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,000
I was trying to save power.

464
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,960
No need to save it.

465
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,319
I don't really trust you.

466
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,200
I don't trust you.

467
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,160
I don't believe in you.

468
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,119
Alright, let's go.

469
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,079
Let's move.

470
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,119
You'll scare us.

471
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,920
There's light ahead.

472
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,079
I don't believe it.

473
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,400
Come on bro, let's go together.

474
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,480
Let's go together.

475
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,520
We'll go together.

476
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,080
There's light ahead.

477
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,360
Light up ahead.

478
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,280
This should lead us out, right?

479
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,360
It's a door.

480
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:39,960
Isn't it?

481
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,680
What is this?

482
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,760
Wait a second.

483
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,960
There's a lever here.

484
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,000
Where does this lead?

485
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,360
Over here

486
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,640
There's a door open here

487
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,680
There's a door open here

488
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,360
Use that stick to push the door open

489
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,240
See what's inside

490
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,360
Can we turn on the lights in here?

491
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,360
What's over there?

492
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,840
That's a dead end, right?

493
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,320
No.

494
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,600
There's something over there too.

495
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,680
We can go through.

496
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,080
Let's go this way.

497
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,920
After all this time, it's really...

498
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,320
There are many cardboard boxes here.

499
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:35,960
Check inside the boxes.

500
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,520
See if there are any useful tools.

501
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,320
There's a room ahead.

502
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,960
There's a pair of rubber gloves here.

503
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,840
Insulated gloves.

504
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,040
A cat.

505
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,400
There's a cat.

506
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,720
There's something here.

507
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,600
Someone "died"

508
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,760
His hand is on the wire.

509
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,000
The one who was lying at my doorstep earlier.

510
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,720
This should be Xiao Song, the delivery guy.

511
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,560
Put on your gloves

512
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,800
Then take his phone

513
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,280
Guo Baoyou

514
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,960
Check his phone

515
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,280
Check the phone

516
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
It's the missed call from the administrator Xiao He

517
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,160
In this bag

518
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,880
Look

519
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,120
Pick up this bag and take a look

520
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,440
He's wearing a really nice watch

521
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,680
You guys

522
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,760
Are you inside?

523
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,840
You guys

524
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,920
Are you inside?

525
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,240
Hey, Xiao He is coming

526
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,360
What's wrong?

527
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,040
Come here, Xiao Song seems...

528
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,160
Maybe we should come out first

529
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,200
Xiao Song seems to have been electrocuted

530
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,400
Get out quickly!

531
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,240
This is so dangerous

532
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,080
Let's get out first

533
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,960
Xiao He is coming over

534
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,080
Come out quickly!

535
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,120
How dangerous!

536
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,000
Hurry up and get out first

537
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,520
His watch is nice

538
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,640
Don't press your hand on that (board)

539
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,160
This is quite extreme for me

540
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,000
Why is there a hole here?

541
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,760
Didn't you know?

542
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,680
You didn't even know?

543
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,320
Wait a minute

544
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,760
The girl who lived here just now said

545
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,400
There was already a hole in this room before

546
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,520
Then she asked you to fix it for her

547
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,000
Is there an electrical room inside?

548
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,160
Yes, there is

549
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Now I understand

550
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,240
Inside here...

551
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,880
Besides this hole

552
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,400
Where else can we enter?

553
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,160
I don't know

554
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,440
Now inside...

555
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,240
There's a dead person

556
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,160
It's Song Huo

557
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,800
Yes, Song Huo

558
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,720
Anything else?

559
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,640
There's also a kitten

560
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,960
Why is Miao Miao running around again?

561
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,400
Because we were afraid Miao Miao would run around

562
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,120
And we couldn't find her

563
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,880
So we put clothes on her

564
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,040
And there's also a camera here

565
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,840
If it's nearby...

566
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,760
Would it...

567
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,320
Have recorded it?

568
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,720
Come on, everyone take a look

569
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,360
This can connect to its camera

570
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,680
Right?

571
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,240
Yes, these should be recent recordings

572
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,560
Why did he collapse as soon as he entered?

573
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,800
Why did he collapse immediately upon entering?

574
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,560
He walked over there, right?

575
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,200
Right.

576
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,840
He collapsed straight away.

577
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,920
He collapsed the moment he touched the doorknob.

578
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,760
The doorknob was electrified.

579
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,280
I think someone might have...

580
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,560
put electricity...

581
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,960
on that doorknob.

582
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,000
This was definitely no accident.

583
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,080
Could an accident...

584
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,200
even happen here?

585
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,400
Where are we? Say it.

586
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,480
We're at the accident site.

587
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,080
The Accident Apartment.

588
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,120
Xiao He?

589
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,880
Who?

590
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,360
What's wrong?

591
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,240
I'm the electrician.

592
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,360
The sixth floor's wiring is complicated.

593
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,760
There are three circuits:

594
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,440
One powers the apartments,

595
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,880
one powers the hallway,

596
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,600
and one goes to the abandoned power room.

597
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,800
(Repeats line 596)

598
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,320
Hallway, apartments, abandoned power room.

599
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,840
The power outage was caused...

600
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,880
I've found the reason.

601
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,080
It's the abandoned power room.

602
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,320
A short circuit tripped the breaker.

603
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,440
Their short circuit caused the trip.

604
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,760
After I reset it,

605
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,360
power returned to the apartments,

606
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,120
but the hallway remains dark.

607
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,320
You're lying.

608
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,200
There is power.

609
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,320
After power returned to the rooms,

610
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,600
didn't the hallway take a while...

611
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,640
to get power back?

612
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,640
We tried to enter...

613
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,400
when the power came back.

614
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,400
After checking,

615
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,680
we found someone in the first-floor power room...

616
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,200
who manually shut off...

617
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,920
the sixth floor hallway circuit.

618
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,600
So someone's on the first floor.

619
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,480
There's still someone on the first floor.

620
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,440
But what's strange is

621
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,080
the sixth-floor power distribution room has been abandoned for ten years

622
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,720
Who would be so bored

623
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,160
as to turn the power back on?

624
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,280
It's been abandoned for ten years

625
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,320
So why would a delivery person go there?

626
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,040
Shouldn't we investigate

627
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,960
the Song goods issue

628
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,960
Everyone take this

629
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Zhenguoli reasoning kit

630
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,800
and start deducing first

631
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,320
Teng Agency's 100% occupancy rate

632
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,480
I think it's questionable again

633
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,480
If we encounter more

634
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,040
situations like this

635
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,520
perhaps

636
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,640
we'll move out too

637
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,720
Either pay the property fees first

638
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,160
We're all moving out

639
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,880
Who'd pay you property fees?

640
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,640
Right

641
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,880
Defaulting on property fees

642
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,240
Now we have

643
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,400
several places to search, right?

644
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,360
Yes

645
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:48,840
The power distribution room

646
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,040
Let's check the power room first

647
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:50,800
And there's another

648
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,920
place nobody's been to

649
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,320
The mysterious bedroom in the power room

650
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,880
Mysterious bedroom

651
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
Here, you take this

652
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,440
Yes, take the flashlight

653
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,680
just in case

654
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,240
Let's go

655
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,680
He looks just like a repairman

656
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:02,640
Let's go

657
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,320
Go

658
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,760
This thing

659
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,800
I...

660
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,240
Is it easy?

661
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,000
Not that easy to climb

662
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,680
I can just step one foot in

663
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,680
and I'm there

664
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,080
How convenient is that!

665
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,480
There's a door here

666
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,120
There's a room here

667
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,440
Shouldn't we try to enter from over there?

668
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,800
Let me see

669
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,720
If someone can reach it

670
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,000
Unlock that latch

671
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,000
My hands are the smallest

672
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,960
Let me try

673
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,040
Can you reach it?

674
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
Got it

675
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,400
Watch me

676
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,000
It's open

677
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,680
Nice

678
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,920
Take it slow

679
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,760
Go in first

680
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,280
Let's go

681
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,200
Whose house is this?

682
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Do we have any information about the owner?

683
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,000
Come here.

684
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,000
Found a computer.

685
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,360
Guo Baoyou, come take a look.

686
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,120
There's surveillance footage.

687
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,680
Which house is being monitored?

688
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,520
Is it this house?

689
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,560
It's Fang Xiaomei's house surveillance.

690
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:26,960
Why?

691
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,600
He installed surveillance in Fang Xiaomei's house.

692
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,560
Fang Xiaomei's house.

693
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,480
What kind of "pervert"?

694
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,360
This is a "pervert".

695
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,280
He was watching Fang Xiaomei's family, right?

696
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,640
"Trashy couple".

697
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,720
This folder...

698
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,920
May 7th.

699
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,560
Isn't this the...

700
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,200
Earlier at Liu Xialai's door...

701
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,720
we saw Song Huo.

702
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,640
He entered Fang Xiaomei's house.

703
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,040
He's clearly not part of Fang Xiaomei's family.

704
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,400
He ate Fang Xiaomei's food.

705
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,960
Look.

706
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,360
He seems...

707
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,400
Look how he's eating here, it's so...

708
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,920
And it's really strange.

709
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,960
No, it seems like he lives here.

710
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,600
Look how he casually sits down and puts his bag aside.

711
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,480
No, you don't know about this kind of people.

712
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,360
They hide under your bed and stuff.

713
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,240
There's no one under here, right?

714
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,880
No.

715
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,600
There shouldn't be.

716
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,640
What's he doing?

717
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,240
He's lying down.

718
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,960
Looks comfortable.

719
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,000
Right

720
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,040
The second one

721
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,840
Both are from May 7th

722
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,400
The previous one was also May 7th

723
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,040
Fang Xiaomei

724
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,640
Fang Xiaomei arrived

725
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,560
They came back together

726
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,520
We know that

727
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,880
They know each other

728
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,920
What are they opening?

729
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,840
Opening packages

730
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,720
He's a delivery person, right?

731
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,080
Yes

732
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,920
Yes, he's a courier

733
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,120
What are these two opening?

734
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,720
Anyway, the two seem very sweet together

735
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,920
They're good together, right?

736
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,880
Opening packages

737
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
This one is from May 10th

738
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,160
This is from May 10th

739
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,560
Right

740
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,040
Today is May 13th

741
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,600
They're living together now

742
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,440
Does he seem unhappy?

743
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:48,680
Look at his expression

744
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,800
He does seem a bit melancholy

745
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,440
There's also a folder with a question mark

746
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,720
This can't be

747
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,200
Liu Xialai

748
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,920
had an argument

749
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,840
got angry

750
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,800
Is there any sound?

751
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,640
No sound

752
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,360
So Liu Xialai has been in this room before

753
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,000
It's fine, we'll ask him later

754
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,880
wrote an IOU

755
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,400
He said he'd find someone to repay the money

756
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,560
delivery service

757
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,680
May 13th at 11:00

758
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,480
Isn't that right now?

759
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,040
Yes

760
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,720
This Song Huo just now

761
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,000
was arguing with Liu Xialai in the video

762
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,680
and also made an appointment with Liu Xialai

763
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,040
to meet at that place today at 11:00

764
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,760
Right

765
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,160
So that means

766
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,320
Liu Xialai is now a prime suspect

767
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,600
Do you know him?

768
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,440
I don't know him

769
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,600
May 6th

770
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,280
Who is this?

771
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,080
Who is this?

772
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,680
Bottom left corner

773
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,240
Who is that long-haired person in the video?

774
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,400
This seems quite dangerous

775
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,360
It looks scary

776
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,560
Move over there

777
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,200
I'll move over there

778
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,960
There's a long-haired person

779
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,920
Hiding behind

780
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,440
the sofa

781
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,200
Her sofa

782
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:28,960
This person (the homeowner)

783
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,720
either has some connection with this woman

784
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,320
some kind of relationship

785
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,440
or has some connection with this man

786
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,520
a romantic kind of relationship

787
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,320
so

788
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,880
he installed surveillance in their home

789
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,160
to document this "scummy couple"

790
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,440
probably to gather some evidence

791
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,560
or something like that

792
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,480
then

793
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
this place

794
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,160
connects directly to Xiaomei's home

795
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,440
right

796
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,080
and Xiaomei

797
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,120
initially didn't even know

798
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,640
about this passage

799
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,440
and here he has

800
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,000
a special lock for exiting

801
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,440
which means

802
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,840
he frequently uses this passage

803
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,880
to sneak into Xiaomei's home

804
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,160
so that suspicious person earlier

805
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,640
was likely the person living here

806
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,120
you mean the disheveled-haired one?

807
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,920
probably not him

808
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,280
no way

809
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,040
his own computer

810
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,760
wouldn't label himself with question marks

811
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,640
plus his folders are marked with question marks

812
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,960
meaning he doesn't know what relationship

813
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,720
these two people have

814
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,120
right, but why?

815
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,960
let's search

816
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,280
Inside there's also

817
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,880
Fang Xiaomei

818
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,920
this pair of unique couple's watches

819
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,520
I

820
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,720
This is the crime scene

821
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Just now on Song Huo's wrist

822
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,160
wasn't there

823
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,200
a particularly expensive watch?

824
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,160
The ladies' version hopes to soon

825
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,000
be worn on your hand

826
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,800
Love, Moonlight

827
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,320
So it must be this person

828
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,040
who admires Fang Xiaomei

829
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,800
Meaning this belongs to Song Huo

830
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,240
Right?

831
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,400
Right?

832
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Song Huo is already wearing it

833
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,840
hoping the ladies' version would quickly

834
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,720
be worn by Fang Xiaomei

835
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
But Song Huo has been with her

836
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,640
Song Huo and Fang Xiaomei

837
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,680
They even live together in the same house

838
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,520
In his document titled "Scumbag Couple"

839
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,800
Inside this "Scumbag Couple" file

840
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,760
there's Song Huo

841
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,520
Song Huo and Fang Xiaomei

842
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,880
So Song Huo can't claim

843
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,560
they're a "scumbag couple"

844
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,200
Calling themselves "scumbag couple"

845
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,280
So it must be some other man

846
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,360
But why would Song Huo have this watch?

847
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:56,560
Right

848
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,360
Right

849
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,040
There's no light in our power distribution room.

850
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,360
How are we supposed to search like this?

851
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,920
Can't see anything.

852
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,560
Wait a moment.

853
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,120
Now there's light.

854
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,040
There's something here.

855
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,280
If it's as we just guessed,

856
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,080
look, there's a wire behind the door.

857
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,720
This wire

858
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,320
should be connected to this handle.

859
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,680
When he opens the door,

860
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,720
he'll be electrocuted and "die."

861
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,120
But that's not insulating tape

862
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,760
Right?

863
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,360
See, isn't this black?

864
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,000
Is black tape insulating?

865
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,320
Yes, but this part is already exposed

866
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:46,800
Look

867
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,240
This tape is on the ground

868
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,920
Which means

869
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,320
This thing

870
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,880
was originally wrapped around it

871
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
It was used for insulation

872
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,040
But someone peeled it off

873
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,080
So this tape

874
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,720
was intentionally removed by someone

875
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,040
If someone went through this trouble

876
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,320
it must be premeditated "murder"

877
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,920
Keep looking

878
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,520
He was wearing a really nice watch

879
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,520
Check his pockets

880
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,200
We're being so cruel

881
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,960
Let's take off his clothes

882
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,400
Come on

883
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,120
Don't

884
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,880
That's too much

885
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,000
That's too much, right?

886
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,520
Inside pocket

887
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,840
There's an inside pocket here

888
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,360
Really?

889
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,720
Tuishi ID card

890
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
Song Huo

891
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,960
Song Huo's ID card

892
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,160
Right, so we can confirm

893
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,120
It's definitely him

894
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,160
Nothing else

895
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
Just found a watch and a bag

896
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,400
Found a phone

897
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,320
The phone password is his birthday

898
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,200
Do they have the phone?

899
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,840
Let me ask them

900
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,360
You go ask

901
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,400
Guo Baoyou has it

902
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,320
With Guo Baoyou

903
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,720
Guo Baoyou

904
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,400
Give me the phone

905
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,840
Here you go

906
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,280
You guys got it open

907
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,960
It's open

908
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,440
Where is this?

909
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:49,920
No idea

910
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,800
This is a peeping tom's bedroom

911
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,960
This is a peeping tom's bedroom

912
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,240
Is he missing a watch?

913
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,960
Yes

914
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,200
That guy had it earlier

915
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,080
Song Huo has it

916
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,040
It's with Song Huo

917
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,440
Here it comes

918
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
What's the birthday?

919
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,720
920616

920
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,320
It's open

921
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,600
So smart

922
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,080
Recently he withdrew his spare change

923
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,520
100,000 in April

924
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,760
20,000 in May

925
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,120
120,000 in total

926
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,120
Withdrawing means transferring from your spare change wallet

927
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,800
to your bank card

928
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,240
This is another phone he took a picture of

929
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,200
Mei Mei Planet

930
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,800
Moonlight Treasure Box

931
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,080
He said if you ignore me

932
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,400
what's the point of these numbers

933
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,880
Balance: 5 million

934
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
This is Song Huo's phone

935
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,520
And this is one that Song Huo took

936
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,000
Mei Mei's social media post

937
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
Took a photo of Xiao Mei's phone

938
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,920
Because when he delivered goods to her

939
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,960
he saw it

940
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,400
Right?

941
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:01,760
Maybe

942
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,800
This should be Xiao Mei's own phone

943
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,160
This should be the blue room

944
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,960
Exactly

945
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,400
In her room

946
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,120
When delivering goods to her

947
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,080
He saw her phone lying here

948
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,320
So he took a photo

949
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,840
One more video

950
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,640
Hello everyone

951
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,000
I'm your Xiaomei

952
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,720
Today I'm going to record for you

953
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,760
an unboxing video

954
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,040
I'd like to especially thank

955
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,240
our delivery guy Brother Songhuo

956
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,520
for helping me carry

957
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,320
all my many packages

958
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,960
back to my home

959
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,680
So I think

960
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,640
he's really very kind

961
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,400
I'm especially grateful to him

962
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,240
This is also something I recently

963
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,760
discovered that's really delicious

964
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,560
the Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Tea

965
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,360
Let me take a sip first

966
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,240
And then

967
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,600
we'll start unboxing now

968
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,640
This one I've already opened

969
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,480
It's very beautiful

970
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,600
And this is also

971
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,200
a gift I gave myself

972
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,920
to celebrate that I've finally

973
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,360
earned 500,000 yuan

974
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,480
It's covered in diamonds

975
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,760
very strategically designed

976
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,960
I think you should get one

977
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,560
Actually, as you know

978
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,680
in my daily life

979
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,080
I don't really have many friends

980
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,640
So I'm willing to share

981
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,840
everything I think is good

982
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,160
with all of you

983
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,040
That's all for today's unboxing video

984
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,440
See you next time

985
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,240
Just to briefly explain

986
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,400
She's a female streamer

987
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,320
with pretty good circumstances

988
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,080
The things she shows everyone are quite nice

989
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,159
And she sincerely

990
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,840
praised this delivery guy

991
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,719
There's a feather duster

992
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,000
There's a backscratcher

993
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
This person's age

994
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,480
should be quite old

995
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,080
And this room

996
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,239
is overall quite

997
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,199
old-fashioned, right?

998
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,159
Yes

999
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,199
Let's look for any

1000
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,719
information about who lived in this room

1001
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,880
Here's a

1002
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,800
relationship diagram

1003
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,040
Cao Yueguang

1004
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,560
Song Huo

1005
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,159
Fang Xiaomei

1006
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,600
So Xiaomei and Yueguang were in an online relationship

1007
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,800
Fang Xiaomei posted on Moments

1008
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,239
on February 14th

1009
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,000
made a post on Moments

1010
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,920
And this "Moonlight Treasure Box"

1011
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,639
must be Cao Yueguang

1012
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,920
Cao Yueguang said "If you ignore me"

1013
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,080
"what's the point of these numbers?"

1014
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,560
How much did he withdraw? Five million

1015
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,600
Matching the large withdrawal mentioned here

1016
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,520
Yes, exactly, a huge amount

1017
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,000
After our agency's four-hour

1018
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,400
online and offline investigation

1019
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,280
we discovered Cao Yueguang on February 15, 2022

1020
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,160
in the afternoon

1021
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,760
withdrew a large sum of cash from Tuishi Bank

1022
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,960
then drove toward Huanhai Road

1023
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,320
Shortly after

1024
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,280
passersby found Cao Yueguang's empty car

1025
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,160
on Huanhai Road

1026
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,520
with what appeared to be his "blood" nearby

1027
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,080
and a witness provided our agency with

1028
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,600
dashcam footage

1029
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,080
that captured

1030
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,280
the scene after Cao Yueguang was robbed

1031
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:10,760
Therefore we can't rule out

1032
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,240
that after being robbed

1033
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,960
Cao Yueguang was pushed into the sea

1034
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,880
to destroy evidence and cover up the crime

1035
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,560
Isn't this Song Huo?

1036
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I understand

1037
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,480
Cao Yueguang is a wealthy man

1038
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,760
And Cao Yueguang likes Xiaomei

1039
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,640
They had an online romance

1040
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:23,880
Right

1041
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,240
Then

1042
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,080
But Fang Xiaomei and Song Huo

1043
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,760
were already together

1044
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,480
They were already a couple

1045
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,840
So the two of them, to be together

1046
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,720
wanted to obtain a huge sum of money

1047
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,800
from Cao Yueguang

1048
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,040
by "killing" Cao Yueguang

1049
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,480
and taking it

1050
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,280
This "scummy couple" plotted murder for money

1051
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,400
"Killed" Cao Yueguang

1052
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,760
Yes

1053
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,160
Right?

1054
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,280
Blood brother

1055
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:42,960
This person

1056
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,840
might be Cao Yueguang's blood brother

1057
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,080
He's helping his brother

1058
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,760
seek revenge

1059
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,040
And in the photo here

1060
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,280
No

1061
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,880
Cao Yueguang

1062
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Cao Yangguang

1063
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,400
Not

1064
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,880
The one we saw last week

1065
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,920
that campus heartthrob

1066
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,360
Cao Yangguang

1067
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,520
That sunny boy

1068
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:58,960
Right

1069
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,840
He looks very

1070
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,600
So the one living here

1071
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,760
should be Cao Yangguang

1072
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,640
Cao Yangguang

1073
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,400
Yes

1074
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,240
His blood brother

1075
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,960
must avenge his brother

1076
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,000
Seems like it

1077
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,320
But on May 7th

1078
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,840
we photographed

1079
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,560
Song Huo

1080
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,600
wearing this watch

1081
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,600
To Fang Xiaomei

1082
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,240
This pair of unique couple's watches

1083
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,880
I'm already wearing

1084
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,440
the women's version

1085
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,840
Looking forward to seeing it on your wrist soon

1086
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,640
Love, Yueguang

1087
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,400
After Song Huo "killed" Yueguang

1088
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,160
He directly took Yueguang's watch

1089
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,600
and wore it himself

1090
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,000
Yes, that's possible

1091
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,840
And then this

1092
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,320
his brother

1093
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Anyway, after Yueguang "died"

1094
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,560
Yangguang took his brother's

1095
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,160
and brought it over

1096
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,960
Meaning his brother's

1097
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,520
during his lifetime

1098
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,480
evidence of pursuing Xiaomei

1099
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,600
Compared to those "scumbag couples"

1100
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,480
their life here was

1101
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:45,960
much more difficult

1102
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,040
much more strapped

1103
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,560
His brother's money was all scammed away

1104
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,520
But this room feels like

1105
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,480
it should belong to someone older

1106
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,080
Not quite like Cao Yangguang

1107
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,480
But

1108
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,520
No, this room

1109
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,960
is clearly a

1110
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,880
place closest to that house

1111
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
And he did this to

1112
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,400
facilitate the crime

1113
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,000
Outpost

1114
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,840
Yes, outpost

1115
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,400
That door

1116
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Where do you think it leads?

1117
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,920
Later we'll need to "interrogate" that person

1118
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,040
Liu Zaizhe

1119
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,400
Liu Xialai

1120
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:06,800
Liu Xialai

1121
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,200
Liu Xialai

1122
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,080
Liu Zaizhe

1123
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,080
Come take a look

1124
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,600
Look at this

1125
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,280
See?

1126
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,800
This plug

1127
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,240
Unlocked

1128
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,000
Who?

1129
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,120
Who are you?

1130
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,920
Wait, who are you people?

1131
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,720
Why are you in my house?

1132
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:30,640
What do you want?

1133
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,760
What are you doing in my house?

1134
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,240
Who are you?

1135
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,840
What do you want?

1136
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,520
Who are you?

1137
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,440
This is my house

1138
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,720
I should be asking what *you're* doing here

1139
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,200
Get out

1140
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,720
Who?

1141
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,280
Why are you in my house?

1142
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,880
(Hao) Cleaning staff

1143
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,960
Hao Baojie

1144
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,040
How did you get in?

1145
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,440
Wait a minute

1146
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,560
We have some questions for you

1147
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,120
This is a misunderstanding

1148
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,680
I want to ask you

1149
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,600
How did you get in here?

1150
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,000
Misunderstanding

1151
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,320
Get out

1152
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:57,840
Out

1153
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,240
Calm down

1154
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,640
Don't

1155
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,080
Stop

1156
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,280
Hurry up, I'll call for help if you don't leave

1157
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,360
Hao Baojie, don't be angry

1158
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:02,920
What are you doing here?

1159
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,680
You're in my home and you expect me not to be angry?

1160
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,800
Is this your home?

1161
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
This is my home

1162
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,040
This room is yours?

1163
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,680
Yes

1164
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,840
So... you've been living here?

1165
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,360
No, are you crazy?

1166
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,640
This is my house

1167
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
You're asking me?

1168
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,280
No

1169
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,720
Do you know

1170
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,360
if there's a door that leads out from here?

1171
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,560
Why should I tell you?

1172
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,080
Get out now

1173
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,200
I'm the homeowner

1174
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,800
Out

1175
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,400
No

1176
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,640
This is my home

1177
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,760
We're really in the wrong here

1178
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,080
Get out quickly

1179
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,960
I'm leaving

1180
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Sorry

1181
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,760
I was wrong

1182
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,480
Let's go

1183
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:29,840
Out

1184
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,320
Sorry for disturbing you

1185
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,080
My apologies

1186
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,720
And I "borrowed" a watch

1187
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,240
I think we should gather up

1188
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,280
the things we've found

1189
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
Okay

1190
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,560
Let's go inside first

1191
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,600
Her room hasn't been searched yet

1192
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,320
Not searched

1193
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,080
My bag

1194
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,320
seems to be in (Hao the cleaner's room)

1195
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,440
What? Your bag is still in there?

1196
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,560
Kewuku left the Zhenguoli deduction bag

1197
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,520
in (Hao) the cleaner's room

1198
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,120
Kewuku

1199
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,280
Yes, Kewuku left the bag in their room

1200
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,840
It's left at Hao the cleaner's place

1201
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,440
Evidence - ironclad proof

1202
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,760
Then let's go to his room first

1203
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,600
to get your bag out

1204
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,680
Alright

1205
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,160
Let's go

1206
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,440
A bit...

1207
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,320
Ding dong, right?

1208
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,480
Coming.

1209
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,360
Verification failed.

1210
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,520
I said you guys are endless.

1211
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
I left a bag behind.

1212
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,200
Sorry, the bag.

1213
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,240
Bag.

1214
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,400
Only one person can come in.

1215
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,480
You come in.

1216
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,080
Okay.

1217
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,920
Pick one.

1218
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,520
The blue one.

1219
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:29,800
That one.

1220
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,680
The bag left behind isn't mine.

1221
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,800
Blue one (go in).

1222
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,240
Hurry up.

1223
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:32,680
Taking it or not?

1224
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,280
Okay, take it.

1225
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,840
Thank you.

1226
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,320
Sorry about that.

1227
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,200
Sorry, my apologies.

1228
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,760
Caused you trouble.

1229
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,480
Why are you closing the door?

1230
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,280
Sorry, my apologies.

1231
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,280
Let me get the bag.

1232
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,120
You've turned my place upside down.

1233
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,840
And you have the nerve.

1234
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,920
Next time I'll hire a cleaner for you.

1235
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,520
To clean up.

1236
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,800
I am the cleaner.

1237
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,600
I'm the only cleaner in this building.

1238
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,200
Coincidentally, I found you a job.

1239
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,680
Right?

1240
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,120
His bag.

1241
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,760
Here.

1242
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,240
Hurry up.

1243
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,640
Take it away.

1244
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,440
You didn't take anything, did you?

1245
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,720
What would I take?

1246
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,000
This is my home, what would I take?

1247
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,960
Next time I'll assign you work.

1248
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,360
Assign you work.

1249
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,400
Thank you.

1250
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,800
When he comes out, we'll be there.

1251
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,720
Let's go quickly.

1252
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,680
Brave.

1253
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,080
Are you okay?

1254
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,640
Thank you, Xiaoke.

1255
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,600
Brave.

1256
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,120
Pick up this bag and take a look

1257
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,800
I haven't seen this important clue yet

1258
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,800
What?

1259
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,560
A doll

1260
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,520
In this man's bag

1261
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,800
Why would he carry a doll?

1262
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,080
Do not approach the abandoned power distribution room

1263
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,640
Disobedience will lead to "death"

1264
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,600
Disobedience will lead to "death"

1265
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,640
Do not enter the power distribution room

1266
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,320
Should we

1267
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,680
search Xiaomei's room first?

1268
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,320
We haven't searched her room yet.

1269
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,520
There's a phone and a note here.

1270
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,760
This is addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

1271
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,520
What does this mean?

1272
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,280
There's also this

1273
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,280
There's also a number on the screen

1274
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,120
6234129

1275
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,680
I think using these cards

1276
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,640
We can unlock the phone

1277
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,640
This is

1278
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,600
This is the password

1279
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,600
This is the password

1280
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,520
Oh no

1281
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,400
I feel like I'm

1282
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,680
really not good at this

1283
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,080
Don't you think so?

1284
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,960
Look

1285
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,600
Two divided by three

1286
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,440
Can't even do this

1287
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,280
Shouldn't have to

1288
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:51,560
We're done for

1289
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,600
Maybe we should look again

1290
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,360
When it comes to numbers

1291
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,760
We're really not good

1292
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,400
Let's get Baoyou back

1293
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,320
Let's check again

1294
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,160
When it comes to math

1295
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,360
It's really our blind spot

1296
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,720
Right, because music students

1297
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,920
Are terrible at math

1298
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,400
Although we're all good at math

1299
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,360
But we want to give this chance

1300
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,400
To Baoyou

1301
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,120
Does that make sense?

1302
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,920
Right, Guo Baoyou

1303
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,760
Let's see what else is here

1304
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,200
Keep looking

1305
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,480
Sorry

1306
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,320
Found another phone

1307
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,680
Does her family sell phones or something?

1308
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,600
Why is it her again?

1309
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,760
This one doesn't need a password

1310
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,200
Just (open it)

1311
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,080
970108

1312
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,240
The password for this room

1313
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,880
There are several passwords listed here

1314
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,200
Everyone with smart locks has them

1315
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,440
Who?

1316
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,840
The delivery person

1317
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,880
This is Xiaomei's phone

1318
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,640
Not necessarily

1319
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,240
Not necessarily

1320
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,680
Why would he have this?

1321
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,280
There must be something else here

1322
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,120
Something useful

1323
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,680
Keep looking

1324
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,240
I found something

1325
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:17,800
A diary

1326
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,360
Okay, let's check the diary now

1327
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,600
The diary has pasted inside

1328
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,680
Her text message history with Moonlight Treasure Box

1329
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,600
Ten days ago

1330
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,000
I accidentally came across your video online

1331
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,080
You said your life

1332
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,440
Has always been lonely

1333
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,880
Actually, me too

1334
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,440
After chatting privately, we discovered

1335
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,120
We're practically

1336
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,240
Each other's mirror image

1337
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,800
Since you're a fashion blogger

1338
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,560
Then check out my fabric

1339
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,320
See if I'm boyfriend material

1340
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,760
If this is Xiaomei...

1341
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,400
She's saying...

1342
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,640
This part below is Xiaomei's...

1343
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,800
What follows should be her words

1344
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,000
Starting today...

1345
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,800
I'm no longer alone

1346
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,400
You are the light in my darkness

1347
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,080
That means...

1348
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,840
She's already been...

1349
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,040
deeply attracted to this man

1350
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:06,800
She likes...

1351
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,120
Good

1352
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,920
That's what it means, right?

1353
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,080
They became official...

1354
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,320
on February 14, 2021

1355
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:11,720
Then...

1356
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,760
on the next Valentine's Day...

1357
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,080
"Xiaomei, we've been together a year"

1358
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,280
"We've only video chatted..."

1359
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,120
"You've always wanted to hear me sing..."

1360
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,440
your favorite song...

1361
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,480
"A Light in the Darkness"

1362
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,360
"I've customized..."

1363
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,680
a gift just for us two

1364
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,600
He customized these two watches

1365
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,120
One for each of them

1366
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,000
But Xiaomei didn't reply

1367
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,120
"Xiaomei, I see you're typing..."

1368
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,920
"Why aren't you responding?"

1369
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,880
"Forgive my cowardice..."

1370
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,360
"If you saw me like this..."

1371
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,840
you'd be disappointed

1372
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,200
"What kind of me would disappoint you?"

1373
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:40,920
What does that mean?

1374
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,560
He wants to meet...

1375
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,520
but Xiaomei keeps refusing

1376
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,600
She just doesn't want to meet

1377
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,960
Maybe due to low self-esteem or something

1378
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,680
But the exact reason...

1379
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,560
we don't know yet

1380
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,720
Alright, let's continue

1381
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,120
What is this?

1382
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,880
Plastic surgery

1383
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,280
Cosmetic surgery

1384
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,320
She used to look like this

1385
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,880
This was how she looked when they were chatting online

1386
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,280
This was her appearance

1387
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,200
After getting plastic surgery

1388
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,760
she became more attractive

1389
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,200
and gained confidence

1390
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,760
She said she could finally stand by his side

1391
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,240
She decided to meet that man

1392
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:16,960
Probably

1393
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,160
But this guy only

1394
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,680
wanted to date her after

1395
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,160
seeing her videos

1396
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:21,840
and DM'd her

1397
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:23,880
Beauty filter

1398
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,440
Ever heard of it?

1399
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,680
Don't you use it?

1400
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,760
Does she even need it?

1401
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,360
No

1402
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,120
Don't give her that excuse

1403
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,640
I'm just buttering her up

1404
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:37,640
Fine

1405
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,320
Okay

1406
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:38,920
Then

1407
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,920
You must be the robber/killer

1408
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:46,520
This is

1409
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,240
This should be Song Huo

1410
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,440
Song Huo was just wearing this watch

1411
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:51,720
Right

1412
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,560
Isn't that correct?

1413
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,840
So this person is Song Huo

1414
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,160
We know about this watch

1415
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,600
But mainly, what do these two lines mean?

1416
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,120
Let's ask them when they come back

1417
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,680
Let's keep this doubt for now

1418
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,560
The most important thing is you

1419
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,240
Left me forever

1420
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,600
Jumped off a building

1421
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,040
The one who jumped/fell last week

1422
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,520
And this person is a heart shape

1423
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,240
A destruction

1424
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,880
She "died" for love

1425
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,400
Right

1426
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,560
Most importantly, you left me forever

1427
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,120
Jiajia said this last week too

1428
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:35,840
Never expected

1429
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,280
You who were once so important to me

1430
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,040
Would end your life by jumping off a building

1431
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,960
I'm sorry

1432
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,280
They're both talking about the same person

1433
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,240
That means this person

1434
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,240
Must be someone

1435
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,280
They both know

1436
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,200
Everyone who comes here

1437
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,320
Probably has some connection to this person

1438
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,120
Right

1439
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,080
Teng the agent

1440
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:53,800
Strange

1441
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:56,960
They can't see it

1442
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,600
Because they're all gone

1443
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,600
Right, there's another important point

1444
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,440
Which is why

1445
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,680
We can see her jump

1446
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,920
But no one else can

1447
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,160
I've been wondering about this too

1448
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,560
Because it's indeed suspicious

1449
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,200
Are we being hypnotized?

1450
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,680
Maybe we're not being hypnotized

1451
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,840
Definitely suspicious

1452
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,040
Come on, let's check that again

1453
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,320
Come on

1454
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,920
What's coming will come

1455
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,600
What?

1456
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,560
This math problem

1457
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,760
Time to solve the puzzle

1458
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,680
If we can't solve this

1459
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,120
Let me tell you

1460
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:23,960
We'll be

1461
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,960
These three people

1462
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,840
Three amateurs can't match one expert

1463
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,800
The (phone) password must be these cards

1464
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,960
Plus sign is dot dot 9

1465
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,160
What about the minus sign?

1466
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:35,800
94

1467
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,680
Apart from what's on this card,

1468
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,280
if you can provide even one more clue or word,

1469
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,280
I'll consider you impressive.

1470
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,600
Addition and subtraction,

1471
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,160
this division is a three-digit number,

1472
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,600
multiplication is five-digit,

1473
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,720
subtraction is four-digit,

1474
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,320
and addition is three-digit.

1475
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,080
Left is three-digit,

1476
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,600
right is three-digit.

1477
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,000
We haven't figured out the pattern yet.

1478
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,960
No, we haven't.

1479
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,880
So now...

1480
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,600
Find a way

1481
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,400
Read

1482
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,880
Add

1483
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,800
Black Black Nine

1484
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,840
Addition and subtraction

1485
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,320
Multiplication

1486
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,400
Division

1487
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,320
Finished reading

1488
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:31,840
Good

1489
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,560
The voice is fairly good

1490
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,160
Remove

1491
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,080
Okay

1492
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:37,720
Broadcasting tone

1493
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,880
Let's read it again

1494
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,440
Add

1495
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:41,840
Subtract

1496
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,080
Multiply

1497
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:44,600
Divide

1498
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,200
We're all going to memorize ourselves silly

1499
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,600
Memorize silly

1500
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,600
Add, subtract, multiply, divide

1501
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:52,560
Divide

1502
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,560
We've already finished

1503
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,520
Okay, your turn

1504
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,240
You read it once

1505
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,160
Quick, you read it once

1506
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,200
Add

1507
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,360
Subtract

1508
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,080
It's not going to be magic, bro

1509
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,200
Read

1510
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,120
Add

1511
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,240
Subtract

1512
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,120
Multiply

1513
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,360
Addition is three digits, subtraction is four digits

1514
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,360
Division is three digits

1515
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,240
Left is three digits

1516
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,400
Right is three digits

1517
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,200
add

1518
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,560
is three numbers

1519
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,480
Right?

1520
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,000
Subtract

1521
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,320
subtract

1522
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,320
is four

1523
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,960
multiply

1524
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,560
is five

1525
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,160
Divide

1526
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,800
divide

1527
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,640
left

1528
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,760
right

1529
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,440
What's the password?

1530
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,560
Wait a moment

1531
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,400
Add

1532
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,200
I got it

1533
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,920
Use this card

1534
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,600
to translate the meaning above

1535
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,160
Right?

1536
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,840
Okay, translate

1537
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,200
6 is z

1538
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,320
2 is h

1539
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,040
3 is e

1540
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,360
4 is n

1541
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,400
1 is c

1542
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,440
9 is a

1543
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:00,920
z

1544
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,560
h

1545
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:01,960
e

1546
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,480
n

1547
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:02,840
g

1548
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,280
g

1549
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,080
7 is u

1550
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:04,720
8 is o

1551
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,600
Completed

1552
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:07,640
Done

1553
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,640
Amazing, you guys

1554
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,040
Experts

1555
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,640
The password is

1556
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,200
zhencha

1557
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,080
zhenguo

1558
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,640
Real tea, real fruit

1559
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,120
So it's Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring Tea

1560
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,760
So delicious

1561
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,360
With a light tea aroma

1562
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,120
With chewable real fruit pieces

1563
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,880
Take a sip anytime, anywhere

1564
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,120
For clearer thinking

1565
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,680
The answer was right before our eyes

1566
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,960
"A Beam of Light in the Dark Night"

1567
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,760
This "Beam of Light in the Dark Night"

1568
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,320
who gave it to whom?

1569
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,480
was their favorite song

1570
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,720
He said you're like my...

1571
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,320
a beam of light in my dark life

1572
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,800
You're actually my beam of light in the dark night

1573
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,240
Right

1574
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,640
Let me see what else is here

1575
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,440
This is still from the previous Meimei Planet

1576
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,520
And this is "Real Tea Real Fruit"

1577
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,520
"Real Tea Real Fruit," let me see

1578
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,080
"Tea and Fruit Meet You" time

1579
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,240
"Meeting You" time

1580
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:04,720
Don't forget

1581
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,080
Let's go to Liu Xialai's room

1582
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,480
In the video we saw

1583
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,720
Liu Xialai had an argument with Song Huo

1584
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,320
He and Song Huo

1585
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,520
He had an argument with Song Huo

1586
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,840
at Fang Xiaomei's place

1587
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,320
Right, Song Huo wrote it down

1588
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,160
Today at 11 o'clock

1589
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:19,960
what was he going to do with him?

1590
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,560
Right

1591
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,080
Let's see what's in Liu Xialai's room

1592
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,320
Right

1593
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,800
Remember during the day he said

1594
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,280
Song Huo has been to his place this week

1595
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:27,960
frequently appearing at his place

1596
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,280
been there five or six times

1597
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,800
But how do we open his door?

1598
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,280
The question is

1599
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,560
I know his password

1600
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,840
How do you know his password?

1601
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,560
I heard about it when I moved in

1602
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,160
His birthday

1603
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,400
What was his birthday again?

1604
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:38,720
What?

1605
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,320
You're not saying we need to crack the password to enter?

1606
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,080
There's still a password?

1607
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,200
This is insane

1608
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,320
This is my home.

1609
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:51,720
Go ahead.

1610
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,960
Thank you.

1611
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,440
Do you remember now?

1612
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,120
I remember now.

1613
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,680
It was 1997.

1614
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,320
1997.

1615
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,480
January 8th.

1616
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,480
Barley is ours

1617
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,600
Sorry

1618
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,800
One of us

1619
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,760
Let's get acquainted

1620
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,680
First check the computer for everything

1621
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,800
The computer is on

1622
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,920
It's on

1623
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,520
Great

1624
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,400
Surveillance

1625
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,240
Why does he have surveillance too?

1626
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,200
This is his home

1627
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:30,880
This is Liu Xialai

1628
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,120
His home surveillance

1629
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,320
Song Huo sneaked into Liu Xialai's room

1630
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,600
Then went there to rummage through things

1631
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,840
What are you looking for? He's here.

1632
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,720
Zoom in, take a look at this.

1633
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,560
This is the maximum zoom.

1634
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,480
Is this a picture?

1635
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,000
It's a picture.

1636
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,320
Yes, it's a picture.

1637
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,120
This looks like Song Huo, right? The hair.

1638
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:51,720
Doesn't this look like Song Huo? The hairstyle.

1639
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,040
Let me emphasize again.

1640
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,120
Wait until the night of the 13th.

1641
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,040
"Kill" Liu Xialai.

1642
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,160
Destroy the "body" and eliminate evidence.

1643
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,400
Take action once the money is received.

1644
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,560
Why "kill" Liu Xialai?

1645
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,200
Sent by Song Huo.

1646
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,160
The person who replied.

1647
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,560
His name is blocked.

1648
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,800
Action will be taken when payment is received.

1649
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,560
Song Huo is paying to have Liu Xialai "killed."

1650
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,320
Then this "killer" says.

1651
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,120
You need to pay me first.

1652
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,360
Then I'll "kill" him.

1653
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,080
Check those places.

1654
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,560
They're all dog chains.

1655
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,160
I think...

1656
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,720
Here, there's a phone.

1657
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,920
Here, there's a phone.

1658
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,440
Phone.

1659
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,480
Take a look.

1660
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,120
Mei Mei Planet.

1661
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,120
Mei Mei Planet, Moonlight Treasure Box.

1662
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,920
Mei Mei Planet is Fang Xiaomei.

1663
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,720
Liu Xialai also knows the Moonlight Treasure Box.

1664
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,600
Moonlight Treasure Box.

1665
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,640
Cao Yueguang's phone.

1666
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,080
Why is it with Liu Xialai?

1667
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,520
Appointment information.

1668
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,000
Then.

1669
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,280
Five million, right?

1670
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,280
So Cao Yueguang was going to withdraw money.

1671
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,960
The money Cao Yueguang was going to give Xiaomei.

1672
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,640
He was going to withdraw money.

1673
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,600
Account name: Mother Cao.

1674
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,960
This is mother's money.

1675
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,520
Cao Yueguang withdrew mother's five million.

1676
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:57,680
Yueguang.

1677
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,360
I feel my neck and hands are so empty.

1678
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,640
I really want something for my hands.

1679
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,160
And something for my neck too.

1680
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,480
Honey, this bar of handmade soap.

1681
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,280
Can be used on the neck.

1682
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,040
And on the hands too.

1683
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,440
Next.

1684
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,600
Let's give this as a gift.

1685
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,680
Sent a necklace worth sixty thousand.

1686
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,040
I see, I was careless.

1687
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,480
She started asking for money.

1688
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,200
Quite wealthy.

1689
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:14,640
Right.

1690
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,120
Yueguang.

1691
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,280
What's the difference between spiders and crabs?

1692
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,160
Spiders don't walk sideways, right?

1693
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:19,960
No, silly.

1694
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,160
Spiders don't have claws.

1695
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,880
Fang Xiaomei kept asking him for things.

1696
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,080
Xiaomei, you're very clean overall.

1697
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,120
But my wallet.

1698
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,640
Is cleaner than my white dress.

1699
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,680
I see, I was careless.

1700
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,480
Kept asking him for money.

1701
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,840
Xiaomei is a very materialistic streamer.

1702
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,080
Topped the charts

1703
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,200
Right

1704
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,000
April 3rd

1705
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,960
was when the first chat record appeared

1706
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,440
was when the first chat record appeared

1707
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,040
The two had actually known each other for quite some time

1708
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,000
Now it's already May 13th

1709
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,680
I'm coming in

1710
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,960
Can all of these be opened?

1711
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,120
Yes

1712
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:51,320
Yes

1713
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,720
All of these are

1714
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,800
Guo Baoyou, check this pet house again

1715
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,520
Painting

1716
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,400
This is a

1717
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,000
secret passage

1718
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,400
wealthy man, Liu Xialai

1719
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,400
You've never been here before, Barley.

1720
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,280
What is this?

1721
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,400
Where's the money?

1722
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,120
He's conducting specimen experiments.

1723
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,560
This seems to be a specimen.

1724
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,000
He's plucking fur to make specimens.

1725
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,880
What's this?

1726
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,480
Wangzi.

1727
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,160
Having you all is the luckiest thing in my life.

1728
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,680
Today we promise never to be apart.

1729
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,120
He's been keeping pets all along.

1730
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,440
And the pets keep "dying."

1731
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,560
He's been...

1732
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,000
He's probably been "killing" pets all along.

1733
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,520
He's been making specimens all this time.

1734
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:51,920
That can't be.

1735
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,840
Is he really that evil?

1736
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,560
We'll confront him about all this soon.

1737
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:58,760
Who are you?

1738
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,000
Have you had any conflicts with anyone?

1739
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,840
No conflicts.

1740
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,400
There are no conflicts at all.

1741
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,440
Wait until the night of the 13th.

1742
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,440
"Kill" Liu Xialai.

1743
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,120
Destroy the "evidence."

1744
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,080
We can definitely lie.

1745
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:08,880
Deceive people.

1746
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,480
There is no such person as Liu Xialai.

1747
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,840
There's a traitor among us.

1748
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,160
Song Huo is "dead"

1749
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,440
Car accident

1750
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,040
Counter-"kill"

1751
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:21,920
Then he deserved it

1752
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,000
There's a traitor among us

1753
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,320
Stop pretending, I'm telling you

1754
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,920
What do you think?

1755
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,200
Actually I knew he was coming to "kill" me today

1756
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:32,920
What was that sound?

1757
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,920
Did you know your house

1758
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,040
has another girl?

1759
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:35,920
I was shocked too at the time

1760
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,640
Don't know who it is

1761
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,080
There's another camera

1762
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,120
She might be imprisoned inside

1763
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,120
You're using us

1764
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:41,880
I don't know

1765
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,680
This is a passage inside

1766
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,680
You could easily make your move

1767
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,400
He should "die"

1768
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:49,840
Of course

1769
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,720
I want to "kill" him

1770
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,880
Don't touch me

1771
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,600
You could just

1772
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,680
find time to "kill" him

1773
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,160
Right?

1774
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,880
I might as well start my life over

1775
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,080
Who would go in to check?

1776
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,160
It's really strange

1777
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,720
Then I'll "kill" that Song Huo too

1778
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,400
I'll make my move early

1779
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,400
Who is that woman?
