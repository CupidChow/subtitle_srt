1
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,720
Early morning of July 15, 2022

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,880
Our Bai Song, Guo Zhou, Liu Ku detective team

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,560
gathered at Zhou Keke's home

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,880
We once again witnessed

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,640
the scene of a woman in red jumping off a building

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,880
This time

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,360
Ke Wuku didn't see it

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,200
Why didn't I see anyone jumping?

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,360
We came to the third-floor platform

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,960
The body had disappeared again

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,080
Look, the body's gone again

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,760
There's a moon here

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,720
Following a new clue

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,520
we found the Sleepless Convenience Store

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,680
Here

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,360
we discovered the secret of time reset

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,880
They altered our movement path

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,720
We also learned that

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,560
the jumping scene we saw earlier

20
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,800
was just an illusion caused by

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,760
everyone's magnetic fields

22
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,320
The woman in red

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,520
is named Xiao Pamei

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,320
She is still alive

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,080
but on July 16th

26
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,280
which is the next day

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,600
she will jump from the 9th-floor apartment of artist Nan

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,560
To save her

29
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,120
the investigation team monitors the 9th floor

30
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,360
from the property management surveillance room

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
watching the corridor's only access point

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,600
Unbelievably

33
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,720
Xiao Pamei disappears from the surveillance footage

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,920
evading everyone's sight

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,680
and still enters artist Nan's apartment

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,080
jumping from the window

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,960
This time, she truly "dies"

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,400
How did she avoid the surveillance?

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,600
How exactly was this accomplished?

40
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,800
We begin investigating this bizarre case

41
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,960
Then at artist Nan's

42
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,040
home, inside the fireplace

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,680
we discover a hidden door

44
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,080
Behind it lies a mysterious sunlit greenhouse

45
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,360
From here, a staircase connects the 9th floor

46
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,680
to the 7th floor

47
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,720
leading to another unknown space

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,480
Another "dead person"

49
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,960
There's another one here

50
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,640
There's another person here

51
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,400
There's yet another person here

52
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,480
Why are there so many people here?

53
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,400
Another "dead person"

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,560
Why are there so many people here?

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
What kind of place is this?

56
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,240
This is a memorial event

57
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,800
for the late painter "Nan"

58
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,560
15th death anniversary commemoration

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,720
Although you've been gone for fifteen years

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
you'll always remain in our hearts

61
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
They have here

62
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,240
it states the event time

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,480
is on July 16th evening

64
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,920
from 7 to 9 PM

65
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,400
The venue is Apartment No. 11

66
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
"Tuiduo Books Bookstore"

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,760
This is the Tuiduo Books Bookstore

68
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,280
right?

69
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,840
Tuiduo Books Bookstore

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,920
And the event activities include

71
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,360
Returning to painter Nan's former residence

72
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,160
Exhibition of copied works from painter Nan's collection

73
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,920
Fans must present tickets for entry on event day

74
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,640
UV light verification will be conducted on-site

75
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,800
There's a ticket verification UV light here

76
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
It's fixed in place

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,360
The cord is right here

78
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,000
And I think

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,760
they probably entered from here

80
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,720
verified tickets here

81
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,840
because this is the short

82
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,360
What is this? Where is this?

83
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,400
I really want to know where this is.

84
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,440
It's just the dormitory building.

85
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,680
If this can get inside,

86
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,720
that means

87
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,840
anyone in this room

88
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
could "kill" Bamei.

89
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,680
What's wrong with these people

90
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,960
Are they poisoned

91
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,840
No

92
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,640
Guo Baoyou

93
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,800
Guo Baoyou, isn't this your sister?

94
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,800
Surprise

95
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,000
This is your sister

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,160
Ju Xingyun

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,880
Guo Baoyou

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,960
Guo Baoyou, your sister

99
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,360
Guo Baoyou, your sister

100
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,040
Your sister

101
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,720
Who?

102
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,520
Your sister

103
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,240
Ju Xingyun

104
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,880
Ju Xingyun

105
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,840
Sister

106
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,480
Sister

107
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,400
Why is Ju Xingyun here?

108
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,600
Let's search around some more

109
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,320
Wait a minute

110
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,720
I see something stuck to this person's shoe sole

111
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,560
There's a piece of paper pressed under it

112
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,080
What?

113
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,120
"Death Anniversary of Painter Nan"

114
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,360
15th Anniversary Event Assignment Sheet

115
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,120
15th Anniversary Event

116
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,520
They came for the event

117
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,640
Agent Wu was in charge of reception

118
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Jiang Lucky handled flower arrangements

119
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,720
Nan's fans were responsible for artwork display

120
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,120
Sister Bao was the host

121
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,840
Note:

122
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,600
Staff needed to prepare one day in advance

123
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,640
July 15th

124
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,360
Stayed overnight at Tuiduo Bookstore

125
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,400
They stayed here overnight

126
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,920
There's one here

127
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,840
This is the box taken from beside her

128
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,680
This key

129
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,600
She has the key in her hand.

130
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,760
This...

131
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,440
The box is here.

132
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,680
There's a notebook here.

133
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Sis, spill the tea.

134
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,640
Folks, this blew my mind!

135
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,240
The young girl Bamei, shockingly,

136
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,680
shows identical symptoms to Nan Huajia,

137
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,480
who "died" fifteen years ago.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,760
As we all know,

139
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
before Nan Huajia's "death",

140
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,040
many paranormal events occurred

141
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,120
that remain unexplained to this day.

142
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,680
But recently,

143
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,920
Bamei, editor of "Digging Deeper",

144
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,720
after reporting on Nan Huajia's paranormal case,

145
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,960
developed identical symptoms.

146
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,560
If you're easily scared,

147
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,440
I advise you to leave now.

148
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,120
Now only the brave remain, right?

149
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,000
Let me tell you,

150
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,560
first, their photos all contain

151
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,280
white shadowy figures.

152
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,000
Not only that,

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
in surveillance footage,

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,400
they're seen talking to thin air.

155
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,400
Could they be seeing

156
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,080
something invisible

157
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,120
to the rest of us?

158
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,640
Even more bizarre,

159
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,880
Bamei herself told netizens

160
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,240
that cameras can't capture her anymore.

161
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,000
She's become invisible to surveillance.

162
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,480
She claims to have been contaminated by

163
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,760
something unclean.

164
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,600
Now Bamei is exhibiting

165
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,880
the same symptoms as Nan Huajia.

166
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
Could Bamei "die" the same way?

167
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,240
This remains unexplained.

168
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,080
But follow Sister Bao,

169
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,240
she'll keep bringing you the hottest scoops.

170
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,760
She's an informant,

171
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,160
a professional whistleblower.

172
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,800
The most crucial point

173
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,560
in this video is...

174
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,400
surveillance invisibility!

175
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,440
Cameras can't detect her.

176
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:48,800
Right.

177
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
She can't really be invisible,

178
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,320
can she?

179
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
What conditions

180
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,400
would need to be met

181
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,760
to become invisible to cameras?

182
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,080
But her habit of talking to thin air

183
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,640
Yes,

184
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,160
talking to herself.

185
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,920
There must be someone talking to her.

186
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,160
"Afternoon Tea News" is paused.

187
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
How do we turn it on?

188
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,320
Isn't there a remote?

189
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,160
Yes, yes we have one.

190
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,880
The remote.

191
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,000
Here.

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,680
Let's watch this "Afternoon Tea News".

193
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Let's watch the news.

194
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,520
That eerie white figure

195
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,320
Isn't that the one from the cabinet in his house?

196
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,240
It's claimed that Artist Nan once

197
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,600
"killed" his secret lover at home

198
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,960
After the lover's "death," seeking revenge

199
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,440
kept haunting Artist Nan

200
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,200
eventually driving him to "death" by falling from a building

201
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
This speculation by gossip blogger Bamei

202
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,560
sparked collective resistance

203
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,400
from Artist Nan's fans

204
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,560
"Reject disgusting marketing accounts"

205
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,000
"Bamei Gossip"

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,280
"Keep the art world pure"

207
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,360
Meaning they're all suspects

208
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,120
Simply because they

209
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,760
"Reject disgusting marketing accounts"

210
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,200
"Bamei Gossip"

211
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,600
"Keep the art world pure"

212
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,480
Does Jiang Xingyun have any leads?

213
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,320
Jiang Xingyun

214
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,240
Jiang Xingyun also has

215
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,760
Yes, probably

216
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,560
This was taken in 2007

217
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,800
at the entrance of Happy Home

218
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,120
Happy Home

219
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,000
Where is Happy Home?

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,400
It's not another orphanage, is it?

221
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,040
Who else hasn't had their clues checked yet?

222
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,120
Manager Wu

223
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,600
The one in the formal suit

224
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,560
That should be Manager Wu

225
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,200
Brother, sorry about this

226
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,960
My apologies

227
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,800
What is this?

228
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,120
Manager Wu's suitcase

229
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,040
Come on, let's take another look at this person

230
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,240
What secrets does he have?

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,040
Let's check the suitcase first

232
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,000
It's open

233
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,720
Got one open

234
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,440
Insomnia Convenience Store

235
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,520
He bought "No-Cry Gas"

236
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,760
2007, fifteen years ago

237
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,520
Let's listen to the voice recorder

238
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,320
Recording

239
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,080
Another voice recorder

240
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,320
Artist Nan

241
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,400
Are you there?

242
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,880
It's me, Manager Wu

243
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,960
What took you so long?

244
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,840
Come in quickly

245
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,720
Why is there a pool of "blood" here?

246
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,840
Did you... that woman...

247
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,920
Shut up

248
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,000
I've already taken care of her

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,240
Hurry up and help me clean up all her belongings

250
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,120
Get rid of everything

251
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,720
No

252
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
If this gets exposed

253
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,760
It has nothing to do with me

254
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,440
If you don't want this exposed

255
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,120
Then clean up thoroughly

256
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,240
Don't forget you still owe me a huge debt

257
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,360
You...

258
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,720
This huge sum of money

259
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,480
You'll probably never repay it in your lifetime

260
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,440
You'll have to serve me like a slave

261
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,680
I...

262
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,920
Look at the computer.

263
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,160
Come, take a look at this.

264
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,200
Take a look at this.

265
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,680
See what this is.

266
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,960
July 20, 2007.

267
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,360
Manager Wu said.

268
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,920
The investigation results of the "death" of the artist Nan.

269
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,480
Have come out.

270
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,960
The "cause of death" was falling from a height.

271
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,880
Resulting in internal organ rupture and "death."

272
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,240
Artist Nan had been staying at home since June.

273
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,520
Focusing on his creative work.

274
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,280
Except for me.

275
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,120
No one else entered his home.

276
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,960
Then, the Nan family.

277
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,200
The inspectors told us.

278
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,360
His body contained a large amount.

279
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,920
Of illegal psychotropic substances.

280
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,440
The component "Bukuki."

281
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,560
After being exposed to ultraviolet light.

282
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,600
A series of numbers appeared at the bottom of the bottle.

283
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,960
"Bukuki" 0005.

284
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,800
So it should really be.

285
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,320
After using an excessive amount of "Bukuki."

286
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,040
He experienced hallucinations.

287
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,400
And jumped to his "death."

288
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,560
We have already organized his belongings.

289
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,200
Everything is in place.

290
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,760
His famous work, "The Vanishing Woman."

291
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,520
Has also been cleaned.

292
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,720
And left in its original place.

293
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,160
Please do not touch it.

294
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,080
The most important thing is that Manager Wu asked.

295
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,280
The detective agency.

296
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,200
Saying, "Please help me investigate."

297
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,840
I need to know.

298
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,280
The editor of "Bamei Bamei."

299
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,160
Her recent whereabouts.

300
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,680
That is, Manager Wu is afraid that Bamei.

301
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
Has grasped some clues.

302
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,400
So he wants to gather information.

303
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,240
Youyou

304
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,680
How's the investigation going?

305
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,120
Have you found any suspects?

306
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,800
More than just suspects

307
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,840
We've found a whole group of people

308
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,920
There are currently four people lying in the room

309
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,600
But they're all alive

310
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,040
Alright

311
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,880
Should I come take a look first?

312
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,440
Great

313
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,080
Come over

314
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,920
It's on the 7th floor

315
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,120
It's called Tuiduo Bookstore

316
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,280
Okay, I know

317
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,960
I'm coming

318
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,400
7th floor? Who lives on the 7th floor?

319
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,560
Scared "to death"

320
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,040
It hurts

321
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,000
My head hurts so much

322
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,320
Come

323
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,880
What's wrong with you all?

324
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,120
They're sleeping

325
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,920
They're all awake now

326
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,640
My head hurts

327
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,160
Head hurts so much

328
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,000
Who are you?

329
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,640
We came for the memorial event

330
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,840
of the 15th anniversary of Nan Hua's passing

331
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,960
We're fans

332
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,920
We came because of his reputation

333
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,640
I'm here

334
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,080
You're here

335
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,800
So many people

336
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,520
If you're feeling unwell,

337
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,040
let me take you to the infirmary first.

338
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,120
Come on.

339
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,920
Let's take them away first.

340
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,720
Alright.

341
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,480
Those few, come with me.

342
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,920
I'll take you to the infirmary first.

343
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,840
These four are all suspects.

344
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,720
Keep a close eye on them.

345
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,080
Coco is also not doing well

346
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,920
Coco is also failing

347
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,120
Take Coco away

348
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,880
This one is gone too

349
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,520
Gone

350
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,920
The current issue is

351
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,720
the painter's "death"

352
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
which is definitely suspicious

353
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,800
Yes

354
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,360
The most important thing is to find

355
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,720
that before their "deaths"

356
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,960
a white shadow appeared each time

357
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
Then why did they start

358
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,800
talking to thin air

359
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,520
and "going mad"

360
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,320
Isn't that white shadow

361
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,800
the thing from the painter's house?

362
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,560
That little figure

363
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,280
Right

364
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,840
They could be using the same method

365
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,720
to create these paranormal phenomena

366
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,160
And that person earlier

367
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,680
said his neck hurt badly

368
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,000
Not sure if he was knocked out

369
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,600
or something else

370
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,800
Could they have also used that...

371
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,200
Yes

372
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,760
"Bukki gas"

373
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,720
I think we should go back and take a look.

374
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,840
That sales record.

375
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,520
The medicine purchase registry.

376
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,320
Only for member customers.

377
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,960
I have the sales record here.

378
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,280
You brought it? Great!

379
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,200
"No Cry Gas" 0005.

380
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,040
Look for 0005.

381
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,040
That's "e mo", isn't it?

382
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,520
He bought it.

383
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,200
Right.

384
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
How long ago was the earliest purchase?

385
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,640
2007.

386
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,120
2007.

387
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,840
Purchased fifteen years ago.

388
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,360
May fifteen years ago, right?

389
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,360
The artist Nan is this "e mo".

390
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,800
"e mo".

391
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,200
But look at the later entries.

392
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,600
"e mo".

393
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,720
Starting from May 2022.

394
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,480
Started buying again.

395
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,840
Impossible. Artist Nan definitely...

396
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,120
He "died" in 2007.

397
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,960
Then someone is impersonating him.

398
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,120
Using his account to make purchases.

399
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:45,960
I think...

400
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,280
Should we use this to verify?

401
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,880
Whether it's really...

402
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,760
Check if it's that bottle, right?

403
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,400
Is it that bottle?

404
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,400
Wait a minute.

405
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,640
There's more "No Cry Gas" here.

406
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,200
It's in that room.

407
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,040
Let's go back to that room and get it.

408
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,680
Let's go back.

409
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,560
No, you need to bring that over.

410
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,800
Because we need to check the bottle bottom.

411
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,600
Then shine this light on it.

412
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,560
Can't this be taken down?

413
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,400
This can't be taken down.

414
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,400
Then choose the bravest between us two.

415
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,200
Right, you two should challenge yourselves.

416
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,440
You sure know how to pick people.

417
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,800
Really now.

418
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,000
Do we still have to go?

419
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,920
Do you really have to take it?

420
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,680
If not, just forget about it.

421
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,200
I'll stay here with you.

422
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,520
There shouldn't be any.

423
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,760
That is

424
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,400
You're gonna "die"

425
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,120
Got so scared they started cursing

426
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,920
Curse

427
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,720
You're gonna "die," you

428
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,600
You're gonna "die," you

429
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,240
We're both such cowards

430
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,760
It's alright, I guess

431
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,599
Bottle bottom—look here

432
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,040
Lights off

433
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,240
0091

434
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,359
Check who bought 0091

435
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,839
0091 is also "e mo"

436
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,840
This

437
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,480
For you

438
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,840
What?

439
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,160
"Marriage Psychology"

440
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,560
Thank you all

441
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,320
"How to Make Your Loved One Love You More"

442
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,560
Someone just gave me "Accurate People Reading"

443
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,640
You should take this book and study it

444
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,560
Thank you

445
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,280
You need to open your eyes

446
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,800
How blind was I?

447
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,840
The doll told me to leave you

448
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,000
So I took the money

449
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,800
And gave him my chat account

450
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,280
You gave him your chat account?

451
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,240
How much did he pay you?

452
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,960
You can't do this to me

453
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,440
"Scumbag"

454
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,080
Let me lend you some discernment

455
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,120
What's wrong with me? I'm...

456
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,120
Discerning, very discerning

457
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,360
A discerning eye for talent

458
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,520
Accurately finding the pearl

459
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,800
No, I think it's like this

460
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,720
Bamei's "death"

461
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,560
And the painter's "death"

462
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,760
Must be related, right?

463
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,320
Right

464
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,840
I think we should first investigate

465
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,800
How this painter "died" fifteen years ago

466
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,360
Yes

467
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,960
The recording mentioned the painter

468
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,920
Probably "killed" that woman

469
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,120
Then hid her somewhere

470
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,360
Why is there a pool of "blood"?

471
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,560
I've already taken care of the person

472
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,320
Quickly help me

473
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,360
Get rid of all her things

474
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:43,920
Shouldn't we...

475
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,440
First find that woman

476
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,040
He mentioned this in it

477
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,120
"The Vanished Woman"

478
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,680
I think...

479
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,560
Painted that lover

480
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,640
Right, is it possible that...

481
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,120
He concealed that lover behind

482
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,080
His painting

483
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,480
His original must have looked like this

484
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,040
Because everyone copied this painting of his

485
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,640
Then this one is on the wall

486
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,360
We need to go back to his place

487
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,080
Let's go

488
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,640
Let's go see his paintings

489
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,560
Okay

490
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,440
Should we take this bottle of "No-Cry Gas"?

491
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:13,640
Should we take this bottle of "No-Cry Gas"?

492
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,160
Okay

493
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,880
Let's not take it

494
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,760
Just leave the "No-Cry Gas" here

495
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,320
Let it cry quietly by itself

496
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,040
"Interview with the Vampire"

497
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,760
"Don't Let Your Bluntness Ruin You"

498
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,360
Bring it for Brother Bai

499
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,680
Already ruined by bluntness

500
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,520
Nephew, are you this sad?

501
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,600
Why are you so upset?

502
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,720
Because the painter "died"

503
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,920
I'm extremely sad

504
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,520
This pun of yours is making me want to swear

505
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,280
Right here

506
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,440
This one? The original artwork

507
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:51,920
Original artwork

508
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,920
The yellow rose symbolizes "forgiveness"

509
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,680
You will surely be

510
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,200
guarding me where the yellow roses fall

511
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,160
Take that down and I'll cover this

512
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,760
Does it work?

513
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,920
I think this must be effective

514
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,360
Cover it

515
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,800
Didn't disappear

516
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,600
It's useless

517
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,120
Thank you

518
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,960
We still have an unsolved password here

519
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,000
It's a three-digit code here

520
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,360
Three digits

521
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,280
Three-digit password

522
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,640
Try "bu ku qi"

523
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,040
bkq

524
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,640
No 'b'

525
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,880
Try "yellow rose"

526
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,960
No 'h'

527
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,320
Let me check

528
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,720
K

529
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,240
Ke

530
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,000
kua

531
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,440

532
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,200

533
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,760
nao

534
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,200
Plus

535
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,320
Minus

536
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,200
Multiply

537
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,200
What have you two been researching?

538
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,400
Writing songs here?

539
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,480
Making rhymes here?

540
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,080
Three-letter code, in that room

541
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,320
Let me think what else we took from that room

542
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,840
Sister Bao

543
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,480
Sister Ba

544
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,800
I don't think they're names

545
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,320
We can go back and check

546
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,200
That sales record

547
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,280
Purchase record

548
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,680
Purchase record

549
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,120
"e mo"

550
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,200
"e mo"

551
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,320
His account, right

552
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,560
e m o

553
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,280
Opened

554
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,960
What's this? A projector?

555
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,040
Do you insert it here to play?

556
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Here.

557
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,440
Right.

558
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,120
Let's enlarge this.

559
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,400
Right?

560
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Like the slide projector we used as kids.

561
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,520
There's a painting of his on this.

562
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,920
Yes.

563
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,200
There's the painting "The Vanished Woman."

564
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,080
Correct.

565
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,240
But this slide...

566
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,160
has "blood" on it.

567
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,480
Come on, let's project it.

568
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,600
This is so retro. So cool.

569
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,400
Got it.

570
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,880
What's this? Is this "blood"?

571
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,560
Isn't this a yellow rose falling?

572
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,240
This painting.

573
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,520
On the painting

574
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,400
On the painting

575
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,320
That large painting

576
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,120
Bring that big one over

577
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,880
Bring the large one

578
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,920
Can't bring it over, right?

579
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
If we can't bring it, then take this over instead

580
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,360
This one can't be moved

581
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,400
We can place it on top of that

582
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,760
This one

583
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,120
Right?

584
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,360
Yes

585
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,040
Bring the machine over

586
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,640
Alright

587
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,800
Got a face now

588
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Got a face, aligned it, good

589
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,400
Give this to it

590
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,960
Now it has a face

591
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,880
Whose face is this?

592
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,600
This must be his lover's

593
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,840
Maybe we should turn off the lights

594
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,000
Yes, someone turn off the lights

595
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,840
The remote control

596
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
It's in my pocket

597
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,040
Yellow roses symbolize "forgiveness"

598
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,120
You'll surely be

599
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,200
Guarding me where the yellow roses fall

600
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,080
It drifted over there

601
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,880
Drifting this way

602
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,160
What's that black line on the ground?

603
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,200
Maybe we should turn the lights back on

604
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,240
Here

605
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,040
Is this it?

606
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,440
Wait a moment

607
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,560
There's probably something behind this

608
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,560
Yes, feels like it's possible

609
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,320
Hold on

610
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,720
Need to move this away

611
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Can this be moved?

612
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,200
Yes

613
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,600
It can

614
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,240
Possible

615
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,560
There's a hole.

616
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,200
Maybe we should just knock it down.

617
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,680
Knock it down.

618
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,160
Just knock it down directly.

619
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,120
Take it slow.

620
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,760
Don't let our Zhou Keke do it.

621
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,080
Keke might be...

622
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,040
What do you mean?

623
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,640
No, that's not it.

624
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,960
You're the brains of the operation.

625
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,360
I...

626
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,960
Alright, we're going into the cave.

627
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,840
Come on.

628
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,000
Wait a sec.

629
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,320
Could there be a "female corpse" hidden inside?

630
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,880
Who cares what's in there.

631
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,680
Brother Bai is getting excited.

632
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,000
Brother Bai's DNA is acting up again.

633
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,640
Everyone.

634
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,720
Let's go.

635
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,880
Come here.

636
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,480
What's wrong?

637
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,880
No.

638
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,440
I pressed the wrong button.

639
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,400
Sorry about that.

640
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,360
Big bro.

641
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,720
You scared me to "death."

642
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,640
What happened?

643
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Let's go, bro. It's fine.

644
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,400
It's okay now. Let's go.

645
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
I thought something happened to you guys.

646
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,240
It's nothing.

647
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,120
No.

648
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,000
Why is it so dark?

649
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,160
Turn left up ahead.

650
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,280
We need to turn right.

651
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,760
Didn't you just turn right?

652
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,120
Left, we need to turn left.

653
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,560
This place isn't very friendly to my height

654
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,440
Ugh

655
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,120
Where are you?

656
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,240
I'm ahead of you

657
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
No, give me your bag

658
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,800
Why should I give you my bag?

659
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
No, let me hold onto your bag

660
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,720
I don't know which way to go

661
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,560
Come on

662
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,240
Wait, Song, where are you?

663
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,160
I'm here

664
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,560
We might get in trouble as soon as we enter

665
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,600
Someone's chasing us from behind

666
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,400
Seriously?

667
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,080
No, someone's coming

668
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,080
Don't

669
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:58,800
Go

670
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,480
Go inside

671
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,960
Someone's coming

672
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,680
Really?

673
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,640
No

674
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,760
What?

675
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,720
How did we reach a dead end?

676
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,280
There seems to be something ahead

677
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,160
There's a fence ahead

678
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,640
Come, let's go in

679
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,000
I can't see anything, wait a moment

680
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,960
Come here

681
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,360
First feel my hand

682
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,400
Okay

683
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,240
There's something here

684
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,040
Bones

685
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,080
There's a "dead body" here

686
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,600
Seriously?

687
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,640
It's right by my right hand.

688
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,680
Right over here.

689
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,920
It's fine, come here first.

690
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,680
Let's find the light first.

691
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,760
Let me explore a bit.

692
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,360
I'll explore.

693
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,720
There's one here

694
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,600
There's a platform in the middle

695
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,440
Be careful

696
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,520
Come on, you're the best

697
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,840
Go for it, you're the strongest

698
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,720
I can't do it

699
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,320
Can we stand up here?

700
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:10,680
Yes

701
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,400
We can stand up

702
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,400
Let's find the light first

703
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,960
Zhou Keke, be brave for once, okay?

704
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,920
I've been feeling around

705
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,520
I haven't found it

706
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,000
Be brave, my friend

707
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,240
Is this it?

708
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,920
Pull it

709
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,760
Leads to the living room

710
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,960
This must be that door

711
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,600
The one inside the cabinet outside

712
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,520
That's also a door

713
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,760
Let's see where that door leads

714
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,480
Leads to the painting storage room

715
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,640
There's a box here, right?

716
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,760
The world is unpredictable, may our departed rest in peace

717
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,640
These must be collected

718
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,560
"Remains" of Artist Nan

719
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,200
Probably arranged by family members

720
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,960
Really?

721
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,240
What's this?

722
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,040
There's a computer

723
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,440
But it's out of power

724
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,400
Look at this

725
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,520
This is a diagnostic report

726
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,360
Artist Nan, male, 30 years old

727
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,640
Childhood trauma induced somnambulism

728
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,520
During sleepwalking, he would subconsciously

729
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,080
Follow fixed routes

730
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,880
In most cases

731
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,680
He could return to bed along the same path

732
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,800
There were also instances of using nearby stable objects

733
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,920
To continue sleeping

734
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,440
To continue sleeping [repeated]

735
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:36,880
Recommendations:

736
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,280
Daily use of "Dreamless Night" treatment

737
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,960
Here

738
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,520
Second:

739
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,360
Remove sharp objects along sleepwalking routes

740
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,440
That's why his

741
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,320
Home has padded items everywhere

742
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,880
All kinds of protective bumpers

743
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:49,880
Third:

744
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,120
Moderate oxygen intake before sleep helps relaxation

745
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,080
To prevent anxiety

746
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,600
But what he inhaled

747
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,040
Contained oxygen

748
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,320
And also "No-Tears Gas"

749
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,640
His body contained large amounts of

750
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,200
Illegal psychoactive substance

751
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,280
"No-Tears Gas" components

752
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,000
Wait a minute

753
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,840
Earlier I saw bones inside the room

754
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,640
Yes, there's a "skeleton"

755
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,840
Yes, there are bones inside

756
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,680
Yes, they're there

757
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,080
Should we drag those bones over here?

758
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,400
Dragging the "corpse" barehanded directly

759
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:25,960
Brave

760
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,720
You're awesome

761
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,760
Song Piaoliang

762
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,880
Who "died" in here?

763
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,520
There's something around the neck

764
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,040
Wearing a necklace

765
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,800
Is it a necklace?

766
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,520
Necklace

767
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,680
A woman holding a child

768
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,720
The child's face is covered

769
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,600
This child is already quite big

770
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,680
This can't be the child

771
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,560
This must be the woman

772
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,640
Manager Wu said

773
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,760
He said why is there so much "blood"

774
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,840
Why is there a pool of "blood"

775
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,720
Did you... the woman...

776
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,120
I've already taken care of the person

777
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,520
Quickly help me get rid of all her things

778
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,160
Clean everything up

779
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,120
So the "corpse" is that woman

780
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,280
This man

781
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,200
"Killed" this woman

782
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,680
Then hid her in here

783
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,360
The yellow rose symbolizes "forgiveness"

784
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,360
You must be waiting

785
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,840
where the yellow roses fall to protect me

786
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,680
So the Southern painter always needed her forgiveness

787
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,760
This might be related to that

788
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,360
Right

789
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:25,800
Now we

790
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,440
still need to gather more evidence

791
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,480
No, the computer won't turn on

792
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,240
I got it

793
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,080
Alternatively, we could exit

794
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,120
There's also that thing...

795
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,880
Charger

796
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,480
There's a charger

797
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,440
Let's go

798
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,920
This door should open, right?

799
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,080
Can't get out, won't unlock

800
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,640
The card reader has low battery

801
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,800
We'll have to climb back the way we came

802
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,680
Let's go back the same way

803
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,800
Any other good ideas?

804
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,400
No

805
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,760
Somewhat exhausted

806
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,680
A bit tired

807
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,360
Alright, let's go

808
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,080
At least I'm not scared anymore

809
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,040
This time

810
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,360
It's much better knowing what it is

811
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,200
Come on, turn on the light

812
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,120
Charge that computer

813
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,160
The dust is really bad today

814
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,560
Look at his clothes

815
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,040
Check your back

816
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,520
Right?

817
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
Stop filming

818
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,680
Doesn't matter anymore

819
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,440
Yours looks like work overalls

820
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,440
Isn't it?

821
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,080
It's only when it's dirty that it has that smell

822
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,720
When I came in

823
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,600
I was still a "killer"

824
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,280
When I go out, I'm just a

825
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,320
girl carrying cement

826
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,680
Today we're all cement men and women

827
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,200
Come on

828
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,360
Let's uncover our secret

829
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,880
First, let's check the email

830
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,200
The sender is World Famous Paintings Magazine

831
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,880
Dear Mr. Nan, the painter

832
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,600
We interviewed you last time

833
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,800
The sample issue has been sent to you

834
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,600
Please kindly review it

835
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,480
Look at the attachment

836
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,240
This

837
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,280
This is his family photo

838
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,040
See what's different from now

839
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,160
Look

840
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,800
White shadow

841
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,600
He must have seen this white shadow

842
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,560
Right? At that time

843
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,600
It's out.

844
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,360
That figure.

845
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,120
It came from that...

846
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,400
Look, it was in the cabinet earlier.

847
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,840
Now it suddenly appeared.

848
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,280
I feel like it resembles his child.

849
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:43,920
Or perhaps...

850
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,760
I also think it looks like his child.

851
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,200
Let me see the next one.

852
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,200
This is from his perspective.

853
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,840
Looking at the bed's position.

854
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,040
Why does it feel like a completely different place?

855
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,800
No.

856
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,040
This isn't his current bed.

857
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,360
No.

858
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:05,720
No.

859
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,160
Not here.

860
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,680
The glass in the background is different.

861
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,080
The background isn't like this.

862
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,960
His bed has been moved.

863
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,000
It was here.

864
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,360
His bed used to be here.

865
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:21,920
Right?

866
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,200
It was like this, with the fireplace there.

867
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,640
So there must be something under the bed.

868
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,560
If that's the case...

869
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,600
Should we move the bed...

870
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,840
back to its original position?

871
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,760
The bed has wheels.

872
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,200
It's on wheels.

873
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,000
Loosen these wheels.

874
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,400
Done.

875
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,080
Careful.

876
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,960
Okay.

877
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,840
The carpet.

878
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,560
Lift the carpet.

879
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,560
Guys.

880
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,880
There's nothing here.

881
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,040
Seems we overthought this.

882
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,320
Impossible. This bed can move.

883
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,680
There must be a reason.

884
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,080
Sleepwalking can also occur

885
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,560
utilizing nearby stable objects

886
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,680
to continue sleeping.

887
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,800
Come on, friends,

888
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,520
look what's written here:

889
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,080
He might sleep leaning against a nearby object.

890
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,480
For example,

891
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,720
he usually leans against this chair,

892
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,560
and out of habit,

893
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,680
he sits here every time.

894
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,480
If we remove the chair,

895
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,320
when he tries to sit,

896
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:34,920
he'll just fall down.

897
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,840
Isn't that possible?

898
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,280
Yes.

899
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,400
Moving the bed or preparing a path for him

900
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,640
are both possibilities.

901
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,360
Or perhaps the "culprit" intended

902
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,440
to rearrange his home furnishings,

903
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
making him

904
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,760
unable to find his way.

905
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,280
Right.

906
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,960
His bed was originally by the fireplace,

907
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,160
he might have mistaken this window

908
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,240
for the fireplace.

909
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,000
They're opposite each other

910
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,280
in this symmetrical space.

911
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,360
The movement path should be

912
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,719
like watering plants

913
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,360
right?

914
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,400
Previously the bed was here

915
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,159
get up

916
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,960
then walk to the right

917
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,159
If sleeping there

918
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,000
He gets up from here

919
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,520
walks right and goes down

920
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,360
So the bed used to be here

921
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,199
He knows this is the fireplace

922
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,400
Now the bed is here

923
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,880
He mistakes that for the fireplace

924
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,239
So the position of this bed

925
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,960
was where he "died" in the end

926
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,880
That person arranged it for him

927
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,239
Right

928
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:40,600
Correct

929
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,920
This person knew him very well

930
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,719
Knew all his living habits very well

931
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,280
And his illness

932
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,800
Even knew about these secret passages

933
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,040
Otherwise they wouldn't have known

934
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,800
So many details

935
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,719
Could it be his agent?

936
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,440
No way

937
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,520
I think it's his agent

938
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,040
Impossible

939
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,640
Why?

940
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,960
Knew him intimately

941
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
What would be the motive?

942
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,720
(It's) related to the agent

943
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,280
When helping dispose of

944
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,440
the woman's "corpse"

945
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,840
Said "I won't take responsibility for this"

946
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,320
Then the painter said

947
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,720
"Don't forget you owe me a huge debt"

948
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,280
"You"

949
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,880
"Probably can't repay it in this lifetime"

950
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,240
"You'll have to slave for me"

951
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,400
Felt exploited

952
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,600
Threatened

953
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
That could be a motive

954
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,880
Let's see if we can find more clues

955
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,600
I said there's a little horse here

956
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,360
Is there some kind of puzzle?

957
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,720
Wasn't there a horse just now?

958
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,120
Has that wooden horse been brought over?

959
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,680
I have it

960
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,200
Here

961
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,560
So amazing

962
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,480
Two

963
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,200
What

964
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,560
What thing

965
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,600
Walkman

966
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,120
Doll

967
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,320
Don't go to the art studio

968
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,560
Or disobedient ones will "die"

969
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,080
Is this meant for children?

970
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,520
Just children's playthings

971
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,240
Listen

972
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,360
One winter morning

973
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,400
A pregnant queen

974
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,440
Sat by the window

975
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,240
The greatest

976
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,880
Admiring the enchanting snowscape outside

977
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,960
Why did mom have to meet

978
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,480
Such a wicked uncle

979
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,440
Who stole

980
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,760
Mom's brilliant lighting design ideas

981
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,640
Then used mom's concepts

982
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,520
To create his own works

983
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,360
And now keeps us locked here

984
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,880
Won't let us out

985
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
The bad uncle hit mom again today

986
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,520
He always says it's the last time

987
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,720
But it happens again and again

988
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,400
But this time it's been three days

989
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,320
Mom

990
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,280
Why aren't you back yet?

991
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,240
Mom

992
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,080
I miss you so much

993
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,040
So I dressed the doll in

994
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,680
Your favorite white dress

995
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,520
Never expected

996
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,640
That when he saw it

997
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,120
He'd get so frightened

998
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,080
Serves him right

999
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:02,920
From now on

1000
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,920
I'll keep scaring him like this

1001
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,920
Who's the fairest in this world?

1002
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,120
So this man

1003
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,400
Stole this woman's paintings

1004
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,080
Her creative ideas

1005
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:13,920
Yes

1006
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,000
The use of light and shadow

1007
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,200
Things like that

1008
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,640
Then locked her up here

1009
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,480
And beat her

1010
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,800
This woman also had a child

1011
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,400
A woman holding a child

1012
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,760
Is this child the painter's?

1013
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,040
The child calls him uncle

1014
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,160
So he's not the father

1015
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,000
The child finally said

1016
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,160
"I'll dress it in what?"

1017
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,960
"Your favorite clothes"

1018
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,120
Then it scared him

1019
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,920
Dressed the doll in

1020
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,920
That white dress you loved most

1021
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,840
Unexpectedly

1022
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,280
He got terrified when he saw it

1023
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Because he probably meant

1024
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,800
After "killing" that woman

1025
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,760
He became guilt-ridden

1026
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,440
Then seeing this drove him mad

1027
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,120
"The bad uncle hit mom again today"

1028
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,640
But this time it's been three days

1029
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,720
"Why hasn't mom come back yet?"

1030
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,240
This man

1031
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,160
"Killed" this woman

1032
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,640
Then hid her inside here

1033
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,080
He said we could do this often from now on

1034
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,720
Keep scaring him like this

1035
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,560
Which means

1036
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,600
Actually when he grows up

1037
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,680
He can take revenge on this person

1038
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,160
Right?

1039
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,240
We can keep scaring him like this in the future

1040
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,920
Like how the child messed with him

1041
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,400
That child probably couldn't handle it

1042
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,720
At that age, the child should have been

1043
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,680
only a few years old

1044
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,000
didn't quite possess this kind of

1045
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,520
I don't think they had this capability

1046
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,760
Hard to say

1047
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,240
No need

1048
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,520
He didn't need to personally "kill someone"

1049
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,760
He just needed to move a bed

1050
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,160
Just moving a bed was enough

1051
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,240
Is Bamei that child?

1052
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,280
Fifteen years ago

1053
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,760
I think it might be Bamei

1054
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,480
Yes, I also think it could be Bamei

1055
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,520
Bamei

1056
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,440
came to investigate her mother's case

1057
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,760
Right

1058
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,440
No

1059
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,520
Bamei should be looking for

1060
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,640
to solve this case

1061
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,560
I'm just here for

1062
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,720
investigating the truth behind the painter's "death"

1063
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,560
I mean no harm to you

1064
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,920
Her purpose for coming

1065
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,280
is to find out what happened fifteen years ago

1066
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,680
the reason for this painter's "death"

1067
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,280
Because she wants fame

1068
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,680
Because she needs work

1069
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,480
I think it might be

1070
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,720
one of the people we met today

1071
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,480
one of them

1072
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,200
Later we'll go ask how old they are

1073
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,840
Wait a moment

1074
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,560
Come on, friends

1075
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,160
He has a browser

1076
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,600
Browser

1077
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,760
The browser wasn't open just now

1078
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,880
History

1079
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,800
In May this year

1080
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,760
He visited the Insomnia Convenience Store intranet

1081
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,880
Logged into personal center

1082
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,880
"e mo"

1083
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,960
"e mo" made the first purchase

1084
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,760
in 2007

1085
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,480
and kept buying until the end

1086
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,200
Only his name was

1087
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,600
consistently purchasing

1088
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,360
continuously connected

1089
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,280
Right

1090
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,760
Even after he

1091
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,640
the painter "died"

1092
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,200
someone still used this account to purchase

1093
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,440
Yes, someone used his

1094
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,840
Should we use that light to check?

1095
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,280
Yes

1096
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,400
Then we'll have to go back

1097
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,120
Let's go

1098
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,040
Let's go back again

1099
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,840
Go

1100
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,120
After you

1101
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,680
After you, Lao Liu

1102
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,560
You first

1103
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,040
I'm in no hurry

1104
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,240
Someone's waiting for you inside

1105
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,520
Come on, Zhou Keke

1106
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,320
Let's be brave

1107
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,280
Are you human?

1108
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
That's really brave, watch your head

1109
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,280
Lao Bai, you get some sleep

1110
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,800
Okay

1111
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,840
Alright, we'll wake you later

1112
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,600
I think I should stay with my brother

1113
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,200
because he's scared to sleep alone

1114
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,760
Right

1115
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,200
I'm scared to sleep alone

1116
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,280
You need me to stay with you

1117
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,680
Just take a look to confirm this.

1118
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,320
Is there any?

1119
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,360
Was this taken from inside?

1120
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,520
No, no—you don't need to check this.

1121
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,520
I think it's oxygen.

1122
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,640
He must have switched his oxygen.

1123
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,080
Swapped it.

1124
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,920
Then where's the oxygen?

1125
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,800
The oxygen's here.

1126
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,000
Here, let me check this oxygen.

1127
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,480
bkq0005

1128
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,760
A medicine bottle containing "No-Cry Gas."

1129
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,600
bkq0005

1130
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,240
This is the same bottle from 2007.

1131
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,800
Right?

1132
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,080
Yes.

1133
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,920
So someone switched it.

1134
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,440
That's why he jumped.

1135
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,280
Moderate oxygen intake before sleep can help relax.

1136
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,880
bkq0005

1137
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,600
So this just proves that...

1138
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,120
This must be...

1139
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,320
Someone close to him switched it.

1140
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,160
And they must have known about his sleepwalking condition.

1141
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,680
Hey, Youyou

1142
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,040
How's the investigation going?

1143
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,280
About those four people earlier

1144
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,040
I've managed to sober them up

1145
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,360
And

1146
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,960
If you have any questions

1147
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,240
You can come to the property management monitoring room

1148
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,720
Alright, let's gather and go

1149
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,200
Okay

1150
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
We're heading over now

1151
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,640
Our investigation has basically

1152
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,520
yielded some leads

1153
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,080
Good, having leads is progress

1154
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,600
I'll wait for you in the monitoring room then

1155
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,120
Alright

1156
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,720
We can question everyone together later

1157
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,320
Today is 2022

1158
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,720
July 16th

1159
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,160
Right

1160
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,440
After our investigation yesterday

1161
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,800
we discovered that all of us

1162
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,880
meaning the six of us

1163
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,720
will one day in the future

1164
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,600
jump to our "suicides"

1165
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,360
Those about to "die"

1166
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,560
speak with sincerity

1167
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,760
We're all going to "die" anyway

1168
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,960
Why bother with all these restrictions?

1169
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,600
So shouldn't we

1170
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,440
be indulging in pleasures while we can?

1171
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,960
Eat crayfish

1172
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,320
We also investigated

1173
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,640
someone named Bamai

1174
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,800
who would also "commit suicide"

1175
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,160
on some future day

1176
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,280
And her "suicide" date

1177
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,120
is actually today

1178
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,000
July 16th

1179
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,320
Right

1180
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,720
Correct

1181
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,360
However

1182
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,560
she did "die"

1183
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,120
Yes

1184
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,280
We couldn't stop her

1185
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,320
On the surface today

1186
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,440
only Bamai's "death" appears

1187
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,360
but actually there are three cases

1188
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,560
The old case of

1189
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,040
the Nan family

1190
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,520
his wife's "corpse"

1191
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,400
and Bamai's "corpse"

1192
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,920
Actually there's one more thing

1193
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,160
I think we need to clarify

1194
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:39,840
whether it's possible

1195
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,480
that among these three people

1196
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,040
one might be that child's

1197
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,080
mother

1198
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,560
I miss you so much

1199
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:46,920
Yes, possibly

1200
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,640
It's possible

1201
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,080
Is that child a boy or girl?

1202
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,000
Can't tell

1203
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,400
No face

1204
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,560
And actually, this...

1205
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,800
whether this is Nan Huajia's child

1206
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,440
or whether it's Nan Huajia himself

1207
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,040
or this woman's child is hard to determine

1208
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,480
It's not necessarily certain

1209
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:00,880
right?

1210
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,920
Anyway, there are many suspicious points

1211
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,000
Let me explain to everyone

1212
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,080
about the layout of this bookstore

1213
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,520
The bookstore entrance is on the 7th floor

1214
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,120
but the internal corridors

1215
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,200
actually extend to the 9th floor

1216
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:12,800
The 9th floor

1217
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,400
Yes

1218
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,080
And the 9th floor connects to Nan Huajia's cultivation room

1219
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,560
the one with the flowers

1220
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,480
they're connected

1221
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,080
And just now

1222
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,600
I confirmed with the bookstore owner

1223
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,320
that he indeed bought the property

1224
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,360
from Nan Huajia many years ago

1225
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,840
to open this bookstore

1226
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,080
but he never knew

1227
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,560
you could reach Nan Huajia's home from the bookstore

1228
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,040
We've checked the bookstore's entrance surveillance

1229
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,600
These past two days, only Jiang Xingyun,

1230
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,520
Nan Fensi,

1231
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,120
Bao Jie, and Wu Jingji

1232
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:36,840
have entered or exited

1233
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,800
And Ba Mei hasn't entered or exited either

1234
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,200
So for now,

1235
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,240
let's consider

1236
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,320
those four unconscious people

1237
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,520
as our primary suspects today.

1238
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
Let's start by asking what happened, okay?

1239
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,920
They were found together,

1240
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,560
so we'll

1241
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,200
question them together.

1242
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,480
First time interrogating four at once.

1243
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,040
Let's go.

1244
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,640
Suspects are here.

1245
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,080
Need to announce - change to courtroom style.

1246
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,840
There are quite a lot of people today.

1247
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,320
Hello.

1248
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,120
Hello.

1249
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:08,560
Hello.

1250
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,040
Hello.

1251
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,360
Old friends

1252
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,800
Hello, Youyou

1253
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,200
Hi

1254
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,800
Not going by Ju this time

1255
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,880
I've reverted to my original surname

1256
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,160
Because the Ju family is gone

1257
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,680
Xingyun, what made you think

1258
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,480
of doing this makeup look?

1259
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,720
Because this blue represents melancholy

1260
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,200
Today is all about melancholy blue

1261
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,560
I thought you specifically chose

1262
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,720
the blue of Zhenguoli's Grapefruit Four Seasons Tea

1263
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,360
Thanks

1264
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,200
So you're saying Oreo isn't blue?

1265
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,440
What a coincidence

1266
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,080
You've found Lucky Blue

1267
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,400
How could you

1268
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,920
all appear in the bookstore at the same time

1269
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,840
What were you doing there?

1270
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,880
Nobody's paying attention to us

1271
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,680
Then let's not speak

1272
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,640
Let's pick a representative - Sister Bao will do it

1273
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,880
You're good at talking - you explain

1274
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,680
Why are you in this bookstore?

1275
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,280
What are you doing?

1276
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,680
What exactly are you doing here?

1277
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,920
She's got a camera too

1278
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,040
I need to get exclusive evidence here

1279
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,000
This is the first time someone's recording us

1280
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,640
Not allowed

1281
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,520
No photography allowed here

1282
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,200
Security guy

1283
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,720
Now's your time to be useful

1284
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,880
Right

1285
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,920
Confiscate it from her

1286
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,640
Why are you wearing gloves?

1287
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:43,880
Sorry

1288
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,000
Sorry

1289
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,560
Sorry

1290
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,600
Wearing gloves is for saluting

1291
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,240
Sorry

1292
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,880
So I really can't take it, right?

1293
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,040
Not for now

1294
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,080
Sorry

1295
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,440
It's also my first time working as a security guard

1296
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,600
Okay

1297
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,400
What are you four doing at the bookstore?

1298
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,400
What happened to you all last night?

1299
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,280
Why did you all wake up lying on the floor this morning?

1300
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,320
As if you had fainted.

1301
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,120
Stop investigating the matter of Nan Huajia.

1302
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,720
Listen to me, or you'll "die."

1303
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,840
All six of us

1304
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,440
will one day in the future

1305
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,320
jump to our "suicides."

1306
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,600
That woman's "death"

1307
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,920
has nothing to do with me.

1308
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,200
Bamei "died."

1309
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,400
I'm so happy.

1310
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,600
I knew Nan Huajia

1311
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,760
when he sponsored us,

1312
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,840
he had already passed away.

1313
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,040
Our Nan Huajia wouldn't do such things.

1314
00:46:59,200 --> 00:46:59,720
It's because of you.

1315
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,240
Was it because of the medicine you gave him?

1316
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,320
It must have been the medicine you gave him.

1317
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,120
Why did you give him that medicine?

1318
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,440
You "killed" Nan Huajia.

1319
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,120
She's framing me.

1320
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,640
Look, she's more suspicious than I am.

1321
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,360
The "killer" must be one of you.

1322
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,280
Haven't we thoroughly searched this place yet?

1323
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,000
Is it possible that "corpses" could be hidden here?

1324
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,520
Why is everything empty?

1325
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,240
The people who wronged you

1326
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,720
Besides her, there are six others

1327
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,200
The six of us

1328
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,280
So we didn't "commit suicide"

1329
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,240
We were "murdered"

1330
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:28,960
Right

1331
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,440
Who would want to "kill" us?

1332
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,200
