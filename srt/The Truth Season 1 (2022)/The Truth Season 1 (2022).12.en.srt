1
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,400
Our family was temporarily formed

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,280
We were just a makeshift family

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,800
The butler

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,640
was actually my employer

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,640
He disregarded my pregnancy condition

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,320
He ignored the fact I was carrying a child

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,160
and I had a miscarriage

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,880
He's the one who got me into this mess

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,160
If he hadn't made such unreasonable demands

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,080
my father wouldn't have "died"

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,480
After he "killed" the butler

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,000
no one would know he had "killed" someone

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Guo Baoyou is suspicious

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,600
He went to the bathroom

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,000
Check if there are any footprints here.

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,600
The truth has been exposed.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,000
What's going on?

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,560
It's this late already

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,200
Still here

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,000
Xiao Guo

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,040
The footprints lead back to your room

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,680
Liu Xialai

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,840
Look how you vouched for him

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,200
Trusted him so much

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,240
I misjudged you

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,400
Not misjudgment

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,760
Really, this is a misunderstanding

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,400
I can only say this is a misunderstanding

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,040
The evidence is irrefutable

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,440
Where do these footprints finally lead to?

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,080
Here.

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,640
Anywhere else?

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,960
Here.

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,200
Here.

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,640
They lead right here.

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,280
What does this mean?

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,880
What is this?

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,840
There must be something inside.

39
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,760
Liu Xialai, search around and take a look.

40
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,520
Come on, dismantle this.

41
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,480
A hidden compartment.

42
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,080
Never would have expected.

43
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,400
Won't give up until faced with certain doom.

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,080
This is...

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,920
Here's a

46
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,240
Happy Events Co., Ltd. employee ID

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,800
Super Happy

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,120
They're the event planners

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,880
The company that organized this banquet

50
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,440
This event

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,520
There's only one pair

52
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,680
A male and female pillow

53
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,920
He documented

54
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,960
all the details in the butler's room

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,080
Look at the date

56
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,600
Isn't this the 15th?

57
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,840
June 15th

58
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,960
I went on the 14th

59
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,480
Let me see

60
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,160
I went there on the 14th

61
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
This was taken on the 15th

62
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,920
Why did you take photos of his room?

63
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:56,960
This isn't

64
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,000
I went there on the 14th

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,440
I didn't go inside

66
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,920
I was just eavesdropping at the door

67
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,960
Why are you still at this point

68
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,280
We've already interrogated you

69
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,320
The interrogation is already over

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,520
This really has nothing to do with me

71
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
That's all I can say

72
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,000
Otherwise, who do you think found the glue?

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,560
Who found this glow-in-the-dark glue?

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,280
You did this on purpose

75
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,080
You intentionally

76
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,320
You're underestimating our intelligence

77
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,520
Framing someone

78
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,360
I understand now

79
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,160
Of course, there's another possibility

80
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,960
What is it?

81
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,000
That someone else did all this

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,600
After doing all these things

83
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,320
Knew he had been to that place

84
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,840
Then deliberately placed this item

85
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,440
Hidden here

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,320
To frame him

87
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,760
I think that's possible too

88
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,400
Because this could be

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
The killer's footprints

90
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,080
Leading all the way here

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,120
Then hidden inside here

92
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,600
Right

93
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,640
That's also possible

94
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,440
Who has a key to his room?

95
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,360
Is it possible he

96
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,520
Lost his key somewhere?

97
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,280
Have you lost any keys recently?

98
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,040
Lost

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,360
Nothing like that

100
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,120
What does "only one pair" mean?

101
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,680
These shoes

102
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,400
I don't know

103
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,880
Let's take this photo

104
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,680
Should we compare it

105
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,360
with this other photo

106
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,920
to see if there are any differences in the arrangement

107
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,640
Could there be

108
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,320
I don't know

109
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,760
Let's go

110
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,720
Let's go compare them

111
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,120
Come on

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,959
Why did you take photos of his room?

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,280
Could it be your father

114
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,360
trying to frame you?

115
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,560
So compared to this one,

116
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,120
is there any difference from before?

117
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,920
Where is it?

118
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,440
It's here.

119
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,400
Here.

120
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,360
This part inside can be opened.

121
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,560
This section can be opened.

122
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,440
What is this?

123
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,520
Pull hard

124
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,080
What is this?

125
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,840
It should be that wall block outside

126
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,120
Put it back and it should open

127
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,000
Maybe it can open

128
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,400
This one

129
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,680
Yes

130
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,840
Here

131
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,400
Not this one

132
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,240
No

133
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,520
This one

134
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,200
The door opened

135
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,720
Push

136
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,280
Pull

137
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,200
We're coming in

138
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,720
These are all bullet comments, huh

139
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,280
The live stream is about to start

140
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,320
Can you grant my wish?

141
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,440
The Ju family has many stories

142
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
Let me tell you about them

143
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,920
I can tell Guo Baoyou

144
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,400
many secrets of the Ju family

145
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,480
Did you watch today's

146
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,160
family reunion live stream?

147
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,200
Mrs. Ju slapped her husband angrily

148
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,320
That slap

149
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,840
was so intense!

150
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,880
This is literally "The Truman Show"

151
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,640
This whole family

152
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,240
has been broadcast live

153
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,360
by this butler all along

154
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,360
So much money

155
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,000
Is this for real?

156
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
There's 200,000 in cash from the butler here.

157
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,240
Let me take a look at this.

158
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,560
No, it's not connected to the internet.

159
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,800
Then this one probably won't light up.

160
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,280
Can't see it.

161
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,400
Wait, let me check.

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,400
June 17th, 4:00 PM.

163
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,560
Phone consultation with the doctor.

164
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,760
Consultation matters.

165
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,680
The doctor previously said taking Heifasen causes allergies.

166
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,920
Can cause immediate suffocation.

167
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,800
It's written on this medicine bottle.

168
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,200
Look here.

169
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,120
Hei-

170
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,600
Heifasen allergy.

171
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,760
The allergy warning is clearly written here.

172
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,360
2022.

173
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,440
The precautions he mentioned last time.

174
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,040
I didn't remember them clearly.

175
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,800
I need to ask again.

176
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,520
Doctor's phone.

177
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,080
173.

178
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,960
There's a phone number.

179
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,640
Call this one.

180
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,560
Sorry

181
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,520
The number you dialed has been suspended

182
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,120
Sorry

183
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,120
The number you dialed has been suspended

184
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,240
The call won't go through

185
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,680
Pay the phone bill

186
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,400
The Gu family has many stories

187
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,480
Let me tell you about them

188
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,120
We can tell Guo Baoyou

189
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,200
Many secrets of the Gu family

190
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,280
We've been livestreamed all day

191
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,960
Ask the netizens, right?

192
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,760
Let's enter the livestream

193
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,680
We're going to the livestream

194
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,080
Enter the livestream

195
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Ask the netizens

196
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,400
Interact

197
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,920
Chat with them

198
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,040
Let's go

199
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,840
Bai Sanwan and Song Piaoliang

200
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,080
Go to Ju Wenyi's room

201
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,240
Come with us

202
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,800
Alright

203
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,240
Okay

204
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,520
Let's go

205
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
This is Mrs. Gu's room, right?

206
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,440
What are you doing?

207
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,400
Starting a livestream

208
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,720
Hello everyone

209
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,440
Do you know any Ju family secrets?

210
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,160
Things you've seen

211
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,320
That others don't know about

212
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,160
Can you tell us?

213
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,120
Can you perform something?

214
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,720
See? I knew it

215
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,320
You tell us Ju family secrets

216
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,760
Then we'll

217
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,120
Perform for us and we'll tell you

218
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,679
Now we're a boy band, let's go

219
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,000
Ready

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,240
5, 6, 7, go!

221
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
Okay, now you can tell us

222
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,520
We'll tell you the secret

223
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,200
Ju Family Secrets Forum

224
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,920
Can be updated again

225
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,800
I'm on the forum

226
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,680
Building a thread for Guo Baoyou

227
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,000
Previously Mrs. Ju was most popular

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,160
Now Guo Baoyou might surpass her

229
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,440
Forum

230
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,200
That place just now

231
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,680
Has something

232
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,200
Want to visit the secrets forum?

233
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,400
See the little secrets?

234
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:36,680
Yes

235
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,160
We want to see

236
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,520
Quick, sing something

237
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:40,960
Don't hesitate

238
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,800
Hurry up and sing for them

239
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,880
Come on

240
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,640
Let's sing "Because of Love"

241
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,320
Okay

242
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,160
Okay, that's enough.

243
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,760
Great!

244
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,160
Tell us the secret.

245
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,600
Hurry.

246
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,120
The secret.

247
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,560
Come on.

248
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,600
The secret of the little forum.

249
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,320
What's the secret?

250
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,200
The forum link.

251
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,240
Sing another song.

252
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,760
Quick.

253
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,320
Nobody should lie to us.

254
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,760
Why is the pitch so low?

255
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,720
Love is when you trade a secret

256
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,800
for a three-person performance

257
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,080
If you don't give it to us

258
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,200
you'll

259
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,160
get beaten by us

260
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,040
Okay, thanks

261
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,800
Here's the address

262
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,400
www.gossipju.com

263
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,760
We should copy this website

264
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,160
Then open it with that

265
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,240
You're tricking us

266
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,000
It won't open

267
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
Want to know how to get in?

268
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,640
Yes, why can't we get in?

269
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,960
Ke Wuku's face is here

270
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,880
Because his face is too small

271
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,520
You can't find it in the frame

272
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,000
Face is too small

273
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,040
Hurry

274
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,400
Your turn

275
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,760
We're already tired of talking with them

276
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,280
I'm already sweating, guys

277
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,440
I'm sweating too

278
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:32,960
Really

279
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,400
He said Ke Wuku looks cool in a tank top

280
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,080
Take off the jacket

281
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,560
Please, I'm begging you

282
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,720
Please

283
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,960
The forum only has a desktop version

284
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,280
The forum only has a desktop version

285
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,480
So we need to use a computer to view it, right?

286
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,160
What do you know about the Gu family?

287
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,200
In a rap style

288
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,040
Perform a tongue-twisting rap verse

289
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,200
Let's begin our game segment

290
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,160
Rap style

291
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,840
Give us a tongue-twister rap

292
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,120
In the Later Han and Three Kingdoms period, there was a reckless man.

293
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,000
That's enough already.

294
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,560
Let me tell you the truth

295
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,480
This family gathering

296
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,240
the limited edition flat peach donuts you ate

297
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,440
is Mrs. Ku's favorite

298
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,640
new favorite

299
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,280
new favorite

300
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
It was given to her by us fans

301
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,200
Because someone specifically went to the Ku family forum

302
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,920
Leaked this information

303
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,680
Probably wanted to give Mrs. Koo a little surprise

304
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
Later I looked up an address

305
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,160
That person was from the Koo family

306
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,120
It must be Koo Seong-gong

307
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
He's so romantic

308
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,880
So romantic

309
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,600
So this donut was given by a fan

310
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,480
But

311
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,000
This fan is actually pretending to be a fan

312
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,040
He claims to be from the Gu family

313
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,200
But it's not necessarily Success

314
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,720
Tomorrow is June 18th

315
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,960
I want to hear from the noodle vendor guy

316
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,400
Tell me in Northwestern dialect

317
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,320
His gift list for pursuing girls

318
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,360
No ambiguity allowed

319
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,000
Must list exactly ten items

320
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,600
What they say

321
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,640
If satisfied, they'll tell us

322
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,080
The big secret

323
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,840
I don't do rap here

324
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,440
Nope

325
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,560
This is Northwestern dialect

326
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,280
Northwestern rap

327
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,720
Alright

328
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,640
Then

329
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,520
Flowers

330
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,360
A bowl of delicious noodles

331
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,080
Then red envelopes

332
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,000
Necklace

333
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,080
Bracelet

334
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,640
Lipstick

335
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,800
Must have one

336
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,320
Candlelit dinner and such

337
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,760
Date

338
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,360
Give it for free

339
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,280
This Song Piaoliang

340
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,440
Give a younger sister

341
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,800
Give away a younger sister for free

342
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,720
Should give a book

343
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,320
I think there's one more important thing

344
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,040
What?

345
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
On memorable days

346
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,440
Must take a photo together

347
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,200
Right?

348
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,920
Right

349
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,560
Is that okay?

350
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,360
Alright then

351
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,160
Can tell the secret now?

352
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,200
Friends

353
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,560
Come on, say it quickly

354
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,200
Come on

355
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,080
Wait

356
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,560
That donut we ate at noon today

357
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,240
I really want to eat it too

358
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,480
But I'm allergic to hazelnuts and can't eat it

359
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,040
Can't eat it

360
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,080
The doctor said before

361
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,120
If I eat hazelnuts and have an allergic reaction

362
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,400
I'll suffocate immediately

363
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,480
He kept eating despite being allergic

364
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,920
Can't eat hazelnuts due to allergy

365
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,440
But there's someone in their family

366
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,240
Using the fans' hands

367
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,400
To make this man "die"

368
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,240
Want to know about Kurokami Mori's allergies

369
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,200
and what symptoms he has?

370
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,000
Unless the pretty girl and handsome guy

371
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,880
sing the love duet "Human World" together

372
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,360
Northwestern guys shouldn't just stand by either

373
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,120
Come on, you two sing "Human World"

374
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,520
Quick!

375
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,800
That unbearable past of ours

376
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,240
Begin!

377
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,000
You have to dance

378
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,880
Alright, dancing!

379
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,560
You're making eye contact with me again

380
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,600
Okay, that's it

381
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,560
We need to have that thing

382
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Alright, thanks

383
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,640
Okay

384
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,160
Fine, I'll tell you then

385
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,600
People allergic to Heifasen

386
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,160
If they consume it by accident,

387
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,840
three hours later

388
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,600
what happens to their nails

389
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,960
what they turn into

390
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,640
They turn black

391
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,800
Then let's take a look

392
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,960
whether the "deceased" has black toenails

393
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,360
Let's go, move out

394
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,960
It's indeed turned black.

395
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
That means they must have eaten it.

396
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,760
And this person must have known very well

397
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,760
that he had this black... disease.

398
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,120
What have you found out?

399
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,200
Let's discuss it together.

400
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Look, the toenails have turned black.

401
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,840
Wasn't it supposed to take three hours?

402
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,160
Right.

403
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,320
Let's share first

404
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,280
our... findings.

405
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,760
The donuts we ate today

406
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,600
were sent by someone.

407
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,120
No,

408
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,560
someone contacted fans

409
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,040
in the fan group to get them.

410
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,640
They checked this account

411
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,880
and found it belonged to the Gu family.

412
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,960
But there's a problem with these donuts.

413
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,560
If you have Blackhausen disease,

414
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,240
wouldn't you have an allergic reaction after eating them?

415
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,480
You would immediately suffocate.

416
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,160
Suffocate.

417
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,840
Meaning his "cause of death"

418
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,400
wasn't actually

419
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,360
that "anger poison," right?

420
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,000
But that "anger poison"

421
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,400
must have had some

422
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,240
purpose.

423
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,760
They wanted to "kill,"

424
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,000
but might not have succeeded.

425
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,360
Someone got to him first and "killed" him.

426
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,560
What kind of line is this?

427
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,640
This is for hanging clothes, right?

428
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,240
Yes, the clothesline.

429
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,839
Pull it out and see.

430
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,400
That's it.

431
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,079
Pull more.

432
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,000
Pull it downward.

433
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,440
Keep pulling.

434
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,280
Pull the floor drain.

435
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,800
It is...

436
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,520
Is this how it works?

437
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,400
Put it inside like this.

438
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,520
Then cover it.

439
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,319
Because the "victim's" feet had...

440
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,400
Strong magnetic plates.

441
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,360
When he approached the drain,

442
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,680
the drain cover would be attracted.

443
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
Then if he slipped,

444
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,440
wouldn't the drain cover pop up?

445
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,200
The magnet would snap back,

446
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,320
and knock over the vase above,

447
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,560
causing it to fall.

448
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,520
Thus releasing the poison gas.

449
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,720
Exactly.

450
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,560
Good, we've figured out the method.

451
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,120
Right?

452
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,600
Isn't it?

453
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,040
Cool.

454
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,960
So there might be more than one person

455
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,560
who wanted him dead.

456
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,120
Definitely.

457
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,280
Everyone we talked to today

458
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,440
wanted to "kill" him.

459
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,320
Maybe two people set up two different traps -

460
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,320
one with the donut,

461
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,000
and one with this mechanism.

462
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,680
So which one was his actual "cause of death"?

463
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,160
"Death cause."

464
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,040
Look at the toenails.

465
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,200
Probably the donut.

466
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,120
But there's another problem.

467
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,760
If he ate that donut,

468
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,560
he would suffocate immediately.

469
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,160
How could he have collapsed here?

470
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,800
He wouldn't have had time to come here.

471
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,840
His final "cause of death"

472
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,880
seems more likely to be this one.

473
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,160
Let me see.

474
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,760
Here, in front of the toilet.

475
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,800
It's a scratch mark.

476
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,640
Yes, a scratch mark.

477
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,840
First suffocation.

478
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,560
First suffocation, then slipping.

479
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,920
If it were poisoning,

480
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,680
there should be two marks.

481
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,280
They would be two solid square marks.

482
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,360
Didn't reach near the floor drain.

483
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,400
When he was at the toilet,

484
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,760
he was already unsteady.

485
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,960
His foot slipped.

486
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,320
Suffocated when reaching here.

487
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,920
Slipped like this.

488
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,760
Triggered this mechanism.

489
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,720
The vase fell.

490
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,080
The whole body here.

491
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,880
Immediately suffocated.

492
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,360
Then nothing.

493
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,120
Suffocation just...

494
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,560
was gone.

495
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,840
But if he suffocated first,

496
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,240
couldn't inhale anything,

497
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,680
then couldn't inhale the poison either, right?

498
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,480
That's true.

499
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,000
Right?

500
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,120
Then the gas was useless.

501
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,960
Yes, so his "death"

502
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,680
was still because of the donut's

503
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,040
this "cause of death."

504
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,760
So the "cause of death" is clear.

505
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,840
"Cause of death" found.

506
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,200
Then who released the "poison gas"?

507
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,920
We passed three talent shows

508
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,480
So what happened was

509
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,680
We obtained access to a website

510
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,200
It's the Ju family's

511
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,360
secret little forum

512
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,600
Let's go

513
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,760
To the computer

514
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,800
We searched for

515
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,680
"Madam Ju really wants"

516
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,720
Madam Ju

517
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,680
really wants

518
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,320
Here

519
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,280
Madam Ju really knows how to live

520
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,200
She's quite the foodie

521
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,840
According to my careful observation

522
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,160
Madam Ju's recent favorite

523
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,800
seems to be that popular

524
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,680
Lipo Western Restaurant's

525
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
limited edition peach donuts

526
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,560
Really?

527
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,200
Those donuts have daily limited sales

528
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
They say eating them makes your soul leave your body

529
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,760
On family gathering day

530
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
we'll prepare these donuts for Madam Ju

531
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,960
The main ingredient is

532
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,880
Soul Black Hairsen

533
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,960
Check out that recommended account

534
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,680
Strawberry Cream Puff Roll

535
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,560
Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs

536
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,680
Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs should be...

537
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
What about Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs?

538
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,600
Because Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs...

539
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,480
was the first one mentioned

540
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,760
Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs

541
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,960
He secretly photographed

542
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,120
when Mrs. Gu was livestreaming

543
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
and saw that next to her phone

544
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,960
she was looking at this donut

545
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,440
That was Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs

546
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,440
That Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs has ulterior motives

547
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:40,640
Right

548
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,920
Actually he wanted to use donuts

549
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,480
to "kill" people

550
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,520
Then in the livestream

551
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,280
fans said

552
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:48,880
they discovered

553
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,320
this Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs account

554
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,320
is

555
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,640
actually their family member

556
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,320
Yes

557
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,760
Right

558
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,040
He would propose this theory

559
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,280
that it might be one person pretending to be two

560
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,840
That's possible too

561
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,320
So who is this Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs?

562
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,200
Who likes sweet and sour spare ribs?

563
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,080
Who prefers sweet flavors?

564
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,320
Guo Baoyou likes sweet food, right?

565
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,280
Coming at me again, huh?

566
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,520
You're judging based on taste

567
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,560
to identify the "culprit."

568
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,320
June 14th at 12 o'clock

569
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,440
Around noon

570
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,680
This date should be confirmed

571
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,560
That should be it

572
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,600
Bought that day

573
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,040
Posted that day

574
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,000
Look

575
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,120
This was taken behind her

576
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,480
Where was this streamed?

577
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,680
Mrs. Ju's room, right?

578
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,040
Let's go

579
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,160
Let's check that room

580
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,960
Where Mrs. Ju streamed

581
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,000
Seems like her husband's streaming spot

582
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,640
Right?

583
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,360
Here

584
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:39,840
This is the spot

585
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,400
It's here

586
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,080
This side is her husband's area

587
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,600
Yes

588
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,200
She has this yellow basket

589
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,280
for holding clothes

590
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,760
And opposite is

591
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,280
She's facing here

592
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,480
She sat right here to stream

593
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,040
This happens to be her husband's camera angle

594
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,240
Right

595
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,640
Isn't it?

596
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,080
She was sitting

597
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,800
at her husband's camera angle

598
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,400
Then this photo

599
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,280
could only have been taken by her husband

600
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,200
Taken by her husband

601
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,600
Right?

602
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,840
It was indeed her husband

603
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,160
Wait a minute

604
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,560
At 12 o'clock on June 14th,

605
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,720
you were also at his place then.

606
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,720
You went to the renovation site.

607
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,520
Right.

608
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,240
You saw those two people at that time.

609
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,360
That was outside.

610
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,800
Who was outside in that picture?

611
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,240
Outside in that picture were...

612
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,040
Both Chenggong and the butler were outside.

613
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,160
So Chenggong wasn't...

614
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,480
Chenggong and the butler were both outside.

615
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:28,760
Correct.

616
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,000
Then who took this photo?

617
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,840
Phone

618
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,680
The phone is ringing

619
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:37,960
The phone is ringing

620
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,400
Go

621
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,720
Hurry

622
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,440
Coming

623
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,320
Coming

624
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,880
Hello?

625
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,080
Hello?

626
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,160
We had already scheduled a time.

627
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,920
It's already time.

628
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,720
Why haven't you arrived yet?

629
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,880
Where are you?

630
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,640
I'm sorry.

631
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,200
Then how about this.

632
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,280
Could you tell me where you are now?

633
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,640
How about we come to meet you?

634
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,640
My clinic.

635
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:57,960
I'm here.

636
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,800
What would you like to tell him?

637
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,200
Follow-up appointment

638
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,880
What do you want to tell him?

639
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,840
I think...

640
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,800
Why are you asking again?

641
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,200
Didn't I already tell him

642
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,080
His sudden HFS allergy

643
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,520
is due to weakened immunity

644
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,080
I just prescribed him

645
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,880
HFSGM2022 allergy medication

646
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,320
That exact medication

647
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,560
There are thirty pills inside

648
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,320
And you only need to take it when allergic

649
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,600
That should last for a while

650
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,400
It was thrown away

651
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,640
Are there any other medical instructions?

652
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,800
Precautions

653
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,600
I've already mentioned this once

654
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,560
That is

655
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,800
If Heifasen

656
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,440
accidentally gets on the skin

657
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,600
it must be rinsed with water within ten minutes

658
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,920
If ingested or inhaled

659
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,520
it causes immediate suffocation

660
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,080
"death" within two minutes

661
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,880
Immediate suffocation

662
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,760
"Death" within two minutes

663
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,920
If consumed, certain "death"

664
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
Consumption means certain "death"

665
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,880
Why are you all so interested

666
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,680
in this matter too?

667
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,160
Actually

668
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,560
No

669
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,080
Wait

670
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,040
Who else

671
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,600
is interested in this?

672
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,240
Previously

673
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,400
someone else called

674
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,600
to ask about this

675
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,520
Who?

676
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,280
Male or female?

677
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,080
Asked exactly the same questions

678
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,960
Male or female?

679
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,320
Really?

680
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Did they mention a name?

681
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:01,720
They

682
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,320
From the call

683
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,520
I only know it was a man

684
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,600
Called three days ago

685
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,920
Called three days ago, right?

686
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,640
The 14th

687
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,680
The 14th

688
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,120
Said they saw the medical record

689
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,000
and called to confirm the details

690
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,600
Used this phone three days ago

691
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,240
Was it you?

692
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,120
Came on the 14th

693
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,560
You came here on the 14th

694
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,320
And took photos

695
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
Three days ago

696
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,600
Is that his voice, doctor?

697
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,560
Is it this one?

698
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,840
Doctor

699
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,000
Speak properly

700
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,760
Speak clearly

701
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,240
Speak slowly

702
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,840
Speak properly

703
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,560
None of these

704
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,120
Okay

705
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,960
Okay, thank you doctor

706
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,320
Alright

707
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,000
The 14th

708
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,600
A man called to consult him

709
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:38,840
Right?

710
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,040
Used this phone to consult

711
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,560
It was a man

712
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,800
Actually, the man

713
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Is between Success and Wellness

714
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,160
Arts

715
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,880
And Arts

716
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,880
Moreover, this person

717
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,560
This person has a good relationship with his wife

718
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,640
Very close relationship

719
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,680
Then

720
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,600
And still wants to "kill" him

721
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Basically, doesn't that mean

722
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,560
Then it's successful

723
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,320
Success is outside

724
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,600
Right, then we've narrowed it down to two people

725
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,920
One from Wellness, one from Arts

726
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,280
Let's go

727
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,000
Arts and Wellness

728
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,640
Let's check again

729
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,160
Let's go then

730
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,480
Go

731
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,560
Let's go

732
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,080
Arts and Wellness

733
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,800
Have you ever lifted this bed?

734
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,840
You can take a look at this.

735
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,600
We wanted to lift it,

736
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,760
but we felt too embarrassed to.

737
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,160
Is there something in the pillow?

738
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,840
There's something in the pillow.

739
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,280
Let me see.

740
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,200
What is it?

741
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,720
Name: Gu Xiangying

742
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,360
Male

743
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,160
45 years old

744
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,400
Sudden onset of Heifasen allergy

745
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,520
So he knew he had a Heifasen allergy.

746
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,640
Important Notes

747
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,280
I've already said this once

748
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,920
Previously, someone

749
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,840
called and asked me about this

750
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,080
From the call, I only knew it was a man

751
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,640
Who gave you that box?

752
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,680
I took it from there

753
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,360
Account: Sweet and Sour Pork

754
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,520
Sweet and Sour Pork

755
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,600
guoba0914

756
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,280
That's my dad

757
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,640
That is my dad

758
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,280
Your dad

759
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,720
Your dad is Sweet and Sour Pork

760
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,040
This very Sweet and Sour Pork

761
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,000
Came up with this

762
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,240
Mrs. Ju loves eating donuts

763
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,960
Then encouraged fans to send them to her

764
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,320
Then, in the livestream

765
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,080
Fans said

766
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,680
They found out

767
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,480
That this Sweet and Sour Pork account

768
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,080
Belongs to their family

769
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,400
This Sweet and Sour Pork

770
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,640
Had ulterior motives

771
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,080
He actually wanted to use donuts

772
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,600
To "kill" someone

773
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,640
This is undeniable evidence

774
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,440
I'm sorry

775
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,800
Today you'll have to sacrifice family ties for justice

776
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,160
Anyway, your family...

777
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,960
In that case, let someone from your family step forward

778
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,200
Have one person come out as the "killer"

779
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,720
If he ate that donut

780
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,520
He would choke immediately

781
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,000
Why would he collapse in the bathroom then?

782
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,360
He wouldn't have had time to reach the bathroom

783
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,760
So if he got hold of this donut

784
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,640
Can we determine

785
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,760
when exactly he ate it?

786
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,400
The bullet comments we read mentioned that

787
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,960
while they were watching the live stream

788
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,840
and right after it ended

789
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,120
they heard a bang

790
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,920
Because today I

791
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,320
Just now, what was that sound?

792
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,000
The live stream just ended

793
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,480
Which means exactly 1 o'clock

794
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,720
The live stream time is almost up

795
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,160
Sir

796
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,200
It's only five minutes to one

797
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,640
So the bang was heard at one o'clock

798
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,520
Meaning he "died" at one o'clock

799
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,720
No

800
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,280
Let me think

801
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,640
Based on the timeline

802
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,120
He took the donuts first

803
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,240
Thank you, sir

804
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,200
Then

805
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,600
Did he disappear for a while?

806
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,800
After a while, he reappeared

807
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,000
Saying, "Sir"

808
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,360
Sir

809
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
It's almost one o'clock

810
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,480
Five minutes left

811
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,120
Hurry up

812
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,200
Then he went back down

813
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,280
Only then did it click

814
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,880
So he went back to eat after saying that

815
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,560
Mainly because

816
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,520
Look, in the restroom at the end

817
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,880
He clearly had two minutes left

818
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,760
He slipped

819
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,680
Must’ve been because he was already worked up

820
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,720
But if he eats the donut

821
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,200
and immediately feels unwell,

822
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,880
his first reaction

823
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,320
would be to take his medicine.

824
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:49,760
After taking it,

825
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,800
he'd realize there's no medicine left,

826
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,920
and go back to the bathroom.

827
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,960
Simulate it

828
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,960
Oh heavens

829
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,680
For example

830
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,360
After he takes it from here and comes back

831
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:10,840
At this point

832
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,040
Then give a slight smile

833
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,280
No

834
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,000
That's not it

835
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,960
Quickly go back and look

836
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,520
Looking for medicine

837
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,320
This actually starts the countdown

838
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,320
Then he goes to the room to take medicine

839
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,880
Only to find the medicine bottle is empty

840
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,760
Searching for medicine in the trash

841
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,960
Looking for medicine in the garbage

842
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,800
He didn't know the medicine was dumped

843
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,080
Then he

844
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,640
Why did he go to the bathroom?

845
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,560
I want to know

846
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,160
That's true

847
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,960
So he goes to this room to find someone to save him

848
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Just like that, he came over

849
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,440
Why go to the bathroom?

850
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,480
It's live streaming

851
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,000
The show must go on

852
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,320
He didn't interrupt the live broadcast

853
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,240
Right, absolutely not

854
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,800
If he had eaten that donut,

855
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,560
he would have choked immediately.

856
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,040
How could he have collapsed in the bathroom then?

857
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,320
There's one more thing.

858
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,840
It just occurred to me.

859
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,960
Isn't that surveillance room the butler's?

860
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,200
So,

861
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,520
that computer would show his browsing history,

862
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:05,880
right?

863
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,640
What was searched was

864
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,040
"Mrs. Ju desperately wants."

865
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,320
He saw that

866
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,960
someone delivered these donuts

867
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,840
to this house

868
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,080
And there was that

869
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,440
He knew

870
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,880
those donuts were suspicious

871
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,440
Not that he knew after tasting them

872
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,520
Right

873
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,760
He could tell

874
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,040
He could see

875
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,640
Yes

876
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,320
He probably wanted to check

877
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,280
the live stream while also

878
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,560
seeing what the forum was saying

879
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:35,920
When he looked

880
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,280
these donuts seemed suspicious

881
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,160
and immediately threw them away

882
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,240
After throwing them away, he went back inside

883
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,840
Did some kind of handling

884
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,400
I don't know

885
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,440
It might have been like this

886
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,960
So he wouldn't bite the donuts

887
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,360
Take another look

888
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,440
Just take them all down

889
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:51,960
Alright

890
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,360
Okay

891
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,000
Just dump them outside

892
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Come on

893
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,360
Take them out

894
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,160
No

895
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,000
There aren't any left

896
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,520
Just put them on the ground

897
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,160
Just dump them directly on the ground

898
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,680
Do it

899
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,200
Take a look at the donuts

900
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,440
See how big the mark is

901
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,240
But he did eat the bread

902
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,720
There was this piece of paper inside back then.

903
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,440
Do you remember this?

904
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,200
There was this paper.

905
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,760
Right.

906
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,280
There was this paper.

907
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,240
GRAND OPENING

908
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,360
First 66 customers to enter the store

909
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,160
This is pretty useless, isn’t it?

910
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,360
Grand Opening Gift Pack

911
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,200
More discount coupons

912
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,840
Push Push Card

913
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,120
Push Push Supermarket

914
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,800
I also think it’s useless.

915
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:34,960
What?

916
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,720
Is there a donut imprint on this?

917
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,840
And it’s a whole one—

918
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,080
not bitten.

919
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,360
He used it to wrap

920
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,440
with paper padding

921
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,320
This whole thing is one big circle

922
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,720
See?

923
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,800
It's indeed the same size

924
00:31:59,320 --> 00:31:59,800
Right?

925
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,640
There's no gap

926
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,680
So when he threw it, it was one

927
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,240
complete piece

928
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,480
So he knows someone is trying to trick him.

929
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,000
He even deliberately took a donut

930
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,000
He took this donut

931
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,160
He knew he couldn't eat it

932
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
Then he took the wrapper

933
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,640
Wrapped it up

934
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,760
Threw it in

935
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,680
No matter what

936
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,040
Even if he didn't eat it

937
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,040
But he came into contact with it

938
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,280
Let's simulate this

939
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,000
Let's sort this out

940
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,920
It's like this

941
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,280
He walks over here like this

942
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,000
Throws it

943
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,560
After throwing it

944
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,720
I think he should take medicine first

945
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,160
Right?

946
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
Take medicine or wash first?

947
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,760
What do you think?

948
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,840
If he just touched it

949
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,000
Washing should be enough, right?

950
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,360
Yes

951
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,040
Wash after touching

952
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,920
Then it's clean

953
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,840
Go wash immediately

954
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,040
Should go wash, right?

955
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,760
For example, he enters

956
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,240
I wash

957
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:06,920
Wash

958
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,240
After washing

959
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,160
Leaves after washing

960
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,600
Then

961
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,680
Tidy up

962
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,440
Is that correct?

963
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,800
Then go out to inform the master

964
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,840
There's five minutes left

965
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,880
Does this make logical sense?

966
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,760
These are the victim's footprints

967
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,680
It's illogical

968
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,560
Because we need to base it on

969
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,240
these footprints

970
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,680
At that time it was a one-way footprint

971
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,000
Right?

972
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,120
He only walked a short distance inside.

973
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
So he only came here once.

974
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,760
And he washed first.

975
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,560
Then used the toilet.

976
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,280
"Death."

977
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,080
This is fixed.

978
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,920
Is there anything else around here?

979
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,000
Take a closer look at the footprints.

980
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,800
One.

981
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,240
Right?

982
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,160
Then reached the second.

983
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Then reached the third.

984
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,800
Fourth.

985
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,440
After washing.

986
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,480
Fifth.

987
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,200
The fifth one is here.

988
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,480
Isn't that right?

989
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,120
Started washing hands.

990
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,320
But this was exactly when he "died."

991
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,800
Then he must have encountered something here.

992
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,560
Wash your hands first when entering.

993
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,600
Dry your hands with the blower.

994
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,000
The blower.

995
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Could it be inside the hand dryer...

996
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,800
that something was added?

997
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,239
Some kind of gas...

998
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:20,920
and inhaled?

999
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,560
This is for filtering

1000
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,199
Filter screen

1001
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,639
Is it possible that

1002
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,639
someone deliberately smeared something

1003
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,840
onto his hands?

1004
00:34:59,360 --> 00:34:59,600
Look,

1005
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,320
it looks like something was intentionally applied here.

1006
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,040
Sugar?

1007
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,920
It smells like

1008
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,720
it's sweet.

1009
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,000
Just like Heifasen.

1010
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,560
Is this sweet?

1011
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,040
Take a sniff.

1012
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,120
If here,

1013
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,080
after washing his hands and blowing on this,

1014
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,440
he would still come into contact with Heifasen.

1015
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,520
He's not just touching it,

1016
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,280
he's inhaling it.

1017
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,160
Inhalation.

1018
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,160
Inhalation is the fastest method.

1019
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,320
For example, if he really inhaled it

1020
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,800
Is it possible that he

1021
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,000
said five minutes later

1022
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,800
came to wash his hands

1023
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,840
washed them

1024
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,600
dried his hands

1025
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,120
but got contaminated with Heifasen instead

1026
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,440
Right

1027
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,200
After drying them

1028
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,000
he came here

1029
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,400
and just as he reached this spot

1030
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,800
he kicked

1031
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,240
and fell

1032
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,760
his foot slipped

1033
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,520
and his head hit the sharp edge behind him

1034
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,320
We still don't know if it was really Heifasen

1035
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,000
We still don't know

1036
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,560
He "died" from hitting his head on the edge

1037
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,520
This investigation just made things more confusing

1038
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,920
But what's certain is

1039
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,960
after he "died"

1040
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,000
someone placed that metal piece

1041
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,680
into this

1042
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
and deliberately took a bite of the donut

1043
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,720
This is clearly framing someone

1044
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,560
The key point is they also knew

1045
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,040
that the donut contained that substance

1046
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,800
Heifasen

1047
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,680
Right

1048
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,440
Are you there?

1049
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,320
It's getting late

1050
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,040
How's everyone's investigation going?

1051
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,800
If we've gathered enough clues

1052
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,200
maybe we should come to this restaurant

1053
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,880
sit down

1054
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,720
and discuss all the evidence

1055
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,800
thoroughly

1056
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,960
I'll wait for you here

1057
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,320
Alright

1058
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,200
Let's go to the restaurant to summarize

1059
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,240
Okay, Xiao He

1060
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:29,960
Alright, everyone

1061
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,520
Let's all take a moment to think carefully

1062
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,000
about who the "killer" really is

1063
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,880
Then you can go to our

1064
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,720
property management surveillance room

1065
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,320
to cast your votes

1066
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,440
I'll then compile everyone's investigation findings

1067
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,320
and collected evidence

1068
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,720
and submit them to the relevant authorities

1069
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,800
So let's all do our best, okay?

1070
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,240
Okay

1071
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,520
We need to determine one thing

1072
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,840
about the "deceased" butler

1073
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,640
what exactly caused his "fatal" condition

1074
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,080
So can we now

1075
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,760
first confirm whether

1076
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,600
the substance on the dryer

1077
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,760
is indeed Heifasen powder

1078
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,920
If we trace back the timeline,

1079
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,160
his "death" occurred during handwashing,

1080
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,520
because that was the final step.

1081
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,120
Then this timeline matches up.

1082
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,840
By this point he had already disposed of that thing,

1083
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,280
thrown it away.

1084
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,080
At 11:55 he came back and told them,

1085
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,600
"The time is almost up."

1086
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,240
"It's about time."

1087
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,000
Then he leisurely washed his hands,

1088
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,280
dried them after washing,

1089
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,000
and after drying,

1090
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,400
realized something was wrong.

1091
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,480
Then collapsed at 1 o'clock.

1092
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,160
This sequence is correct.

1093
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,080
Right, because when he happened to fall,

1094
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,400
his foot slipped right there,

1095
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,760
and accidentally kicked it open.

1096
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,640
Exactly.

1097
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,240
That mechanism

1098
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,040
was triggered when he was near "death",

1099
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,880
so the poison gas

1100
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,960
could no longer harm him.

1101
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,000
Right.

1102
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,600
So what we've confirmed now

1103
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,360
is that it's Hei Fasen, correct?

1104
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,400
Everyone seems certain about this.

1105
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,600
Confirmed.

1106
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,120
<summaryThe group discusses how the mechanism was accidentally triggered when someone fell, making them immune to the poison gas, and confirms their suspicion about Hei Fasen.

1107
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,800
Let's summarize

1108
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,160
How many specific methods were used today?

1109
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,000
There are three

1110
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,680
First is the donut

1111
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,800
Eating the donut

1112
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,600
Or touching it

1113
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,560
Second is the "gas attack"

1114
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,280
That poisonous gas

1115
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,000
"Gas attack"

1116
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,600
Third is the powder from the hand dryer

1117
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,480
Hefsen

1118
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,000
Right

1119
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,880
Corresponding to the donut

1120
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,840
The most likely first is health maintenance

1121
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,480
Right?

1122
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:56,880
Yes

1123
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,400
The gas is

1124
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,400
The gas is actually the hardest to trace.

1125
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,440
We've never been able to find it.

1126
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,400
Who released the gas?

1127
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,120
The person who released the poisonous gas.

1128
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,520
They took some photos.

1129
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,680
Then placed them in your room.

1130
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,800
The one who framed you.

1131
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,480
Right?

1132
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,160
First of all, your father wouldn't frame you.

1133
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,560
No.

1134
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,680
First, let's establish.

1135
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,360
That the "culprit".

1136
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,680
Is the one who put the black hair.

1137
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,720
Into the filter screen.

1138
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,480
Yes, the filter screen.

1139
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,880
We've figured it all out, right?

1140
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,200
Right.

1141
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,800
We've figured it all out.

1142
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:21,680
Yes.

1143
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,600
Alright, then let me tell everyone.

1144
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,520
I was the one who released the gas.

1145
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,840
Seriously?

1146
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,560
Was it you?

1147
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,840
No, so we asked him.

1148
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,640
About where those photos came from.

1149
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,280
He said he didn't know.

1150
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,040
We were still wondering who would frame him.

1151
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,520
Turns out it was you.

1152
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,640
No one framed you.

1153
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,640
You just trusted him too much.

1154
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,960
You kept defending him at every turn.

1155
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,560
I thought we should clear his suspicion first.

1156
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
After this person did all these things.

1157
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,840
They deliberately hid this here.

1158
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,760
To frame him.

1159
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,920
I think that's possible too.

1160
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,320
It's me

1161
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,000
My fault

1162
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,880
I did it

1163
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,880
I'll have to regard you with some awe from now on

1164
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,080
You should have admitted it then

1165
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,720
Let me tell you

1166
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,160
No

1167
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,400
"Murderer" is not something you can say

1168
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
You're not the "murderer"

1169
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,040
Aren't I?

1170
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,600
I didn't realize until 9 o'clock

1171
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,400
He wasn't actually "killed" by me

1172
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,280
He was the first

1173
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,080
Among us who attempted "murder"

1174
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,920
You wanted to "kill"

1175
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,480
No

1176
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,400
That's not it

1177
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,040
You wanted to "kill"

1178
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,040
But you didn't succeed

1179
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,440
You wanted to "kill"

1180
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,600
And it only took him five seconds

1181
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,640
His method was the most ruthless

1182
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,840
Yes, the most "treacherous"

1183
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,880
Always "scheming"

1184
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,320
Look at you all

1185
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,640
You might end up "killing" all of us

1186
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,560
Right

1187
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,640
Yeah, if we go to the bathroom

1188
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,160
and accidentally trigger it

1189
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,320
What should we do then?

1190
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,280
You didn't consider our safety

1191
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,160
No, that area isn't under your feet

1192
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,000
I set it up right where he stands

1193
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,320
What if a gust of wind comes in

1194
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,480
We'd be "dead" too

1195
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,400
This is really unbelievable

1196
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:46,920
Truly unbelievable

1197
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,920
Completely speechless

1198
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,520
What was your entire process for the crime?

1199
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,680
Tell us

1200
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,280
Actually, I visited this house for three days

1201
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,840
What did you do each day?

1202
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,560
On the first day I saw my dad being scolded

1203
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,520
Ready to ruin your reputation anytime

1204
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,800
On the second day I thought I should see

1205
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,920
why he was scolding my dad

1206
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,400
Then I heard him say

1207
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,760
"I have his secrets anyway"

1208
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,400
So I thought he was going after my dad

1209
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,880
That's why on the third day I set things up

1210
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,440
Pull out that rope

1211
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,280
Thread it through the vase

1212
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,120
Guide it into the drain

1213
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,240
Then cover it with the drain cover

1214
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
This drain cover actually has magnetism

1215
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,280
I attached a demagnetizing sticker to it

1216
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,920
After he walks past

1217
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,160
The drain loses its magnetism

1218
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,200
Can't hold the rope anymore

1219
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,400
The rope retracts

1220
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,840
The vase loses balance and falls

1221
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,120
I figured the vase alone wouldn't "kill" him

1222
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,080
So I placed inside

1223
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,800
A "frustration bomb"

1224
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,320
I swapped the "frustration bomb" with the nutrient solution

1225
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,200
As a replacement

1226
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,000
So that footprint

1227
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,280
Was accidentally left by me

1228
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,120
We can't trust anymore

1229
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,640
If that's the case

1230
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,960
Then it's much simpler

1231
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,200
One has confessed without pressure

1232
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,000
We can just

1233
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,040
Directly eliminate this frustration

1234
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,200
I didn't confess without pressure

1235
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,560
I had no choice but to confess

1236
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,520
Because I'm not the "killer" now

1237
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,040
So I can't lie anymore

1238
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,240
These two are the same thing, right?

1239
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:57,880
No

1240
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,320
Two different methods

1241
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,240
Black Forest and donut

1242
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,960
Can't be the same person

1243
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,160
He didn't eat that donut

1244
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,400
But we saw the donut

1245
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,320
Had a bite taken out

1246
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,560
This "killer"

1247
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,440
Wanted to frame Yangsheng

1248
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,040
The original imprint was a whole one

1249
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,480
He took out the whole one

1250
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,760
Replaced it with one he bit

1251
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,280
And put it back

1252
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,320
So who else would know

1253
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,520
about his allergy to Heifaisen?

1254
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,320
His wife must know, right?

1255
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,400
Why should we assume

1256
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,440
his wife would definitely know about these things?

1257
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,120
Their marital relationship isn't good.

1258
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,040
Do you think I resent him?

1259
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,520
Of course I do.

1260
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,480
I lost my child.

1261
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,960
But Mrs. Ku

1262
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,480
lives in his house, doesn't she?

1263
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,240
His medicine is right on the nightstand.

1264
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,720
She knows whether he takes this medicine or not,

1265
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,000
but knowing how he could "die"

1266
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,960
is a completely different matter.

1267
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,200
You need to know

1268
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,560
the exact medical instructions

1269
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,800
and precise side effects

1270
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,120
before you can determine

1271
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,600
whether this matter

1272
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,920
could "kill" this person.

1273
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
Otherwise, you only know

1274
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,920
that he usually takes medicine

1275
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,520
and nothing more.

1276
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,320
Gu Lucky probably wouldn't

1277
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,040
Because Gu Lucky is...

1278
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,560
quite decent

1279
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,120
Just look at him

1280
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,200
Because all your fans are good people

1281
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,840
Right

1282
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,400
Gu Lucky seems quite distant from what's called...

1283
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:07,960
the butler

1284
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,840
Very distant

1285
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
Just hates him

1286
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,280
But never got close

1287
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,720
Yes

1288
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,640
Gu Success has always been desperate for money

1289
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,360
If he accessed the live stream backend

1290
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,680
wouldn't he have taken all that money?

1291
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,360
Success is definitely ruled out

1292
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,840
He's no longer a suspect

1293
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,600
Right, no success

1294
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,320
Now focusing on health

1295
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,920
In this household,

1296
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,600
my most important mission

1297
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,560
is to clear my name after seventeen years of wrongful accusation.

1298
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,440
If Yangsheng had "killed" him,

1299
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,520
not only would he fail to overturn his case,

1300
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,480
but he'd add another "murder" to his record.

1301
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,760
So Yangsheng's motive for "murder"

1302
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,800
isn't actually that strong.

1303
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,320
It might be because of his son,

1304
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,720
but Yangsheng only wants to clear his name.

1305
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,680
Moreover, he's said

1306
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,000
clearing his name is more important than his son.

1307
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,640
A "killer" can deceive people,

1308
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,680
but I don't think

1309
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,600
I don't think it's Yangsheng.

1310
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,320
Donut is trying to frame Gu Yangsheng.

1311
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,800
A "murderer" wouldn't frame themselves.

1312
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,080
This is double insurance.

1313
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,160
I guarantee you'll "die."

1314
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,120
Furthermore,

1315
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,000
Yangsheng said his lifelong greatest wish

1316
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,040
is to clear his name.

1317
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,320
Why clear his name?

1318
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,680
He wants to prove to his son

1319
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,560
that he has a clean identity.

1320
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,520
When his son is about to "die,"

1321
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,320
or be dragged into

1322
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,400
a whirlpool of trouble,

1323
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,320
would he still care about

1324
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,280
whether he's innocent or not?

1325
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,000
You've said so much,

1326
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,240
yet in the end you wrote about Mrs. Gu.

1327
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,600
Then why do you think it's the wife?

1328
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,640
His wife must know.

1329
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,680
Because they live together every day,

1330
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,600
and sleep together.

1331
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,760
How could she not know?

1332
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,400
We must look at the evidence.

1333
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,480
Previously, the doctor said taking Heifasen causes allergies,

1334
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,080
leading to immediate suffocation.

1335
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,440
He actually wanted to use donuts to "kill" someone.

1336
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,760
Now let's enter that secret room.

1337
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,880
On the computer desktop,

1338
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,720
it clearly states:

1339
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,400
"Doctor's orders."

1340
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,120
So whoever can enter that secret room

1341
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,600
would know about his condition.

1342
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,760
Who could enter that room?

1343
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,000
Only the couple, right?

1344
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,120
Who else could it be?

1345
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,280
Moreover, the wife's anger

1346
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,280
is newly developed,

1347
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,800
because she finally discovered

1348
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,880
that the butler never loved her.

1349
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,720
Right.

1350
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,600
The butler has been

1351
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,880
secretly giving me birth control pills,

1352
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,680
but I didn't know.

1353
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,440
And she even thought

1354
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,800
you were really his son

1355
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,720
Suddenly having an eldest son appear

1356
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,520
I also felt very

1357
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,080
In the wife's mind

1358
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,400
the butler had always had a son outside

1359
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,360
That's why he didn't want to have

1360
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,240
a new son with her

1361
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,640
Yes, resentment

1362
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,680
Mainly because his wife fell in love with me again

1363
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,720
Seeing all this money

1364
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,120
She wanted to take the money and run away with me

1365
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,760
Wanted to support you

1366
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,240
Vote for him, Bai Sanwan

1367
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,920
Goodbye, everyone

1368
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,440
You really are this kind of person

1369
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,520
What other choice is there?

1370
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,880
The most decisive man

1371
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,360
The most decisive man in the apartment

1372
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,320
But the wife didn't say

1373
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,200
That you must know

1374
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:43,680
Right

1375
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,320
Did Wenyi enter his room?

1376
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,240
That being said

1377
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,600
Because that day I was listening at the door

1378
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,680
I didn't see where Wenyi was

1379
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,400
I suspect Wenyi was listening inside the room

1380
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,440
Ju Xiangying's room is very small

1381
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,600
There's nowhere to hide

1382
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,760
But outside the door was Guo Baoyou recording

1383
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,520
So at that time he might have been

1384
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,400
in the secret room next to Ju Xiangying

1385
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,920
If he was in that secret room

1386
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,920
he would have had the chance to see

1387
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,840
that text on the computer screen

1388
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,840
This logic makes sense

1389
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,000
Moreover, Wenyi has been unwilling

1390
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,480
to leave the apartment

1391
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,920
because he had nowhere else to go

1392
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,040
He broke up with his girlfriend

1393
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,360
and had a falling out with his family

1394
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,160
Completely alone

1395
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,600
He truly had nowhere to go

1396
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,240
So his anger

1397
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,800
made him even more determined to eliminate him

1398
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,880
Because Wenyi "killed" someone

1399
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,200
"Killed" someone

1400
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,280
Then he arranged for him to go abroad

1401
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,040
to get him out

1402
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,360
But he wouldn't leave

1403
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,560
precisely because he wanted to "get rid of" him

1404
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,800
This way he could ensure no one would ever

1405
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,480
know about his affairs

1406
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:46,880
Right

1407
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,920
Let's go with Wenyi then, okay?

1408
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,520
What? Let's just make a guess

1409
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:54,920
right?

1410
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,160
Just guess Wenyi, right?

1411
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:00,560
I'll write it down

1412
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,560
Or the Qiao siblings

1413
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,800
Audacious and reckless

1414
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,840
It really has to be you two

1415
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,400
When it comes to crucial moments

1416
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,160
it always comes down to you two

1417
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,680
It really is you two

1418
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,520
You're the ones who...

1419
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,640
I believe the "killer" is Mrs. Ju

1420
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,080
The method of committing the crime

1421
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,760
involved using quite clever techniques

1422
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,840
As for the specific techniques

1423
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,960
I trust that you

1424
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,640
will definitely be able to identify them

1425
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,040
Alright

1426
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,920
This opening is a bit small

1427
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,080
Okay

1428
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,720
Because I think

1429
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,680
Ju Wenyi had stronger motives

1430
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,040
After he "killed" the butler

1431
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:41,720
no one would know

1432
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,760
that he had "killed" someone

1433
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,240
So I vote for Ju Wenyi

1434
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,600
What I struggled with in the end was

1435
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,480
choosing between Ju Wenyi and Mrs. Ju

1436
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,720
because their motives for "murder"

1437
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,720
were the most urgent and intense

1438
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,320
My final choice was

1439
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,200
because I think he had the least options

1440
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,440
available to him

1441
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,560
My long-lost father Ju Yangsheng and I

1442
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,640
tampered with the victim

1443
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,080
This was actually unacceptable

1444
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,360
I choose

1445
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,880
him because his suspicion and motives are most substantial

1446
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,720
I think I'll be the only one among the six

1447
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,880
who chooses him

1448
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,240
I'm actually quite uncertain

1449
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,320
but I have to choose him

1450
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,760
He fits logically and reasonably

1451
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,000
We can't exclude him just because

1452
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,360
he seems too obvious

1453
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,560
The person I choose is

1454
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,000
Ju Yangsheng

1455
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,200
Today at Ju Yangsheng's place,

1456
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,400
we also discovered he once had

1457
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
a very important person who jumped to their death.

1458
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,760
Why does there always have to be someone jumping in every case?

1459
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,640
Zhenzhen,

1460
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,640
Fang Xiaomei,

1461
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,760
Ju Yangsheng,

1462
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,960
they probably all knew each other.

1463
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,800
They seemed to have good relationships.

1464
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,720
So who exactly is this person?

1465
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,560
No, this time,

1466
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,760
that symbol has appeared again.

1467
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,280
This time it even looks

1468
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,280
like some kind of product.

1469
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,280
And it particularly resembles a bottle of insecticide.

1470
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,080
But no matter how we ask Mrs. Ju,

1471
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,120
she refuses to reveal

1472
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,680
what this is actually for.

1473
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,120
Could it be

1474
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,520
Mrs. Ju is the one sending the warnings?

1475
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,680
But how would Mrs. Ju know

1476
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,360
about other people's affairs?

1477
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,400
This...

1478
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,200
I don't know where it came from either.

1479
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,040
My unethical father...

1480
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,200
This "murder" today is a bit strange.

1481
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,440
He has no motive.

1482
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:27,800
If he "killed" someone,

1483
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,920
wouldn't it make even less sense?

1484
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,000
I feel

1485
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,080
there must be more to this story.

1486
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,960
Just ask your father directly,

1487
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,320
and remember to tell us after you ask.

1488
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,360
Go get your beauty sleep now.

1489
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,280
I'm exhausted.

1490
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,400
It's time for the big reveal

1491
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,080
The results are in

1492
00:48:59,080 --> 00:48:59,840
I'm so happy

1493
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,040
Who did you vote for?

1494
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:01,960
You're happy

1495
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,800
Guo Baoyou

1496
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,320
Guo Baoyou

1497
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,200
Guo Baoyou

1498
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,080
You actually voted for me?

1499
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,720
Really?

1500
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,920
Vote for Guo Baoyou

1501
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,360
I can't even have a proper conversation with these people

1502
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,360
Dear friends,

1503
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,880
Let's fill our cups first.

1504
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,800
Here, fill it up.

1505
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,080
Tea fragrance meets fruit pieces,

1506
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,480
Milk makes it more delicious.

1507
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,680
After completing today's deduction task,

1508
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,000
we'll take a sip

1509
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,840
of this super tasty Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring tea with real fruit pieces.

1510
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,640
Let's toast together

1511
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,920
and reveal the truth.

1512
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,360
Okay.

1513
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,840
Cheers!

1514
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,040
Next,

1515
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,720
we'll announce the truth of this case.

1516
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,800
In today's case,

1517
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,560
the suspects discovered by players were:

1518
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,000
Ju Chenggong,

1519
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,120
Mrs. Ju,

1520
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,040
Ju Xingyun,

1521
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,040
Ju Wenyi,

1522
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,120
Ju Yangsheng,

1523
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,760
and Guo Baoyou - six people in total.

1524
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,640
After voting,

1525
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,040
those who received votes were:

1526
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,520
Ju Wenyi,

1527
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,520
Ju Yangsheng,

1528
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,520
and Mrs. Ju.

1529
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,920
Those who voted for Ju Wenyi:

1530
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,200
Guo Baoyou,

1531
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,040
Song Piaoliang,

1532
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:03,720
Zhou Keke,

1533
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,840
Liu Xialai.

1534
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,080
Those who voted for Ju Yangsheng:

1535
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:10,840
Ke Wuku

1536
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,200
You're being ridiculous

1537
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,360
No, I genuinely can't find a motive

1538
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,880
to vote against Wenyi

1539
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,320
She's such a simple, honest person

1540
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,880
The one who voted for Mrs. Ju is

1541
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,040
Bai Sanwan

1542
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,520
Just because she likes Bai Sanwan

1543
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,480
you have to vote to "eliminate" her?

1544
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,840
What kind of personality is this?

1545
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,400
The deeper the love

1546
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,440
The sharper the hatred

1547
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,880
Don't love me, it's pointless

1548
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,400
If you dare love me, I'll vote you out

1549
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,400
Then let's see

1550
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,920
who actually found the "real culprit"

1551
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,520
This episode's locked "culprit" is

1552
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,400
Ju Wenyi

1553
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,080
Was your choice

1554
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,680
correct?

1555
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:49,920
Of course it was

1556
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,040
This episode's culprit locked

1557
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,040
Failed to identify the "culprit"

1558
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,680
Failure

1559
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,280
Failed

1560
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:05,920
Unsuccessful

1561
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,240
Then who is it?

1562
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:08,800
Then who could be

1563
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,840
The real "culprit" is

1564
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,480
Mrs. Gu?

1565
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,800
Mrs. Gu

1566
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,200
Mrs. Gu

1567
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,800
Old Bai

1568
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,320
Where are you going?

1569
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:26,720
Wait a moment

1570
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,440
Come down

1571
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,000
Old Bai

1572
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,200
Are you trying to crawl inside or what?

1573
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,320
He's trying to teleport himself away

1574
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,760
So what crucial evidence

1575
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,760
did we miss?

1576
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,280
The key evidence everyone missed is

1577
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,320
the time when the butler browsed the forum

1578
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,680
was on the day of the incident

1579
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,080
Therefore, the "killer" decided to turn this to their advantage

1580
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,040
The time when Heifasen was placed in the dryer

1581
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,840
was also on the day of the incident

1582
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,040
And on that day, the butler mentioned

1583
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,080
that the Gu family stayed home today

1584
00:51:59,080 --> 00:51:59,960
for the family reunion

1585
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,680
to welcome everyone's arrival

1586
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,360
Therefore, the Heifasen powder

1587
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,080
came from within the Gu household

1588
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,960
On the butler's room shelf

1589
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,040
there were numerous hot and sour noodle packages

1590
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,120
Inside these noodle packages

1591
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,760
were Heifasen seasoning packets

1592
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,480
Among them, one noodle package's

1593
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,720
Heifasen seasoning packet

1594
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,800
was taken and used by the "killer"

1595
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,240
I even opened that hot and sour noodle package

1596
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,280
But I just took a quick look

1597
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,120
I thought

1598
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:30,560
the seasoning packet

1599
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:34,760
It's all your fault

1600
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,840
We missed the most important clue

1601
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,280
Right?

1602
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,200
Why didn't you check it?

1603
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,320
How would we know it belonged to the wife?

1604
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,920
Everyone found a locked box

1605
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,240
Inside was the wife's makeup bag

1606
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,240
After the wife obtained Heifasen

1607
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,320
she immediately used the compact case from her makeup bag

1608
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,040
to crush it into powder

1609
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,840
On the compact case

1610
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,720
traces of crushed Heifasen powder remained

1611
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,560
We thought it was just shattered foundation

1612
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:07,920
Right?

1613
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,000
We just didn't consider that

1614
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,120
Never expected that

1615
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,960
I'm sorry

1616
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,960
Next time I'll try harder

1617
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,920
to examine every ingredient

1618
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,840
even the seasoning packets

1619
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,600
I'll tear them open and taste

1620
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,040
If it's the culprit

1621
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:24,720
even at my own expense

1622
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,160
I'll find the "culprit"

1623
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,960
The "Super Good Family" is a makeshift family

1624
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,880
Eggplant

1625
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,080
They pretend to be a family

1626
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,400
doing live-stream sales online

1627
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,160
Glitter ink

1628
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,680
During the June 14th live stream

1629
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,440
Mrs. Ju asked fans on the forum

1630
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,720
to vote for a food item

1631
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,840
to use in the family recognition ceremony

1632
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,000
Eventually, her fans

1633
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,800
chose a

1634
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,160
limited edition peach donut

1635
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,160
Mrs. Ju discovered the donut contained

1636
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,400
Heifasen (a substance)

1637
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,320
while Ju Xiangying is severely allergic to Heifasen

1638
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,520
Now that fans have chosen this donut

1639
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,320
it might cause

1640
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,800
Xiangying to "die" from an allergic reaction

1641
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,440
This plays right into Mrs. Ju's hands

1642
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,560
Early on the day of the incident,

1643
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,800
Mrs. Gu was cleaning

1644
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,000
Gu Xiangying's secret room

1645
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,200
when she unexpectedly saw his computer

1646
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,600
The browsing history showed

1647
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,640
he had already seen

1648
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,080
that on the day of the recognition ceremony

1649
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,600
there would be limited edition peach donuts

1650
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,520
So he likely already knew

1651
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,360
the donuts contained Heifasen

1652
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,080
He wouldn't eat them

1653
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,160
But as the live stream host

1654
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,400
he would still be given a donut

1655
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,400
After handling the donut

1656
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,160
he would surely wash his hands

1657
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,800
Mrs. Gu realized

1658
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,840
if she took advantage when Gu Xiangying washed his hands

1659
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,000
to tamper with things

1660
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,360
she could make him inhale Heifasen and "die" from allergy

1661
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,440
Then even if investigated

1662
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,680
everyone would think

1663
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,920
Gu Xiangying died from

1664
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,160
eating the Heifasen-laced donuts

1665
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,480
She recalled that on Gu Xiangying's shelf

1666
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,160
there was spicy sour noodles from his livestream

1667
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,560
which contained Heifasen packets

1668
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,840
She took from the shelf

1669
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,160
and opened a box of the noodles

1670
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,880
taking out the Heifasen packet inside

1671
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,320
Then using her powder compact

1672
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,280
she ground the Heifasen into fine powder

1673
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,960
Before the recognition ceremony officially begins,

1674
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,800
Mrs. Gu quietly slips into the banquet hall's restroom,

1675
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,040
and applies Heifasen powder

1676
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,080
around the hand dryer's air vent.

1677
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,880
To prevent anyone from washing their hands

1678
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,040
and using the dryer

1679
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,520
from disrupting her plan,

1680
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,320
she also takes away

1681
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,440
the restroom's

1682
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,920
smart dryer remote control

1683
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,080
to cut off the dryer's power.

1684
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,320
12:50 PM,

1685
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,960
during the banquet proceedings,

1686
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,040
Mrs. Gu notices

1687
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,680
that Gu Xiangying indeed takes a donut

1688
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,240
and leaves the banquet hall.

1689
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,000
12:55 PM,

1690
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,880
Gu Xiangying comes to inform Gu Chenggong

1691
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,320
that the live stream's end time is approaching.

1692
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,200
Mrs. Gu observes

1693
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,320
Gu Xiangying preparing to wash hands in the restroom,

1694
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,480
and secretly uses the hidden remote in her hand

1695
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,520
to turn on the smart dryer's power.

1696
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,160
Thus,

1697
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,840
when Gu Xiangying finishes washing hands

1698
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,360
and uses the dryer,

1699
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,840
the dryer's strong airflow will

1700
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,960
cause her to inhale the Heifasen powder.

1701
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,880
Thirteen o'clock (idiom meaning "silly" or "foolish")

1702
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,440
Everyone heard a loud noise coming from the restroom

1703
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,840
and hurried to check what happened

1704
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,360
They discovered Gu Xiangying

1705
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,160
already "dead" in the restroom

1706
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,040
Mrs. Gu took advantage of

1707
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,240
the opportunity to enter the restroom with everyone

1708
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,720
to place the hand dryer remote

1709
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,160
back on the wall

1710
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,400
and took a piece from

1711
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,320
the donut in the trash bin

1712
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,480
along the path to the restroom

1713
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,360
that Gu Xiangying had discarded

1714
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,680
making everyone believe

1715
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,960
Gu Xiangying "died" from eating the donut

1716
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,840
thus creating the illusion

1717
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,840
This completed

1718
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,720
her "murder" method

1719
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,000
Bai Sanwan, the only one who voted correctly

1720
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,040
please claim your golden key

1721
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,160
Congratulations

1722
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,160
This case

1723
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,640
actually relates to

1724
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,960
certain consumer mentality

1725
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,440
in our daily lives

1726
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:36,960
Exactly

1727
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,680
So we'll once again

1728
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,400
welcome our old friend

1729
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,760
from China University of Political Science and Law

1730
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,240
Professor of Criminal Psychology

1731
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,160
Professor Ma Ai

1732
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,200
to help us analyze this case

1733
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:49,800
Hello Professor Ma

1734
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,320
Hello

1735
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,360
Professor, I have a question

1736
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:55,960
For example

1737
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,600
in this particular case

1738
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,840
there's a "victim"

1739
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,800
but three "attackers"

1740
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,160
For instance

1741
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,360
if I had already "killed" this person

1742
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,120
but the other two didn't know

1743
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,120
and each gave another stab

1744
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,800
would these two be guilty of crime?

1745
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,160
These two would also be guilty

1746
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,320
However,

1747
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,960
Taking you three as examples,

1748
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,120
You committed intentional homicide,

1749
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:15,720
That's correct.

1750
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,000
These two,

1751
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,320
didn't know he was already "dead",

1752
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,320
but wanted him "dead".

1753
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,160
This is called mistake of object.

1754
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,000
Mistake of object.

1755
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,400
Right.

1756
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:24,840
That is to say,

1757
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,280
this person was already a "corpse".

1758
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,360
No matter what you did to him,

1759
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,520
he couldn't "die" again.

1760
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,120
Correct.

1761
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,000
The tools you prepared,

1762
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,280
and the actions you took,

1763
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,480
but caused no actual harm.

1764
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:32,880
Yes.

1765
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,920
Because the target was already a "corpse".

1766
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,520
This is called impossible crime against the object.

1767
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,720
Impossible crime against the object.

1768
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,440
But your actions

1769
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,760
had already entered

1770
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,680
the preparatory stage of crime.

1771
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,440
Therefore it should be judged

1772
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,800
as preparatory acts for intentional homicide,

1773
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,000
with mitigated punishment,

1774
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,920
or even exemption from punishment.

1775
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,400
So you're guilty of

1776
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,600
preparatory acts for intentional homicide.

1777
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,160
So Guo Baoyou, you had actually

1778
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:00,920
Your action -

1779
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,040
releasing that poison gas -

1780
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,800
was already in the preparatory stage of crime.

1781
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,320
Is that so?

1782
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,800
He had already made preparations.

1783
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,200
He had made complete preparations.

1784
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,720
It's just that the previous person

1785
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,280
had already "died" first,

1786
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,240
so his poison gas

1787
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,000
wasn't inhaled by the "deceased".

1788
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,080
Thank Mrs. Ju then.

1789
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,080
Thank Mrs. Gu for saving your life

1790
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:15,800
Mrs. Gu saved your life

1791
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:16,440
Saved your life

1792
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,440
Don't blame me

1793
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,520
That was Guo Baoyou's doing

1794
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,040
What does that have to do with me, right?

1795
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,760
But actually, come to think of it

1796
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,200
This kind of live-stream selling

1797
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,800
is a new type of consumption trap nowadays

1798
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,240
Right

1799
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,600
They even use certain sales tactics

1800
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,560
to deceive consumers

1801
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,520
making them buy things

1802
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,800
they might not normally need

1803
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,360
at all

1804
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,480
How should we avoid this?

1805
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,360
No matter what you're buying

1806
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,360
the first thing is to ask yourself

1807
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,440
Do I really need this?

1808
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,560
Second, you need to think about it

1809
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,200
Is it worth it?

1810
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,240
The third question you should ask

1811
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,560
Is there an alternative?

1812
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:44,880
Finally

1813
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,360
You must consider

1814
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,400
Is this absolutely necessary to buy?

1815
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,600
What would happen if you didn't buy it?

1816
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,960
Just try to convince yourself

1817
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,000
Because often

1818
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,960
the products offered by consumer traps

1819
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,280
are designed to help you

1820
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,920
gain self-esteem and something to show off

1821
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,880
some capital

1822
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,680
what we call social capital

1823
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,160
rather than things you truly need

1824
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,160
Professor Ma, I have a question.

1825
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:08,800
It's about...

1826
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,840
what you'd call impulsive spending.

1827
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,360
When we read the news,

1828
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,040
many people come across

1829
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,720
some shocking figures.

1830
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,040
Like some tipping extravagantly

1831
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,040
or competing to show off wealth,

1832
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,040
casually spending hundreds of thousands.

1833
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:21,880
This kind of...

1834
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,680
From a psychological perspective,

1835
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,120
how can we curb

1836
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,120
this spending impulse?

1837
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,160
Or how should we analyze

1838
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,240
rational consumption?

1839
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,720
Are you describing a bandwagon effect?

1840
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,920
Yes, somewhat.

1841
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,880
Actually here,

1842
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,360
these spending traps

1843
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,720
have two characteristics.

1844
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,400
First,

1845
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,840
what we just mentioned -

1846
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,120
the ripple effect.

1847
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,640
You start from one point

1848
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,680
and it eventually expands.

1849
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,440
Second,

1850
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,840
it influences your values

1851
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,000
and lifestyle.

1852
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,440
All spending traps

1853
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,480
essentially stem from

1854
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,880
comparing yourself to others.

1855
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,480
Behind this

1856
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,720
more importantly

1857
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,200
lies the need for self-esteem,

1858
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,040
our fear of

1859
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,560
social exclusion,

1860
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,080
and our desire for

1861
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,400
social recognition.

1862
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,200
Right.

1863
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,880
This is a consumer trap

1864
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:08,640
But if, let's say,

1865
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,600
I accidentally fall into this trap,

1866
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,640
how can we consumers

1867
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,040
maximize our efforts to

1868
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,440
protect our rights?

1869
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,600
There are two scenarios:

1870
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,440
One is buying counterfeit goods,

1871
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,880
the other is buying substandard products.

1872
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,040
Our criminal law

1873
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,160
has specific provisions for both.

1874
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,560
You can report it,

1875
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,360
or you can

1876
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,760
file for civil compensation.

1877
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,440
Who should you seek recourse from?

1878
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,240
The live-stream seller,

1879
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,880
the merchant behind them,

1880
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,120
or both?

1881
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,520
When it comes to rights protection,

1882
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,720
you should rely on public authority.

1883
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,560
For instance, with counterfeit goods,

1884
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,480
market regulation authorities can assist.

1885
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,360
If you encounter

1886
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,400
obviously

1887
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,840
substandard products

1888
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,560
that cause direct harm,

1889
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,680
like health issues after consumption,

1890
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,360
or even fatal consequences,

1891
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,480
then public security authorities

1892
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,440
will directly file your case.

1893
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,720
Teacher, how can we help young people

1894
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,000
establish proper

1895
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,760
values and consumption habits

1896
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,280
Many are even overburdened

1897
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:07,880
with such

1898
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,440
Yes, extremely overburdened

1899
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,280
How to help young people

1900
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,160
Your generation

1901
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,760
lives in very fortunate

1902
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,680
circumstances

1903
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,360
unlike our generation

1904
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,040
You lack the most basic

1905
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,160
what we call "being vigilant in peace time"

1906
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,240
psychological preparation for rainy days

1907
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:23,720
Right

1908
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,080
Without this preparation

1909
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,840
your spending

1910
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,400
will mainly bring you

1911
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,320
dopamine release

1912
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,280
But if you change your perspective

1913
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,840
and learn from life's setbacks and experiences

1914
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,240
to see various uncertainties

1915
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,600
you'll realize

1916
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,200
we shouldn't excessively

1917
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,400
engage in premature consumption

1918
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,480
This is a conceptual issue

1919
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,200
Furthermore

1920
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,360
with digital payments now

1921
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,360
spending has become too easy

1922
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,160
So

1923
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,960
it instantly stimulates your dopamine

1924
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,160
Yes

1925
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,600
Alright, let's give a round of applause

1926
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,760
for Professor Ma's sharing

1927
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,400
Thank you

1928
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,800
for giving us many useful suggestions

1929
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,000
Thank you, Professor Ma

1930
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,520
"Let's Start Deduction"

1931
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,640
See you next week

1932
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,200
Apartment 11 was a decoy

1933
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,040
So it made the workers

1934
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,120
vanish into thin air again

1935
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,200
The elevator fell

1936
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,000
Deputy Manager Fu "died"

1937
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,960
The "killer" must have been on the scene

1938
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,520
He didn’t want to be seen

1939
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,120
He hid too much from us

1940
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,720
Is human nature this dark?

1941
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,280
Someone deliberately "killed" him

1942
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,920
I now have evidence

1943
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,760
Everyone was at peace

1944
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,200
You also had "murderous" intent

1945
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,240
Stop

1946
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:33,800
Sis

1947
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,760
Wait, who is this?

1948
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,840
Ke Wuku is suspicious

1949
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,760
Come here, buddy

1950
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,400
Stop forming cliques here

1951
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,400
The relationships are already complicated

1952
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,560
It has nothing to do with me

1953
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,560
You’re the one who "killed" him

1954
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,240
Get your attitude straight

1955
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,720
Everyone should pay the price

1956
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:45,600
Smart

1957
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,360
He "deserved to die"

1958
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,960
Let me end all this

1959
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:48,600
Well said

1960
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,640
You’re next

1961
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:51,920
Again

1962
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,520
Another one

1963
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:53,960
Yet another doll

1964
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,520
The culprit must be

1965
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,120
"Using others to kill"

1966
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:57,920
Today is his day

1967
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:58,760
Well done

1968
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,200
Relax

1969
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,520
Enjoy it properly

1970
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,320
Come on, let's begin

1971
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,960
Old Bai is one step ahead again

1972
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,200
No, he's working on something

1973
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,040
So Old Bai has been

1974
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,520
If we can solve cases, we can commit them too

1975
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,320
Impossible

1976
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,200
Kewuku is gone

1977
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,280
Heading to the execution ground

1978
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,120
Just shoot him directly

1979
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,880
