1
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,800
Today we'll teach everyone how to make chocolate

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,280
First

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,160
The pot for melting chocolate must not get wet

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Do you really know how?

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,840
Do you want to make white chocolate

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,480
or red chocolate?

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,040
Do you have this?

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,360
Want to try one I made?

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:30,800
Liu Xialai

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,600
Awesome

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,040
Delicious

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,560
There's no difference

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,240
from what we made

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,920
Right

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,040
The secret recipe is all in the chocolate

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,760
Doesn't the chocolate have a brand logo?

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,920
Stop exposing me!

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,040
Today's spread is really lavish

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,960
This is way too lavish today

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,720
I don't know why

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,400
Did our apartment make money

22
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,360
that they're treating us to good food before

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,160
sending us all away

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,680
You eat way more than your brother.

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,560
Judging by how much you eat,

26
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,320
it really seems like two people.

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,840
Life at home must be tough.

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,600
Ke Wuku.

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,040
So you're Zhou Keke's

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,520
nephew.

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,120
Nephew.

32
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,920
Nephew, don't you trust me?

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,760
Brother Keke.

34
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,400
Nephew, don't you trust me?

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,360
Aunt Cai, our son—

36
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,160
Why are you calling him "our son"?

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,360
Hello

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,960
Hi

39
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,400
Morning

40
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,360
Hello everyone

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,680
We've been through two seasons together

42
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,160
Do you have anything

43
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,320
you need to confess beforehand?

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,120
Don't wait until the end

45
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,240
No

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,120
and then suddenly drop another bombshell

47
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,200
Nothing

48
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,160
I'm a good person

49
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,800
Everyone claims to be good

50
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,560
I really am good

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,160
Honestly

52
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,520
Let me tell you

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,000
You're acting suspicious today too

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,520
You're not exactly innocent either

55
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,440
You still haven't explained

56
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,800
that story about two bowls of noodles

57
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,880
That girl, I owe you an apology

58
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,160
That boy, I'm sorry to you too

59
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,600
And then

60
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,600
Brother, I "got you killed"

62
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
There, I confessed

63
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,240
My noodles story is

64
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,040
one bowl

65
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,760
to toast friends

66
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,680
two bowls for myself

67
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,919
That's my three-bowl noodle story

68
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,080
You're quite generous with friends

69
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,640
Hello everyone

70
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,520
Hi

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,880
You changed your hairstyle

72
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,840
Yes, got a haircut

73
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,600
Your hair

74
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,920
After the cut, you look slimmer

75
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,280
Really?

76
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,560
Like you lost several pounds

77
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Your head even looks smaller

78
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,600
What's wrong with you?

79
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,320
I have a stiff neck.

80
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,480
She won't accept it.

81
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,040
You really seem a bit unconvinced

82
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,600
I'll perk up in a moment

83
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,120
Hello

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,640
Hi

85
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,520
You got a haircut too

86
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,120
Yes

87
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
You look younger

88
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,080
Right

89
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,200
I do look young, don't I?

90
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Let's get started

91
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,280
Start what?

92
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
Today we'll teach everyone how to make chocolate

93
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,800
Making chocolate is actually quite simple

94
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,680
First, this pot for melting chocolate

95
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,320
must not get wet

96
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,880
Do you really know how?

97
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,320
I really do

98
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,120
Are you sure you know?

99
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,880
Then what are you pouring?

100
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,360
Melt the chocolate using a double boiler

101
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,280
And that's it

102
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,280
Do you want to make white chocolate

103
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,200
or red chocolate?

104
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,360
Red chocolate

105
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,120
Red chocolate

106
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,520
Do you have this?

107
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,320
Do you want white chocolate

108
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,440
or dark chocolate?

109
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,280
White chocolate

110
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,680
White chocolate

111
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,120
Looks nice

112
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,200
What's the difference between these two?

113
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,880
These

114
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,720
One is white chocolate

115
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
one is dark chocolate

116
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,440
Just pour the water in, right?

117
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,640
Yes

118
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,720
Melt the chocolate first?

119
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,760
Right

120
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,640
Let's wait a moment

121
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,920
Let me open this first

122
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,680
I can't open it

123
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,240
I'll open it for you

124
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,240
Can this be eaten?

125
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,280
Yes, this is really edible.

126
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,800
This much?

127
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,600
What is this?

128
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,240
Chocolate.

129
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,920
Right.

130
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,240
Do you want white or dark?

131
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,760
I'll take white.

132
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,080
I'll go with dark.

133
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,720
I'll have dark too.

134
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,800
It melted so quickly, this one.

135
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,600
Who is this person?

136
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,120
Hello everyone.

137
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,600
Hello, who is this?

138
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,920
No, who are you?

139
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,880
Who are you?

140
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,640
Can you guess my name?

141
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,280
I guess you're Kewuku's son.

142
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,720
Kuzi.

143
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,160
Kuzi.

144
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,000
My surname is Ke, given name Wuku.

145
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,680
Kewu.

146
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,520
Kewuku.

147
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,560
His brother is Kuge (Crying Brother).

148
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
And he's Ku (Bitter).

149
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,120
There's also one called Ku (Cool).

150
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,680
And I'm here to teach you how to make chocolate.

151
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,240
Zhou Keke.

152
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,600
Come here.

153
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,320
I've melted white chocolate for you.

154
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,440
Come on.

155
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,080
Hurry up.

156
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,360
We're such new residents.

157
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,440
We've become friends so quickly.

158
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,080
We're really too hospitable.

159
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,000
We're such nice people.

160
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,120
After I finish melting it.

161
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,800
After melting.

162
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,480
If you want to make large chocolate bars.

163
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,440
Use this container.

164
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,680
You can also make.

165
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,160
Any pattern you want.

166
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,640
Understood.

167
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,680
You can add nuts to the chocolate.

168
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,360
Or add figs.

169
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
Even lemon slices work.

170
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,320
In your experience, what sells best?

171
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,120
In my experience.

172
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,760
Everything I make sells well.

173
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,960
What about ours?

174
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,600
No matter what, they don't sell well.

175
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,560
As for you.

176
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,840
You can't compete with me.

177
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,480
I actually saw it melt

178
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Yes, you have a shovel there

179
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,720
Right?

180
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,360
You can just shovel it

181
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,040
It'll melt when you shovel it

182
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,040
Coco, hit me with another one

183
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,160
I've got one more here

184
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,760
We just wait for it to dry, right?

185
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,280
Yes, then just put it in the fridge

186
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,640
Alright

187
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,440
This amount I melted is enough for this

188
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,600
You could melt a bit more

189
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
Never mind, this is enough

190
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,320
That's good

191
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,800
Done

192
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,280
That's about enough

193
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,880
Don't be so polite

194
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,560
This is the idea

195
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,600
What are you making?

196
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,160
A smiley face

197
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,960
You're so half-hearted

198
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,000
No I'm not

199
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,160
What did you make?

200
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,640
You only melted that tiny bit of chocolate

201
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,880
Poured it on lemon slices

202
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,800
This is exactly what she wants

203
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,600
This kind sells well these days

204
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,560
Yes, practical

205
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,640
Thanks for taking time

206
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,200
out of your busy schedule to half-heartedly help us

207
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,680
Here

208
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
I'll put it in the fridge

209
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,280
Okay

210
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,320
Everyone can put theirs in the fridge when done

211
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,920
Got it

212
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,720
Yours...

213
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,640
How is it?

214
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,920
Great, very creative

215
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,040
Really, thank you

216
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,440
I'm already feeling the pressure

217
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,160
What pressure?

218
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,480
The pressure of Zhou Keke losing her job

219
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,240
Now I finally understand

220
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,320
how I managed to keep

221
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,240
this chocolate shop

222
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,360
successfully running in the market

223
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,120
Because people don't know

224
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,120
they can just freeze it in the fridge

225
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,560
Right?

226
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes

227
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,640
After finishing, just freeze it in the fridge

228
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,040
This is

229
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
This is something I made before

230
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,040
Okay

231
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,560
Let's leave it at that

232
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,200
You're amazing

233
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,360
Let me show everyone

234
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,080
First, let me show you what I made

235
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Previously successful ones

236
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,040
You can eat some if you want

237
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,960
It's really edible

238
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,760
Look at what I made

239
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,840
Can I try one?

240
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,400
It's edible, it's really edible

241
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,920
Can I try some?

242
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,520
Sure.

243
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,200
Go ahead.

244
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,680
Want to try one I made?

245
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,160
Liu Xialai

246
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Amazing.

247
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,480
Delicious.

248
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,880
It's just like...

249
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,640
...what we make.

250
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,440
Right.

251
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,280
So you just melt the chocolate...

252
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,320
...then let it solidify again?

253
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,880
What's going on?

254
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,480
My secret recipe...

255
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,280
...is all in the chocolate.

256
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,080
Not telling you.

257
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,600
But the chocolate has a brand label.

258
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,720
Stop exposing me.

259
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,480
So your chocolate factory...

260
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,160
...works like this?

261
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,000
Add some peanuts.

262
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,600
This is unbeatable.

263
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Yours is great.

264
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,120
Yeah.

265
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,480
This looks like the expensive kind.

266
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,040
You even made it double-layered

267
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
That's amazing!

268
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,040
Right? Just messing around

269
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,560
Actually, you can make it double-layered

270
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,600
Yeah, just make a...

271
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,160
Look at this part here

272
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,880
This looks expensive too

273
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,920
Streaks and patterns

274
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,720
Then sprinkle some of this and it'll be perfect

275
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,240
Just like the ones sold in stores

276
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,960
No difference at all

277
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,039
Doesn't it look like sesame paste?

278
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,760
Hotpot time, bro

279
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,080
Bro, any more would be too much

280
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,560
Attention all citizens of Tuishi City

281
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,760
It's now 4 PM on July 2nd

282
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,720
Currently 4 PM

283
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,080
So he abandoned you too

284
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,640
Right?

285
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,480
You're in the same boat

286
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,080
Why do I feel...

287
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:07,920
You...

288
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,520
Pay attention to us

289
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,080
What's this? It was fine just now

290
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,760
Made it look like...

291
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,920
You wouldn't understand

292
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,960
This is called cutting it to eat

293
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,320
You know...

294
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,000
Cut it open and you'll see what's inside

295
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,440
Right?

296
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,320
I'll put it in the fridge for you

297
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,120
Let's go eat

298
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,840
Let's eat first

299
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,440
We'll have energy to keep working after we're full

300
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:38,920
Bro Bai

301
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,200
Come see today's dishes

302
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,560
Let me see

303
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,600
Not bad

304
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,840
Looks good

305
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,880
Then I'll dig in first

306
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,000
So Brother Bai, you're putting it on tab today?

307
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,160
Sure

308
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
What if I don't have a meal card?

309
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
You don't have a meal card?

310
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,880
No

311
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,400
Can't eat without one

312
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,520
Look for it

313
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,760
No meal card

314
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,320
A He

315
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,480
Come on

316
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,440
Very wealthy

317
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,720
This purchase: 58 yuan

318
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,440
Please

319
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,200
This was so hard

320
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,760
So difficult

321
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,600
Finally not on credit

322
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,200
Finally can eat right away

323
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,720
Bro, you're on credit now

324
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,480
Credit

325
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,640
He's still on credit

326
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,840
I'll work for you later

327
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,280
Pay back

328
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,720
Today's dishes

329
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,400
This is kinda

330
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Like eating like there's no tomorrow

331
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,320
Afraid you can't get good food there

332
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,280
Still lying to us

333
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,280
We all know

334
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
Know everything

335
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,160
No

336
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,840
Not this

337
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,600
What's this called

338
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,200
Year 1988

339
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,680
Those were all fake

340
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,320
You've already started eating

341
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,760
Here

342
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,160
58 yuan per person

343
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,920
Found my brother's meal card

344
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,640
Found it

345
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,080
Found it

346
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,120
Your brother passed it to you

347
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,200
Right

348
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,160
This purchase: 58 yuan

349
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,720
Done

350
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,320
Okay

351
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,760
Here

352
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,080
How much is on your card

353
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,720
Over 90 yuan

354
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,000
See, the account still has my brother's name

355
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,880
You should thank your brother

356
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
He's already inside

357
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,480
But left the meals for you

358
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,200
This counts as inheritance, right?

359
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,080
Not inheritance

360
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,000
He's not gone yet

361
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,360
You just said you

362
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,800
"time traveled" - how exactly?

363
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,440
Fake

364
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,120
Didn't happen

365
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,520
We were tricked

366
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,240
Where?

367
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,600
Our basement floor

368
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,080
There's such a place?

369
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,200
Someone modified it

370
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,560
To make it look like 1988

371
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,480
Right

372
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,720
We almost got locked in there

373
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,640
Then when mealtime came

374
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
We escaped to eat

375
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,080
Yeah

376
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,400
Right

377
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,320
And at mealtime

378
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,560
Maybe they got careless with security

379
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,040
Makes sense

380
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,360
Sister Cai

381
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,960
Won't be with us the whole time later

382
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,040
Right, because Sister Cai

383
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,320
I noticed she didn't look well

384
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,960
I took her to the infirmary

385
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,600
Then let's visit her at the infirmary

386
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,560
Yes, let's check

387
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:17,920
Right, we can

388
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,480
Let's go see her after eating

389
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,960
Today's spread is really lavish

390
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,800
This is too extravagant today

391
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,040
Not sure why

392
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,760
And you can still eat this meal?

393
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,440
Aren't you worried at all?

394
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,400
Why couldn't I eat?

395
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,440
I'm actually eating better than before

396
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,160
Today's dishes seem

397
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,880
Particularly appetizing, don't they?

398
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,760
Yes

399
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,160
Did our apartment make money?

400
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,960
Right, we're profitable for the first time

401
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,520
Giving us a good meal

402
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,760
Before sending us all away

403
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,760
Really sending us back to "1988"

404
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:45,920
What's wrong?

405
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,840
Is our Apartment 11 closing down?

406
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,800
Or is this a farewell dinner?

407
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,400
You mentioned discovering that case over there

408
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,640
Then what happened?

409
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,440
Look

410
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,320
Thirty-four years ago

411
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,360
two people "died," right?

412
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,920
Correct

413
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,400
Then why

414
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,440
did two more people "die" today?

415
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,240
Two more people have "died"

416
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,920
at the place where we "time traveled"

417
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,680
to in the past

418
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,920
So who

419
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,760
Same time

420
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,720
Same location

421
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,680
It must be

422
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,640
someone faking

423
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,240
So today's "victims" are

424
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,480
the ones creating the 1988 illusion

425
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,040
That person

426
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,040
One of them should be Old Wang

427
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,560
Who's the other one?

428
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,800
Little Wang

429
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,160
I can't help but think it's very likely

430
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,000
Sister Cai

431
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,600
did it

432
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,880
killed them

433
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,640
Sister Cai is a suspect

434
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,560
Yes

435
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,000
Sister Cai is the victim

436
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,760
but

437
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,240
she could also have a "murder" motive

438
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,080
Sister Cai's missing person notice

439
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,480
Didn't you see it before

440
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,200
at the Feimao Foot Wash shop

441
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,680
Did you see it there?

442
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,560
Sister Cai

443
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Female, 72 years old

444
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,160
Big eyes

445
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,400
Fair skin, elegant demeanor

446
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,040
Loves chocolate

447
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,120
Was wearing a white undershirt when she went missing

448
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,040
Caramel-colored coat

449
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
May 24th

450
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,000
Dressed up nicely

451
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,600
Left home and hasn't returned since

452
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I think it's very possible

453
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,320
that she "killed" these two people today

454
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,480
First, she was a victim back then.

455
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,280
She's also a victim this time.

456
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,640
Isn't it written in the file?

457
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,160
The remaining one is actually Sister Cai.

458
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,000
Right.

459
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,280
If the elderly discover the secret,

460
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,520
or aren't even worth deceiving anymore,

461
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,840
they're eliminated by special means.

462
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,840
So Sister Cai

463
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,560
is seeking revenge for these people.

464
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:16,920
Correct.

465
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,520
This person also intends to eliminate her.

466
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,480
She might have "killed" them

467
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,080
out of fear of being eliminated herself.

468
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,840
That's also a possibility.

469
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,760
Old Li said

470
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,440
Thank you

471
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,360
for helping me find my son and grandson

472
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,400
Who is the grandson?

473
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,480
I should thank you

474
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
for helping me find my grandson and son

475
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,400
He

476
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,080
So you're Zhou Keke's

477
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,560
nephew

478
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,520
Nephew

479
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,400
This is indeed

480
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,160
your family's genes

481
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,320
are somewhat unusual

482
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,240
Finished eating

483
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,480
Have some more

484
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,560
No thanks

485
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,880
Need to use my brain later

486
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't exist

487
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,720
He doesn't use much

488
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,800
Because we haven't been kicked out in these recent episodes

489
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,760
A little more

490
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,240
I ate so much today.

491
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,760
You eat way more than your little brother.

492
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,640
You can tell from the amount of food.

493
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,400
There really are two different people.

494
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,600
No, eat more.

495
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,520
We won't do anything like that.

496
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,720
We're happy watching kids eat.

497
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,080
Okay.

498
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,120
Hello.

499
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,800
Come here.

500
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,680
Eat quickly.

501
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,520
Where's your meal card?

502
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,360
Meal card?

503
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,120
Meal card.

504
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,880
No meal card.

505
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,480
Don't have one?

506
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,600
Then you'll have to keep a tab.

507
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,400
Fine, you keep track then.

508
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,240
If Zhou Keke doesn't come soon,

509
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,200
we'll finish all the food.

510
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,240
Look at this Ke Wuku,

511
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,200
his portion today...

512
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,120
His family must be really struggling.

513
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,680
Ke Wuku.

514
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:20,840
Zhou Keke.

515
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,760
He went to the infirmary to take care of Sister Cai.

516
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,200
Really?

517
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,120
Or did he go to commit a crime?

518
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,600
He's definitely suspicious.

519
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,560
He must know the inside story.

520
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:36,960
Right.

521
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,360
He's definitely hiding something from us.

522
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,200
We haven't searched his room yet.

523
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,440
I didn't know about any of this.

524
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,320
I had no idea at all.

525
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,920
About this place called Chuyang Alley.

526
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,280
Sister Cai is my good friend.

527
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,480
That thing this morning...

528
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,160
The box.

529
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,360
What about the box?

530
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,320
Who gave it to us?

531
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,200
Me

532
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,680
Just one box

533
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,240
What else?

534
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,319
He

535
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:10,760
You

536
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,960
No, the TV said

537
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,760
Right, you've investigated

538
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,480
Who exactly released that so-called预告 (note: "预告" is typically translated as "trailer" or "preview" in media context, but left in pinyin here as it appears to be a key term)

539
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,880
What I want to tell you is

540
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,960
Two people will "die" today

541
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,040
In the box outside

542
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,960
There are clues I left for you

543
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,160
I think all of this

544
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,000
must have been his doing

545
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,920
Zhou Keke did it

546
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,200
I think he was helping Sister Cai

547
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,080
Right?

548
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Because they've known each other for a long time

549
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,200
Sister Cai

550
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,560
Sweet little Zhou Zhou

551
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,040
Sister Cai, what are you doing here?

552
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,360
Because when we were gathering evidence earlier

553
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,080
we saw his photo with Sister Cai

554
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,440
So he should have known long ago

555
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,120
that Sister Cai was his

556
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,880
stepmother

557
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,480
No, his former mother

558
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,880
Not exactly former mother either

559
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,360
Anyway, they're half-siblings with the same father

560
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,320
Half-siblings

561
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,040
That's not relevant, just different mothers

562
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,840
What's the relationship between Sister Cai and Zhou Keke?

563
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,640
Sister Cai

564
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,840
was Zhou Keke's father's first love

565
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,720
Meaning

566
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,960
his father, Old Man Li

567
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,720
met her while on the run

568
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,880
and hid at Zhou Keke's mother's place

569
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,400
So Zhou Keke

570
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,000
is actually not in his forties

571
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,360
No

572
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,040
He was born in 1997

573
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,560
Who's the oldest in this apartment?

574
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,440
Old Bai? No, not Old Bai

575
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,120
No, Old Bai is his nephew

576
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,680
nephew

577
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,960
No, he's actually quite young

578
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,080
He was born in 1993

579
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,720
If he was born in 1993

580
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,520
then I would be 1995

581
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,280
But I think I'm 1992

582
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,040
or sometime in the 90s

583
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,600
1991

584
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,880
You're actually older than me

585
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,240
Yes, my character is 28 years old

586
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,400
Show some respect, okay?

587
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,680
You're twenty-eight, two years older than me.

588
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,200
Call me "big sister."

589
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,840
I'm twenty-six.

590
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,160
Is yours ready yet?

591
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,440
Yes, all done.

592
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,280
You should see his pile.

593
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,680
That...

594
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,880
That bowl, right?

595
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,480
The vomit one.

596
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,600
Excellent.

597
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,120
Perfect.

598
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,720
Let it freeze a bit more, it still feels a little...

599
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,480
Let's go now.

600
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,400
We haven't finished eating yet.

601
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,240
What's wrong with you? Rushing us out?

602
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,800
Look.

603
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,880
For someone running a restaurant,

604
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,280
you shouldn't be in this business.

605
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,360
After you finish eating,

606
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,640
just put the chairs on the tables

607
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,600
and start mopping the floor.

608
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,920
At least wait for Zhou Keke, right?

609
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,840
It's fine, pack some for him.

610
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,560
Bring some for him.

611
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,320
Pack it for him to eat while solving the case.

612
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:48,680
Take it.

613
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,920
Eat while pushing.

614
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,720
No,

615
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,800
is it possible that Sister Hua and the others

616
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,960
must know something?

617
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,440
Didn't they call us over?

618
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:01,920
We

619
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,280
after gathering everyone,

620
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,400
it would be convenient for them to commit the crime.

621
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,080
Neighbors,

622
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,800
quickly

623
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,000
gather at our dance hall.

624
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,960
I think

625
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,320
the old man who invited us is suspicious.

626
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,880
The one who treated us to buns, right?

627
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,720
Yes.

628
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,280
The others

629
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,640
were probably controlled by them.

630
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,240
I feel...

631
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,680
If that's the case,

632
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,120
those aunties who danced with us

633
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,920
would also be suspicious.

634
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:34,680
No,

635
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,840
those aunties were probably tricked into going.

636
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,640
They're victims.

637
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,480
They genuinely believed

638
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,960
they had returned to "1988."

639
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,920
The suspicious one is that Sister Cai.

640
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,440
I think she's suspicious.

641
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,560
And quite suspicious at that.

642
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,000
Who else?

643
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,880
Hello

644
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,480
Sister Cai

645
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:01,840
You see

646
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,200
I thought you'd gone back to eat

647
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,760
Come on, eat quickly

648
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,120
No thanks, I'm full

649
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,920
At least have some vegetables

650
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,360
I won't eat

651
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,760
Not eating?

652
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,600
Then I won't hold back.

653
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,840
Hurry up, I'll wait.

654
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,920
I've eaten.

655
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,320
Today's meal was delicious.

656
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,040
I've already eaten.

657
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,760
It was really good.

658
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,240
I've already eaten.

659
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,880
Let me see.

660
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,480
What else is there?

661
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,120
Haven't you already eaten?

662
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,520
Why are you holding a plate?

663
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,200
I'm not eating yet, I've already eaten.

664
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
You insist on giving me a plate.

665
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,120
This squid looks good.

666
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,800
The squid is fine.

667
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,640
Right.

668
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,280
Then I'll have this.

669
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,280
Yes, there are some shrimp in it.

670
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,160
Okay.

671
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,600
Thank you.

672
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,760
I won't eat, I'm full.

673
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,480
While we were eating earlier,

674
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,280
we completely

675
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,560
figured out that you're the culprit.

676
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,400
deduced it.

677
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,000
Here we go again.

678
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,120
It's really not me.

679
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,320
You should admit it now,

680
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,440
Don't make blind judgments.

681
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,600
If you admit it later,

682
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,440
I'm telling you it might be too late.

683
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,360
Don't repeat my brother's mistake.

684
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,560
It will affect our

685
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,040
friendship.

686
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,040
Because of this,

687
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,880
he stopped talking to me.

688
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,160
Right?

689
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,880
Yes, just be careful.

690
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,280
Behave well, I'm telling you.

691
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,480
Behave well.

692
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,080
This episode really has nothing to do with me

693
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,160
I don't know

694
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,680
We were just talking

695
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,520
You must have things we don't know about

696
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,040
Right

697
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,640
He has too many

698
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,680
things we don't know about

699
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,280
Not that many actually

700
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,000
I think you know almost everything

701
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,680
You know about my father

702
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,520
right?

703
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,840
My grandfather

704
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
Stop bringing up my husband

705
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,520
Sorry

706
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,840
Who's your grandfather?

707
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,000
Zhou Cangcang

708
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Old Cang and Old Ku

709
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,400
Old Cang and Old Ku

710
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,600
Old Cang and Old Ku are his grandfather and great-uncle

711
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,440
His father

712
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,640
Drank with his father-in-law

713
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,600
When drunk, he'd curse at his father-in-law

714
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,840
I'm not close with my father at all

715
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,800
He left me when I was five

716
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,960
How would I know about him

717
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,320
Actually, it's not really related to him

718
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,720
I'm completely innocent

719
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,160
Not his great-uncle

720
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,600
It is his great-uncle

721
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,120
His dad was buddies with Old Cang and Old Ku

722
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,000
He took his buddy's daughter

723
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,240
And later married her

724
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,960
Married her

725
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,360
He married his buddy's daughter

726
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,120
And had him

727
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,400
Understand?

728
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,240
No

729
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,680
Yes

730
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,440
Yes

731
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,320
Lao Cang and Lao Ku were from earlier years

732
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,040
and knew his first wife

733
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Right

734
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,000
He ran away without divorcing me

735
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,880
What do you mean by first wife?

736
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,560
Then that's bigamy

737
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,800
He committed bigamy

738
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,440
But Lao Li

739
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,760
has been on the run

740
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,520
I kept missing him

741
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,440
But then found someone else

742
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,160
I don't miss him anymore

743
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,800
He's a traitor

744
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,720
A traitor to love

745
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,000
A heartless man

746
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,480
And he abandoned you after you were born

747
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,640
Why did he run?

748
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,840
Auntie Zhou

749
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,200
and your uncle Zhou Zengzeng

750
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,720
He didn't believe

751
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,800
that I was innocent

752
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,880
Thought I pushed your mother off the cliff

753
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,680
Moreover

754
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,320
he firmly believed that in 1988

755
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,440
I "killed" your grandfather

756
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,480
I had no choice

757
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,120
so I ran away again to investigate

758
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,800
Aren't you

759
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,520
also raised in an orphanage?

760
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,640
I was also in an orphanage

761
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,760
Me too

762
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,880
Same here

763
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,560
I was too

764
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,960
You must be too

765
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,800
You're hiding something

766
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,760
I definitely wasn't

767
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,560
You say you weren't

768
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,520
Who are your family?

769
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,800
Do you know?

770
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,680
Tell me about them

771
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,440
What are your parents' names?

772
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,560
Raised in an orphanage, your dad "died"

773
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,160
My dad didn't "die"

774
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,080
It was my mom who "died" first

775
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,480
Then my dad abandoned me

776
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,240
And never looked after me

777
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,120
We're just a group of

778
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,320
abandoned children

779
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,960
Then I was taken in by my aunt

780
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,640
And brought here

781
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,520
Her name is Auntie Zhou

782
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,080
Then she brought me here

783
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,040
Our family all have A-B-B style names

784
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,360
See, my grandfather is called

785
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,160
Zhou Cangcang

786
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,920
Zhou Kuku

787
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,760
And my mom was called Zhou Mama

788
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,440
Yes, and my aunt is called Auntie Zhou

789
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,960
I also have a little uncle

790
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,040
Called Uncle Zhou

791
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Zhou Zengzeng

792
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,240
He's not tall enough, right?

793
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,320
This Zengzeng

794
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,880
Wasn't he that Zengzeng earlier?

795
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,920
The guy who was singing, Zengzeng

796
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,120
Not that Zengzeng

797
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,520
That was

798
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,280
Teacher Zeng, I'm sorry

799
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,560
This Uncle Zeng

800
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,440
Is this Zeng Zeng?

801
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,480
He is Zeng Zeng

802
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,720
My uncle

803
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,320
Uncle, look at me

804
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,560
Is this you?

805
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,000
Uncle

806
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,000
Not that Zeng Zeng

807
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,720
Let's vote

808
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,680
It must be him, it must be him

809
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,760
Alright, let's vote directly

810
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,560
Okay, I'll submit everyone's information

811
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,680
to the relevant authorities

812
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,120
Okay

813
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,600
Relevant authorities

814
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,800
It's not me

815
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,200
Did I just realize this is involution?

816
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,160
Yes, it's possible within our group too

817
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,280
Keke, are you full?

818
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,800
I'm full

819
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,840
Now that you're full, we'll "interrogate" you

820
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,960
Eat your fill before the final journey

821
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,760
Actually

822
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,520
We all know what's going on

823
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,520
We all know what happened

824
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,480
You did it to help Sister Cai

825
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,400
That's all there is to it

826
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,560
Brother Keke

827
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,600
Nephew, don't you trust me?

828
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,560
Sister Cai

829
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,160
Our son

830
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,200
No

831
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,880
The generations are getting mixed up

832
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,320
What are you saying

833
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,240
What do you mean "our son"?

834
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,240
What a mess

835
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,840
Nephew, don't you trust me?

836
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,400
I don't

837
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:38,960
Nephew

838
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,280
I must place justice above family ties

839
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,960
Then he finished escaping

840
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,840
After fleeing

841
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,760
Finished escaping

842
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,160
"1988"

843
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Lots of river snails

844
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,880
Kept eating river snails

845
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,320
That's what he said

846
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
Back to 2022

847
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,880
Still can't speak clearly

848
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,400
Really

849
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,960
What tongue?

850
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,440
Tongue, this thick tongue

851
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,120
Twinkle twinkle little star

852
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,760
How I wonder

853
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,840
You slur your words

854
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,480
Right

855
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,080
What slurred speech?

856
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,160
Hurry up

857
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,080
Hurry up

858
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,800
He keeps rushing you

859
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,480
You're like from CrossFire

860
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,440
Hurry up

861
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,120
He's so carefree, still eating melon seeds

862
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,000
So unconcerned

863
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,360
Let's go back and figure out

864
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,760
how to get out

865
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,520
Someone opened it

866
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,600
Then changed the lock

867
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,440
Where was it just now?

868
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,000
Right in the middle

869
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,080
Look, there's a ladybug marking

870
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,360
Go

871
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:48,880
Is this the cabinet?

872
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,560
Yes

873
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:49,920
Go

874
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,800
Quick, go

875
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,480
Quick, go

876
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,040
Could it be related to that bell sound?

877
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,240
Because there's no door-kicking work today

878
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,200
He usually just says

879
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,160
"Brother Bai is here to kick the door"

880
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,120
Then he

881
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,200
His main job is physical labor

882
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,360
You mean brute force, right?

883
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,800
Yes, the physical strength aspect

884
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,480
Supporting performer

885
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,560
The most frequent reminder for him is

886
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,080
"No violent dismantling"

887
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,600
Let's go once we're done eating.

888
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,120
Let's go.

889
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,800
Go.
