1
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,720
A young girl in her prime

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,560
brutally victimized

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,680
Netizens' comments

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,200
drove Teacher Lou to "suicide"

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,920
I kidnapped her at 8 o'clock

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,400
I also stirred things up in there

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,560
framed him for it

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,840
We're all "murderers"

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,000
He's a "pervert"

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,360
Arrest him

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:31,920
Get him

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,240
You "killed" Xiao Nao

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,800
Proposing a bold hypothesis

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,880
even suspecting Xiao Jing might not be "dead"

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,960
That is quite bold

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,400
2:30 AM

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,000
What were you doing in Teng's room?

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,200
What did you talk about?

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,680
I...

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,440
Just about this matter.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,200
Then...

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,960
The day before at noon after work,

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,480
when I returned to my room,

24
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,360
I saw a note at the door.

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,200
It said they knew my secret.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,080
I thought he might be

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,200
aware of my whole situation.

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,000
I was terrified,

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,720
afraid he would tell others.

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,520
So I still wanted

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,600
to talk with him.

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,120
Then I went there.

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,360
Through the gap in the door,

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,080
I saw his feet through the glass crack.

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes, I saw his feet.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,560
When you went there,

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,680
the outer door wasn't locked, right?

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,160
Not locked.

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,240
Were there playing cards?

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,920
No playing cards.

41
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,800
What playing cards?

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,000
Definitely no playing cards.

43
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,920
What was the outcome of your talk?

44
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,120
We didn't talk.

45
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,320
I told him I came,

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,000
and he said,

47
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,880
"Go back."

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,840
Then said his throat was a bit uncomfortable.

49
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,880
I think he might have been testing me.

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,600
I kept pleading desperately,

51
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,880
I said,

52
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,480
"Bro, it's fine, I have time."

53
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,360
Then he said,

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,680
"It's fine,"

55
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,720
"Go back."

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,960
"Come again tomorrow."

57
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,480
His...

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,760
voice sounded a bit different than usual.

59
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,040
The voice changer was probably already being used

60
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,040
It was someone else

61
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,520
Right

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,920
The person who spoke with us earlier

63
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,000
was indeed Teng Zhongjie

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,960
He didn't mention anything about

65
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,560
what you did to your girlfriend

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,400
that secret from three years ago

67
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,440
He didn't bring up any of this?

68
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,960
He never asked

69
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,640
He probably

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,200
didn't even know

71
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,920
He didn't know, right

72
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,040
He didn't even know about the meeting

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,280
He didn't know this person

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,760
didn't know about this matter

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,040
The person who "killed" Teng Zhongjie

76
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,000
didn't know what Kai had done before

77
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,640
He didn't know the "dead" one was Xiao-

78
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,160
Xiao Nao

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,040
So he never expected you to come, right?

80
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,840
Because he didn't know Kai's story

81
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,640
So that means the ones before him

82
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,120
There were three people in total

83
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,680
The two before him are the most suspicious

84
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,960
If what he said is true

85
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,440
How did you get in?

86
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,560
How we got in?

87
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,120
You should change your password.

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,520
Right.

89
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,400
You just arrived, and the door lock hasn't been changed, right?

90
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,080
Why haven't you changed the password?

91
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
Your password is his father's birthday.

92
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,280
I don't have the administrator's password.

93
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,080
I don't know.

94
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,960
Wait a second, bro.

95
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,040
To be honest,

96
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,440
We've been brothers for so many years.

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,160
Is there anything

98
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,880
you still need to tell me?

99
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,320
Honestly,

100
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,920
Is something wrong?

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,640
Open your heart.

102
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,840
Yes, anything you want to confess.

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,880
Did you write that?

104
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,520
Excuse me,

105
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,680
Yes.

106
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,400
Is this photo yours, Xiao Kai?

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,960
I took this photo.

108
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,480
You took the photo?

109
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,240
Are you investigating

110
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,160
this organization called "Meet You"?

111
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,320
You know about "Meet You" too?

112
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,320
They say

113
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,480
there's some kind of magical legend.

114
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,840
What do they say?

115
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,360
What?

116
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,120
I don't know either.

117
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,400
Anyway, I'm still investigating.

118
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,160
Alright, is there anything else here?

119
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,240
If not, we should head to 703.

120
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,519
You're going to other rooms, right?

121
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,519
About what happened three years ago...

122
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,320
Keep it secret for now.

123
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,839
Impossible.

124
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,399
That won't do.

125
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,040
That's out of the question.

126
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,080
Even though we're brothers for life,

127
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,280
but...

128
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,080
this matter...

129
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,520
If you've done wrong, you must face the consequences.

130
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,040
Xiao Kai, what you did three years ago...

131
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,840
was illegal, you know that?

132
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,560
Even if it was accidental manslaughter,

133
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,160
it's still killing someone.

134
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,720
You need to turn yourself in.

135
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't worry,

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,680
I will turn myself in.

137
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,360
I've been filled with guilt these three years.

138
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,400
Then let's go check out 703.

139
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,480
The remaining room.

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,480
Brothers for life - wait for me to get out.

141
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,040
Brothers for life.

142
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,760
We'll still be brothers for life.

143
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,080
Okay.

144
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,600
We'll wait for you.

145
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,000
What's this?

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,720
Are you two planning to commit crimes together

147
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,160
or what?

148
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,120
Waiting for you to get out.

149
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,640
Let's go, we'll head to 703 then.

150
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,200
Let's go.

151
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,600
This is 703

152
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,520
Come on, open the door

153
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:09,960
Come on

154
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,400
This is your old home

155
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,040
The really wealthy one

156
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,280
The family that adopted him

157
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,680
It must be magnificent inside

158
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,800
Your place is so luxurious

159
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,160
So high-class

160
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,880
This isn't my home anymore

161
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,800
I've already moved out

162
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,560
Your former home was so upscale

163
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,360
Isn't this that thing?

164
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,160
Cao Yangguang

165
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,080
Do you like Tongtong?

166
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,080
I don't like her

167
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,520
I only like the things she wears

168
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,720
Your earrings

169
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,640
So cute

170
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,680
You're so creepy

171
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,800
I'll give them to you, I'll give you everything

172
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,040
That "pervert"

173
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,280
Let's check the rooms first

174
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,560
Check the rooms first

175
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,040
This one?

176
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,000
This first room

177
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,760
Whose room is this?

178
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,240
This is Father Cao's room.

179
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,720
Why are there so many footprints on the ground?

180
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,200
Look

181
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,840
There's a pair of shoes

182
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,960
There's actually white dust on the soles

183
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,280
Where do these footprints lead?

184
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,160
What's this?

185
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,640
What is this?

186
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,360
There's more over there

187
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,120
A silk scarf

188
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,520
Why would Mr. Cao have this kind of shawl?

189
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,480
Doesn't he have a wife?

190
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,600
"Mrs. Cao passed away"

191
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,320
I know your big secret from three years ago

192
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,200
That person at 1:30

193
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,920
1:30

194
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,400
He had an appointment with Mr. Cao

195
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,880
Mr. Cao was summoned for questioning

196
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,840
Maybe we should check next door again

197
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,200
If there's nothing special here

198
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,480
Okay

199
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,320
This is Cao Yangguang's room.

200
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,320
Do you still remember

201
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,240
that Cao Yangguang liked women's things?

202
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,560
Really, look

203
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,760
They're all women's clothing

204
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,920
So many

205
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,440
He has so many diamond rings

206
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,280
How could there be so many?

207
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,440
So many

208
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,320
Let's each take one

209
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,160
There's a note here

210
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,880
A note

211
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,800
I know your big secret from three years ago

212
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,640
It's for 12:30

213
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,640
Come to Room 205 at 12:30 to discuss in detail

214
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,960
Come on

215
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,040
This all adds up now

216
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,000
This

217
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,560
isn't

218
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,040
This person

219
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,640
Isn't this Jing?

220
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,400
Why do they have a photo together?

221
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,320
You

222
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,600
Do I look like a cuckold to you?

223
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,560
Do I look cheated on?

224
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,320
The light is blinding me

225
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,919
There's a beam of light

226
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,600
That moment

227
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,320
What was that painfully blinding thing?

228
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,799
Your gaze

229
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,720
She's really not "dead" - there's a secret

230
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,320
Zhenzhen

231
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,200
Cao Yangguang

232
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,400
To be honest, this is really "perverted"

233
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,480
There are so many stockings here

234
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,040
So is it possible that

235
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,720
a girl lives here?

236
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,800
So is it possible that

237
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,360
a girl lives here?

238
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,480
So many stockings

239
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,680
Isn't this Jing?

240
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,320
Is it possible that

241
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,640
Jing has been living with him all along?

242
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,920
If Jing didn't "die"

243
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,840
then where did she go? Why is she hiding?

244
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,160
How about we go take a look outside?

245
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,400
This cabinet has

246
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,320
What's that sound?

247
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,480
There's someone here

248
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,280
She's scratching the wall

249
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,520
Who's trapped inside?

250
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,000
Right

251
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,120
But it looks like

252
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,320
it's a girl's hand

253
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,120
Jingjing

254
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,440
Jingjing

255
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,200
Jingjing is locked in here

256
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,920
Jingjing

257
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,440
Jingjing, is that you?

258
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,080
I'm here

259
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,760
Jing

260
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,160
Jing, your ex-boyfriend is here

261
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,320
Coming, I'm coming

262
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,000
Can we crawl under this?

263
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,600
No

264
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,160
That cabinet

265
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,480
This box is a mechanism

266
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,880
Can the box be moved?

267
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,680
This box can move

268
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,240
It moved

269
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,480
Stay away

270
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,000
Don't

271
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,440
Don't go over there

272
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,400
It's me, me, me

273
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,280
Jingjing

274
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,200
Stay back

275
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,600
Don't come closer

276
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,000
Wait a moment

277
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,800
It seems Jingjing's mental state

278
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,520
isn't very good

279
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,840
Either a pretty girl

280
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,680
Right, you comfort her

281
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,240
Does she have some issues with us?

282
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,680
Hello

283
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,200
Afraid

284
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,920
Don't touch me

285
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,840
Alright

286
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,640
It's okay now

287
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,200
Won't touch you

288
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,560
No problem now

289
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,360
It's fine now

290
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,200
I'll push this over to you

291
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,320
Everything's fine now

292
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Did someone trap you here?

293
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,080
Get me out

294
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,760
You can leave

295
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,080
Look, the door's open now

296
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,840
You can go out now

297
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,360
You can come out now

298
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,680
I'm scared

299
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,680
It's okay

300
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
There we go

301
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,440
Alright

302
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,080
This isn't

303
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,960
Tuishi University

304
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,400
Why are they all torn?

305
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,320
There are plates here too

306
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,040
So the food is here as well

307
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,520
Meaning she lives here

308
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,120
Right

309
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,600
Why are there rose petals all over the floor?

310
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,920
It's like

311
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,240
Like a little fairy

312
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,200
Is that how someone shows love for her?

313
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
Someone has imprisoned her here

314
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,000
Someone is keeping her captive here

315
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,280
Don't come any closer.

316
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,520
Don't do anything yet, wait a moment, just wait

317
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,160
Let's go outside and let her calm down

318
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,880
Alright

319
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,760
You two talk privately

320
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
You two talk alone first

321
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,080
Comfort her properly

322
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,000
Come on, let's go

323
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,760
Okay

324
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,800
Help me

325
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,280
I'll help you

326
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,520
You'll be out soon

327
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
It's okay

328
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,600
Alright

329
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,880
Hello, is this the infirmary?

330
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,200
Yes

331
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,720
Can you come to room 703?

332
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,680
Yes, there's someone here

333
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,560
Who's not feeling well

334
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
You all

335
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,120
Help me

336
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,960
No, get a jacket

337
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,800
Get some shoes

338
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,840
Will this clothing work?

339
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,040
Is this thick enough?

340
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,800
Find a scarf

341
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,360
Scarf

342
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,400
Here

343
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,160
Is this it?

344
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes

345
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,360
I'll take it to her to try

346
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,440
Go ahead

347
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,800
Take this

348
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,520
No

349
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay

350
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,520
Give it to me

351
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,640
Just throw it to me

352
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,040
Alright

353
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,280
Uh

354
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,120
I'll leave my slippers here

355
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,800
Can you grab them?

356
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,240
Okay

357
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,040
Put on some clothes first, your hands are so cold

358
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,760
There

359
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,520
Okay, put this on first

360
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,680
You're completely safe now

361
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,600
Have you been locked up for a long time?

362
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,080
Are you afraid of men?

363
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,000
It's okay now.

364
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's alright.

365
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,480
Everything's fine now.

366
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,680
It's okay, it'll be done soon.

367
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,400
Look at the clues.

368
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,360
Come, take a look.

369
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,000
This...

370
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,600
Look.

371
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,480
Come here.

372
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,480
Take a look at this notebook.

373
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,360
Read the first one.

374
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,080
Today is another happy Tuesday.

375
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,960
Since Teacher Lou agreed...

376
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,840
to tutor me every Tuesday...

377
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,120
I feel like I'm improving rapidly.

378
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,960
Big thumbs up for Teacher Lou.

379
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,080
And a thumbs up for my hard work too.

380
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,720
July 16th.

381
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,640
This was after several lessons...

382
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,880
It was the second Tuesday again.

383
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,640
Today I arrived early at Teacher Lou's place...

384
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,400
but accidentally saw...

385
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Teacher Lou wearing women's clothes.

386
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,440
It gave me quite a shock.

387
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,360
I immediately ran away.

388
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,320
I told Teacher Lou's secret...

389
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,360
to Guo Guo.

390
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,720
He comforted me, saying not to worry...

391
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,120
and that he would always protect me.

392
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,880
I told you...

393
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,160
Yes, that very day.

394
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,200
July 23rd

395
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,720
This

396
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Something terrifying happened

397
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,120
I was robbed in the grove

398
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,440
Although the three robbers

399
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
didn't physically hurt me

400
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,600
I was still terrified

401
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,400
If Guoguo had been here today

402
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,680
he would have protected me

403
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,080
My classmate who invited me lives nearby

404
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,400
so I went straight to their place

405
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,640
Seeing how shaken I was

406
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,000
and unable to reach my parents

407
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,800
I stayed overnight to recover

408
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,640
July 30th

409
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,720
Whose house is she at?

410
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,200
Xiaojing

411
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,360
During last rehearsal at my place

412
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,560
we couldn't get one melody right

413
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,200
before you all left

414
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,080
I've been thinking about it since

415
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,200
and finally found the mistake

416
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,480
Our performance is tomorrow

417
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,680
Come to my place tonight

418
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,520
to fix this issue

419
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,600
I'll be waiting

420
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,480
He tricked Xiaojing into coming

421
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,040
Cao Yangguang

422
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,760
Then

423
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,480
I was locked in a house

424
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,800
He's a "pervert"

425
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,120
He said this was the safest place

426
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,080
No bad people could hurt me here

427
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,920
He's so terrifying

428
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,400
Why

429
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,520
No one could hear my cries for help

430
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,560
Why, Guoguo

431
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,880
Why didn't mom and dad

432
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,200
come looking for me

433
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,400
July 31st

434
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,040
How many years

435
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,960
I've been imprisoned for three years

436
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,720
Then I drew a crying

437
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,400
version of myself

438
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
So many tears

439
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,000
Tears

440
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,120
Why is nobody

441
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,760
Everything is tears

442
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,400
coming to save me

443
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,040
Save me

444
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,520
I've been abandoned here

445
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,640
I'm abandoned here

446
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,000
Crying

447
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,520
Crying every day

448
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,800
When will you let me go

449
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,360
Wait, will that person come back

450
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,680
If he comes back I'll tackle him

451
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,480
Beat him up first

452
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,520
If he returns I'll beat him badly

453
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,920
Just viciously beat him up

454
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,360
"Pervert"

455
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,360
Good insult

456
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,640
Makes me so angry

457
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,240
I can't stand it anymore

458
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,400
She's been imprisoned

459
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,560
No wonder nobody's looking for Xiaojing

460
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,120
Because they think she's "dead"

461
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,560
Right

462
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,240
This is too "perverted"

463
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,400
Seriously, who could handle this?

464
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,160
Locked up for three years

465
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,680
Three years in confinement

466
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,599
Imprisoned for three years

467
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,560
My mind would completely break

468
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,640
I wouldn't even be able to speak, I think

469
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,160
Wait, there's another issue

470
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,839
About this Cao Yangguang matter

471
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,560
Zhenzhen also discovered it

472
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,599
Didn't she secretly record Cao Yangguang

473
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,040
You know, that one

474
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,880
Right?

475
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,000
The high heels video

476
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,000
He stopped talking

477
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,600
That day I had a big secret

478
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,320
If she finds out my real secret

479
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,880
Then everything would be over

480
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,720
No, we just want to know

481
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,000
What the real secret is

482
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,680
If a secret is told

483
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,840
can it still be called a secret?

484
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,000
Do you still remember Guo Baoyou?

485
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,680
You'll get to see him soon.

486
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,240
So you'll be completely safe now.

487
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Let's go to the infirmary now, okay?

488
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,040
We can leave after going to the infirmary.

489
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,680
Okay, let's go.

490
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,240
She's coming out.

491
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,800
She's coming out.

492
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,200
Be careful.

493
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,840
Alright.

494
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,000
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

495
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,480
Be careful.

496
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Don't be afraid.

497
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,560
The infirmary staff.

498
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,360
should be coming soon.

499
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,520
Or you two can go out first.

500
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:13,920
Okay.

501
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,720
Wait at the door.

502
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,520
Okay.

503
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,680
Let me walk you both out.

504
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,880
No need.

505
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,480
No need.

506
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,280
Do you remember this?

507
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,240
Are we out now?

508
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,440
Are we safe now?

509
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,280
Thank you.

510
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,880
It's nothing.

511
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,360
It's alright now.

512
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,720
What should I do?

513
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,760
I came to pick her up and comfort her.

514
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,760
Thank you.

515
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,320
No problem.

516
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,520
That's so scary, you know

517
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,880
Just now, two of us were sitting here with her

518
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,920
I was really scared

519
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,760
Yeah, because you never know

520
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
what might happen

521
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,400
You know if someone

522
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,480
locks you in a place like this

523
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,400
it's truly terrifying

524
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,640
Let's check

525
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,960
if there's anything in these flowers

526
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,400
Could it be...

527
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,040
What's the meaning of this plastic sheet?

528
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,680
Soundproofing, right?

529
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,280
Her cries

530
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,200
might travel through the hallway

531
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,600
or the pipes

532
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,200
The woman in our building is crying

533
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,120
Crying sounds

534
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,240
What?

535
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,600
Why is there a woman crying?

536
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,680
This Apartment No. 11

537
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,840
has always been strange

538
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,800
I always hear at midnight

539
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
a woman's crying sounds

540
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,960
I got goosebumps all over.

541
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,720
This is so uncomfortable.

542
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,280
Keke, you've heard it at your place too, right?

543
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,400
Yes, I've heard it.

544
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,600
So...

545
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,000
It was Xiaojing all along.

546
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,680
This "pervert".

547
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,600
Three years...

548
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,120
Why?

549
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,040
Everyone we met today has such tragic stories.

550
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,960
And the worst is...

551
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Teacher Lou didn't do anything wrong.

552
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,720
Then this Cao Yangguang was hiding behind.

553
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,760
He really deserves to "die".

554
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
This person, really...

555
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,880
Can't stand it, makes me furious.

556
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,400
Yes.

557
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,960
Looking at it this way...

558
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,120
Cao's father must know about this.

559
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,160
So who specifically "killed" Teng the agent?

560
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,920
It could be Cao Yangguang.

561
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,720
Or maybe his father.

562
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,200
Taking care of it for his son.

563
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,960
Both are possible.

564
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,160
What does this have to do with Teng the agent?

565
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
Teng the agent probably knew...

566
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,520
His secret from three years ago.

567
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,800
So is his father covering for him?

568
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,360
Possibly.

569
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,960
Because today Teng the agent arranged to meet...

570
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,720
Actually both Cao Yangguang and his father.

571
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,800
These two people's "motives for murder"...

572
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,680
Are very plausible.

573
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,440
If both of them...

574
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,800
knew about this matter...

575
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,080
They would both have...

576
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,440
The same logic for "killing" Teng the agent.

577
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,120
Today they could have worked together.

578
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,520
Right.

579
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,560
Let's go, we'll discuss this outside.

580
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,120
The six of us

581
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,400
Plus these two, father and son

582
00:21:59,400 --> 00:21:59,720
Right

583
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,960
There are eight of us in total

584
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,440
They don't know about Xiao Kai's situation

585
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,880
Does Cao Yangguang know about it?

586
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,280
Isn't he following Xiao Jing?

587
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,240
Wait, is that guy going to come back?

588
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,760
If he comes back, pin him down.

589
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,400
Then beat him up good.

590
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,920
Can't stand it—such a hot temper.

591
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,040
I can't just stand by anymore.

592
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,280
We'll have to take action soon, right?

593
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,240
What's wrong with you two?

594
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,960
What's going on?

595
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,800
Is it you?

596
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,240
What are you doing here?

597
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,800
What are you up to?

598
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,840
Who let you in?

599
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,080
Who allowed you into my house?

600
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,360
Who gave you permission?

601
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,560
You're illegally detaining me.

602
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,360
Why are you shouting?

603
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,080
You started yelling first.

604
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,760
You barged into my home

605
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,880
without any permission.

606
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,680
And now you're shouting at me?

607
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,720
Then go ahead and call the police.

608
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,120
Look at this room, you know?

609
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,960
Go inside and take a look.

610
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,040
Come on, just take a quick look inside.

611
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,480
Have a look.

612
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,040
What was this place used for before?

613
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Is this for growing flowers?

614
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,000
Can't I use it to store my alcohol?

615
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,680
For alcohol.

616
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,240
Where's the alcohol then?

617
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,400
I drank it.

618
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,440
There's a bed and a person inside.

619
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,520
Can't I sleep in there?

620
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,000
I like alcohol.

621
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Can't I live with my alcohol?

622
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That skirt of yours...

623
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,640
Is that clothing inside yours?

624
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,520
Skirt.

625
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,280
Like wearing skirts.

626
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,440
Do you like wearing skirts?

627
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,560
Like wearing high heels.

628
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,200
That's fine.

629
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,720
It's hereditary, all hereditary, right?

630
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,480
Yes.

631
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Right, it's hereditary.

632
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,840
Is that not allowed?

633
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,600
No one said it's not allowed.

634
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,320
Because this now involves...

635
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,800
A very important "homicide case."

636
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,880
I believe you're reasonable people.

637
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,280
We hope you can cooperate with us.

638
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,400
Let's go to two rooms first.

639
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,240
We'll separately...

640
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,880
Ask you some questions.

641
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,240
As for our illegal entry...

642
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,520
We apologize first.

643
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,920
We were indeed in the wrong.

644
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,440
But...

645
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,280
The more important matter is...

646
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,640
To solve this "homicide case" first.

647
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,480
How about we sit down and talk?

648
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,560
Very clear and logical.

649
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,720
Come on, you go over there.

650
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,200
Go wait over there.

651
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Let's ask one question together first.

652
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,320
Ask one together.

653
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,000
First, let's ask one together.

654
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,760
This guy is too fierce.

655
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,040
Cao Yangguang, I'll watch him first.

656
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,760
Don't move around.

657
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
We hope you can cooperate with us.

658
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,520
Go

659
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,680
I know who you are

660
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,720
And suddenly figured it out

661
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,280
He knows

662
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,440
You guys are that...

663
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,160
what Yang Guang called a complete mess, right?

664
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,080
Yeah

665
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,400
Yes.

666
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,120
What exactly are you trying to do?

667
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,560
Can't you just let people

668
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,560
live in peace and quiet?

669
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,840
Inside this building,

670
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,920
you've turned everything

671
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,680
Where are you going?

672
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,640
into complete chaos.

673
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,480
Don't you know?

674
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,840
It's already in complete chaos.

675
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,600
Yet you're still laughing.

676
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,640
That wasn't given for free.

677
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,680
Given for free.

678
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,160
Free of charge.

679
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,640
Complaining about free stuff?

680
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,200
A few months ago,

681
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,720
because something happened in that theater,

682
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,880
someone

683
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,200
"died."

684
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,320
you started suspecting my son Yangguang,

685
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,720
right?

686
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,520
Anyway, the things I want,

687
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,160
I always get them in the end.

688
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,680
Can't have her

689
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,920
So you just want to "kill" her, is that it?

690
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,160
Then it's not so certain

691
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,680
And then what?

692
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,680
Was the matter resolved?

693
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,200
Let him go

694
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,160
But do you know what followed?

695
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,720
What kind of harm it caused?

696
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,800
My son at school

697
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,440
Gets pointed at and gossiped about daily

698
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Subject to endless rumors

699
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,160
Have any of you been parents?

700
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,040
Try seeing it from another perspective

701
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,120
Can you feel that visceral pain?

702
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,760
If I had such a child

703
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,200
I would've strangled them to "death" long ago

704
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,800
You know?

705
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,840
Can you understand other parents

706
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,560
When your child

707
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,040
Imprisons another family's child

708
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,400
Do you think that's appropriate?

709
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,320
This wasn't just one or two years

710
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,920
Three years ago

711
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,120
Right

712
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,000
Alright, one at a time

713
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,160
Fine, since I'm sitting here

714
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,080
What exactly do you want to ask?

715
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,520
Go ahead

716
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,040
First

717
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,160
You know Teng Zhongjie, right?

718
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,280
Teng Zhongjie

719
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,760
I know.

720
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,160
He left this at your doorstep, didn't he?

721
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,120
He knows your big secret from three years ago.

722
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,320
Yes

723
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,320
What secret from three years ago

724
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,280
Teng Zhongjie is now "dead"

725
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,000
He is "dead"

726
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,520
Yes.

727
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,560
When did this happen?

728
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,920
When was the last time you saw him?

729
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,160
He invited me to his room at 1:30 AM on the 29th.

730
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,360
He asked me to come to his room.

731
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,680
But I went.

732
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,520
I saw him again.

733
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,480
But I didn't see him again.

734
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,720
Because I only saw one of his feet

735
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,040
He was lying on the bed

736
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,520
I thought he wanted to tell me something

737
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,560
But when I got there, he just said

738
00:26:59,400 --> 00:26:59,960
He was tired

739
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,080
He didn’t want to talk anymore

740
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,160
I asked, "Are you sure?"

741
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,040
I kept asking him

742
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,000
He said, "I’m sure, I’m tired."

743
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,960
So I came back

744
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,040
When you met with Teng the agent

745
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,400
Did you

746
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,040
When he was talking to you

747
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,240
Did he seem different than usual?

748
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,760
His tone

749
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,480
or tone

750
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,160
or voice

751
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:17,920
No

752
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,360
Anyway, it's his voice

753
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:20,760
Right

754
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,280
So this big secret from three years ago

755
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,760
what is it?

756
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,640
Alright, I'll tell you the truth

757
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,680
I think

758
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,520
the secret he knew

759
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,760
was probably that he found out

760
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,640
I locked Xiaojing here

761
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,360
It was me who imprisoned Xiaojing

762
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,320
Not him? It was you?

763
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,400
Yes, I did it

764
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,400
It happened one day three years ago

765
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,280
Which specific day?

766
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:52,840
Let me check

767
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,800
July 30th

768
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,200
Yes

769
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,160
On that day

770
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,720
Xiaojing came over for rehearsal

771
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,400
But on her way here

772
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,080
she got robbed

773
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,120
After being robbed

774
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
she was too scared to go back

775
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,360
so she stayed overnight at our place

776
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,680
Yangguang and I slept in this bed

777
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,240
She was in that room

778
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,400
Then I locked her inside

779
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,760
That's all there is to it

780
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,560
Why did you lock her up?

781
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,080
Right.

782
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,240
You locked her inside.

783
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,560
Yes, why did you lock her up?

784
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
Can't I just like her?

785
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,480
You're seriously messed up.

786
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,400
She's...

787
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,800
She's just a female student.

788
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,960
A classmate who liked your son.

789
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,080
Locked up for three years.

790
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,080
Do you realize your actions...

791
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,240
are much worse than ours?

792
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,440
Do you think that kind of environment...

793
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:35,960
can be called confinement?

794
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,560
I gave her good food and care.

795
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,640
Flowers too, and a bed.

796
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,440
She couldn't even see the sun, uncle.

797
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,160
Why don't you live there yourself?

798
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,760
Your son is a child,

799
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,040
but she isn't?

800
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,880
Doesn't she have parents?

801
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,760
Xiao Jing has parents too.

802
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,720
He...

803
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:52,920
It's also possible...

804
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,480
he's making excuses for his own child.

805
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,560
Right, for his son, that's possible.

806
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,760
Because he loves his child very much.

807
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,120
Right.

808
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,400
I've already revealed the answer

809
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,040
to you all

810
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,200
What more are you trying to deduce?

811
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,280
It's true that I imprisoned Xiaojing

812
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,840
How did you imprison her?

813
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,600
Right, you couldn't have invited her out

814
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,560
What evidence do you have?

815
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,200
We need to see evidence

816
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,520
It was Yangguang who invited Xiaojing

817
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,360
saying "let's rehearse together"

818
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,360
then kept her at your place against her will

819
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,080
Defending your son at this point

820
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,280
is completely meaningless

821
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,560
Taking the blame for him

822
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,120
I'm not defending him

823
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,760
Yangguang couldn't have known

824
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,960
about me imprisoning Xiaojing

825
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,200
There's no way he didn't know

826
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,000
He lived with you for three years

827
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,040
She was locked up during those three years

828
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,320
We discovered it within a day

829
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,480
Yet he didn't notice in three years?

830
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,600
Ever since my son Yangguang

831
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,280
became independent

832
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,840
we rarely interfered in each other's lives

833
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,920
Besides, this door was sealed shut

834
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
The crying

835
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,000
and scratching at the walls

836
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,800
constant scratching at the walls

837
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,240
Your son

838
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,560
If you don't lock him up soon

839
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,160
and discipline him

840
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,760
he might even "kill" you someday

841
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,400
I

842
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,840
When I imprisoned Xiaojing

843
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,120
no one really knew

844
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,760
And back then

845
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,680
it wasn't just me at home

846
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,480
along with my son Yangguang

847
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,720
and my adopted son Yueguang

848
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,800
Even he didn't know

849
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,600
Bro, he's right here

850
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,000
This is Yueguang

851
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,720
Yueguang

852
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,280
Otherwise, how do you think we got in?

853
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,400
Hello, Uncle

854
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,200
Impossible

855
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,440
How can he be Cao Yueguang?

856
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,600
It is Yueguang

857
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,720
Yes, it's me

858
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,400
I had plastic surgery

859
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,680
I've recently changed my appearance

860
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,880
He knows your passcode

861
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,160
So this house

862
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,520
The reason we have the right to enter is

863
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,560
because this house

864
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,720
partially belongs to Mother Cao

865
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,840
Wait, you're—

866
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,120
Your voice does sound familiar

867
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,680
That's right

868
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,920
But now it doesn't as much

869
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,600
What is this?

870
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,880
It's me

871
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,640
Yes, it's really me

872
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,080
After searching far and wide

873
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,320
I finally run into you here

874
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:47,840
Pay me back

875
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:49,960
Give me my money

876
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,320
We'll settle our family grudges later

877
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,920
This is your room, right?

878
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,960
This is my room.

879
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,600
Why is there a silk scarf in your room?

880
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,080
Whose is it?

881
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,800
Let me answer for him.

882
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,200
Xiao Jing usually likes to wear it.

883
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,040
So I kept it here.

884
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,120
Because I like Xiao Jing.

885
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,240
Doesn't that make perfect sense?

886
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,240
What are you still trying to deduce?

887
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,000
I've already given you the answer.

888
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,240
Just believe me.

889
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,240
Having a woman's scarf is perfectly normal.

890
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,120
That belongs to my wife.

891
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,960
Although she's already "dead."

892
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,000
Uncle, you explain first.

893
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,360
What's with your shoes?

894
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,160
Are these shoes yours?

895
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,200
Yes, these shoes are...

896
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,440
Where have these been?

897
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:36,920
Right.

898
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,840
These are from when I imprisoned Xiao Jing.

899
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,560
They were left behind.

900
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,800
In his room, there was...

901
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,840
Powder scattered on the floor.

902
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,360
Just look at the lower right corner of the bed.

903
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,000
Right?

904
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,040
It's him.

905
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,720
So he must be the one coming and going regularly.

906
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,480
At least he knows about this.

907
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,800
Any more questions?

908
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,200
If not,

909
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,040
we can head over there.

910
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,080
That's about it, next one.

911
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,760
Let's find his son.

912
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,120
Right.

913
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,560
No,

914
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,080
I want to stay away from this uncle.

915
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,240
I'm scared of him.

916
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,560
This uncle is really scary.

917
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,240
Come

918
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,840
Brothers, come in

919
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,200
Beat him up

920
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,560
Ke Wuku

921
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,040
Let's block that camera

922
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,360
Ready

923
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,240
Let's beat him up first

924
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,440
Just give him a brutal beating

925
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,080
Pervert

926
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,120
Calm down

927
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,840
Calm down

928
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,920
How can you expect us to stay calm?

929
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,880
Come on, tell me

930
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,280
How did you come up with

931
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,960
the idea of locking Xiao Jing in that room?

932
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,800
Actually, I don't think

933
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,360
it counts as locking her up

934
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,040
I was just

935
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,160
protecting her

936
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,080
Keeping her safe

937
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,760
Then who was hurting her?

938
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,200
I don't know if anyone was hurting her

939
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Then why were you protecting her?

940
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,240
What were you protecting her from?

941
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,880
Nothing

942
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,360
I just put her in my room

943
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,120
And then gave her

944
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,080
all the prettiest clothes

945
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,840
and the most beautiful jewelry

946
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,360
I just want her to be beautiful

947
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,159
That would make me very happy

948
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,400
Why don't you just buy a doll

949
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,080
Wouldn't that be better?

950
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,639
A doll

951
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,120
Yes

952
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:24,880
It's not the same

953
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,800
Xiao Jing is...

954
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,480
Alive

955
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,360
She can move

956
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,280
She has thoughts

957
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,360
She can communicate

958
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,000
No, she's mine

959
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,520
She's the most

960
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
perfect thing in this world

961
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,400
Thing

962
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,239
So "perverted"

963
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,080
On the evening of July 30th,

964
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,560
you saw Xiaojing being robbed

965
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,080
and then you decided to take her to your home

966
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,760
Actually, here's what really happened

967
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,760
At that time, I was the one who invited her to my place

968
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,640
But

969
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,680
when she appeared at my door

970
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,560
she was

971
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,560
disheveled

972
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,200
looking like she'd just been through something terrible

973
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,280
She urgently told me

974
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,960
that she had been robbed

975
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,520
Her jade necklace,

976
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,200
jade

977
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,280
bracelet and other things

978
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,560
had all been stolen

979
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,280
Then she asked me

980
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,640
if I could accompany her back to the scene

981
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,240
to take a look

982
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,400
I hadn't expected

983
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,560
her to appear in that condition

984
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,680
So at that moment I

985
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,040
wanted her to calm down first

986
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,040
Then I pretended

987
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,200
to contact her parents

988
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,640
but I never actually contacted them

989
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,360
Instead, I gave her

990
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,720
the sleeping pills I'd prepared

991
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,280
for her to drink

992
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,400
I drugged her directly

993
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,280
I just wanted her

994
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,440
to get some proper sleep

995
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,320
because she seemed so frightened

996
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,080
Why didn't you let her leave after waking up?

997
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,920
(Why keep her confined?)

998
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,880
Because

999
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,440
the outside world is too dangerous

1000
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,760
I didn't want her to

1001
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,200
get hurt like that again

1002
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,160
So you can endure danger outside

1003
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,440
You can

1004
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,120
That day after you drugged her, it was over for you

1005
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,360
You just stayed at home

1006
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,400
Yes, that day I gave her sleeping pills

1007
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,800
After making her quiet for a while

1008
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,920
The next day

1009
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,400
Actually, I

1010
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,720
Suddenly saw a news report

1011
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,280
The news said

1012
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,240
In the grove

1013
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,880
Then it was about Xiaojing

1014
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,120
She had been

1015
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,840
"Murdered"

1016
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,720
Because perhaps her belongings

1017
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,440
Were left at the scene

1018
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,880
So the police at that time

1019
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,240
Determined it was her "death"

1020
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,600
I think at that moment

1021
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,240
Everything aligned perfectly

1022
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,440
Perfect timing and conditions

1023
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,200
You're imprisoning her

1024
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,000
Before locking her up

1025
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,280
did you consider the consequences?

1026
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,880
I just wanted to protect her

1027
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,240
Who do you think you are?

1028
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,960
Look at Xiao Jing's current mental state

1029
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,560
It's come to this

1030
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,760
Do you really think this is protection?

1031
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,600
But I think she's fine

1032
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
She wears the most beautiful clothes every day

1033
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,800
And the prettiest jewelry

1034
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,360
Until she had her mental breakdown

1035
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,000
She was still fine

1036
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,600
Crying every day

1037
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,680
Screaming every day

1038
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,000
Afraid of everyone she sees

1039
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,480
"Stay away!"

1040
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,640
Can't you hear her crying?

1041
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,840
I've never heard her cry

1042
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,160
Can't you tell crying from laughter?

1043
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,240
When you bring her meals

1044
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,080
She rushes at you

1045
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,760
And hugs you

1046
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,640
Saying "thank you," right?

1047
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,200
No, I would...

1048
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,080
Whenever she's upset

1049
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,880
I always comfort her

1050
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,640
I tell her

1051
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,680
"The outside world is too dangerous"

1052
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,520
"Don't let her go out"

1053
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,880
Haven't you noticed the more you comfort her

1054
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,920
The harder she cries?

1055
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,800
I'll make sure she gets proper rest.

1056
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,160
He drugged Xiao Jing.

1057
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,680
You're restricting her personal freedom

1058
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,560
by doing this

1059
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,200
You're breaking the law, you know that?

1060
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm speechless about what he did

1061
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,000
I just don't even know

1062
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,680
how to even explain this

1063
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,360
When you prepared this room,

1064
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,040
did your father know about it?

1065
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,200
He...

1066
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,240
probably didn't know.

1067
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,400
I never brought it up myself,

1068
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:47,880
but I'm not sure

1069
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,080
if he might have discovered it by chance.

1070
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,160
We never discussed this matter.

1071
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,840
We could hear girls crying

1072
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,200
from next door or other floors.

1073
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,480
Hasn't your father ever heard them?

1074
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,000
I don't know.

1075
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,920
Let's not talk about Xiaojing for now, let's talk about Teng the agent.

1076
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,200
Okay.

1077
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,680
You know him, right? Teng the agent.

1078
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,440
I know him.

1079
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,720
When was the last time you saw him?

1080
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,880
The last time I saw him was...

1081
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,760
At around...

1082
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,400
12:30 AM.

1083
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,640
Why did you go to see him?

1084
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,160
Well...

1085
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,520
Yesterday afternoon,

1086
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,520
I found a note at my door.

1087
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,680
It was from Teng the agent,

1088
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,920
saying he knew something.

1089
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,120
He told me to meet him

1090
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,320
at 12:30 AM.

1091
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,240
So I went.

1092
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,680
What did you talk about?

1093
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,560
When I got there at night,

1094
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,520
At first,

1095
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,320
I entered a room,

1096
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,240
but he wasn't there.

1097
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,800
There was an inner room,

1098
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,200
and I saw the light was on.

1099
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,920
I could only see through a small window,

1100
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,560
and I saw...

1101
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,240
him.

1102
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,720
I could only see him

1103
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,920
up to about his legs.

1104
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,760
Then I asked him,

1105
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,680
"Why did you ask me to come?"

1106
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,680
"What do you know?"

1107
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,160
He said...

1108
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,560
he was very tired that day

1109
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,200
and told me to go back first.

1110
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,120
He said he might talk to me again in a few days.

1111
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,040
Actually, at that time,

1112
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,520
I still wanted to keep asking him,

1113
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,760
because I was afraid he knew

1114
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,200
about me and Xiaojing.

1115
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,240
But then I thought,

1116
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,280
I didn't really hurt her.

1117
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,000
I just protected her.

1118
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,200
I didn't think

1119
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,160
I did anything wrong.

1120
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,160
So I left.

1121
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,000
Teng Zhongjie's voice

1122
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,440
Is there any difference from before?

1123
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,840
I haven't noticed any difference

1124
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,720
Because Teng Zhongjie and I

1125
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,800
aren't actually that close

1126
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,000
Yes, Guo Baoyou

1127
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Did you just see a photo of

1128
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,440
Zhenzhen with him?

1129
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,280
Yes, why did you

1130
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,960
secretly take photos of our Zhenzhen?

1131
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,520
Zhenzhen is his girlfriend

1132
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,120
Tongtong

1133
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,000
What?

1134
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,480
Tongtong, yes

1135
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,000
Tongtong

1136
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,640
In his memory, she's called Tongtong

1137
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,840
Because a few days ago during rehearsal

1138
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,320
I happened to see her

1139
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,200
The last time we met

1140
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,680
Didn't you say

1141
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,520
she had already "died"?

1142
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,960
But do you know

1143
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,760
that the person you like has "died"?

1144
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,720
The person I like has "died"

1145
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,040
Do you like Tongtong?

1146
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,200
I don't like her

1147
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,480
Because the person you said "died"

1148
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,440
I actually saw again

1149
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,160
I found it very strange

1150
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,680
So I casually took a photo

1151
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,760
So kid

1152
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,040
First, you broke the law

1153
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,440
We'll have to punish you on behalf of the law

1154
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,000
This calls for hands-on action

1155
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,960
His behavior counts as

1156
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,960
real interaction, right?

1157
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Everyone, hold back

1158
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,800
Regarding the Cao family situation

1159
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
I'll definitely report it to the authorities

1160
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,600
We should let the law punish them

1161
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,280
Yes

1162
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,960
Right

1163
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,880
How about we go to the restaurant next

1164
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,920
to discuss

1165
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,400
If there's nothing else

1166
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,280
please leave for now

1167
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,320
Because I don't really like

1168
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,720
having other people's scents in my room

1169
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,240
You don't like having people in your room

1170
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,360
What are you talking about?

1171
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:26,960
Let's go

1172
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,200
Then let's go to the restaurant to discuss

1173
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,280
Run

1174
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,640
Actually, this is really terrifying

1175
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,280
Creepy as hell

1176
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,040
Extremely uncomfortable

1177
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,000
Can't open my mouth, can't speak

1178
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,520
Right?

1179
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,040
Yeah

1180
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,280
Let's discuss this together

1181
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,400
There's another big problem

1182
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,160
Do you know what it is?

1183
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,960
What?

1184
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,880
The playing cards at his door

1185
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,680
We still haven't figured them out

1186
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,160
Right

1187
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,560
Those playing cards

1188
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,080
Can only be arranged from inside the room

1189
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,600
Correct

1190
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,320
Unless that net below

1191
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,120
Can be taken down

1192
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,640
Didn't you say you had liquid nitrogen?

1193
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,520
Didn't you mention having liquid nitrogen?

1194
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,800
Can't liquid nitrogen freeze the playing cards

1195
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,640
in place?

1196
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,040
Then we can leave.

1197
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,640
After the liquid nitrogen evaporates,

1198
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,040
Once the liquid nitrogen dissipates,

1199
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,640
after it's gone,

1200
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,960
only the empty playing cards remain.

1201
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,600
This would create

1202
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,200
the illusion no one came out.

1203
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,600
Liquid nitrogen provides instant freezing,

1204
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,240
but currently we

1205
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,640
never studied chemistry properly.

1206
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,720
It's like being flash-frozen.

1207
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,400
The liquid nitrogen would fix them

1208
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,280
and bond them together.

1209
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,680
Then we'd spray it "pshh" -

1210
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,400
Say this represents the door,

1211
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,680
we'd arrange it like this,

1212
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,440
so the door can still open.

1213
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,640
Because they're bonded to it.

1214
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,120
But when opening/closing,

1215
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,040
wouldn't the cards move?

1216
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,000
No, they're stuck to the door.

1217
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,120
They're all bonded together.

1218
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,640
The card edges would be

1219
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,480
clamped to the door like this.

1220
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,560
So the door can operate

1221
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,600
while they remain attached.

1222
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,760
After it evaporates,

1223
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,120
they'd separate here.

1224
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,560
Right.

1225
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,120
Got it.

1226
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,960
What's the purpose?

1227
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,280
Basically,

1228
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,400
to make Officer He believe

1229
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,920
that no one entered before.

1230
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,520
When he opens the door,

1231
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,000
finding cards standing there

1232
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,800
would suggest

1233
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,880
no killer could have exited.

1234
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,200
There's one more important point

1235
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,040
On their wall, it wasn't us

1236
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,680
It was several of us

1237
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,200
And underneath, didn't you also find their

1238
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:22,840
There was also something torn off

1239
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,320
And a poster was missing

1240
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,360
We found a piece of paper

1241
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,840
This was probably torn off

1242
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,520
We couldn't see if something was pasted underneath

1243
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,560
Possibly

1244
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,880
It's among these three people

1245
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,240
One or two of them

1246
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,160
are probably helping to cover something up

1247
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,880
Let's discuss

1248
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,040
who exactly

1249
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,840
might be the one who "killed" Teng Zhongjie

1250
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,280
the "murderer"

1251
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,520
There are quite a few suspects now

1252
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,400
Nine suspects like this

1253
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,520
Today's "victim"

1254
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,360
is our Teng Zhongjie, right?

1255
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,640
The suspects in order of entry

1256
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,240
let's write them down

1257
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:56,840
Bai

1258
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,160
Bai

1259
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,240
Song

1260
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,240
Guo

1261
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,160
Liu

1262
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:00,920
Zhou

1263
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,280
then Ke

1264
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,160
then Yangguang

1265
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,440
Yang's dad

1266
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,520
Who's the last one?

1267
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,040
Kai

1268
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,560
Right? These are today's suspects

1269
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,480
Exactly

1270
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,360
But

1271
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,400
there's one thing

1272
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,200
that is

1273
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,680
We've visited everyone

1274
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,400
but

1275
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,240
the so-called "Teng Zhongjie"

1276
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:18,800
talked with six of us

1277
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,000
about what happened three years ago

1278
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,400
Right

1279
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,880
Only told the last three

1280
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,040
"I'm tired, let's not talk"

1281
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,120
I told him I came

1282
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:24,840
but he just said

1283
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,080
his throat was a bit uncomfortable

1284
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,240
and asked me to leave today

1285
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,480
Then when I arrived, he said

1286
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,880
he was tired

1287
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,680
he didn't want to talk

1288
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,880
He said

1289
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,240
he was very tired today

1290
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,440
and asked me to leave

1291
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,800
After 12 o'clock

1292
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,000
he stopped mentioning anything about those three years

1293
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,080
But there's one problem

1294
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,600
During this period

1295
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,040
The surveillance footage from this period was deleted

1296
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,520
Right

1297
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,120
From 12:05 AM to 3:00 AM

1298
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
According to cleaner Hao's testimony

1299
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,360
From 2:00 to 2:15 AM

1300
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,600
He didn't notice anything unusual

1301
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,280
Correct

1302
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,360
Arrived at 2:00

1303
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,560
Left at 2:15

1304
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,440
After disinfection, he also took away the trash

1305
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,320
From 2:00 to 2:15 AM

1306
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:00,960
Yes

1307
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,920
He came to clean up

1308
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,280
What cleaner Hao took away

1309
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,680
What evidence was collected?

1310
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,680
What was collected were

1311
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,360
Items that could prove someone "died"

1312
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,400
Not Xiao Jing's

1313
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,080
The trash outside

1314
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,480
Mainly to create that locked room scenario

1315
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,040
Right?

1316
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,400
Yes

1317
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:13,920
Correct

1318
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,480
So after 2:15

1319
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,360
Because Hao the cleaner had finished

1320
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,320
That "killer" of his

1321
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,240
Left the remaining stolen goods

1322
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,920
Dumped there

1323
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,040
So they wouldn't be collected

1324
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,320
But he had to go there first

1325
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,800
To know about this note

1326
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,240
He only received this one

1327
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,000
Personal note

1328
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,400
He must have acted on impulse

1329
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,440
To "kill" him

1330
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,160
Right

1331
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,120
How could he prepare so much phosphorus powder on impulse?

1332
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,040
And those other things?

1333
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,800
Wait

1334
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,400
The date on the receipt

1335
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,120
July 29th

1336
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,120
These crime tools

1337
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,160
Were all purchased after midnight

1338
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:43,800
12 AM, right?

1339
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,080
Yes

1340
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,000
The voice changer was bought on the 29th

1341
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,600
Before that it was the real Teng the agent

1342
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,120
Correct

1343
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,160
We all went on the 28th

1344
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,400
Right, we all went on the 28th

1345
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,760
So this note

1346
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,520
Can eliminate the first six of us

1347
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,120
Is that what it means?

1348
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:55,840
Can't eliminate

1349
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,200
Can eliminate us

1350
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,040
These things only existed on the 29th

1351
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,000
No

1352
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
For example, Keke

1353
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,280
You heard the secret

1354
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,560
I'll come back after midnight

1355
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,480
Now I'll come "kill" you

1356
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,520
So they deleted the later surveillance footage

1357
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,080
Right

1358
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,120
If there's a suspect among us

1359
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,880
The only one

1360
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,920
Who was the last one to go?

1361
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,200
Ke, right?

1362
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:16,840
How long did he stay?

1363
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,600
Twenty minutes

1364
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,760
I used her classmate's name

1365
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,520
to lure her to

1366
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,280
the grove

1367
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,640
and stole those three jade pieces

1368
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,960
He committed a crime—he robbed her

1369
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:28,920
No

1370
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,960
Let's sort this out properly

1371
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,080
And the amount you robbed is quite large

1372
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,680
Three hundred thousand

1373
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,360
Over three hundred thousand

1374
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,120
All three hundred thousand was taken by him

1375
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,480
But you were the one who committed the act

1376
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,160
You robbed, I mistakenly took

1377
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,280
For example, let's first take Ke Wuku

1378
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,440
as the "murderer" for now

1379
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,640
At 23:00

1380
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,160
Finished and went out to buy

1381
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,040
Came back after buying

1382
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,000
Returned and immediately "killed"

1383
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,400
Done

1384
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,800
Wait a minute

1385
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,760
No

1386
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,280
Let me ask you

1387
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,000
If it were me

1388
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,480
Let's assume it was me, okay?

1389
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:55,960
Okay

1390
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,400
I don't know these three people's timings

1391
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:00,960
How could you not know?

1392
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,720
You also saw this thing

1393
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,400
Entered this room

1394
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,040
You saw this paper

1395
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,640
How did I see it?

1396
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,680
What evidence do you have to prove

1397
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,840
that I saw this?

1398
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,560
What evidence do you have that you didn't see it?

1399
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,520
The point is I didn't see this

1400
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:09,920
Do you understand?

1401
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,160
What evidence do you have to prove

1402
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,560
that you didn't see it?

1403
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,560
What evidence do you have to prove

1404
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,880
that you didn't throw this?

1405
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,400
Fine

1406
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,040
Indeed

1407
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,800
You're playing this game

1408
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,960
Indeed

1409
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,880
It's really Guo Zhou

1410
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,920
We're not much better than others either

1411
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,280
No, here's how it is

1412
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:27,960
Look

1413
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,960
These two came from the same batch

1414
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,040
Which means

1415
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,320
The person who knew who he was going to meet next

1416
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,280
must have known

1417
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,240
that the one who "died" now isn't Xiaojing

1418
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,160
And they wouldn't want

1419
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,040
anyone to know

1420
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,160
that it wasn't Xiaojing who "died"

1421
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,200
But none of us knew

1422
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,640
about Xiaojing not actually being dead

1423
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,080
So

1424
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,240
I think it's those three people later

1425
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:47,920
and unrelated to the earlier people

1426
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,520
Yes

1427
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,640
Those three later had stronger motives

1428
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,280
I think it's Kai

1429
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,800
Because he doesn't seem like

1430
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,720
having evidence that the girl isn't "dead"

1431
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,240
You know

1432
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,320
What I mean is Agent Teng called Kai over

1433
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,520
But he didn't specify

1434
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,120
what kind of evidence

1435
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,560
that proves Kai "killed" someone

1436
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,800
You're right about that

1437
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,320
And I think Xiao Kai

1438
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,760
if he were the "perpetrator"

1439
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,560
he wouldn't need to delete

1440
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,760
three hours of surveillance footage

1441
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,400
Ke, do you think Agent Teng's voice sounded strange?

1442
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:22,800
Not strange

1443
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,000
The voice I heard was

1444
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,320
definitely his normal voice

1445
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,000
Among these three people

1446
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,120
only Kai said

1447
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:28,480
his voice was off

1448
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,720
his voice sounded strange

1449
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,480
He

1450
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,320
said the voice was slightly different than usual

1451
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,000
The other two didn't say it was strange

1452
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,880
They both said no

1453
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,840
It was completely normal

1454
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,600
Agent Teng's voice

1455
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,120
was there any difference from before?

1456
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,720
I didn't notice any difference

1457
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,680
None

1458
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,320
Let me tell you

1459
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,960
this voice changer probably

1460
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,400
isn't that amazing

1461
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,760
Right, it must sound unnatural

1462
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,320
Maybe he thought it would sound amazing

1463
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,440
but realized it wasn't working well

1464
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,400
That's why I feel uncomfortable

1465
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,120
Never mind, let's drop it for now

1466
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,000
That's probably what happened

1467
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,480
Who do you think is more credible between Yangguang and his father

1468
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,360
Who's more trustworthy?

1469
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,800
Actually, we should be examining these two people

1470
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,640
I think

1471
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,000
it's Cao Yangguang

1472
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,080
Yes, it seems like him

1473
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:05,920
I believe it's him

1474
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,200
Because only if he was the one who "killed"

1475
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,080
this crime

1476
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,840
would there be enough time for the cleanup afterwards

1477
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,800
to have sufficient time

1478
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,280
Right

1479
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,520
Including deleting things

1480
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,520
and altering videos

1481
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,400
The problem with his father is

1482
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,680
that stuff on his shoe soles

1483
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,720
Don't believe his nonsense

1484
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,440
That story about going to see Xiaojing

1485
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,320
I don't really believe it either

1486
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,960
Because there wasn't even dirt there

1487
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,920
Even if Yangguang really did the "killing"

1488
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,720
his father would take the blame

1489
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,560
But it's not just the "killer" who can lie

1490
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,000
But

1491
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,120
Actually, the one who locked up Xiaojing

1492
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,680
was Cao Yangguang

1493
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,400
Yet his father kept telling

1494
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:34,960
lies

1495
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,680
Wait

1496
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,600
But too many people could have told this lie

1497
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,920
Back then, Boss Fei lied for my brother

1498
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,320
Right

1499
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,120
I was the one who replied to that text

1500
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,640
The one on the 29th, right?

1501
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,840
I was the one who "killed"

1502
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,760
Because just now when you were "interrogating" her

1503
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,440
she took everything

1504
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,520
and claimed all the responsibility for herself

1505
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,720
She said she was the one who sent the message

1506
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,360
The blueprints and all that—she handled them

1507
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,880
But actually, you were the one who sent them

1508
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,520
You mean...

1509
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:00,920
Yes

1510
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,280
This kind of lie is very common

1511
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,480
Like claiming you're relatives or family

1512
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,080
Right

1513
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,520
Yes, I did it to protect you

1514
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,160
Let me sort this out

1515
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,200
Normally if he went there

1516
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,640
For example, if Cao Yangguang entered

1517
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,080
After entering, he had a conflict with (Teng the agent)

1518
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:13,680
They fell out

1519
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,520
After the fallout, he was "taken care of"

1520
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,560
After being silenced

1521
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,560
He came out

1522
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,000
After coming out

1523
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,160
He tore up these things

1524
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:19,880
And threw them away

1525
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,840
And then?

1526
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,720
Or maybe he didn't come out

1527
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,640
Okay, staying inside

1528
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,560
He stayed inside the whole time

1529
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,680
For example, doing something inside

1530
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,640
Then his father happened to come

1531
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,640
His father arrived

1532
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,080
Unexpectedly, he told him to leave first

1533
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,800
After his father left

1534
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,840
He went out to dispose of this

1535
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,720
This was the first round

1536
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,640
First round of disposing evidence

1537
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,160
Disposed before 2 o'clock

1538
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,760
Then this batch was collected

1539
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,960
Then after a while he returned

1540
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,560
Say around 2:15

1541
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,120
When he came back with those purchases

1542
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:40,720
Then in the room

1543
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,640
Preparing to clean up the remaining evidence

1544
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,640
Then Kai arrived

1545
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,920
Kai was also sent away

1546
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,360
Sent away

1547
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,560
Finally using liquid nitrogen or whatever

1548
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,240
Or other materials

1549
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,480
You're saying Cao Yangguang came out himself

1550
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:48,720
Yes

1551
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,840
If we assume Cao Yangguang

1552
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,440
Was really the "culprit"

1553
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,520
Then how did he open that inner door none of you could open?

1554
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,640
How did he get in?

1555
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,480
A kick?

1556
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,000
One kick, kicked it open right?

1557
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,640
Kicked it open

1558
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,760
There was a door latch

1559
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,160
So he went and bought another door stopper

1560
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,600
Right

1561
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,560
The person you're talking about

1562
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,120
suddenly sounds a bit like me

1563
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,760
Yes, I did it

1564
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,400
Then I have a question

1565
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,120
That is, when his father arrived

1566
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,040
He hadn’t had time to buy a voice changer yet

1567
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,080
How could his father not recognize his voice?

1568
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,480
His father cleaned up the mess

1569
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,200
The son "kills," the father covers it up

1570
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,160
Look at the old man’s whole attitude just now

1571
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,760
It was totally a "cleaning up the mess" attitude

1572
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,160
He doesn’t hide anything from his father

1573
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:28,840
These two people

1574
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,120
could absolutely commit crimes as a team

1575
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,760
In the end, I believe

1576
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,960
the "killer" who "murdered" Teng Zhongjie

1577
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,280
is Cao Yangguang.

1578
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,000
Because I lived with him for some time,

1579
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I think

1580
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,760
he is inherently

1581
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,680
an extremely intelligent person

1582
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,760
with meticulous attention to detail.

1583
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,080
This Cao Yangguang

1584
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,840
is unscrupulous,

1585
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,760
somewhat pathological and extremely extreme.

1586
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,360
Since childhood, Cao Yangguang

1587
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,440
has been excessively spoiled by his family,

1588
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,440
given whatever he demanded without refusal.

1589
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,240
I believe Cao's father

1590
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,160
was likely the one cleaning up his messes.

1591
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,240
"The murderer"

1592
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,200
In the end, I think it's more likely to be Cao Yangguang

1593
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,480
Then why Cao Yangguang?

1594
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,800
and not Cao's father?

1595
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,320
If we assume it's Cao's father,

1596
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,880
he came at 1:30

1597
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,000
He threw the items used

1598
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,920
to fake the locked room

1599
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,680
into

1600
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,600
the trash can in the room

1601
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,800
So it must be him

1602
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,200
who didn't have time

1603
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,800
to dispose of this evidence

1604
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,000
which led to this situation

1605
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,280
So judging by the timeline,

1606
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,080
the more urgent suspect should actually be Cao's father

1607
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,600
That's why I initially wrote Cao Yangguang

1608
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,840
but I'm changing my vote

1609
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,680
Let me change it

1610
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,920
Now I think it's Cao's father

1611
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,560
As for Cao's father's motive,

1612
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,680
it would be to protect his son

1613
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:38,680
Therefore,

1614
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,360
Alright, that's it

1615
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,960
The voting method I chose today

1616
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,800
is quite special

1617
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,040
It's also my first time making this choice

1618
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,080
I'm casting my vote for two people

1619
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,000
The "culprits" I've chosen are

1620
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,720
Cao Yangguang

1621
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,960
and Cao's father

1622
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,000
I believe in today's case

1623
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,080
if

1624
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,760
someone should go to prison

1625
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,360
it should be these two

1626
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,880
going to prison together

1627
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,280
So I must cast these two votes

1628
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,680
for these two people

1629
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,120
Neither of them can escape

1630
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:08,800
If they must "die"

1631
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,320
these two must die together

1632
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,800
Neither of them is acceptable

1633
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,640
Cao Yangguang

1634
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,160
this

1635
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,600
this guy

1636
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,440
couldn't possibly have the brains

1637
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,320
nor the presence of mind at the time

1638
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,080
to create this locked room scenario

1639
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:23,720
So

1640
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,480
he's just someone who would "kill" someone

1641
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,040
then cry and go tell his dad

1642
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,160
"Dad, I 'killed' someone"

1643
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:28,840
"You have to help me"

1644
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,800
His father came back and helped cover it up

1645
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,720
concealed the incident

1646
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,360
and created a locked room

1647
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,960
So let these two go to hell together

1648
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,600
Here

1649
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,120
Thank you

1650
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,560
Good morning

1651
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,360
Tomato noodle soup

1652
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:51,720
Tomato noodle soup

1653
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,520
Here, Uncle

1654
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:02,600
Thanks, nephew

1655
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,400
Nobody leaves until we finish all this food today

1656
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,600
Thank you

1657
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,880
Everyone, please eat

1658
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,440
Whose phone is that?

1659
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,320
Mine

1660
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,560
Your sister-in-law is calling you

1661
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,040
What is it?

1662
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:17,960
I'll take it

1663
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,120
Put it on speaker

1664
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,520
Hello, sister-in-law

1665
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,240
What's up?

1666
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,560
Bro, it's me

1667
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,960
I just heard about that Teng agent's incident

1668
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,640
Right

1669
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,080
And?

1670
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,240
He was also a regular at our foot massage parlor

1671
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,720
He was wearing a vital signs monitor too

1672
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,560
We can check

1673
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,360
The patch from his vital signs monitor

1674
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,360
Then we can log into that website

1675
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,120
To check

1676
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,000
His monitor's data

1677
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,480
Go get it

1678
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,320
Okay, go get it

1679
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:45,840
Got it

1680
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,080
Anything else, sister-in-law?

1681
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,280
No, I'll get back to work

1682
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:48,600
Alright

1683
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,440
Okay, goodbye

1684
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,520
Goodbye, sister-in-law

1685
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,680
Come for a foot massage when you're free

1686
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,480
Okay

1687
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,040
Goodbye

1688
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:54,880
Goodbye

1689
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,680
Goodbye

1690
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,320
I'll go get it

1691
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,040
Okay

1692
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,320
Earlier she mentioned that vital...

1693
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,320
The vital signs thing

1694
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,680
Which means

1695
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,520
When he actually died

1696
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,240
Let's see if our theory is correct

1697
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,280
The "time of death"

1698
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:08,840
"Time of death"

1699
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,560
I'm here

1700
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,840
I've been searching for so long

1701
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,240
It's really

1702
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,080
Teng Zhongjie's vital signs monitor

1703
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:20,640
Couldn't find it

1704
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,080
But under his mattress

1705
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:23,880
But under his mattress

1706
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,960
I found this small box

1707
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,960
With a code

1708
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,320
And this is the computer I got from the property management

1709
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:31,880
Here

1710
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,360
Thanks

1711
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,000
Let's check it

1712
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,760
Vital signs monitor

1713
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,240
Open it

1714
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,160
Enter the code

1715
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,560
940483

1716
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,040
Confirm

1717
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,000
Time of death around 12:40

1718
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,280
That matches

1719
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,480
Yes, it's Cao Yangguang

1720
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,480
Last time we saw him was

1721
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,360
At around

1722
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,000
12:30

1723
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,960
11 AM on the 28th

1724
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,320
fell into a coma

1725
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,920
He was already in a coma by 11 AM

1726
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,000
Which means he

1727
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,800
had already been unconscious

1728
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,080
Right, unconscious long before

1729
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,160
Then who was talking to us?

1730
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,760
Yes, who were you talking to?

1731
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,160
Didn't you say you communicated with him?

1732
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,160
After arriving

1733
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,560
Teng Zhongjie told me

1734
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,120
Have you forgotten about three years ago

1735
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,560
when Teacher Lou jumped to her death?

1736
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,600
When I met Teng Zhongjie, he said

1737
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,360
you instigated the online bullying

1738
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,640
After entering, he even threatened me

1739
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,080
saying he'd tell my girlfriend Zhenzhen

1740
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,200
about what happened three years ago

1741
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,320
He told me he knew

1742
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,840
about my robbery three years ago

1743
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,160
and would expose what I did back then

1744
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,640
He just said

1745
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,920
"I already know the truth"

1746
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,080
"I'm going to expose you" and such

1747
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,400
"You must take responsibility for your actions"

1748
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,720
Are we sure what we heard

1749
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,520
was really Teng Zhongjie speaking?

1750
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,520
It should be

1751
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:00,960
Coco

1752
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,480

How do you feel about this episode?

1773
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,920
This episode is actually quite special

1774
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,760
Because

1775
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,440
Each of us

1776
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,320
actually made many mistakes in 2019

1777
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,800
We all made many mistakes

1778
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,240
Previously we were looking for the "culprit"

1779
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,200
But unexpectedly in this episode

1780
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,880
It seems we're all "culprits"

1781
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,080
Everyone is a "culprit"

1782
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,400
We all contributed to this tragedy

1783
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,320
Yes

1784
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,840
Next we'll reveal

1785
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,640
the truth of this case

1786
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,040
In today's case

1787
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,960
The suspects identified by players

1788
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,800
Total nine people

1789
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,280
They are:

1790
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,480
Bai Sanwan

1791
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,800
Liu Xialai

1792
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,920
Guo Baoyou

1793
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,280
Ke Wuku

1794
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,720
Zhou Keke

1795
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,520
Song Piaoliang

1796
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,280
Xiao Kai

1797
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,040
Cao Yangguang

1798
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,960
Cao's father

1799
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,640
Nine people

1800
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,080
After deduction

1801
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,480
The "culprit" voted by everyone is

1802
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,120
Cao Yangguang

1803
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,000
He received

1804
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:23,880
five votes

1805
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,440
Five votes

1806
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,760
One person didn't vote

1807
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,760
One person

1808
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,040
voted for two people

1809
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,640
So that vote is invalid, right?

1810
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,520
Invalid

1811
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,360
As you all know

1812
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,880
"Identifying the culprit"

1813
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,800
"Identify the killer"

1814
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,120
Success

1815
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,480
"The killer is"

1816
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,600
Cao Yangguang

1817
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,880
I almost wrote his father's name again

1818
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,840
In this case,

1819
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,960
the decisive evidence everyone overlooked

1820
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,440
was under Teng Zhongjie's bedside—

1821
00:57:59,440 --> 00:57:59,880
there was

1822
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,760
a vital signs monitor's box.

1823
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,720
Through the vital signs monitor,

1824
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,120
everyone can check

1825
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,800
Teng Zhongjie's "time of death"

1826
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,720
at 12:40 AM.

1827
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,000
This was when Cao Yangguang

1828
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,840
entered Teng Zhongjie's home.

1829
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,840
Right.

1830
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,080
Correct.

1831
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,480
After receiving Teng Zhongjie's note,

1832
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,880
Cao Yangguang had been extremely uneasy.

1833
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,920
At 12:30 AM on the 29th,

1834
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,360
Cao Yangguang arrived on time.

1835
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,720
He wanted to probe how much

1836
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,520
Teng Zhongjie actually knew.

1837
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,680
As soon as he entered,

1838
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,760
Teng claimed to be unwell

1839
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,200
and might faint at any moment,

1840
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,760
then stayed lying in the bedroom.

1841
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,440
Shortly after,

1842
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,800
Teng directly exposed

1843
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,520
his three-year imprisonment of Xiaojing

1844
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,720
and harshly condemned

1845
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,200
Cao Yangguang's actions.

1846
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,000
Then,

1847
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,760
Teng appeared to faint

1848
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,800
and fell silent.

1849
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,760
With his three-year secret

1850
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,440
suddenly exposed,

1851
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,640
in a furious rage,

1852
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,440
Cao Yangguang used brute force

1853
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,200
to break down Teng's bedroom door.

1854
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,040
After bursting in,

1855
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,960
he directly smothered Teng to "death."

1856
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,480
After Teng Zhongjie's "death"

1857
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,600
A calmer Cao Yangguang began calculating

1858
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,080
how to escape this situation

1859
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,160
At Teng's bedside, he noticed

1860
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,840
a photo of Xiaojing

1861
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,880
with her canine teeth circled by Teng

1862
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,320
and a note from the old security guard

1863
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,080
These two pieces of evidence proved

1864
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,040
the victim in the grove three years ago

1865
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,760
wasn't Xiaojing at all

1866
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,160
Cao then found a notebook

1867
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,440
with paper matching the notes he'd received

1868
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,120
faint writing was barely visible

1869
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,120
Pencil rubbing revealed that

1870
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,480
Teng had scheduled meetings with nine people

1871
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,600
with two more after Cao himself

1872
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,320
He had to complete his disguise

1873
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,240
before 1:30

1874
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,080
and use the last two visitors

1875
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,400
to create the illusion Teng was still alive

1876
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,880
Studying Teng's apartment layout,

1877
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,120
Cao conceived

1878
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,000
a double-locked room scenario

1879
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,560
Since Teng had mentioned

1880
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,000
his poor health recently

1881
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,960
a perfect locked-room setup

1882
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,160
should be convincing enough

1883
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,080
Cao discarded Xiaojing's photo,

1884
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,240
the guard's note,

1885
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,640
and his rubbing of

1886
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,840
Teng's appointment records

1887
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,480
into the hallway trash

1888
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,520
then went to a convenience store

1889
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,120
to purchase necessary tools

1890
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,600
After returning to Teng Zhongjie's house,

1891
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,440
Cao Yangguang first used the newly purchased latch plate

1892
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,320
to replace the one he had damaged

1893
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,240
when breaking into the bedroom door.

1894
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,440
Then he closed the bedroom door properly

1895
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,800
and used a voice changer

1896
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,040
while waiting in the corner of the bedroom

1897
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,760
for the two people who would come later.

1898
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,960
But he didn't expect the next person to arrive

1899
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,280
to be his own father.

1900
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,360
Shocked by this,

1901
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,160
Cao Yangguang used Teng Zhongjie's voice

1902
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,280
to first send his father away.

1903
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,280
At 2:30,

1904
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,880
Cao Yangguang similarly dismissed Xiao Kai briefly.

1905
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,360
Afterwards, Cao Yangguang

1906
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,040
applied phosphorescent powder to a cotton thread.

1907
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,920
Using cotton thread and dumbbells

1908
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,560
The self-rebounding wardrobe door

1909
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,840
Locked the bedroom door

1910
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,120
Used a space heater outside the bedroom

1911
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,160
To ignite the phosphorus powder

1912
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,480
Burning away the cotton thread

1913
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,880
Creating a locked-room scenario

1914
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:48,920
Then

1915
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,120
He stacked playing cards into a tower

1916
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,560
Used liquid nitrogen to freeze the card tower

1917
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,320
To the door

1918
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,240
When closing the door

1919
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,320
The card tower would naturally be pulled behind the door

1920
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,320
After the liquid nitrogen evaporated

1921
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,000
The cards would stand upright inside

1922
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,320
Creating the illusion the door was never opened

1923
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,040
After completing all this

1924
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,280
Cao Yangguang returned home

1925
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,920
And confessed everything to his father

1926
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,480
Claiming that he

1927
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,120
Had already completed

1928
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,920
The cleanup work

1929
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,640
Please vote for the correct player

1930
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,040
Collect your golden key from behind

1931
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,080
Here's an idea

1932
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:23,920
That's too much

1933
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,040
It's inconvenient if we all stand up to get it

1934
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,400
Let Xiao Ke help us get it

1935
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,080
Okay, that's right

1936
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:28,880
Agreed

1937
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,640
Sounds reliable

1938
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,600
No, how about we let him present the awards to us?

1939
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,040
This one is yours, here.

1940
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:37,480
This one is yours, here.

1941
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,360
Guo

1942
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,680
Thank you.

1943
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,800
Thank you, Ke Wuku.

1944
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,120
Liu

1945
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,080
Bai Mei

1946
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,440
Let's do this right in front of Ku.

1947
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,560
Okay

1948
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:55,520
INTO1 Zhou Keyu

1949
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,320
What were you thinking at the time?

1950
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,760
Writing down two names

1951
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,080
I know this person

1952
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,960
was "killed" by sunlight

1953
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,080
The main reason I wanted to accuse both of them

1954
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:03,920
is because these two

1955
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,360
while fully aware

1956
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,960
locked that girl up for three years

1957
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,320
Yes, three years

1958
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,720
Yes, honestly, both of them

1959
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,800
share equal blame

1960
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,560
It's just

1961
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,360
I can't accept that

1962
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,240
They should

1963
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,480
both face the consequences, right?

1964
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:14,920
Right

1965
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,000
They shielded each other

1966
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,840
Complicit in covering up

1967
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,000
He's also guilty

1968
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,360
And today might be

1969
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,080
the case with the most

1970
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,480
suspects we've handled so far

1971
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:22,760
Yes

1972
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,720
So let's

1973
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,320
give a warm welcome to our old friend

1974
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,960
from China University of Political Science and Law

1975
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,000
Professor Ma Ai, a criminal psychology expert

1976
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,800
to help us analyze

1977
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,680
and explain

1978
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,560
Hello everyone

1979
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,160
Hello

1980
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:34,680
Hello

1981
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,960
Hello, Teacher Ma Ai

1982
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,600
After solving this case, I think we...

1983
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,240
All are guilty

1984
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:47,880
All are guilty

1985
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,360
None of us are innocent

1986
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,440
Let's go through them one by one

1987
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,600
and analyze slightly

1988
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,000
what everyone has done

1989
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,800
to see what category of crime

1990
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,520
or violation it belongs to

1991
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,920
You judge us

1992
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,760
Judge us

1993
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,800
Who should we start with

1994
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,040
Ke Wuku

1995
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,720
Why start with me?

1996
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,280
Yours is a serious crime

1997
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:07,640
Yours is

1998
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,120
Right, we just talked big

1999
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,960
but you actually did it

2000
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,160
Everyone should know

2001
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,800
That behavior like his

2002
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:15,680
using violence

2003
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,720
coercion

2004
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,080
or other methods

2005
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,080
to rob public or private property

2006
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,200
should be classified as

2007
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,920
the crime of robbery

2008
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,240
For the crime of robbery

2009
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,000
the penalty is over ten years imprisonment

2010
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,200
life imprisonment

2011
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,800
or even death penalty

2012
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,400
and impose a fine

2013
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,560
confiscate property

2014
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,800
Therefore, robbery is a felony

2015
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,320
In fact, we all understand very clearly

2016
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,000
I have a question, Teacher Ma.

2017
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,760
Regarding cases like Ke Wuku's situation...

2018
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,160
Didn't he ultimately steal those items?

2019
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,440
But then he had a car accident...

2020
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,000
However, the items...

2021
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,920
He didn't actually get to sell them himself.

2022
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,240
They were taken by someone else.

2023
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,760
So for someone like Ke Wuku...

2024
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,000
When determining his compensation...

2025
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,840
how should this matter be evaluated?

2026
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,600
For this kind of compensation...

2027
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,560
Actually, if he's criminally...

2028
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,200
convicted...

2029
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,840
the valuable items worth...

2030
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,760
300,000 yuan that he took...

2031
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,280
would they be considered stolen goods?

2032
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,400
If they are stolen goods...

2033
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,160
then it's not about compensation...

2034
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,280
but about recovering the stolen property.

2035
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,120
I understand.

2036
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:15,800
Now...

2037
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,360
Sanwan...

2038
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,560
You were in a car accident...

2039
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:18,920
Yes.

2040
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,960
So everyone can see...

2041
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,160
this actually involves two matters.

2042
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,440
One is the typical...

2043
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,680
hit-and-run offense.

2044
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,160
Although he hit you...

2045
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,600
but before determining liability...

2046
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,600
we can't simply say...

2047
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,600
whether it's your fault or his.

2048
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,680
Understood.

2049
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:37,480
The second...

2050
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,320
you secretly took that bag...

2051
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,800
which is a clear case of theft.

2052
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,360
I see.

2053
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,280
So you're facing two charges:

2054
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,240
one is hit-and-run,

2055
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,240
and the other is theft.

2056
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,480
Let me explain to you...

2057
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,160
For the theft charge...

2058
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,240
when the amount is particularly large...

2059
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:54,560
300,000 yuan...

2060
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,440
carries over 10 years imprisonment...

2061
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,520
or even life imprisonment,

2062
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,760
plus possible fines...

2063
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,440
and confiscation of your property.

2064
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,840
Now let's talk about the girl's matter

2065
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,600
Because you posted online

2066
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,760
and spread these messages

2067
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,520
it caused harm to her

2068
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,560
Right

2069
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,280
So your actions

2070
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,720
constitute what we call defamation

2071
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,800
Meaning you fabricated facts

2072
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,320
resulting in harm to others

2073
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,840
Now let's discuss

2074
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,520
defamation

2075
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,080
If the circumstances are severe

2076
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,120
you may face up to three years in prison

2077
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:33,840
detention

2078
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,760
control

2079
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,280
or deprivation of political rights

2080
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,280
Now, who else—

2081
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,040
What about me?

2082
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,920
I edited the images myself

2083
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,760
and posted them online

2084
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,880
to frame someone

2085
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,400
If authorities investigate

2086
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,280
and during the investigation

2087
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,480
you still submit altered images

2088
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,600
it would constitute perjury

2089
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,440
In my case,

2090
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,320
previously it was Zhou Keke

2091
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,360
who secretly photographed others' privacy

2092
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,000
and then took that private information

2093
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
to those gossip accounts

2094
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,080
and had it exposed publicly

2095
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,640
Your actions

2096
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,440
involve two legal violations

2097
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,360
First,

2098
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,240
investigating personal information

2099
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,320
constitutes civil infringement

2100
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:13,920
because

2101
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,120
you had no right to do this

2102
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:16,720
Correct

2103
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,480
Therefore

2104
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,440
this violates

2105
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,000
the relevant provisions

2106
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,800
of China's Civil Code

2107
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,720
If you further

2108
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,360
expose their identity online

2109
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:31,200
and cause damaging

2110
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,520
consequences to them

2111
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,120
you then commit

2112
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,360
the crime of infringing personal information

2113
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,560
If circumstances are serious

2114
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,920
punishable by up to three years imprisonment

2115
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,920
or criminal detention

2116
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,640
plus fines

2117
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,000
For particularly severe cases

2118
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,400
the punishment is three to

2119
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,680
seven years imprisonment

2120
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,480
So

2121
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,600
all criminal acts

2122
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,600
ultimately bring you young people

2123
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,760
completely

2124
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,960
disproportionate consequences

2125
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,920
Like me buying this private information

2126
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,360
and then leaking it - that gossip girl

2127
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,520
how should she be sentenced?

2128
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,240
So behavior like that gossip girl's

2129
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,600
is similar to your previous conviction

2130
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,680
and sentencing

2131
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,240
Both involve selling

2132
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,280
other people's private information

2133
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:13,800
Understood

2134
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,000
Now finally

2135
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
we have Guo Baoyou left

2136
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,200
Actually your actions

2137
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,680
weren't intended to "kill" him

2138
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,400
Right

2139
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,760
What condition did this old lady have?

2140
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,400
Do you remember?

2141
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,080
Alzheimer's

2142
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,920
Yes, she had Alzheimer's

2143
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,640
She thought her daughter had returned

2144
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:28,960
Correct

2145
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,640
So during the chase

2146
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,200
she fell and "died"

2147
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,240
Your actions constitute

2148
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,680
involuntary manslaughter

2149
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,560
I actually "killed" someone

2150
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,920
This counts as involuntary "killing"

2151
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,760
He should be sentenced to more than three years

2152
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,360
but less than seven years in prison

2153
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,480
If the circumstances are less severe

2154
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,360
the sentence should be less than three years

2155
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:49,720
So,

2156
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,760
each of us can see that

2157
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:52,360
in daily life,

2158
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,240
everyone may make mistakes,

2159
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,280
but I believe mistakes are inevitable.

2160
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,560
However, you must maintain

2161
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,840
basic boundaries and limits.

2162
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,600
Crime and mistakes

2163
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,800
are fundamentally different.

2164
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:04,440
Right.

2165
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:05,920
Because you must understand,

2166
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,000
losing your freedom

2167
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,520
and being imprisoned

2168
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,440
is truly not a particularly

2169
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,160
enlightening process

2170
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,720
for understanding life.

2171
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:14,680
Yes.

2172
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,320
Understood.

2173
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,399
Alright.

2174
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:17,080
So let's give a round of applause

2175
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,000
to thank our Teacher Ma

2176
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:18,840
for his analysis.

2177
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:19,240
Thank you.

2178
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:19,880
Thank you, Teacher Ma.

2179
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,920
Thank you, thank you Teacher Ma.

2180
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,080
"Let's Start Deduction"

2181
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,920
See you next week

2182
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,040
Eight guilty individuals

2183
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,399
were invited to a small island

2184
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:51,600
All of them had committed

2185
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,680
the "crime of murder"

2186
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:54,720
Then,

2187
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,000
they all "died" one after another on the island

2188
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:02,880
The guilty ones

2189
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:05,080
Violence

2190
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:05,840
Lies

2191
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,240
Jealousy

2192
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:06,680
Greed

2193
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,120
Snooping

2194
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:07,920
Impulse

2195
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,760
So we are the guilty ones

2196
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,760
Everyone has "committed suicide" by jumping off buildings

2197
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,520
They were doing this

2198
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,600
to avenge Teacher Lou

2199
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,960
They lured the six of us to "commit suicide"

2200
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,319
Step by step,

2201
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,880
they pushed us to the brink

2202
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,160
The avenger hiding among us

2203
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,960
escaped by "faking their death"

2204
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,000
Among the six of us,

2205
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,120
one person never "died"

2206
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:30,960
There is a

2207
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:31,640
traitor among us

2208
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,479
who wants to "kill" us all

2209
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,359
We all did corresponding things

2210
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,160
Only he

2211
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,760
How can you prove

2212
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:40,720
your guilt?

2213
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,319
How terrifying

2214
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:46,399
Everyone who could prove Liu Xialai's guilt has "died"

2215
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:47,760
You're inexplicably pinning this on me

2216
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,399
What do you mean?

2217
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:50,240
No one can escape responsibility

2218
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,920
So you're the "emo"

2219
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,920
Yes, I'm going to "kill" all five of you

2220
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:55,040
No!
