1
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,760
I want to get the information

2
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,120
The same reasoning experience?

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,200
You want to play a board game at home?

4
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,880
The real "cause of death" of Teng Agency

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,680
Because

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,120
The gosling among us

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,680
To kill someone with a knife.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,960
Kai and Cao Sunshine

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,200
They are going to jump off the building.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,640
The emo has found them.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,200
Here's the thing.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,120
I think

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,240
There's a traitor.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,080
There's a man.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,640
Is the executor.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,600
The gosling among us

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,080
I didn't do anything wrong.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,000
He was just a cover for her crime.

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,640
One of the people in the orphanage.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,800
To sneak into us.

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,239
To kill all of us.

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
It seems that everyone is here.

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,280
Today, I deliberately

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,040
In this way,

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,320
So that we can discuss it.

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,800
Because I just heard that

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,280
Among you,

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,320
There's a mole.

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,560
First, I think

30
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,720
This mole

31
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,040
Must have replaced him.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,320
Of the man who died.

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,960
Lurking in our place.

34
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,040
And his biggest possibility

35
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,680
Is that he faked his death.

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,600
Before the time and space reset,

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,200
He...

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,120
Is not dead.

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,360
This little goose.

40
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,440
I knew my identity was going to be exposed.

41
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,920
He started to take out

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,840
This woman

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,680
The thing that killed Mr. Lou.

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,640
Put it on yourself.

45
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,520
I think one is faking death.

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,400
Actually, there's another one.

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,960
He must find

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,880
With the pollen allergy,

49
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,640
A lot of things that a dead woman has in common.

50
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,480
But for example,

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,000
If you want to prove your innocence,

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,880
We just need to point out

53
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,000
What I did

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,680
That woman can't do it.

55
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,240
So I must be the one who did it.

56
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,440
It's beautiful. I have it.

57
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,520
I think her credibility

58
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,200
It's already high.

59
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,120
Because first of all, we have the witness of the puppet.

60
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
The second point is

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,600
Remember when we searched her house,

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,160
There will be a love album.

63
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,520
I think these clues

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,920
You can give her some evidence.

65
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,680
Is Guo Bao You suspected?

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,840
I think so.

67
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,760
Because we can now prove

68
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,960
He has a grudge against Lou.

69
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,280
He sneaked into

70
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,760
Miss Lou's home.

71
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,800
And pretend to be Jing.

72
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,720
To scare Madam Lou.

73
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,840
But the person who pretended to be a girl

74
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,680
Not necessarily Guo Baoyou.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,320
And he's on the Internet.

76
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,400
Are anonymous.

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,800
I didn't prove it was him.

78
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,600
therefore

79
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,280
He is also suspected.

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,280
That Ke Wuku

81
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
I think

82
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,760
It's a little reliable here.

83
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,200
Because Xiao Kai

84
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,000
They went through

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,120
The three of them,

86
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,680
It proves his identity.

87
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
Am I not a human?

88
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,480
Old Bai hit someone on his bike.

89
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,240
It might not be you.

90
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,400
Because no one can prove it's you.

91
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,160
Wear a helmet when you ride a bike.

92
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,320
He can't remember what you look like.

93
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,480
And your transfer record

94
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,640
Or it's fake.

95
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,560
What's one more thing?

96
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,720
As I mentioned just now,

97
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,960
The word "fake death"

98
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,520
Your family has a record of faking death.

99
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,640
Investigation is faking death.

100
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,880
Let me tell you something.

101
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,440
Investigation is not dead.

102
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,360
I'm not dead.

103
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,160
And solved the misunderstanding with Bai San Wan.

104
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,080
So I think your suspicion

105
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,840
Is also very big.

106
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,720
then

107
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,080
Zhou Keke, I think I have him.

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,400
I think it's quite suspicious.

109
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,960
The reason is that

110
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,840
To prove that he and Miss Lou

111
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,760
There's too little information about enemies.

112
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,600
It's just Official Account message template

113
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,680
A store exploration blogger.

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
And the video of the store

115
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,640
The sound has been processed.

116
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,560
It may not be you.

117
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,080
That's me.

118
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,840
And I think there's one more thing.

119
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,320
It's your last one.

120
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,600
The "cause of death" of time reset

121
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,440
You feel guilty about what happened to Miss Cai.

122
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,640
Jumping from a building.

123
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,560
I don't think so.

124
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,000
Enough for you to commit suicide.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So I think in all the motives,

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,480
I think the current situation

127
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,000
Explain yourself.

128
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,240
Myself

129
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,880
Is the death of Miss Lou.

130
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,200
Of all the things made,

131
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,360
Actually, you only fixed one picture.

132
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,280
Yes

133
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,480
But the drawing you fixed

134
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,240
I think

135
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,640
You won't die.

136
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,400
Because first of all, this picture

137
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,800
You didn't send it.

138
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,400
Of course

139
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,840
And this picture doesn't have

140
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,240
What lethal effect?

141
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,960
Yes, I have.

142
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,000
Actually, Miss Lou's death

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,360
It's all of us.

144
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,600
To add fuel to the flame.

145
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,640
To the death.

146
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,600
Yeah, but I was thinking

147
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,960
Did you do anything else?

148
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,280
Or something serious to you,

149
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,920
No. First, I want to prove myself.

150
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,840
I'm definitely not faking my death.

151
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,080
The reason is that

152
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,840
I'm from the orphanage.

153
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,040
And my blood type is unique.

154
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,640
I can't pretend to be someone else.

155
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,040
Right now,

156
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,920
It's just a problem of incoherence.

157
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,480
Liu, you have to prove that

158
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,240
It's the map you fixed.

159
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,920
First of all, my identity

160
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Not through me.

161
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,040
Through the Cao family.

162
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,600
I have someone to set it up.

163
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,480
Your identity is not important.

164
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,240
To prove that

165
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,640
You made this?

166
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,760
I must have done it.

167
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,240
I think it's the same as that girl.

168
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,000
Have one thing in common.

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,920
Is very important.

170
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,400
It's easier to replace them.

171
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,720
What that girl did,

172
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,840
I want to say it's because of that girl.

173
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,560
She has a message.

174
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,760
She's an old resident of Apartment 11.

175
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,400
And of all the six of us,

176
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,360
Actually, only he

177
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,600
It's the same as Apartment 11.

178
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,720
It's related long ago.

179
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,880
Because the Cao family has been living here.

180
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,600
I'm telling you,

181
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,920
The thief started to shout "Stop!"

182
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,880
The other one is

183
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,240
Or the problem of faking death?

184
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,960
Because I faked my death.

185
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,560
Liu Xia said that

186
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,440
Your girlfriend is investigating.

187
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,360
Had such an experience.

188
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,760
But in fact, he's more

189
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,480
He even changed his name before.

190
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,520
Looks

191
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,640
Have changed.

192
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,520
You got the point, Uncle.

193
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,160
The Moonlight Box, Cao Yuanyue's phone.

194
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,520
Why did Liu Xia come here?

195
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,280
Is it Cao Yue Yue?

196
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,360
And then I made

197
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,440
A state of "suspended animation."

198
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,640
Put my pants and shoes

199
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,400
On the shore.

200
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,680
And push the car into the sea.

201
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,120
And made them think I was dead.

202
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,040
To get plastic surgery.

203
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,200
In the beginning, my name was Liu Xia.

204
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,080
I'm telling you,

205
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,640
Here's the thing.

206
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,520
Because of my panda blood,

207
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,600
Can't be faked.

208
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,320
I can't pretend to be someone else.

209
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
First, I think

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,720
We must figure out one thing.

211
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,200
He is wearing this shell.

212
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,440
He must have been

213
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,840
I started to want to do.

214
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
Because he's getting exposed.

215
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,960
Guo doesn't exist.

216
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,520
Because he followed the girl.

217
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,480
For a long time.

218
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,160
Then I think Ke Wuku and Bai San Wan

219
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,120
Their stories are connected.

220
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,000
and

221
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,920
Ke Wuku actually has someone to testify against him.

222
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,240
Actually, we've seen

223
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,920
Goose wrote on the paper

224
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,640
He's not interested in

225
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,280
And people who are violent

226
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,080
He's connected

227
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,680
To admit their identities.

228
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,840
So there's nothing wrong with them.

229
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,920
And I think

230
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,720
Why would I doubt it?

231
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,840
Coco and Liu come down.

232
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,200
There's no other reason.

233
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,919
But I think

234
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,760
It has nothing to do

235
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,000
It's not so coherent.

236
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,880
Why did he go to help

237
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,559
Who he doesn't like so much.

238
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,160
Why is she a cocoa maker?

239
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,000
Why did he go to the shop?

240
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,440
This is something I don't understand.

241
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:52,960
that's right

242
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,760
that's right

243
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,120
My sister's idea today

244
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,000
It's good.

245
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,440
It's time.

246
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,120
The clock is ticking.

247
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,400
The time of the clock.

248
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,880
I'll talk about my exclusion method.

249
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,440
My exclusion method

250
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,400
The first rule out

251
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,280
bitter

252
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,000
You have a witness.

253
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,240
I ruled you out.

254
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,880
What about me?

255
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,280
I'll choose my order first.

256
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,680
first

257
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,800
When is the killer?

258
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,360
I found that Agent Teng found him.

259
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,640
It's the camera.

260
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,400
When I saw him writing this,

261
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,320
That's when I found out.

262
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,760
As soon as we met,

263
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,560
About my bowl.

264
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,640
Why is the story of three bowls

265
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,760
That girl, I'm sorry to you.

266
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,000
That boy, I'm sorry to you.

267
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sorry, brother.

268
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,840
I killed you.

269
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,440
That man

270
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:32,960
I am sorry

271
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,200
Which man?

272
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,360
I don't want to talk about it.

273
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,000
Back then,

274
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,320
Have you already thought of

275
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,720
Is something going to happen now?

276
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,840
Am I a time traveler?

277
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,760
I think we should basically

278
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,080
You can rule me out.

279
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,680
So in my mind,

280
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,280
We are the good guys.

281
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,080
But there are many people

282
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,160
I think the problem is bigger.

283
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,800
Or the two of them?

284
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,880
In my place,

285
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,080
I won't rule out any of you.

286
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,600
First, let's talk about Liu.

287
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,120
He's a painter.

288
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,720
I have reason to suspect that

289
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,320
The painter may not be yours.

290
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,760
The second week, Coco.

291
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,880
Coco is because his account

292
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,160
You didn't appear yourself.

293
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
There's reason to doubt it.

294
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,560
You are a person who faked his death.

295
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,760
To forge a new identity.

296
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,400
A new life.

297
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,800
Secondly, there's Song.

298
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,000
Her beautiful handmade number

299
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,480
I think it's possible.

300
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,040
It's a fabricated thing.

301
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,720
secondly

302
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,000
white

303
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,360
That night,

304
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,200
I did hit one.

305
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,480
A motorcycle rider.

306
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,200
That's the problem.

307
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,920
I didn't see it.

308
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,320
What does the man who hit me look like?

309
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,720
He did get it.

310
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,480
That day, I robbed

311
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,440
All the things you brought with you,

312
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,280
But I can also say that

313
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Maybe when you came later,

314
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,040
I took it.

315
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,800
Or any other time.

316
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,520
Because I didn't see it with my own eyes.

317
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:00,920
but

318
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,320
Of course.

319
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,440
His suspicion

320
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,280
May be relatively small.

321
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,680
Because we're closely related.

322
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,520
therefore

323
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,880
As long as there is a little evidence,

324
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,360
To prove that Bai is a greedy man.

325
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,680
He can be ruled out.

326
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,160
But this greedy man

327
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,800
It's also possible that

328
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,080
The person who lost the pollen,

329
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,200
The last one is Guo.

330
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,320
Actually, Liu and I suspected that

331
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,800
Is the same.

332
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,520
There's no way to prove it completely.

333
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,600
The identity of the video

334
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,800
So, before any of you

335
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,040
To produce any evidence.

336
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,360
To prove this.

337
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,080
Before you made it yourself,

338
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,560
Any explanation.

339
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,400
I can't rule you out.

340
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,920
We're

341
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,760
The murderer

342
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,280
Find it.

343
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,800
I hope

344
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,400
Yes

345
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,640
Don't hurt your own people.

346
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,960
You have hurt everyone.

347
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,760
Yes

348
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,680
Besides yourself,

349
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,760
Everyone stepped on it.

350
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,280
Really

351
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,360
When he hit your brother, he targeted us.

352
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,800
That's right.

353
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,920
No

354
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,880
I didn't mean that.

355
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,200
No

356
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,320
In the kindergarten,

357
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,200
With a white face.

358
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,520
Everyone is talking about

359
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,080
I'm a bad person.

360
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,760
I did bad things.

361
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
How can you prove that you did this?

362
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
How can you prove that you did this?

363
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,720
Besides his own confession,

364
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,440
Is there any evidence?

365
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,480
That grandma died on the spot.

366
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,600
He was alone.

367
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,120
We are connected.

368
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,320
But I didn't see you clearly.

369
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,360
You didn't see me clearly.

370
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,920
I'm really bad.

371
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,840
I'm a bad person.

372
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,360
No, I'm a bad person.

373
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,360
I'll explain.

374
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,480
I just threw out a logic.

375
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,840
It means to find yourself.

376
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,440
And this pollen allergy.

377
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,920
The difference of this woman

378
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,720
Then, at that time,

379
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,480
When you scared the old lady,

380
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,560
To do this.

381
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,040
This woman can't do it.

382
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,160
You can see my

383
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,920
This video

384
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,320
In this video,

385
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,560
I put a pot of flowers.

386
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,200
therefore

387
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,480
This woman can't do this.

388
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,040
Actually, we have several methods.

389
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,520
Can be ruled out.

390
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,480
One is to replace this thing.

391
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,560
Second, he really died in his previous life.

392
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,840
Yes

393
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,800
There's another problem.

394
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,960
Can we still go?

395
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,440
Find a way to go with everyone's family.

396
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,400
To verify this matter.

397
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,800
Just because Agent Teng

398
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,280
To verify his family.

399
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,960
Did you die in the previous round?

400
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,680
This matter

401
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,400
I think it's possible

402
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,240
Narrow down the range.

403
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes. Actually, I have ruled her out.

404
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,720
Actually, it's because of

405
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,080
The girl who came here.

406
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,200
What is it?

407
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,320
The girl who came here.

408
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,240
Come on, doll.

409
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,080
The girl who came here.

410
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,320
The girl who came here.

411
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,400
Boys and girls.

412
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,280
The girl who came here.

413
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,960
The only way to prove she's really dead.

414
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
It's him.

415
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,240
Right?

416
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,520
She might have died in her previous life.

417
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,560
In my previous life, I used to pretend to be dead.

418
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,120
We really don't know.

419
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,400
Because the five of us are dead.

420
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,160
But I have to be really dead.

421
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,640
My husband can get me back.

422
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,480
If I didn't die,

423
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,040
You can't come back.

424
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Because

425
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,240
She went from the ninth floor of Apartment 11

426
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,080
Jumping from a building.

427
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,640
January 2025

428
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,280
I've really got

429
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,000
A piece of paper on how to travel through time and space.

430
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,960
So I decided

431
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,200
To reset the secret of time.

432
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,000
To share with you.

433
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,960
Let us who lost the most important person

434
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,000
A chance to save him.

435
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,520
So in my heart,

436
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:35,880
Be good at (your status).

437
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,040
Or the four of us?

438
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,240
Actually, the problem lies with you two.

439
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,040
The two of them.

440
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,200
Coco, you have to save yourself now.

441
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,080
Where are you exactly?

442
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,440
Is to prove you

443
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,560
First, you have to ask me.

444
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,360
How to prove it?

445
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,960
My subscription number is mine.

446
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,560
Is actually very difficult.

447
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
Because everyone

448
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,400
How are you going to prove it?

449
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,680
Your evidence is yours.

450
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,400
And then I think

451
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,360
I'm a little bit

452
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
What's more embarrassing is that

453
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,080
On the 29th,

454
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,760
We are talking together.

455
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,600
Three years ago,

456
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,040
The big secret,

457
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Because I'm the one

458
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,720
To the cusp of the storm.

459
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,800
And confirmed his cross-dressing habit.

460
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,600
Mine is actually very obvious.

461
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,400
So everyone

462
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,960
I didn't ask many questions.

463
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,720
So I have a lot of

464
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,360
Is my own business.

465
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,880
I didn't tell her.

466
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,360
Why should I open the shop?

467
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,960
Because when I was five years old, my mother

468
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,080
And passed away.

469
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,560
Aunt Zhou.

470
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,280
When I was ten years old,

471
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,720
Passed away.

472
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,160
I don't have anyone

473
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,480
So of course I have to make money.

474
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,200
And my dream

475
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,240
Has always been a chocolate factory.

476
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,160
I came here because it's cheap.

477
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,040
We're all here with discount coupons.

478
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,280
Then I want to say,

479
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,840
I don't care about Miss Lou.

480
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,720
Because I actually have a chance

481
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
You can tell everyone.

482
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,400
The murderer.

483
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,000
Not Miss Lou.

484
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,520
Because I didn't film him.

485
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,760
After the announcement,

486
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,720
And then everyone thought

487
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,160
He is a murderer.

488
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,480
Actually, I think

489
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,400
I did something for justice.

490
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,360
He's a murderer anyway.

491
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,120
I think he should be exposed to the internet.

492
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,800
So I didn't...

493
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,960
Any follow-up treatment.

494
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,520
This is what I want.

495
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,840
The bad thing I did.

496
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
There's one more thing.

497
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,640
If you follow this calculation,

498
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,960
Actually,

499
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,760
Should be on the same charge.

500
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,240
Obviously,

501
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,280
I already have one.

502
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,600
It's obvious that the case is there.

503
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,520
Besides, Nanny Qi is here.

504
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,480
It's the same thing

505
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,160
It doesn't matter.

506
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,920
This label

507
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,640
Is actually a subjective act.

508
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,480
We can't stand on our own side.

509
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,000
What mistake did we make?

510
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,680
We should stand on the goose.

511
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,400
And the little one.

512
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
In their eyes,

513
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,640
What's wrong with us?

514
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,960
What does it say?

515
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
He might just think

516
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,000
Zhou Keke is violent.

517
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,440
I'll leave you there.

518
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,200
He thought

519
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,880
It doesn't mean that

520
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,040
His perspective on us

521
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,200
From his perspective, he thinks

522
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,760
For example,

523
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,800
cocoa

524
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,440
Can you say something else?

525
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,960
It can prove that

526
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,800
Yes

527
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,480
Or is there

528
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,440
What? Your exclusive habit.

529
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,839
Or

530
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,440
Only belong to you.

531
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,960
First of all, the voice of the video is mine.

532
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,760
Hello, everyone.

533
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,520
This is the Sweet Honey Restaurant.

534
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:16,920
There's another one.

535
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,000
It's my chat record with Diao Mei.

536
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,680
All transfer records

537
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,760
The so-called transaction process

538
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,839
Coco, which orphanage are you in?

539
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,160
what

540
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,360
I'm at Little Star Orphanage.

541
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,080
It's beautiful.

542
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,760
Little sun.

543
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,400
Little sun.

544
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,960
What about you?

545
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,880
Little moon.

546
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,280
I'm Tui Municipal Welfare Institute.

547
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,320
I'm also from the welfare center.

548
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,600
You were in an orphanage.

549
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,160
The three of you

550
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,040
The three of us are the same place.

551
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,240
I haven't seen you before.

552
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,760
I haven't seen you two.

553
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,680
It's been changed.

554
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,280
This is

555
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,160
to make sense

556
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,760
I really want to ask Liu Xia's question.

557
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,360
For example, in your family,

558
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,680
The one you cut is...

559
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,120
Having a building is just...

560
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
We can pass without building.

561
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
In the screenshot,

562
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,600
Actually,

563
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,400
He never said a word.

564
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,480
Yes

565
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,240
You planted it on me for no reason.

566
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,280
What do you mean?

567
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,960
Because I've been suspecting you.

568
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,360
Make fun of

569
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,320
So you are an emo.

570
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,840
No

571
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,680
I want to prove to you that

572
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,440
What is it?

573
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,280
I think there's a problem.

574
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,120
We neglected

575
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,440
You were talking about the orphanage.

576
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,560
I think someone who came from an orphanage

577
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,920
Is lying to us.

578
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,520
He's not from the welfare home.

579
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,600
Because he's from a happy family.

580
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:37,960
Yes

581
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,880
What about him?

582
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,280
His job is to repair the map.

583
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,560
His thing is for his cross-dressing.

584
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,960
And found a complete image.

585
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,680
The two of them

586
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,480
He has a witness, a pickpocket.

587
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,840
But the witness is dead.

588
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,680
He didn't have any witness to fix the map.

589
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,000
To prove that Liu Sheng

590
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,360
Who helped them do this.

591
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,120
Is dead.

592
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,280
good

593
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,160
You can either

594
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,920
The man's name.

595
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,040
On your test board now.

596
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,400
It's finished.

597
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,720
Come on.

598
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,400
I'll give you a countdown.

599
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,920
Do not

600
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,960
This is not good.

601
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,280
Don't worry, brother.

602
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,320
At this point,

603
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,600
Just do it.

604
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,520
Is everyone ready?

605
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,080
It's done.

606
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,880
The last suspense of the season.

607
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,720
Ready, brothers.

608
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,880
I can't either.

609
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,680
I really...

610
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,360
No, my heart can't stand it.

611
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,520
I can't stand it.

612
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,440
My heart is failing.

613
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,520
It's done.

614
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,480
If everyone writes it,

615
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,240
I'm three, two, one.

616
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,680
Show it together.

617
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,040
The person you suspect

618
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:16,880
three

619
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,160
two

620
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,160
one

621
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,920
Please shine.

622
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,680
Actually, I have a message here.

623
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,720
To provide it to everyone.

624
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,240
Ten years ago,

625
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,000
Madam Lou.

626
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,520
Was in our apartment 11.

627
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,360
And sent it.

628
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,280
A time capsule.

629
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,800
Come on.

630
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,200
This is the place

631
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,000
The time capsule of the owner's deposit office.

632
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,600
In here,

633
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,840
And hid Lou's mother.

634
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,040
To the happy family.

635
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,320
What the children said.

636
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,000
therefore

637
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,680
inside

638
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,320
Must also contain

639
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,880
The gosling you're looking for

640
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
So this could be

641
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,360
The next step is to find the gosling.

642
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,400
There will be some help.

643
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,440
I'll go first.

644
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,240
To Xiao Te.

645
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,360
Naughty Ted.

646
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,600
You loved it when you were little.

647
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,680
And drink real fruit, red pomelo, Siji Chun.

648
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,400
And listen to my story.

649
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,760
To the small room.

650
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,160
This is small.

651
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,760
Sister Bao.

652
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,640
To Xiao.

653
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,400
But you are also the most afraid of the dark.

654
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,360
I hope you can find

655
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,520
The light in the dark

656
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,920
To guide you.

657
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,120
He's Buddha.

658
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,080
I'm not Buddha.

659
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,560
You scared me to death.

660
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,360
No, this is what I saw.

661
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,720
Could it be Liu?

662
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:45,920
Let's go.

663
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,280
I have the key information.

664
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,320
To the gosling.

665
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,520
Dear Gosling,

666
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,200
When I was young, Madam Lou and Miss Lou

667
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,520
With real fruit, red pomelo, four seasons and spring.

668
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,040
To the children of the Happy Home.

669
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,880
Love and company

670
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,400
Later, Lou's mother

671
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,120
The real fruit, the red pomelo and the spring season.

672
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,240
Into a time capsule.

673
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,520
And hope that

674
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,360
With real fruit, red pomelo, four seasons and spring.

675
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,520
A familiar taste.

676
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,840
Can open the children's memory of time and space.

677
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,920
This is what Madam Lou

678
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,800
Left in the property deposit office.

679
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,720
The result of the voting just now

680
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,680
There are two people you suspect the most.

681
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,920
If everyone writes it,

682
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,680
I'm three, two, one.

683
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,120
Show it together.

684
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,400
The person you suspect

685
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,360
three

686
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,600
two

687
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,160
one

688
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:21,920
Please shine.

689
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,400
Guo Baoyou is the suspect of Zhou Keke.

690
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,320
Come on.

691
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,400
Did you change it?

692
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,520
as well as

693
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,680
Our Ke Wuku

694
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,560
Three votes.

695
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,440
You suspect that Liu's father

696
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,680
There are also three votes.

697
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,480
Three bowls of white.

698
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,200
Song Meili

699
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,960
And Zhou Keke.

700
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,920
You can decide to let them

701
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,960
Who wants to test it?

702
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,800
I'll go first.

703
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,560
good

704
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,000
a row

705
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,880
Old Liu, come here.

706
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,160
Come on.

707
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,960
Okay, then you decide.

708
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,040
Liu will come down first.

709
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,720
We decided to give it a try.

710
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,120
Can we play it together?

711
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,480
Can't be together.

712
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,680
red

713
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,000
Three times.

714
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,200
It must be a mistake.

715
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,720
wrong

716
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,600
It didn't open.

717
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,400
I didn't open it.

718
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,320
That's Zhou Keke.

719
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,960
Not really.

720
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,240
It's opened.

721
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,080
yes

722
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,520
Because I just heard that

723
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,320
Among you,

724
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,080
There's a mole.

725
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,240
We just need to point out

726
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,360
What I did

727
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,240
That woman?

728
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,840
I can't do it.

729
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,240
I have a witness.

730
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,480
Hey, Kai.

731
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,040
If I didn't die,

732
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,880
You can't come back.

733
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,120
You can see my

734
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,880
This video

735
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,880
In this video,

736
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,200
I put a pot of flowers.

737
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,000
therefore

738
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,280
This woman can't do this.

739
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,160
I think someone who came from an orphanage

740
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,240
Is lying to us.

741
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,280
He's not from the welfare home.

742
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,480
Because he's from a happy family.

743
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,160
This is the place

744
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,880
When she was adopted by the Cao family.

745
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,160
Then I think Ke Wuku and Bai San Wan

746
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,440
Their stories are connected.

747
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,600
So there's nothing wrong with them.

748
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,920
No

749
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,600
what

750
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,600
It's him.

751
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,240
What is this?

752
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,080
uncle

753
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,640
This is our rooftop.

754
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
uncle

755
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,760
The question mark sculpture.

756
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,360
There's a letter.

757
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,160
You want a second chance?

758
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,720
I'm from the future.

759
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,960
After a long time,

760
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,360
We have

761
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,280
In a special magnetic environment,

762
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,320
The ability to reset time.

763
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,400
In time and space,

764
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,000
The first person I met.

765
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,560
Call me Madam Lou.

766
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,480
She missed it every day.

767
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,440
The late daughter.

768
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,920
I asked her if she wanted to go back

769
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,200
When my daughter was still here,

770
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,200
But she said

771
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,160
Life is always moving forward.

772
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,280
Then I came across

773
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,120
A toy that can't bear to die.

774
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,520
He chose to start over.

775
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,400
After him,

776
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,440
A tenacious agent.

777
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,040
And chose to start over.

778
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,640
Now?

779
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,000
It's your turn to choose.

780
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,240
If you want to reset the time,

781
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,560
The question mark

782
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,720
To the corresponding grid.

783
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,680
You can activate the reset time device.

784
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,440
Take you back to this day three years ago.

785
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,320
To make up for what you did wrong.

786
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,560
We actually have a choice.

787
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,960
We can have a game.

788
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,960
Time reset

789
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,320
Three years ago today,

790
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:08,920
So we are now

791
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,240
To make a choice.

792
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,040
Are we going back?

793
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,200
The Reasoning Team.

794
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,440
I succeeded in revenge.

795
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,480
It didn't work out.

796
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:37,960
No

797
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,720
What he means is,

798
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,520
We finally admit it.

799
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,560
Our own mistakes.

800
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:40,920
Yes

801
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,200
Actually, I thought I was very happy.

802
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,800
Because of us.

803
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,080
We play together every day.

804
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,360
Eat together

805
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,240
Are actually very happy.

806
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,040
But actually,

807
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,160
During the whole process,

808
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,200
It's very painful.

809
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,160
then

810
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,000
Go on.

811
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
The place where we grew up.

812
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,080
When I was in a happy home,

813
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,400
actually

814
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
I miss Lou.

815
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,320
Mom

816
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,360
Mom

817
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,320
Mom

818
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,920
I think...

819
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,400
I'm sorry, Madam Lou and Miss Lou.

820
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,240
And then I think

821
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,320
I don't deserve to use it again.

822
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,240
The ability that Lou's mother left me,

823
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,760
Because I don't want to.

824
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,440
With this guilty mood,

825
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,840
And self-blame.

826
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
Go back to the past.

827
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,800
So I'm going to use this power

828
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,680
To you.

829
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,600
I hope you can go back.

830
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,680
Can make up for all the mistakes you made.

831
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,120
You can go back and save it again.

832
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,520
The people you want to save

833
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,480
Even if I have to say goodbye,

834
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:23,960
Is also good.

835
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,560
therefore

836
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,360
I'll give you this special ability.

837
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,200
I will stay here forever.

838
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,560
I hope you will always be light.

839
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,400
It's always hot.

840
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,000
Bye

841
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,360
Bai Song, Guo Zhou and Liu are bitter.

842
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:51,720
Come on.

843
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,120
We're

844
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,320
Zhou Zhou gave it to all of us.

845
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,000
Let's put it on the top together.

846
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,480
Let's go back to the past.

847
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,240
And make up for ourselves.

848
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,160
The mistake I made.

849
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,520
Yes

850
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,080
all right?

851
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,120
You will remember it in the future.

852
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,360
Is there someone named Zhou Keke?

853
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,680
Wait for us.

854
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,880
Our memory will stay here.

855
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,040
We will remember Zhou Keke.

856
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,800
But there are many times in life.

857
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,520
But not every goodbye

858
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,240
We will meet again.

859
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,200
I hope you can remember it in the future.

860
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,440
In this place,

861
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,840
There's another one named Zhou Keke.

862
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,960
I hope you won't be like me.

863
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,000
Room 702.

864
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,920
Zhoukeke

865
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,840
You can do anything.

866
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,960
We're

867
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,360
Bai Song, Guo Zhou,

868
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,120
why

869
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,880
Liu1cool

870
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,000
Bye

871
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,760
So sad.

872
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:07,600
sorry

873
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,800
sorry

874
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,719
My bold partner

875
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,280
I'm afraid there's someone here, you know?

876
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,199
Don't scare me like this.

877
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:31,679
No

878
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,120
It's dark. It doesn't matter.

879
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,760
But no one else is here.

880
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,560
It's quite neat.

881
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,960
Did you two practice it?

882
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,120
sorry

883
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,679
That's it.

884
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,280
Bye

885
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,719
Let's go.

886
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,200
We'll be on the return train.

887
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,280
Bye

888
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,240
We will still be neighbors.

889
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,360
And reorganized a detective team.

890
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,520
We can do better.

891
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,440
More meaningful things.

892
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,000
If we go back,

893
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,960
Are our memories still there?

894
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,720
Of course.

895
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,800
To reset the memory of three years.

896
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,520
Without you,

897
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,120
We can only have Bai Song.

898
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,440
It's Bai Song.

899
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,000
Zhou is gone.

900
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,800
Bai Song is out of time.

901
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,800
Yes, I need you.

902
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,640
We will find you when we come back.

903
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,360
There's no way Liu Yi will suffer, right?

904
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,160
There's nothing bitter about Zhou Liu.

905
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,040
Come on.

906
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,600
According to our plan,

907
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,440
The return ticket.

908
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,200
We met three years ago.

909
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,840
Three years ago.

910
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,800
Bye, Zhou Ke.

911
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,160
Bye

912
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,600
I'm really afraid of the dark and lonely.

913
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,440
Give me a shoulder.

914
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,400
With a shoulder, he will follow me.

915
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,880
I don't deserve it.

916
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,520
You can go.

917
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,240
Okay, then.

918
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,160
Let's go, friends.

919
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,520
The door is open.

920
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,120
Everyone, take a look.

921
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,480
Bye.

922
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:07,960
Bye.

923
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,640
cocoa

924
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,360
Bye

925
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,680
Let's go.

926
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,440
Let's go.

927
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,640
Poor thing.

928
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,240
That's amazing.

929
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,040
The closest person to us

930
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,280
Go back to the past through the door of time and space.

931
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,800
And saved our lives.

932
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,080
I decided to fight before you.

933
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,840
Killed the butler.

934
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,680
That way, you won't

935
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,040
For killing someone.

936
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,600
And committed suicide.

937
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,640
If it wasn't for my selfishness,

938
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,120
You wouldn't have

939
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,560
With such a tragic ending.

940
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,160
The moon of Cao.

941
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,880
I finally meet you again.

942
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,080
I knew it.

943
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,920
You're not dead.

944
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,960
Your brother Hao Bao Jie and I

945
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,120
Will always be with you.

946
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,760
We won't let you

947
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,800
And committed suicide.

948
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,640
You know,

949
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
We all love you.

950
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,160
Why did he jump to commit suicide?

951
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
I promised Brother Cry.

952
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,880
To protect his two brothers.

953
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,080
This time,

954
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,880
I want to find Ke Wuku earlier.

955
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,080
From now on,

956
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,160
Restart

957
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,320
I will treasure every day of our lives.

958
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:21,760
This time,

959
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,640
I must make Song Meili happy.

960
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,040
Since this day,

961
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,960
And start all over again.

962
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,400
This time,

963
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,040
We will use the same way.

964
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,720
Go back to the beginning of the story.

965
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,000
To stop any false start.

966
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,040
And took her phone.

967
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,160
Wallet

968
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,520
And took the three jade.

969
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,040
I will definitely sell it.

970
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,000
She hit her head on a stone.

971
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
He died on the spot.

972
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,360
How did this girl die?

973
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,600
Was killed by Miss Lou.

974
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,600
The jade three-piece suit is sold.

975
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,040
I sent him

976
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,800
To the woods.

977
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,960
Is to

978
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,240
To frame him.

979
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,240
I'll go there.

980
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,160
And scared Madam Lou.

981
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,280
We are not good people.

982
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,960
For the last time.

983
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,720
The melody you taught me

984
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,280
I should be with this desperate world.

985
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,800
Goodbye.

986
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,440
We are all murderers.

987
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,960
This time,

988
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
We can definitely rewrite the tragedy.

989
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,680
Apartment No. 11 is for sale.

990
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,920
30 July 2019

991
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,120
So we're really back.

992
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,200
Miss Lou is in class.

993
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,720
408

994
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,280
Let's go.

995
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,920
Does he not know us?

996
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,120
It's possible.

997
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,800
It's possible that

998
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,000
Didn't know us three years ago.

999
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,520
Hello

1000
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:47,920
This friend

1001
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,120
Hello.

1002
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,320
gosling

1003
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,960
Who are you?

1004
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,400
Are you a gosling?

1005
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,120
But who are you?

1006
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,640
Why are you here?

1007
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,280
Because we thought

1008
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,800
This place looks very familiar.

1009
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,720
Pretty good

1010
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,040
That's right.

1011
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,320
Because we heard the music.

1012
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,600
So I want to have a look.

1013
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,040
Who is playing the piano?

1014
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,120
Who is playing the piano?

1015
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,440
Do you also like that song?

1016
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,080
I like it very much.

1017
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,760
Very familiar.

1018
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,320
Very familiar.

1019
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,920
Yes

1020
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,040
That's good.

1021
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,400
We just moved in.

1022
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,840
You're in a happy home.

1023
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,800
In apartment 11,

1024
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
We'll be neighbors from now on.

1025
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,120
Where are you staying?

1026
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,440
I'm in the happy home.

1027
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,440
indeed

1028
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,880
You're the only one at home.

1029
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,680
Yeah, how do you know?

1030
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,480
My name.

1031
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,760
Many children said that

1032
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,760
He said that we have a kid named Gosling.

1033
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,560
And loves to make friends.

1034
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,760
And said he had a good personality.

1035
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,280
So we said

1036
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,360
I came to say hello to you.

1037
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,480
We'll be neighbors.

1038
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,280
You can take care of her.

1039
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,000
good

1040
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,880
Thank you

1041
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,440
Nothing

1042
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,840
By the way, I forgot to tell you.

1043
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,680
We are all detectives.

1044
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,880
If there's any difficult problem,

1045
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,400
You can find us.

1046
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,240
detective

1047
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
That's right.

1048
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,680
good

1049
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,360
Thank you

1050
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,360
Welcome, everyone.

1051
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,000
To Tencent Video.

1052
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,320
There's tea and fruit.

1053
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
Milk is more delicious.

1054
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,960
The real fruit, red pomelo, the Spring Festival.

1055
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,440
The exclusive title broadcast.

1056
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,560
Immersive drama experience reality show

1057
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,360
Start reasoning.

1058
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,520
A man who knows his face but doesn't know his heart.

1059
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,640
I thought this sigh

1060
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,760
To the show.

1061
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,760
How to do it?

1062
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,080
It's hard to be a human.

1063
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,040
Who is this person?

1064
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,360
Why did you touch me just now?

1065
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,360
Why are you here with us?

1066
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,120
The fragrance of tea meets the fruit.

1067
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,360
Milk is more delicious.

1068
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,200
Congratulations. You've completed it.

1069
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,000
All the drama of Apartment 11.

1070
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Let us raise our hands

1071
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,840
Super delicious fruit, red pomelo, Sijichun.

1072
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,600
Let's toast together, friend.

1073
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,320
In this case,

1074
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,800
Everyone needs to come down from the White Three Bowls.

1075
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,080
Guo Bao You, Ke Wu Bitter Week,

1076
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,680
Song Meili, of the six,

1077
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,600
To lock the real Avengers.

1078
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,800
The result is three to three.

1079
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,600
Liu Xia and Zhou Keke are on a par.

1080
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,360
The final result is known to all.

1081
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,760
The real goose.

1082
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,680
Is Zhou Keke.

1083
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,360
congratulations

1084
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,120
Congratulations.

1085
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,520
I was embarrassed.

1086
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,520
sorry

1087
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,920
You're amazing.

1088
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,000
The decisive evidence you missed.

1089
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,040
When we searched Lou's house,

1090
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,560
In Madam Lou's house,

1091
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,360
There are some wool and cloth.

1092
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,040
Some of them are made of Zhou Bao Bao cloth.

1093
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,960
Really?

1094
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,320
Because in Zhou Keke's story,

1095
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,800
Madam Lou used to help him.

1096
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,360
I've patched my Bao Bao.

1097
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,080
Yes

1098
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:47,760
Where are the materials?

1099
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,360
I want to go back and have a look.

1100
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,840
By Madam Lou's bedside.

1101
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,400
There is a basket full of cloth and wool.

1102
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,720
Song's beautiful, turn over.

1103
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,800
You're really a master craftsman.

1104
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,640
You're really

1105
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,120
It's handmade.

1106
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,520
super!

1107
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,360
How did you make this?

1108
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,360
Old swan.

1109
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,120
"Kill people" doesn't mean

1110
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,800
Alright

1111
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,360
we

1112
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,360
just

1113
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,840
Beautiful. Thank you.

1114
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,360
Thank you

1115
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,520
This is killing people.

1116
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,160
And on Zhou Keke,

1117
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,160
And I was exposed to the Moodiness.

1118
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,040
The traces of the blue liquid

1119
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,840
where

1120
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,200
Where is it?

1121
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,520
On the sleeve,

1122
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,880
We've been unkempt all day.

1123
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,200
Look, there's something on my leg.

1124
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,280
408 dust

1125
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,040
Now,

1126
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,400
The blue liquid.

1127
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,760
This one?

1128
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,600
Yes

1129
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,080
Because Madam Bao was caught.

1130
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,760
This morning,

1131
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,080
And escaped.

1132
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,920
So in the bookstore office,

1133
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,760
To appear.

1134
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,320
The blue "no crying" liquid

1135
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,440
Zhou Keke made it herself.

1136
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,440
You're amazing.

1137
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,920
It's okay.

1138
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,640
Uncle, what a face!

1139
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,480
To see your father.

1140
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,160
My grandfather.

1141
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,680
So I didn't go with you.

1142
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,880
To myself.

1143
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,960
Denounce him severely.

1144
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,560
So the photo in the room

1145
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,680
At Kai's place.

1146
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,800
Uncle Li's photo.

1147
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,160
Because Xiao Kai has been regretting.

1148
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,520
And killed Xiao Xiao.

1149
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,200
therefore

1150
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,920
Is investigating the story of Pomelo See You.

1151
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,520
In the end,

1152
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,960
And I believe in the story of crossing.

1153
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,720
So I jumped on the ninth floor.

1154
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,480
The story of apartment 11.

1155
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,720
Is a warm ending.

1156
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,440
Everyone back to 2019.

1157
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,760
And completed the redemption.

1158
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,400
And Coco said it very well.

1159
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,440
He heard we were going back

1160
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,040
2019

1161
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,120
To correct our own mistakes.

1162
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,840
He thought he had succeeded in revenge.

1163
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,600
The real revenge.

1164
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,640
You don't have to punish the evil with evil.

1165
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,040
Yes

1166
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,320
Let them realize their own evil.

1167
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,800
And be able to turn over a new leaf.

1168
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,800
I think this is also

1169
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,520
Yes

1170
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,360
A good home.

1171
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,960
Let's welcome the right one.

1172
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,720
To get the golden key behind you.

1173
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,920
Please welcome the children of the Qiao family.

1174
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,360
To reunite.

1175
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,920
Come on. Move forward.

1176
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,760
No, but

1177
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,400
Go to the front.

1178
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:03,960
Right now,

1179
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,560
Life should face the storm.

1180
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,720
Congratulations.

1181
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,480
Okay, let's applaud.

1182
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,720
Welcome our old friend.

1183
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,960
China University of Political Science and Law

1184
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,360
Professor of Criminal Psychology

1185
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,840
Professor Ma Ai.

1186
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,640
Miss Ma.

1187
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,480
Hello.

1188
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,160
Hello, Miss Ma.

1189
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,720
Thank you, Miss Ma.

1190
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,440
Hello, Miss Ma.

1191
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,040
Congratulations on your success.

1192
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:26,640
Yes

1193
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:27,880
Miss Ma.

1194
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,040
In an age where position is before fact,

1195
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,480
We might be seeing

1196
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,560
There are many things

1197
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,480
There's already one.

1198
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,160
When you're very subjective,

1199
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,480
And this matter

1200
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,480
May be mixed with

1201
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,560
A lot of information.

1202
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,160
How can I

1203
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,040
You can make yourself

1204
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,240
Stay unaffected.

1205
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,200
And finally restore it.

1206
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,760
The most complete truth?

1207
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,120
This is why you are so good.

1208
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,000
What young people think now

1209
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,600
Don't look.

1210
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,160
Many old people

1211
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,120
He really didn't think so.

1212
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,160
What's the reason?

1213
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,600
Because this information

1214
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,560
Brought us

1215
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,960
A lot of changes.

1216
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,480
In our generation,

1217
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,240
A lot of information is simple.

1218
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,440
Especially in our opinion,

1219
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,640
Is the authoritative information.

1220
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,000
Then the black and white printed on the newspaper

1221
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,680
You have to believe it.

1222
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,400
Can it be wrong?

1223
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,080
You must believe what the box says.

1224
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,120
Yes, it's said in the box.

1225
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,080
You have to believe it on TV.

1226
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,400
Yes

1227
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,720
Including some old people who said

1228
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,240
It's said on the Internet.

1229
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:25,520
Yes

1230
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,320
The phone said

1231
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,400
It also said that

1232
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,720
Major news.

1233
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,000
Yes

1234
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,240
Don't you believe me?

1235
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,800
Yes

1236
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,720
Fortunately, you young people already know

1237
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,360
You can't believe everything.

1238
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,640
This is an improvement in concept.

1239
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,680
The second one.

1240
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,320
All the information

1241
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,200
Could be the truth.

1242
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,400
But more often,

1243
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,360
Is built by people.

1244
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,280
And in the internet age,

1245
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,480
There's a problem.

1246
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,800
This person

1247
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,520
Only a little bit.

1248
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,920
But he can draw a face for you.

1249
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,480
To each of our audiences.

1250
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,560
It's easy for us to believe it.

1251
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,920
When we were at school,

1252
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,680
When teaching students,

1253
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,120
I often ask them to do six investigations.

1254
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,080
One

1255
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,800
Check whether the source of the news is official.

1256
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,240
reliable

1257
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,040
The second one.

1258
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,840
Check the author's information.

1259
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,000
The third one.

1260
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,160
Check the date of publication.

1261
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,360
Fourth

1262
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,120
Check the data.

1263
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,360
When you say something,

1264
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,040
You can't just make arguments.

1265
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,400
You have to have an argument.

1266
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,120
argument

1267
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:29,920
Your arguments

1268
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,000
Is what the law says.

1269
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,120
If you have enough evidence,

1270
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,160
I might believe you more.

1271
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,000
Next,

1272
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,840
Check the experts' opinions.

1273
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,200
What others say,

1274
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,120
Other people's comments on this matter.

1275
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,400
The last point.

1276
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,320
Check yourself.

1277
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,800
Do you have this preference?

1278
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,040
To put it simply,

1279
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,440
Are you natural?

1280
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,600
Agreed with him.

1281
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,680
At that time, you should pay attention to

1282
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,960
It's not because

1283
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,600
His opinion suits your taste.

1284
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,600
I trusted him.

1285
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,080
We want to go together.

1286
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,600
I trusted him.

1287
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,720
So this is what we teach our classmates

1288
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,120
The sixth method

1289
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,120
To make yourself aware of the truth of a message.

1290
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,480
Or a mistake?

1291
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,920
There is a basic judgment.

1292
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,560
to receive instruction

1293
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,960
On this network,

1294
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,600
We should pay special attention to

1295
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,960
The dichotomy between black and white.

1296
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,480
We should advocate

1297
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,360
More objective.

1298
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,560
There's evidence.

1299
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,280
To analyze everything and everyone.

1300
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,440
Understood

1301
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,040
Miss Ma.

1302
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,320
How to treat this kind of avengers.

1303
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,000
To take revenge with extreme tactics.

1304
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,120
The practice of using violence against violence

1305
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,800
It's called homogenous revenge.

1306
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,960
Or self-help.

1307
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,440
And solve it in your own way.

1308
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,520
He believes that it should be the law

1309
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,680
To solve the problem.

1310
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,200
Actually,

1311
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,800
Everyone can understand.

1312
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,160
Yes

1313
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,440
But we also know that

1314
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,480
You hate crime.

1315
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,680
Because you...

1316
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,560
Or family.

1317
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,480
Is the victim of a crime.

1318
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,960
If you use a criminal method,

1319
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,840
To commit crimes against these people.

1320
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,600
Is actually

1321
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,160
To hurt others and benefit yourself.

1322
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,440
This kind of thing,

1323
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,640
Happened a lot.

1324
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,640
but

1325
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,800
In a civilized society,

1326
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,760
This kind of homogenous revenge,

1327
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,480
Should be less and less.

1328
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:19,800
Yes

1329
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,760
Everyone knows

1330
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,320
Since there are legal weapons,

1331
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,280
What are we doing?

1332
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,040
Don't punish him with law.

1333
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,200
To make more people

1334
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,720
To understand each other's evil.

1335
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,080
You did the same revenge thing.

1336
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,720
Will you find out?

1337
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,800
A lot of times,

1338
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,160
The whip has come to you again.

1339
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,800
Take it out on yourself.

1340
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,600
And the seed you planted is hatred.

1341
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,920
You want to kill him?

1342
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,960
He has children too.

1343
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,960
Yes

1344
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,920
He has his own family too.

1345
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,440
Vicious spiral

1346
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:45,840
Their mutual injuries were avenged on each other

1347
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,120
This vicious cycle

1348
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,280
Will bring you greater harm.

1349
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,880
Okay, we really appreciate it.

1350
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,600
Miss Ma Ai.

1351
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,800
To accompany the whole Apartment 11.

1352
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,600
All the stories.

1353
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,920
And gave us a lot.

1354
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,400
That we can't think about.

1355
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,400
To look at those problems.

1356
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,520
And gave us a lot of

1357
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,880
Approach and recommendations

1358
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,360
Then I still use the words of Miss Ma Ai.

1359
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,000
There's no difference in the size of the crime.

1360
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,680
We must maintain

1361
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,960
The ability to think independently.

1362
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,520
And embrace the beautiful tomorrow.

1363
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,720
Thank you, Miss Ma Ai.

1364
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,840
Thank you

1365
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,320
Thank you, Miss Ma.

1366
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,800
Thank you

1367
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,120
We have to say goodbye.

1368
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,520
We haven't seen each other next week.

1369
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,040
How to do it?

1370
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,080
Thank you, teachers.

1371
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,120
Thank you

1372
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,480
Take a group photo.

1373
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,240
good

1374
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,120
Three, two.

1375
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,840
Happy ending.

1376
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,160
Happy ending.

1377
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,920
What do you mean?

1378
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,280
Happy ending, teachers.

1379
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:55,960
good

1380
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,080
You scared me to death.

1381
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,320
Every one of these dolls

1382
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,600
The first episode.

1383
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,400
This is me.

1384
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,240
So cute.

1385
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,080
That's me in the middle.

1386
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,080
This should be Ke Muku.

1387
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:12,640
Yes

1388
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,120
This is my brother.

1389
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,720
Come on, cut it.

1390
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,640
We are on the same hand.

1391
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,200
That's it.

1392
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:23,960
come

1393
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,240
We pass the power to him.

1394
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,080
come

1395
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:26,840
How about this?

1396
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:29,840
Pass it to him.

1397
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,880
Pass the internal power to him.

1398
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,640
This is

1399
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,920
What about the group wedding?

1400
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,480
Three, two.

1401
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,360
good

1402
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,320
very good

1403
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:49,680
come

1404
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,200
Thank you

1405
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,240
Teachers, do you remember

1406
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,800
The goal you set before you started?

1407
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,440
Here comes the bill.

1408
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,480
I'm leaving.

1409
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,240
I'm really leaving.

1410
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,640
I never set a goal.

1411
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,040
Please answer the following questions.

1412
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,960
This is the first day.

1413
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,640
In the reasoning building,

1414
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,320
And set up a mystery case.

1415
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,840
Waiting for you to reveal the truth.

1416
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,680
Please predict your accuracy.

1417
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,200
Correct rate.

1418
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,200
Why are they all here?

1419
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,640
More than 90%.

1420
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,560
Gone with the wind.

1421
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,960
"Gone with the wind", Liu.

1422
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,080
if

1423
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,840
In the end,

1424
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,760
If you can't reach the correct rate,

1425
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,640
Is there any punishment?

1426
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,200
If you can't reach it,

1427
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,520
I've been watching this show

1428
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,960
As long as I live,

1429
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,720
I will spend five minutes

1430
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,560
To promote our show.

1431
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,200
all right?

1432
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,040
To promote it.

1433
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,240
The correct rate is 100%.

1434
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,080
hundred

1435
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,720
If you don't reach one hundred percent,

1436
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,880
I regret it.

1437
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:58,800
60 percent.

1438
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,960
Insurance score.

1439
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,240
If you haven't reached

1440
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,280
With a 60 percent accuracy rate.

1441
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:06,720
You will...

1442
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:07,920
There should be.

1443
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,680
You have it.

1444
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,840
You didn't.

1445
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,440
I even ate three bowls of noodles.

1446
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,840
Waiting for your video log.

1447
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,040
I've reached 60.

1448
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,000
He should be.

1449
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,720
That's right.

1450
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,840
Is wrong.

1451
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,680
The correct rate

1452
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,600
It should be 50%.

1453
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,760
Am I right?

1454
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,200
If you don't reach 50%,

1455
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,360
Listen to this.

1456
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,880
I'll...

1457
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,560
To wash Guo Bao You's hair on the spot.

1458
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,480
Wash your hair with chocolate.

1459
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,680
To wash his hair with hot chocolate hotpot.

1460
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,160
Are you punishing him or me?

1461
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,200
therefore

1462
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,560
Guo Baoyou, I advise you to help me.

1463
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,280
To find the real murderer.

1464
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,400
Must be more than 50%.

1465
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,360
The correct rate is 50 to 50.

1466
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,760
If I'm wrong, it means

1467
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,120
This case is unreasonable.

1468
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,880
This case is unreasonable.

1469
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,520
Is that reasonable?

1470
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,880
To make you the murderer.

1471
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,840
that's right

1472
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,640
Is unreasonable.

1473
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,360
If the teammates can help,

1474
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,640
I think

1475
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,440
Is it OK?

1476
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,920
Can your teammates help you?

1477
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,440
Friends

1478
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,960
Why do I think

1479
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,760
Or conservatively estimating

1480
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
if

1481
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,000
These ten cases

1482
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:16,960
I can't break seven or eight.

1483
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,120
I'll come again next season.

1484
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,360
But he's really good.

1485
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:20,800
Really

1486
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,640
It's 50-50.

1487
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,720
It's 50.

1488
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,240
It's 50.

1489
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,080
You're too conservative.

1490
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,000
If not,

1491
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,880
I'll do five push-ups.

1492
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,360
Is that okay?

1493
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,880
I won.

1494
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,360
I've reached 60.

1495
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,280
Take a look.

1496
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,840
There's no such thing as 50 yuan.

1497
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,840
If I'm right tonight,

1498
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,480
I just...

1499
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,440
I only got four right.

1500
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,240
I'm going to wash your hair, Guo Baoyou.

1501
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:07,760
No

1502
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,040
I'll share one with you.

1503
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,680
Teachers,

1504
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,680
Really?

1505
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,840
You can claim your

1506
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,200
Guo Baoyou, you're done. Guo

1507
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,320
To wash his hair with hot chocolate hotpot.

1508
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,160
You can't.

1509
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,080
Are you playing this big?

1510
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,520
Really?

1511
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,440
This is

1512
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,080
contract

1513
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,680
Really?

1514
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,640
Really?

1515
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,240
Professor Ma,

1516
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,600
Someone wants to buy and sell it for me.

1517
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,240
What about this?

1518
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,160
Please welcome China University of Political Science and Law

1519
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,880
Professor of Criminal Psychology

1520
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,600
It's not like this.

1521
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,520
Is your own punishment.

1522
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,640
It's a reward.

1523
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,280
To reward yourself with a job next year.

1524
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,040
You're so talkative.

1525
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,120
You're right.

1526
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,400
It makes sense, right?

1527
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,440
Seems to be good.

1528
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,200
Really?

1529
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,040
What are you doing?

1530
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:15,560
Are you here?

1531
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,880
Hold on.

1532
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,720
I'm Guo Kirin.

1533
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,920
Voluntary and unconditional participation

1534
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,440
Start Reasoning Season 2

1535
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,520
The whole process.

1536
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,440
And reasoning.

1537
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,000
cautious

1538
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,600
search

1539
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,280
Pay attention to the details.

1540
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:26,920
Bold hypothesis.

1541
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,880
Be careful.

1542
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,200
Reel silk from cocoons -- make a painstaking investigation

1543
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,240
I'm here.

1544
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,480
Hold on.

1545
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,080
to wait a moment

1546
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,360
Let him sign the contract first.

1547
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,440
It's so long.

1548
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,120
When you move into the new house,

1549
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,200
No violence.

1550
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,600
To win the heart

1551
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,640
Not to be a backup.

1552
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,200
Try to find the suspect

1553
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,280
Don't drag your family with you.

1554
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,600
And try to

1555
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,480
Not falling into a loop.

1556
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,040
To swear by the sun.

1557
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:48,960
Why is it cloudy today?

1558
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,200
Is it a cloudy day?

1559
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,920
I want to use the moon as evidence.

1560
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,400
But it's not yet night.

1561
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,880
So I made this token under the lamp.

1562
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,560
If there is a violation,

1563
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,280
The representative work will never be published.

1564
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:58,960
You're so ruthless.

1565
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,840
I'll give you a thumbprint.

1566
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,960
You pressed a handprint.

1567
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,040
I signed it.

1568
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,200
It's locked.

1569
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:16,720
Which one is mine?

1570
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,080
This QR code is yours.

1571
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,520
Do you remember what you said before?

1572
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,720
As long as I live,

1573
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,440
I will spend five minutes

1574
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,400
To promote our show.

1575
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,280
Yes, I got two QR codes.

1576
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,200
This QR code

1577
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,640
Is the QR code of our program.

1578
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,480
all right?

1579
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,360
I'll take this back.

1580
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,320
In my studio.

1581
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,680
Brother, I want to have a bite.

1582
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,240
This is good.

1583
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,280
He's so happy.

1584
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,040
I want to finish it.

1585
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,000
Can I give you some punishment?

1586
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I can do that.

1587
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,480
good

1588
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,920
Great. Happy ending.

1589
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,520
Thank you

1590
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,920
Thank you.

1591
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,400
Let's go and wash your hair.

1592
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,240
Let's wash your hair.

1593
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,480
Start reasoning.

1594
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,520
The last interview.

1595
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,280
After this season,

1596
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:12,800
What is it?

1597
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,400
I think

1598
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,040
Apartment 11 gave me a chance.

1599
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:14,880
Apartment 11 gave me a chance.

1600
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,240
To accompany you.

1601
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,120
I used to...

1602
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,720
The Zhou Shen who wrapped himself

1603
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,960
To grow.

1604
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,040
In the end, we can see

1605
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,960
The happiest and kindest Zhou Keke

1606
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,120
Actually, I have the most direct feeling.

1607
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,160
I'm even happier.

1608
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,760
Actually, it has nothing to do

1609
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,280
Standing on the stage is similar.

1610
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,720
It's more and more meetings.

1611
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,440
Be happy and enjoy it.

1612
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,000
find

1613
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,200
Reasoning needs some rational thinking.

1614
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,320
But I'm extremely sensitive.

1615
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,960
I think this is exciting.

1616
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,200
Let me be the ultimate backer, okay?

1617
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,840
Let me

1618
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,160
And have a good time.

1619
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,440
At the same time,

1620
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,840
It can also make you think about

1621
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,040
It's just a sudden dream.

1622
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:53,880
It's like

1623
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,920
My name is Guo Baoyou.

1624
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,760
Zhoukeke

1625
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,720
It's cool.

1626
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,640
Three bowls of delivery cards.

1627
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,360
Beautiful.

1628
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,320
I'm Liu Xia.

1629
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,840
When you play this reasoning game,

1630
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,800
Actually, we have...

1631
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,400
And changed another identity.

1632
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,760
In this variety show,

1633
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,480
A rare experience.

1634
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,720
Dad

1635
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,240
You made me look so hard.

1636
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:13,760
A lifetime brother.

1637
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,720
A lifetime brother.

1638
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,200
this

1639
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,320
Thank you, brother.

1640
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:16,720
Thank you

1641
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,840
In the whole world,

1642
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,080
In the investigation,

1643
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,240
Some mechanisms.

1644
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,320
I remember it clearly.

1645
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,800
He went down.

1646
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,400
One, two, three.

1647
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,800
Is the experience of each of us.

1648
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,240
To me.

1649
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,520
Will give me a lot of memory points.

1650
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,440
It's easy to immerse.

1651
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,880
There are many surprises and surprises every time.

1652
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,520
I'm in Apartment 11.

1653
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:46,680
I'm in Apartment 11.

1654
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,440
To meet these brothers and sisters.

1655
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,600
I'm so happy.

1656
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,600
We started to

1657
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,120
Is becoming more and more familiar.

1658
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,800
I think it's kind of sweet.

1659
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:56,960
What we experienced

1660
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,640
It's really a lot.

1661
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,600
This kind of ups and downs,

1662
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,440
In the whole story,

1663
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,440
Support each other.

1664
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,400
We will soon become friends.

1665
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,760
Joey, when you get along with her, she will infect you.

1666
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,760
Her happiness.

1667
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,880
Guo Baoyou is very smart.

1668
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,360
Suddenly a lot of inspiration will come out.

1669
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,560
Miss Bai Yu is a very

1670
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,160
A little boy.

1671
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,520
Zhou Keke always takes his dolls.

1672
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,480
Come on.

1673
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,720
Very serious and active to find some clues.

1674
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,960
Cool. Although he's young,

1675
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,520
But there are still some calm people.

1676
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,320
I think I'm very

1677
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,080
I like it so much

1678
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,560
The team of Bai Song, Guo Zhou and Liu Ku

1679
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,560
We're

1680
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,040
Bai Song, Guo Zhou,

1681
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,680
Liu1cool

1682
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,520
Thank you for Apartment 11.

1683
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,280
Made me think a lot.

1684
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,480
Think about a lot of questions.

1685
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,360
Yes, and the problems

1686
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,800
It's all

1687
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,960
Nonfloating

1688
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:00,600
Although these cases

1689
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,120
Happened in our apartment 11.

1690
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,520
But actually from a certain perspective,

1691
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,280
Actually, every case

1692
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,040
Is really happening around us.

1693
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,800
The children at home have grown up.

1694
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,280
They won't communicate with you.

1695
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,520
So I'm living

1696
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,760
There's no one to talk to.

1697
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,880
I don't want to go back.

1698
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,280
So our generation of young people

1699
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,080
You should pay more attention to

1700
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:18,920
The old people at home.

1701
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,800
This spiritual need

1702
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,520
If your friends

1703
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,160
I met some unreasonable people.

1704
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,080
When you ask for something,

1705
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,640
I feel brave enough to refuse.

1706
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,640
Keep your eyes open and be rational.

1707
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,440
You should protect your privacy.

1708
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,840
To ensure the authenticity of this incident.

1709
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,520
Completeness

1710
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,360
As a journalist,

1711
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,960
I think the most important thing

1712
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,160
