1
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,680
Brother Bai, you really remind me of

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,080
that school bully from our student days

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,920
He said you don't study properly

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,560
Who?

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,760
Which school are you from?

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,280
I'm just a kid from the streets who hasn't gone to school much

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,920
just a little kid

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,720
a preschooler

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,880
He didn't even cry out

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,520
Let me try

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,560
Brother He

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,880
Take it and use it freely

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,800
Generous

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,880
Not even touching up my makeup

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,760
Let's start right today

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,480
Not even applying lipstick

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,040
Doesn't matter

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,840
Did you just check yourself in the mirror?

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,480
Thought your makeup looked good?

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,200
No

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,040
I really didn't

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm being completely sincere

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,200
I'm most afraid of this thing exploding

24
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,600
Me too

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,480
Then let's try

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,120
Zhou Keke

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,280
This is the most bizarre experience

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,840
I've encountered at work

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,000
These people...

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,680
They can't solve puzzles

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,760
Yet they can have fun with some stupid balloons for hours

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,880
Say goodbye to all your troubles

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,280
Say hello

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,360
Youth is full of unknown possibilities

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,640
What are the troubles of growing up?

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,080
Isn't this a nice school uniform?

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,320
I almost wore the same one as you

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,200
This exact set

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,400
I bought a Harry Potter

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,320
House uniform

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,240
Brother Bai, you really look like back in school days

42
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,800
The school bully

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,760
He said you didn't study properly

44
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,160
Who?

45
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,640
Today I'm going for the "old, weak, sick and disabled" look

46
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,560
"Old, weak, sick and disabled"

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,720
So I'm wearing this school uniform

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,840
To reminisce about youth

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,600
This classmate

50
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,280
Your beard

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,560
That beard is fierce

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,920
I told you it's the "old, weak, sick and disabled" look

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,920
What are these two doing?

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,720
Why aren't they here yet?

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,600
Touching up makeup

56
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Their makeup is quite...

57
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,480
They just arrived and haven't done it yet

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:30,920
Just (touching up makeup)

59
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,840
Haven't done it yet

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,760
Their makeup got messed up right away

61
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,200
Oh no, we're wearing the same shoes today.

62
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,800
One of you is in black, the other in white.

63
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,040
We're wearing matching shoes today.

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,000
Really?

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,640
Yes, really.

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,880
You're already so tall.

67
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,200
And you're wearing such thick-soled shoes.

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,080
Let me tell you something.

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,920
Usually,

70
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,240
when someone has such a sweet style,

71
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,640
there's bound to be a big contrast today.

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
You're absolutely right.

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,640
The cozier it is,

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,960
You're completely right.

75
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,800
This calls for a music box right now.

76
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,200
With a little ballerina dancing.

77
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,120
Right, so I'll be at the back today.

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,440
I'll stand last in line.

79
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,240
Why?

80
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,480
To protect you all.

81
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,120
No, you don't have to.

82
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,480
You charge ahead, we'll protect you

83
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,520
Of course little brother would be at the front

84
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,840
Why am I always at the front?

85
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,320
You're the bravest

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,840
Hello there

87
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,480
Today is the Eighteen Arhats of middle school

88
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,080
Eighteen Arhats

89
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,800
What style is this?

90
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,040
Japanese style

91
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,760
Crows Zero

92
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,680
Yours is kindergarten

93
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,320
Kindergarten

94
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,040
This is just that little vest for horse riding

95
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,240
Put one on

96
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,880
That protective gear

97
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,360
Yes, we're all learning equestrian

98
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,160
Equestrian students

99
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,320
Which school are you from?

100
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,399
I'm just a kid by the roadside

101
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,720
who hasn't started school yet

102
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,080
Preschooler

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
This is university for seniors

104
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,000
Listen to me

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,800
These earrings would look good on you

106
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,560
Candy

107
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,480
I don't have pierced ears

108
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,760
You could clip them on your clothes

109
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,960
Don't do that

110
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,520
You're beautiful

111
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Yes, but be careful

112
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,880
They might get caught when running

113
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,400
Once it gets dark

114
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,320
You two will just

115
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
be pulling on my ears

116
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,760
No, you go first

117
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,400
Follow behind

118
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Turn left

119
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,680
Catch him

120
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,200
What's going on?

121
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,760
Don't be so happy

122
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,280
Coming

123
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,160
Who is it?

124
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:36,960
A client

125
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,520
Hello boss

126
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,080
Hello

127
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,120
Come in quickly

128
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,080
Come

129
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,840
A visitor is always a guest

130
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,320
I won't disturb you

131
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Come

132
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
A visitor is always a guest

133
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,960
How can I have the nerve to come in?

134
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,200
It hurts here

135
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,080
No

136
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,960
I'm enduring it

137
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,120
But it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt

138
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,480
Right

139
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,800
Teacher

140
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,320
Get used to it.

141
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Today you all

142
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,480
Didn't you know about this part?

143
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,200
I really didn't know

144
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,000
I didn't know either

145
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,120
Just consider it a perk

146
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,320
Experience it

147
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,000
Relax a bit

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,560
Thank you

149
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,840
No

150
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,560
We haven't even discussed the price

151
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,600
Right off the bat

152
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
We'll talk about money later

153
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,400
Does anyone do business like this?

154
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,880
Who discusses money afterward?

155
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,920
Shouldn't you treat us?

156
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,440
My treat

157
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,080
Someone's treating

158
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,120
Her brother's treating

159
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,640
Right, do you know each other?

160
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,840
Who's this Xu the agent?

161
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,680
Who are these people?

162
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,040
Usually they say many property managers

163
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,240
always love coming here

164
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,880
Do you know?

165
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,800
Never seen them

166
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,440
Don't know

167
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,960
Is this your first day at work?

168
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,320
They must have privacy awareness

169
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,680
Can't casually discuss customers

170
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,280
These three over here are chatting so well

171
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,960
How much does it cost to recharge the card?

172
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,560
We want to apply for a card.

173
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,000
VIP

174
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,240
It's not that easy

175
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,520
to become one.

176
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,200
What are the qualifications then?

177
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,560
You need to meet our three "enough" criteria.

178
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,800
What "enough"?

179
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,520
Have you been around long enough?

180
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,920
What does that mean?

181
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,400
"Long enough" means

182
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,120
whether you've worked in this field long enough.

183
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,680
I've been around quite long.

184
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,360
I can sing

185
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,000
for several hours straight.

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,640
I've also been around long enough.

187
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,400
I started in this industry at fourteen.

188
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,280
Then you didn't start as early as me.

189
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,800
I'm older than you.

190
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,880
Sisters, the second "enough" -

191
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,280
Are you lonely enough?

192
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Are you lonely enough?

193
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,920
This is actually such a heartfelt Q&A?

194
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,800
Is there background music?

195
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,640
Human Erhu

196
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,560
Let me go first

197
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,960
I was separated from my father for eighteen years

198
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,640
And just met him again last week

199
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,800
So lonely

200
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,280
Indeed

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,040
Really?

202
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,520
That was our plot from last episode

203
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,680
Right

204
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,480
Let's go with the third one, okay?

205
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,240
The third one is enough

206
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,080
Are you strong enough?

207
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,320
Are you resilient enough?

208
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,520
I think actually us young people nowadays

209
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,400
Are all quite resilient

210
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,200
We think we're not strong enough

211
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,240
But actually after overcoming the hurdle

212
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,400
We find it's really nothing

213
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,559
Yes, our working class

214
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,200
Are all quite resilient

215
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,080
Strong enough

216
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,559
You're strong enough too

217
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,200
Me?

218
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,720
Look

219
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,840
He didn't even scream

220
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,280
Let me try

221
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,720
Strong

222
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,120
Me...

223
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,440
Is Song Piaoliang strong enough?

224
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,840
I...

225
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,160
If you're not strong enough, you can't enter VIP

226
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,080
You have to force yourself to be strong

227
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,160
I'm strong

228
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,960
On my future path

229
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,920
I'll become even stronger

230
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,640
I'll become a strong girl

231
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,320
Right

232
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,760
Are we qualified to enter VIP

233
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,960
This category?

234
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
After listening, you do qualify

235
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,480
Alright, sisters

236
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,280
Let's wrap up

237
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,800
Let's go to the next room

238
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,600
Thank you

239
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,280
Thanks

240
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,160
Good work

241
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,920
Well done

242
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,800
Okay, keep it up

243
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
Keke, let's review the case in the cafeteria.

244
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,000
the case from earlier.

245
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,840
Okay.

246
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,480
Hello

247
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,400
Long time no see

248
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,640
Long time no see

249
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,720
Did everyone bring their meal cards today?

250
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,200
Yes, I did

251
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,320
I don't have a meal card

252
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,080
Me neither

253
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,720
I don't have a card

254
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,160
Where's the card?

255
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,720
I don't have one either

256
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,080
Why is your card with me?

257
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,800
Why don't I have a meal card?

258
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,120
I'll pay by card

259
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,560
This transaction is 58 yuan

260
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,880
Ate fifty-eight, forty-four left

261
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,320
Really?

262
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,360
So rich

263
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Next, who's up?

264
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,200
I'm loaded

265
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,120
Bro

266
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,160
Take mine

267
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,360
I still have eighty-four

268
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,840
You had eighty-four and spent fifty-eight

269
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,880
Sixty-four

270
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,320
He's the richest now

271
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,080
I don't even have a card

272
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,120
My treat

273
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,000
Allow me to treat you

274
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,560
No need

275
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,120
Xiao He

276
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,720
Brother He

277
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,520
Take it

278
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,160
Spend freely

279
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,800
Thanks Brother He

280
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,400
Generous

281
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,480
No way, I'm "starving" to death

282
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:39,920
So hungry

283
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,840
Today's dishes are quite extravagant

284
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,040
What's this? Bullfrog?

285
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,320
This one

286
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,920
There's seafood

287
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,880
This is beef brisket with potatoes

288
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,440
I called him at 10 this morning

289
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,200
Isn't this the teacher?

290
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,960
This isn't the teacher

291
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,480
Isn't this the teacher?

292
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,720
Isn't this the teacher?

293
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,160
He calls that teacher

294
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,640
Teacher Sister Jie

295
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,200
What's wrong with you?

296
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,440
Still feeling gloomy?

297
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,280
Wait.

298
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,360
I'll wait until everyone has served themselves.

299
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Surely there wouldn't be...

300
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,000
...any clues during mealtime, right?

301
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,080
Seriously, could the cafeteria hold any clues?

302
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Teacher, take off your mask for a moment.

303
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,440
Unhygienic.

304
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,800
As a cafeteria staff member,

305
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,200
I think his behavior today is suspicious.

306
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,400
He wasn't here yesterday.

307
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,120
He wasn't here last night.

308
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,560
Because last night he...

309
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,440
...went to "kill" someone.

310
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,560
So the cafeteria guy is...

311
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,840
What are you all talking about?

312
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,800
I don't understand any of this.

313
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,080
That's exactly what the "killer" would say.

314
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,880
Right?

315
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,320
You're today's killer too.

316
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,040
After tomorrow...

317
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,760
After this meal...

318
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,520
...you won't live to see tomorrow.

319
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,600
This is our last supper.

320
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,360
Just confess.

321
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,920
Who was it? Who did the "killing"?

322
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,880
I told you it was me.

323
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,480
Don't believe me?

324
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,360
Why won't you believe me?

325
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,680
You've seen such conclusive evidence.

326
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,800
There's even a photo that says:

327
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,880
"Brother Cry".

328
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,040
Those who exploit you until you vomit "blood"

329
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,400
should all pay the price.

330
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,760
Who do you want to make pay?

331
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,280
I'm the one who "killed" them.

332
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,840
After you "killed" someone,

333
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,120
How will you...

334
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,000
Won't you just leave?

335
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,880
I'll definitely go to prison.

336
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,280
You're in the next episode.

337
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Any work plans?

338
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,360
Just confessing like this?

339
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,000
Now we're talking off-topic.

340
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,080
He really...

341
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,120
If he gets sent in this episode,

342
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,760
Next episode, we'll probably film "Prison Break."

343
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,680
You'll come rescue me.

344
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,400
Because you'll find out I was framed.

345
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Help overturn your case.

346
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,200
Right, we need to appeal.

347
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
That's illegal.

348
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,480
No, don't overthink it.

349
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,640
That General Manager Zong really...

350
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,120
You did it?

351
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,640
I did it.

352
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,000
Really?

353
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,720
I think the way you're acting...

354
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,280
so resolute, is really strange.

355
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
Look at you people

356
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,760
I've noticed

357
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,520
You just refuse to believe

358
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,880
what you've seen

359
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,840
In our first episode he told you

360
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,480
You should believe what you see, right?

361
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,120
No

362
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,680
You

363
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,600
should

364
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,400
doubt

365
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,520
what

366
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,200
you

367
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,920
see

368
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,880
(emphasis particle)

369
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,280
Now he's just making things up

370
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,040
Actually

371
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,320
it's really not made up

372
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,280
How is this made up?

373
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,000
But I didn't see anything

374
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,880
You saw my mouth say

375
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,720
"I'm the murderer"

376
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,880
That must have been heard

377
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,680
You...

378
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,160
Never mind

379
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,480
Let's drop it

380
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,480
So did you "kill" Deputy Fu?

381
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,680
Deputy Fu

382
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,720
Definitely wasn't him

383
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,240
He didn't have time

384
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,040
We were in an escape room

385
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,560
But what if he "killed" the night before?

386
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
"Killed" the night before

387
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,720
"Killed" last night

388
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,360
What I mean is

389
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,920
If he "killed" last night

390
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,600
It would freeze overnight

391
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,520
Would need to thaw today

392
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,680
Would need to defrost first

393
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,840
Put it in the microwave first

394
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,920
First of all, that "corpse"

395
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,680
must have been kept in the fridge, right?

396
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,000
Kept there

397
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,760
Yes, must have been kept there

398
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,400
But not for too long, right?

399
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,560
Leave it overnight, it would freeze

400
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,920
Might be refrigeration

401
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,680
Not freezing

402
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,160
Brother Bai is wearing a school uniform

403
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,120
Eating in this cafeteria

404
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,720
Seriously

405
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,360
It gives off such a nostalgic vibe, you know

406
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,040
Youth is coming back

407
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,880
Today's meal is really good

408
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,760
Today's food is so delicious

409
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,240
Really?

410
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,200
But if he "killed" someone,

411
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
what will he do next time?

412
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,880
He won't record the next episode,

413
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,680
and then later when he comes back,

414
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,280
No,

415
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,840
maybe in the next segment,

416
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,920
they'll expose him,

417
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,960
and find out it wasn't him at all.

418
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,960
I get it now.

419
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,160
They'll "eliminate" Xu Zhongjie.

420
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,800
Why?

421
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,440
He's my new brother.

422
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,840
He's your biological brother?

423
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
No, he's my...

424
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,960
He's my new...

425
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,880
new brother.

426
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,640
So actually you thought

427
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,280
you were the "killer,"

428
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,000
but it was actually Xu Zhongjie who "killed."

429
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,400
Let me tell you,

430
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,080
it's very likely that

431
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,520
these three people are protecting each other,

432
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,320
but in reality, none of them are [the killer].

433
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,880
Then who is it?

434
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:56,760
Let me tell you

435
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,840
It's most likely someone

436
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,360
with the surname Shen

437
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,400
Actually, I've always thought

438
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,760
that Deputy Manager Fu was the "killer"

439
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,240
I don't know why

440
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,000
Deputy Manager Fu "died"

441
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,920
He "committed suicide"

442
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
to "kill"

443
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,440
General Manager Zong

444
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,080
No

445
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,000
That person was indeed "killed" by Deputy Fu

446
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,000
He took all the blame for Deputy Fu

447
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,080
That's why Deputy Fu

448
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
classified it as an accident

449
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,720
I don't think Deputy Fu was the "killer"

450
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,400
Why?

451
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,440
Because Deputy Fu approached him and his sister

452
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,320
about General Manager Zong's "death"

453
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,200
I think someone deliberately staged it

454
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,400
It could only be you or Ke Wuku

455
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,320
I will definitely get to the bottom of this

456
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,400
So he actually went to

457
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,520
threaten him and his sister

458
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,960
If he was the "killer"

459
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,440
he could have just called it an accident

460
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,720
to clear himself of suspicion

461
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,840
Brother Liu's logic today

462
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,240
is on point

463
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,680
very sharp

464
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,800
Are you saying it was usually mediocre before?

465
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,520
No, not at all

466
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,880
No

467
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,480
Now it seems only Shen has the strongest motive

468
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,240
Because Shen can't afford to lose his job

469
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,160
Right, he mentioned

470
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,600
This is his last day at work

471
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,200
So today is the only day he can "kill" him

472
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,800
Most convenient

473
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,480
And after "killing" him, he can immediately

474
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,800
Leave this place

475
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,400
Yes

476
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,080
Because

477
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,120
Assistant Manager Shen has

478
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,360
Always had someone tied to him

479
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,480
Someone to provide him an alibi

480
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,080
So from 11:30

481
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,920
To 12:30

482
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,960
You were with Agent Xu

483
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,880
And Xiao Bao the whole time, right?

484
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,440
We went out for a farewell dinner

485
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,160
It was our last day

486
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,760
That was afterwards

487
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,080
If at 10 o'clock

488
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,360
The person everyone saw

489
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:30,840
Wasn't

490
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,960
The real Assistant Manager Fu

491
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,840
If it wasn't the real Assistant Manager Fu

492
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,600
That means

493
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,320
His "time of death"

494
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,400
Can be pushed even earlier

495
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,200
Right, it must have been

496
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,440
Before 10 o'clock

497
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:38,800
Right

498
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,120
Correct

499
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,440
"The killer" must be your sister

500
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,600
You mean "killed" General Manager Zong

501
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,200
Or "killed" Deputy Manager Fu

502
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,600
Deputy Fu

503
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,720
But why would he protect you?

504
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,160
I mean, why would Deputy Fu protect you?

505
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,200
It's because

506
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,680
He probably

507
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,800
Fell in love with your sister

508
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,920
Listen to me

509
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,119
And then

510
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,720
My brother always wanted them to fall in love with each other

511
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,480
Also knew the manager was

512
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,520
The general manager was "killed" by you

513
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,119
To protect her younger brother

514
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,240
To protect you

515
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,599
She temporarily stayed with Deputy Fu

516
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,640
Then

517
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
But his sister knew

518
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,360
This couldn't last forever

519
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,680
He had to be eliminated

520
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,280
This way

521
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,920
The secret could be kept forever

522
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,440
Without being exposed by Deputy Fu

523
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,160
So it was your sister

524
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,640
I don't care

525
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,240
I just want to write the case report now

526
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,440
But today it seems everyone

527
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,200
has good things to say about Manager Fu

528
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,760
Yes

529
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,040
General Manager Fu helped me apply for

530
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,640
compensation benefits

531
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,200
helped me find a new job

532
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,720
And before that he even gave me

533
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,560
a Happy Hometown membership card

534
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
so I could go relax there

535
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Afraid I'd get scolded

536
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:04,920
Then

537
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,640
afraid General Manager Zong

538
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,360
might actually deduct my salary when angry

539
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,480
This is very strange

540
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,680
Perhaps everyone has their own

541
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,840
weakness that he's exploiting

542
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,280
vulnerability

543
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Right

544
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,000
Because he went to threaten those siblings

545
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,880
And then perhaps later

546
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,080
those siblings would say

547
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,040
"He's actually not that bad"

548
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,160
Right, when asked if they hated him

549
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,320
they all said no

550
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
They thought he was helping them

551
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,920
fight for some compensation money

552
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,720
Yes

553
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,480
Deputy Manager Fu helped broker Xu

554
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,680
One time

555
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,800
had him sent to headquarters for recuperation

556
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,120
So what did Deputy Manager Fu do for Brother Ku?

557
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,280
Big deal

558
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,160
No, it's what Brother Ku did for him

559
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,720
Nothing

560
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,000
He gave Brother Ku a big deal

561
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,080
Introduced a major business deal

562
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,480
He was almost fired back then

563
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,040
So what you're saying

564
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,960
is becoming more and more credible.

565
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,240
He has dirt on everyone,

566
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,960
and helped them cover up all these matters.

567
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,280
Right.

568
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,880
Deputy Manager Fu,

569
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,640
after my brother "died,"

570
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,480
even applied for compensation for him.

571
00:18:59,480 --> 00:18:59,880
Isn't that right?

572
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,000
So your sister is grateful to him,

573
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,960
and she thinks he's a good person.

574
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,320
The money my sister used to open the foot massage shop

575
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,160
came from that.

576
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,280
That's how she got the money for the shop.

577
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,680
Yes.

578
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,480
He seems like a good person,

579
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,680
but he's actually a scoundrel.

580
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,840
He's a scoundrel.

581
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,800
No, you can't just assume

582
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,760
he didn't threaten everyone.

583
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,680
Everyone conspired together to

584
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,840
"take him down."

585
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,720
Explain in detail.

586
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,080
The thing is, that person

587
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,200
didn't actually "die" that way.

588
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,600
But everyone

589
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,200
spread a different version of how he "died,"

590
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,920
covering for each other.

591
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,680
What we heard might all be lies.

592
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,200
Is that possible?

593
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,920
We always blame the victim

594
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,960
Meaning this person must be

595
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,600
"deserving" of death

596
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,920
Why can't it be that a good person

597
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,120
was simply harmed by bad people?

598
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,320
No

599
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,520
I think there's another issue first

600
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,720
He initially said

601
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,680
he suspected

602
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,640
and his sister

603
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,000
had threatened these two people

604
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,520
The so-called threat

605
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,920
"Just wait, I'll definitely uncover the truth"

606
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,520
Why did he change his statement later?

607
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,640
No, at first you even gave compensation

608
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,400
Why would you threaten them?

609
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,920
That's not

610
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,120
They're just stating facts

611
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,920
Right, his threat must be something bad

612
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,200
I'm just stating facts

613
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,120
You "killed" someone

614
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,680
And won't let me investigate you

615
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,760
The question is

616
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,320
He investigated

617
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,680
He said he had conclusive evidence

618
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,160
He said

619
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,360
and he did indeed "kill" that person

620
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,880
Why did he suddenly change his statement?

621
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,560
So there must be something behind this

622
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,520
Could it be

623
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,760
your sister exchanged something with him

624
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,840
He might have

625
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
fallen in love with your sister

626
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,640
My brother did "kill" that person

627
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,880
Then Deputy Manager Fu said

628
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,400
"Fine, then you should be with me"

629
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,000
To protect you

630
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,600
she temporarily stayed with Deputy Fu

631
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,440
I'll help cover up your brother's

632
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:40,880
incident

633
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,840
Then he documented it as

634
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,240
a work accident, accidental "killing"

635
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
But his sister knew

636
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,120
this couldn't last forever

637
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,920
He had to be eliminated

638
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,680
Then his sister said

639
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,280
"I don't want to

640
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,360
spend my whole life with someone

641
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,640
I don't love"

642
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,400
I know

643
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,760
this is a very,

644
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,520
very melodramatic soap opera

645
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,040
I'm sorry

646
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,400
I ate two more bowls of rice

647
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,960
You're bigger, you burn more

648
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,000
You're tall, need to distribute it evenly

649
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,240
Top and bottom

650
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,200
We're all here

651
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,040
You're like this

652
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,160
One bowl goes to the top

653
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,360
One bowl goes to the bottom

654
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,960
One bowl fills normal people

655
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,200
For me one bowl only reaches my ankles

656
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,240
Eat then go

657
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,680
No rush

658
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,080
Won't even touch up makeup

659
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,040
Starting right now today

660
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,760
Won't even put on lipstick

661
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Whatever, this is fine

662
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,640
Did you just check the mirror?

663
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,360
Thought your makeup looked good?

664
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,880
No, I really didn't

665
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,240
I really didn't

666
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,920
Honestly didn't

667
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,680
This is the only way I can see

668
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,120
Right, you knew there was a mirror behind

669
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,200
I didn't

670
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,560
I'm being completely sincere

671
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,120
Leave early

672
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,920
No more makeup

673
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,640
Just kidding

674
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,480
Your reputation

675
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,440
Spreads faster than Deputy Manager Fu's

676
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,320
How could you all be like this

677
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,680
I'm so genuine

678
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,720
It's fine, even if we do perfect makeup

679
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,280
Still wouldn't

680
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
You'd still be the prettiest here

681
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,520
I take the longest with makeup

682
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,040
Why didn't you say

683
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,960
Every morning I'm basically painting a new face

684
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,440
Don't play games

685
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,600
Or you'll "die"

686
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,680
What kind of story should I write

687
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,720
What bizarre experience

688
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,840
I don't know

689
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,160
It has to be truly bizarre

690
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,600
I don't have any bizarre experiences

691
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,080
Let's play ball.

692
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,400
Come on.

693
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,400
What

694
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,400
What

695
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,800
It exploded just now

696
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,280
It exploded just now

697
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,960
Lost

698
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,360
Eat bitter melon

699
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,840
So in the end, I still have to eat the bitter melon

700
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
How come there are two balls now?

701
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,480
These people

702
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,120
I said they couldn't solve the puzzle

703
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,600
Just playing with a stupid balloon

704
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,560
and they're happy for ages

705
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,000
Keke

706
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,520
He's too fierce. He's so fierce.

707
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,160
Great minds think alike.

708
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,600
Really?

709
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,000
Yes.

710
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,960
I'm really afraid this thing might explode

711
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,320
You know what?

712
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,760
I'm scared too

713
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,440
Then let's try it

714
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,000
Not trying

715
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,120
Wrong

716
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,160
Zhou Keke

717
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,320
This is the most bizarre experience

718
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,760
I've ever encountered at work

719
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,560
Aren't you two tired?

720
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,120
Are you guys exhausted?

721
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,280
That's enough

722
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,240
I'll leave, alright?

723
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,800
I'm leaving

724
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,120
Come back

725
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,560
No more crowding

726
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,000
Come back

727
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,720
You're not that kind of person

728
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,760
You're not that simple

729
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,720
What's my weirdest experience?

730
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,840
Playing with balloons while working

731
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,680
Yeah, that counts
