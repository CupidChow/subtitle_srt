1
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,360
15th anniversary of the Southern painter's "death"

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,280
Memorial event

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,680
Anyone in this room could have "killed" Bamei

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,960
I think we should investigate

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,600
Fifteen years ago

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,880
how this painter "died"

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,880
His bed used to be here

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,560
He might have mistaken this window

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,680
for the fireplace

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,560
bkq0005 (proper noun, untranslated)

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,080
Someone replaced it

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,120
That's why he jumped

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,720
That's why he jumped

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,760
There's a "corpse" here

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,920
Wearing something around the neck

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,720
A necklace

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,760
A woman

18
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,280
Holding a child

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,800
This man

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,720
"Killed" this woman

21
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,040
Then hid her here

22
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,960
Mom

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,680
I dressed the doll in

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,600
your white dress

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,760
He got a big fright

26
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,800
Actually after growing up

27
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,960
he could have taken revenge on this person

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,880
I think it might be

29
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,120
one of those people we met today

30
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,880
One of them

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,320
What are you four doing at the bookstore?

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,520
For me, it was four days ago

33
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,080
when I received

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Lucky's phone call

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,720
She told me

36
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,760
to come to this bookstore

37
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,440
to commemorate

38
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,280
the 15th anniversary of Mr. Nan's "passing"

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
Four days ago

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,040
For me, it was July 15th

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,640
I arrived at 1:50 PM

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,160
Jiang Lucky was already there when I arrived

43
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,840
Yes, I was the first to arrive

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,320
I arrived at the bookstore at 1:30 PM

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,880
For me,

46
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
it was 2:20 PM

47
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,480
What time did Manager Wu arrive?

48
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,520
What time did Manager Wu arrive?

49
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,760
2:30 PM

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,360
2:30 PM

51
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,880
Did you invite everyone here?

52
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,280
Yes, I gathered everyone

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,039
I had this idea four days ago

54
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,320
I wanted to commemorate him

55
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,120
on Mr. Nan's anniversary

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,920
Then four days ago I found them

57
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,840
and contacted them

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,760
I rented this bookstore three days ago

59
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,160
You rented this bookstore?

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,480
Yes

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,920
So yesterday I asked them to come together

62
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,880
to clean up this place

63
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,280
Yes

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,200
So what happened to you all last night?

65
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,240
Why did you wake up this morning

66
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,840
collapsed on the floor as if you'd fainted?

67
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
We didn't collapse on the floor.

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,760
We were just asleep.

69
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,560
You're really something.

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,720
Slept so deeply

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,400
Even the manager was out cold.

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,000
His...

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
That looks like unconsciousness.

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,600
Don't you think...

75
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,760
Don't you think it's strange?

76
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,920
My head hurt terribly after waking up.

77
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,160
Right, why did it hurt so much after waking?

78
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,040
So dizzy.

79
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
We were exhausted yesterday.

80
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,520
Then fell asleep around 10 PM.

81
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,640
Slept straight until just now.

82
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,360
Woke up feeling extremely dizzy.

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,720
Yeah.

84
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,680
We only woke up when you arrived.

85
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,360
They must have inhaled something

86
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,040
and then passed out

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,520
Exactly

88
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,760
So that person knocked them all out first

89
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,280
then committed the crime himself

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,880
After committing the crime

91
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,160
he made himself pass out too

92
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,000
to create an alibi

93
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,360
Well

94
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,520
What was the last thing

95
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,800
you did before sleeping?

96
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,240
Sleep

97
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,040
Brilliant

98
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,400
Smooth

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,480
Did you notice who was

100
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,120
the last one to fall asleep?

101
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,960
I slept at 10 o'clock

102
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,920
Me too at 10

103
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
I also slept at 10

104
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,440
Same here

105
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,960
All at 10

106
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,720
You slept at the same time?

107
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,640
Didn't you sleep a bit later?

108
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,920
You weren't asleep when we slept

109
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,520
No

110
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,600
See

111
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,080
She's framing me

112
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,760
Why would she frame you?

113
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,560
I don't know why either

114
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,480
She suddenly claimed

115
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,440
she fell asleep before me

116
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,720
How would she know I slept late?

117
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
This is a logical paradox

118
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,720
You do seem to be

119
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,200
Right

120
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,120
Indeed

121
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,160
Indeed

122
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,959
Indeed

123
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,880
Indeed

124
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,480
Isn't that so?

125
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,080
Was he

126
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,640
scrolling through Weishi?

127
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,440
Just scrolling, then fell asleep

128
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,920
Actually, this logic makes perfect sense

129
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,440
Because for example, when she was falling asleep

130
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,160
The last thing she saw

131
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,080
Was this person still awake

132
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,880
Still not sleeping

133
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,760
Still scrolling through videos

134
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,720
Right? Doesn't that make sense?

135
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,200
Yes

136
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,160
Teacher, let's discuss

137
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Today's "deceased", okay?

138
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,920
Today's "deceased" is called Bamui

139
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,880
Do you know this person?

140
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
I've heard of her

141
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,040
On July 10, 2022

142
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,040
You used your own WeChat account, Manager Wu

143
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,920
To contact this

144
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,720
Tui Huicha Detective Agency

145
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,080
I only hired Tui Huicha to help me

146
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,560
Investigate what exactly she knew

147
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,440
Why did you want to know

148
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,760
What exactly did she know

149
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,360
She's writing an article about the "death" of the Southern painter.

150
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,880
I currently have many

151
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,000
of the Southern painter's artworks.

152
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,200
If she slanders the Southern painter,

153
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,440
these paintings will become worthless.

154
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,280
The Southern painter's reputation will be ruined.

155
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,360
And these paintings won't sell anymore.

156
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,040
Of course,

157
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,720
if Bamie "dies."

158
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,680
Are you happy?

159
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,040
Bamie "died."

160
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,520
My article will go viral.

161
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,760
Right.

162
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,480
From now on,

163
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,800
you'll be number one in the promotion market.

164
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm so happy.

165
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,880
Look, she's more suspicious than I am.

166
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,240
Yes, she can't escape either. We'll question her later.

167
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,640
Wait, what exactly are you suspecting?

168
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,840
You don't suspect that

169
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,400
Bamie's "death" is related to us, do you?

170
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,960
Of course,

171
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,120
the "killer"

172
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,320
must be one of you.

173
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,520
How is that possible?

174
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,000
You hated Bamie so much.

175
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,840
How is it not possible?

176
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,040
There's surveillance footage

177
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,240
that can prove we

178
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,920
never left the bookstore

179
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,440
after entering.

180
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,160
Xiao Wen,

181
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,880
could you help retrieve that surveillance footage?

182
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,400
Absolutely no problem.

183
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,280
Leave it to me.

184
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,240
Do we need to wear gloves to get the footage?

185
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,360
Push

186
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,640
Push

187
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,080
Push

188
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,120
Our property management needs more employees like this

189
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,320
Is it a Husky?

190
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,720
This guy always wrecks the house

191
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,280
Got it

192
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,480
Come, take a look

193
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,200
Come here

194
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,000
What are you showing them?

195
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,160
Are you looking or not?

196
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,320
What's wrong with you?

197
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,080
And you call this investigating?

198
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,920
We've been humiliated

199
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,560
Sorry about that

200
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,080
This isn't the first time we've been humiliated

201
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,000
Jiang Xingyun

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,680
Jiang Xingyun entered through the main gate

203
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,880
1:30, she wasn't lying

204
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,480
1:30

205
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,400
Right

206
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,480
That's correct

207
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,760
And you call this detective work?

208
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,920
Still using touchscreen?

209
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,680
Let me give you something to wake you up

210
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,120
Who was here at 1:50?

211
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,000
This is

212
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
This is Sister Bao

213
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,720
Sister Bao

214
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,120
Right, she said 1:50

215
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,000
2:20

216
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,960
Nan Fanshi

217
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,360
2:20, that's correct

218
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,400
Then it seems the last one should be

219
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,120
2:30

220
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,480
2:30, this is Manager Wu

221
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,240
Manager Wu

222
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,560
All correct

223
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,120
None of them were lying

224
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,960
Let's talk about what happened at Nanjiahua's place fifteen years ago

225
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,360
This conflict between you and Nanjiahua

226
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,040
What are you doing?

227
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,640
No, there's no conflict between us

228
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,240
You're really disrespecting me as a security guard

229
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,320
We've already found evidence

230
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,960
There's a voice recorder in your possession

231
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,280
That shows you owe him a lot of money

232
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,880
He made you work like a slave for life

233
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,080
And he even made a demand

234
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,040
For you to help him hide a "female corpse"

235
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,840
What's the story behind this?

236
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,520
Tell us about it

237
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,280
Hide what "female corpse"?

238
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,080
Impossible

239
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,880
Nanjiahua would never do such a thing

240
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,560
Our Nanjiahua wouldn't do something like this

241
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,280
He's being framed

242
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,320
Let's pin it on him first

243
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,200
How could you

244
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,400
Frame our Nanjiahua

245
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,840
Calm down

246
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,120
Our Nanjiahua isn't that kind of person

247
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,440
Right

248
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,000
The truth is this:

249
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,960
I did owe him some money,

250
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,280
that's why I became his agent.

251
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,679
But his paintings were terrible.

252
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,120
So he could only...

253
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,000
Whose paintings are bad?

254
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,159
Who are you saying paints poorly?

255
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,919
Don't speak ill of Artist Nan.

256
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,159
How could his paintings be bad?

257
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,760
Be rational about celebrity worship.

258
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,600
Before,

259
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,480
his paintings were bad.

260
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,640
Then he met his muse,

261
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,080
after that,

262
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,840
his work improved.

263
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,640
We already know about that woman -

264
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,720
she was the one actually painting.

265
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,280
That woman's "death"

266
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,360
has nothing to do with me.

267
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,960
Let me explain:

268
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,640
Artist Nan

269
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,720
"killed" this woman,

270
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,160
then called me

271
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,800
asking me to help dispose of the "body."

272
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,800
I was scared.

273
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,560
I was really worried,

274
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,040
so I needed evidence to protect myself.

275
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,240
That's why I brought a recorder.

276
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,160
When I arrived,

277
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,280
"Come in quickly!"

278
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,120
there was no "body" -

279
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,600
just a package from Artist Nan

280
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,400
containing this woman's "belongings,"

281
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,360
which he asked me to burn.

282
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,080
You're lying.

283
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,040
I'm not lying.

284
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,240
It's all in your recording -

285
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,600
you asked "why so much blood?"

286
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,320
Yes, I saw "blood,"

287
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,120
but I didn't see a person.

288
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,760
The "deceased" woman had a child

289
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,360
Was that child hers with the Southern painter?

290
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,920
There's also a child

291
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,000
There's also a child

292
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,280
That's his lover's child

293
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,120
Right

294
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,720
They're actually taking notes too

295
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,320
That's how it is

296
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,080
On the 16th, he gave her

297
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,720
While handling her "belongings"

298
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,040
I think

299
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,440
I saw a child run past me

300
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,800
They

301
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,400
They were holding a

302
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,160
doll as big as them

303
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
with long hair

304
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,720
Boy or girl

305
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,120
I only noticed the doll

306
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,560
Not the child

307
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,640
Do you know that the Southern painter is "sick"?

308
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,400
His mental illness...

309
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,200
He doesn't sleep well.

310
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,960
How could that be?

311
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,920
Impossible! Don't slander him.

312
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,160
There's no need to get so worked up.

313
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,240
True.

314
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,400
He has sleepwalking disorder.

315
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,720
So he sleepwalks, right?

316
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,400
You know this well.

317
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,280
Every day,

318
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,760
what does he do when he sleepwalks?

319
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,560
I’ve never lived with him.

320
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,040
I only know he has sleepwalking disorder.

321
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,000
He’s taking a medication—

322
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,960
What medication?

323
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,320
"Dreamless Night."

324
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,000
Why?

325
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,880
We found a shopping receipt.

326
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
In the month he "died,"

327
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,040
you bought "No-Tears Gas."

328
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,600
Yes, exactly.

329
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,440
Because in front of his fans,

330
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,600
I really couldn't say this.

331
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,040
But

332
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,960
The reason was

333
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,120
he had lost his inspiration.

334
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,200
We heard that "Bukuki"

335
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,800
could help with inspiration.

336
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,560
So

337
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,320
we made a joint decision

338
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,840
to buy this medicine for him to take.

339
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,920
To help him regain inspiration.

340
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,920
The last time I saw him

341
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,360
was the night before the incident.

342
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,280
Right.

343
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,520
What was he like that night?

344
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,680
Because he has sleepwalking issues

345
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,960
and mentally perhaps

346
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,760
after taking it,

347
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,360
he would talk to himself a bit.

348
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,240
Muttering to himself.

349
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,480
But I thought he was normal

350
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,360
because usually

351
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,400
he's basically like this.

352
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,840
His talking to himself

353
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,680
was actually because

354
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,960
he was taking "Bukuki".

355
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,920
It's a reaction after taking this.

356
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,520
Right?

357
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,480
Yes.

358
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,720
About this Southern artist,

359
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,400
are you familiar with the layout of his home?

360
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,760
Yes.

361
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,080
Did you know his house has a secret passage?

362
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,440
I didn't know about that.

363
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,480
But I only know that

364
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,240
well,

365
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,560
the 7th floor,

366
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,160
8th floor,

367
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,320
and 9th floor

368
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,360
all belong to the Southern artist.

369
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,480
I should also explain to the fans

370
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,400
that

371
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,920
this Southern artist actually

372
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,120
was murdered,

373
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,080
it wasn't suicide.

374
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,320
It was murder.

375
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,400
Right.

376
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,680
Why do you say that?

377
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,960
The Southern artist's house had a secret passage.

378
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,280
When sleepwalking, he would habitually

379
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
go through the passage

380
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,440
to do certain things.

381
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,560
Then the night before,

382
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,360
his bed was

383
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,240
after he fell asleep,

384
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,440
moved to a different position.

385
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,400
When sleepwalking,

386
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,520
he mistook the window for the passage

387
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,080
and went through it,

388
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,880
resulting in his fatal fall.

389
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,720
Therefore,

390
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,320
the manager is now highly suspicious.

391
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,400
Is it because you gave him that medicine?

392
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,520
Why did you give him that medicine?

393
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,080
You killed the Southern artist.

394
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,760
Look at these three "obsessive fans" -

395
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,120
they don't seem like murderers, you know?

396
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,640
Right.

397
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,520
Let me say this first -

398
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,280
I had no motive to kill him.

399
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,800
You owed him money.

400
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,480
You owed him a lot of money.

401
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,040
He made you work like a slave for life.

402
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,200
I was helping him sell paintings,

403
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,720
and I earned money from every sale.

404
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,520
If he died,

405
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,880
I would lose that income.

406
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,160
Right.

407
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,360
I had no reason to kill him.

408
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,200
I shouldn't ask the agent first

409
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,600
Because the agent's logic

410
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,680
is quite meticulous

411
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,840
Got it, right

412
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,240
Let's pick someone less meticulous

413
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,640
These three nearby, ask them

414
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,760
They don't look like troublemakers

415
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,320
Right

416
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Appearances can be deceiving

417
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,960
You see, I used to have a younger brother

418
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,280
I was the one who "killed" him

419
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,480
Now I'm serving as a cautionary tale here

420
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,840
Come on

421
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,120
You three knew each other before, right?

422
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,160
Fifteen years ago, you three

423
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,680
took a photo at Happy Home's entrance

424
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,880
took a photo

425
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,080
Is this you three?

426
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,520
Yes

427
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,080
Yes

428
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,240
What kind of place is Happy Home?

429
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,040
Please follow my lead

430
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,800
We're twenty-five

431
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,760
We entered Happy Home together

432
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,640
We grew up together

433
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,920
I came here alone

434
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,240
What's it to you?

435
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,480
So you grew up together at Happy Home, right?

436
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,760
That's right

437
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,920
I'm an orphan

438
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,240
When I was just born

439
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,520
my parents "died" in a car accident

440
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,560
Then

441
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,160
I was passed around among various relatives

442
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,440
who took me in

443
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,840
When I turned ten

444
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,400
they thought of me

445
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,640
as a burden

446
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,600
and sent me to Happy Home

447
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,680
He's a burden

448
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,320
Then you can shake it off

449
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,040
Stop making jokes about it

450
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,240
Then

451
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,480
I met Mother Love

452
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,360
Who?

453
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,920
Mother Love

454
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,720
Mother Love

455
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,080
She was our mother at Happy Home

456
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,640
Mom

457
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,640
But

458
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,440
later Happy Home had some problems

459
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,440
because our Mother Love

460
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:20,920
got sick

461
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,120
And then

462
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,720
Mom "passed away"

463
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,160
How did mom "die"?

464
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,960
Fell ill

465
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
In what year did they "die"

466
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,560
You're not orphans from Loving Mother's Home

467
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,040
We're from Happy Home too

468
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,360
No way, I've never seen you before

469
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,480
We're older than you

470
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,360
I'm the boss

471
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,840
We're from the previous batch

472
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,120
We're from the previous generation

473
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,880
Grandma Love raised us

474
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,000
Nonsense

475
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,000
And then?

476
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
After Mom got sick

477
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,640
we moved out to study and live on our own

478
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,960
Then after we grew up,

479
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,720
when we came back here again,

480
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,640
this place had changed quite a lot.

481
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,040
This is Happy Home.

482
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,120
It's had several names.

483
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,720
Happy Home.

484
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,760
This used to be Happy Home before it was renamed.

485
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,320
Happy Home.

486
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,120
You even said

487
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
that you came from a happy family

488
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,440
You don't even know this?

489
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,880
Actually, we're just...

490
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,600
He's lying, this guy's no good

491
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,880
She definitely has a story

492
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,280
Hurry up

493
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,080
Tell us quickly

494
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,280
Alright, let's ask Sister Bao

495
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,720
What's your background?

496
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,400
When I was very young

497
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,480
I was abandoned by my parents

498
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,440
And I never knew

499
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,760
who my parents were

500
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,520
You were also abandoned as a child

501
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,520
Then taken in by a newspaper-selling grandpa

502
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,000
who adopted you

503
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,960
Since grandpa sold newspapers daily

504
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,960
he used them to teach me to read

505
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,800
That's when

506
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,200
I developed

507
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,440
a strong interest in journalism

508
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,400
Hoping that someday

509
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,280
I could write a viral story

510
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,480
When I was ten

511
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,800
Grandpa got too old

512
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,680
to support my schooling

513
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,400
So he sent me to Happy Home

514
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,520
Alright, Lucky

515
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,360
Tell us about your

516
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,480
childhood story

517
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,720
I told you last time

518
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,240
When I was little

519
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,840
my father went out to work

520
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,960
and met a woman

521
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,920
He thought he found true love

522
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,960
and ran away with her

523
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,840
Then my mother worried too much

524
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,800
and "passed away"

525
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,240
"Passed away"

526
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
After that

527
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,200
Mother Love found me

528
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,880
discovered me

529
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,040
and took me to Happy Home

530
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,440
I was ten years old

531
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,640
when I went to Happy Home and met them

532
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
We were all ten

533
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,080
Then when I was fifteen

534
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,480
ten years ago

535
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,880
Mother Love got sick

536
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,840
We older kids

537
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,120
had to go out and support ourselves

538
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,360
attending school and working

539
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,000
After starting work

540
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,720
I learned about this Southern painter

541
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,840
who actually

542
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,640
had sponsored our Happy Home

543
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,000
When I saw his paintings then

544
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,920
I really liked him

545
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,800
Plus he had sponsored us

546
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,080
so we became his fans

547
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,640
But at the same time we learned

548
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,040
he had already "passed away"

549
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,600
Right

550
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,760
So all three of you

551
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,360
genuinely liked him

552
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,120
Absolutely

553
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,800
Of course

554
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,360
Yes

555
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,360
Why suddenly like this?

556
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,000
Look at the agent

557
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,680
Look at his expression

558
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,760
Why would he

559
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,360
sponsor Happy Home?

560
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,440
Surely to help more children

561
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,320
Right

562
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,920
The persona I created

563
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,560
This is the meaning of my existence

564
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,680
Stop talking nonsense, he's already gone

565
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,360
And now you're slandering him

566
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,200
Back off

567
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,800
Back off

568
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,240
Back off

569
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,080
Back off

570
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,680
Then I'll leave

571
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,120
Don't

572
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,480
This makes it all worthwhile

573
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,440
He's been "dead" for fifteen years

574
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,600
Yet there are still people who remember

575
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,480
Wait a minute

576
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,800
Did the Southern painter know the charity mother?

577
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,440
We wouldn't know that

578
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,360
By the time I knew about it, they were already working

579
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,280
Right

580
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,880
Does the agent know?

581
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,200
We just transferred money

582
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,600
You didn't know him either

583
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,200
No, I didn't

584
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,160
Just tell the truth, all three of you

585
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,080
Before this Southern painter

586
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,040
You never knew him at all?

587
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,520
Never met him

588
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,080
Because when I learned about the Southern painter

589
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,480
And

590
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,920
When I found out he had sponsored us

591
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,040
He was already "deceased"

592
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,720
Their connection to the Southern painter's "death"

593
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,280
Has nothing to do with it

594
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,840
Not necessarily - the Southern painter's lover

595
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,360
Might have had a secret love child

596
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,960
When the Southern painter "died"

597
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,600
We were just teenagers

598
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,560
I have my own parents

599
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,640
I have my own mother and father

600
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,960
Sister Bao, I want to ask you something

601
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,600
about those things concerning Bamei

602
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,640
How did you know about them?

603
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,880
Well, here's the thing

604
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,480
I've been wanting to write

605
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,440
a viral hit

606
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,360
but my articles

607
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,200
never got any attention

608
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,160
Then I got a secret guide

609
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,480
The guide said

610
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,400
"Ride the wave of trending topics"

611
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,760
to create viral content

612
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
This is the box I took from her side

613
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,560
"The Law of Absorbing Popularity"

614
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,080
So I look for trending people to piggyback on

615
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,640
But I'm a very righteous person

616
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,400
I absolutely won't exploit good people's popularity

617
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,760
I must expose those unethical people

618
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,120
and use those villains' popularity

619
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,640
Bamei, the editor of "Expose Everything"

620
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,360
she's a bad person

621
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,720
so I must expose her

622
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,760
Sister Bao, your malice toward Bamei

623
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,520
seems a bit excessive

624
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,760
She was always a bad person

625
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,800
She was always bad

626
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,920
She was always a villain

627
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,560
He had strong "motive for murder"

628
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,600
Sister Bao, I'd like to ask

629
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,160
How did you come by that information?

630
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,280
Or did someone give it to you?

631
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,440
One day

632
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,920
I accidentally ran into her

633
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,760
You met Sister Pa?

634
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,800
Then I followed her

635
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,760
To her home

636
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,920
You went to her home?

637
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,440
To get the hot scoop

638
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,680
Anything is worth it

639
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,040
Aren't you afraid of karma?

640
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,400
Because she's a bad person

641
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,200
Sister Pa is bad

642
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,720
Where's her home?

643
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,840
Apartment 11, room 206

644
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,640
But as far as I know

645
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,880
That's not her home

646
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,720
That's probably her relative's home

647
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,200
Yes, let me interrupt

648
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,440
When did you follow her?

649
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,600
July 14th

650
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,400
July 14th

651
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,960
Then I saw Sister Pa acting very strangely

652
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,720
She

653
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,040
said one sentence

654
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,960
"Don't come any closer"

655
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,760
"Don't harm me"

656
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,640
"I didn't mean to provoke you"

657
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,240
Then calmed down

658
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,320
And said it again

659
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,640
I think

660
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,520
she must have been contaminated by some

661
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,160
evil presence

662
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,080
Sister Explosive

663
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,120
I saw your last comment

664
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,840
Someone commented that

665
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,440
If Sister Spy really ends up like Southern Painter

666
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,080
and "dies" by jumping off a building

667
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,680
then Sister Explosive could finally get her big scoop

668
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,080
Some said

669
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,720
Right

670
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,040
That would definitely go viral

671
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,440
Then you replied saying

672
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,600
"Just wait and see"

673
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
So what do you plan to do?

674
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,120
Have you ever thought about "killing" her?

675
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,120
Actually, from the beginning I thought

676
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,040
Since Sister Spy digs up dirt on others daily

677
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,520
She must have some

678
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,800
dark secrets of her own

679
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,720
So I wanted to expose hers

680
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,880
To give her a taste of her own medicine

681
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,840
But you've been stalking her place daily

682
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,400
I doubt you're much better

683
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,440
But Sister Explosive should mention

684
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,880
If you break into Sister Spy's home

685
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,280
that might constitute a crime

686
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,480
So in the future

687
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,440
let's not do such things

688
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,520
We should obtain information legally

689
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,200
Okay

690
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,400
So what did you find out?

691
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,120
I discovered

692
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,880
She keeps rambling nonsense in her room

693
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,120
And here's the key point

694
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,040
I didn't see that white shadow

695
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,280
Sister Spy

696
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,760
previously spread rumors about Southern Painter

697
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,920
claiming that before Southern Painter "died"

698
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,920
a white shadow kept haunting him

699
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,400
Right

700
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,320
Later she said

701
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,080
she also had a white shadow haunting her

702
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,520
But after I sneaked into her home

703
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,360
I found

704
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,240
no white shadow

705
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,240
Her implication is that this white shadow

706
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,680
can't actually be seen by anyone

707
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,520
except the "deceased"

708
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,160
So it must be

709
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,720
some kind of internal hallucinogenic effect

710
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,840
But in the surveillance footage she showed us

711
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,480
there was a white shadow

712
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,000
So Bamie is spreading rumors.

713
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:11,920
What's wrong?

714
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,400
Why did I just get a text?

715
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,720
Who?

716
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,360
We got a message.

717
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,640
Let's check it out right away.

718
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,160
The subscription account "Gossip Girl Gossip" posted...

719
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,640
The "Gossip Girl Gossip" you subscribed to...

720
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,040
just published a new article.

721
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,800
There's a twist!

722
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,560
Gossip Girl was "killed" by White Shadow.

723
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,160
What she said was indeed the truth.

724
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,360
The haters can shut up forever now.

725
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,800
The article already has over 100,000 reads.

726
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,200
But wasn't Gossip Girl "dead"?

727
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,880
Why is she still posting on the public account?

728
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,320
Bamei posted it herself

729
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,600
her own "death announcement"

730
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,080
Is it possible that

731
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,680
Bamei "committed suicide"

732
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
and scheduled this post?

733
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,600
Yes, Bamei did it to gain fame

734
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,240
So Bamui committed "suicide," right?

735
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,280
Hard to say.

736
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,920
Anyway, before Bamui "died,"

737
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,320
she showed signs of mental disturbance.

738
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:30,920
I think soon

739
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,600
we'll have to go

740
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,520
check out Bamui's place

741
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,240
We must go

742
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,080
But we also need to return to the scene

743
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,480
And we need to figure out

744
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,600
how Bamui avoided the surveillance cameras

745
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,000
Right

746
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,040
Another suspicious point is

747
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,240
why those four people fainted

748
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,560
Someone must have drugged them or something

749
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,400
After making them pass out

750
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,360
then during that time

751
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,920
used a secret passage to commit murder

752
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,120
Among the four of you who fainted

753
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,200
one of them

754
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,480
is very likely the killer

755
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,600
Then maybe we should first investigate

756
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,120
and check Bamui's room

757
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,080
Room 206, right?

758
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,480
Come on

759
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,560
This room

760
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,360
should be across

761
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,200
Room 20... what was it?

762
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,840
206

763
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,360
Bamui's room

764
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,320
206 is the one from this morning, right?

765
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,640
Yes, the one from this morning

766
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,360
By the way

767
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,840
Where's that key?

768
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,960
Luckily

769
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,280
it's not lost

770
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,040
Where did we get this key?

771
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,720
From Bamui's body

772
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,080
There's something in her clothes, wait

773
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,080
The key

774
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,320
Finally we can open it

775
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,920
Very small, her home

What medal?

790
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,640
Her award medal

Today's Tui City gossip won't disappoint

794
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,720
Recently

795
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,280
Our reporters captured famous painter Nan

796
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,560
Entering a mansion with a long-haired woman in white

797
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,720
Judging by the waist-holding gesture

798
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,240
Their relationship appears intimate

799
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,600
At the Nan residence

800
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,440
The white shadow in photos can be explained as

801
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,600
Top celebrity's "death" plus supernatural legends

802
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,720
Equals viral content formula

803
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,960
"Wronged dead" become white shadows

804
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,200
Lingering near those who harmed them

805
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,320
Tormenting them endlessly

806
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,280
Until they "die"

807
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,800
They'll also haunt anyone with ill intentions

808
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,280
Who approaches them

809
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,560
There's woman's hair

810
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Bought equipment

811
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,960
Hidden in the cabinet

812
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,760
To stage supernatural events

813
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,280
She arranged that clothing herself

814
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,400
The hair was also her doing

815
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,640
I get it - she just saw

816
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,600
Him entering with a woman

817
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,120
So she's convinced he has a secret lover

818
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
And since this woman disappeared

819
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,840
She wants to create buzz

820
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,680
She wants to generate hype to get famous

821
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
She's just like Explosive Sister

822
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,720
They both want fame

823
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,280
There's also a note here - who found it?

824
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,240
Where did Old Bai find it?

825
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,960
Trash can

826
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,200
Little sister

827
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,240
Stop investigating the Southern painter's matter

828
00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,800
Be obedient

829
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,880
Or you'll "die"

830
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,000
Computer, check her computer

831
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,720
Check Bamie's private messages

832
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,160
Feasting on "blood-stained buns"

833
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,800
You pathological liar

834
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,280
If it's really Bai Ying seeking revenge

835
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,120
why wouldn't Bai Ying come for you?

836
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,240
These are her private messages

837
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,520
People kept sending her these

838
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,640
There must be some virus now

839
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,280
Confirmed

840
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
This can't be extinguished

841
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,920
Right, it's some kind of virus

842
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,440
Phone

843
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,080

July 5, 2022

845
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,920
I've been your loyal fan for years

846
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,400
Three years ago, everyone around me

847
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,480
was reading your articles

848
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,120
You're so good at creating buzz

849
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,200
I think you're right

850
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,400
Controversy brings traffic

851
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,960
Traffic equals value

852
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,440
It's been three years

853
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:43,920
I hope

854
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,640
to see your viral articles again

855
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,360
Thank you

856
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,400
I'll definitely write another

857
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,280
viral article

858
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,680
Top 10 unsolved mysteries in art circles

859
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,600
Why did the Southern painter

860
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,240
"commit suicide" at his peak?

861
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,600
The mystery remains unsolved

862
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,920
Give us the scoop!

863
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
This is sensational

864
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,680
Let's talk by phone

865
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,560
Okay, phone call it is

866
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,320
Thanks, I'll dig deeper

867
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:01,840
Go for it

868
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,960
Celebrity "deaths"

869
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,120
Plus paranormal legends

870
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,000
Plus Bamie's signature style

871
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,920
Equals the traffic formula

872
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,440
An explosive viral article

873
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,400
I saw you topping the hot searches

874
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,000
You got there through backlash

875
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,160
But what does it matter?

876
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,520
Hate views still count as views

877
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,280
Infamy is still fame, right?

878
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,240
Why does this person keep egging her on?

879
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,840
Being scolded creates stress

880
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,920
If you're unhappy

881
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,440
I have a way to make you happy

882
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,280
She said yes

883
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,760
That magical item you mentioned

884
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,080
Can it really make me happy?

885
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,680
Magical item

886
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,480
"No-cry charm"

887
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,920
July 13, 2022

888
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,800
Midnight

889
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,520
I'm so happy

890
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,840
I'm so joyful right now

891
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,160
I can definitely accomplish this

892
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,320
There’s actually a group of people

893
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,320
trying to control me and six others

894
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,760
I don’t know what they want

895
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,360
But I can’t let them catch me

896
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,280
or I won’t be able to finish

897
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,320
my plan

898
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,680
Help!

899
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,480
Quick, cuff them!

900
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,400
Is anyone there?

901
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,200
Stay put!

902
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,840
Stay here.

903
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,800
Those six helped me escape

904
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,440
I really have to go—it’s urgent

905
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,280
I feel like my plan

906
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,680
is about to succeed

907
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,040
and become the top trend

908
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,640
We’ve been used

909
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,720
But I just overheard

910
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,960
they’ll be watching the surveillance closely

911
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,120
I don’t know how to get to the 9th floor now

912
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
She deliberately avoided us

913
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,720
She intentionally evaded our surveillance cameras

914
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,880
She must have some method

915
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,040
that allows her to slip past

916
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,360
Exactly

917
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,600
To make the cameras not capture her

918
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,720
Then she walked through

919
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,800
Is it possible that

920
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,880
That...

921
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,440
The thing that makes paintings disappear

922
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,120
That's it

923
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,880
This is exactly what I was telling you about

924
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,000
The two of them made another phone call

925
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,600
What did they say?

926
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,320
This...

927
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,080
Here it comes

928
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,760
The Southern painter's magical creation

929
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,920
The one we saw

930
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,840
"The Vanishing Painting"

931
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,520
"The Vanishing Woman"

932
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,240
When you turn it to a certain angle

933
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,760
the painting becomes invisible

934
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,600
Then when you turn it back

935
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,640
the painting reappears

936
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,160
If she could obtain this material

937
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,600
and apply it to herself

938
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
She could pass through the surveillance

939
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But look at what's attached to it

940
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,760
That white shadow was created by her

941
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,160
Right?

942
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,280
Yes, the white shadow was her doing

943
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,000
Yes, all these mysterious occurrences

944
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,440
were deliberately created by her

945
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,560
But why did Sister Ba still "die"?

946
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,160
She said, "Don't worry, I just want to know..."

947
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,280
the truth about what happened back then.

948
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,760
There should have been a conversation, right?

949
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,720
No conversation.

950
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,560
No conversation at all.

951
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,800
Was she hallucinating?

952
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,440
Possibly.

953
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,320
Unless there's another possibility...

954
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,600
She went in and saw someone...

955
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,440
who was also pretending to be a "ghost" there.

956
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,640
Then she got scared...

957
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,440
Like Sister Bao, for example...

958
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,160
She said, "You captured that..."

959
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,040
"Well, I captured it too."

960
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,200
That's how it was.

961
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
And they found "No Cry Gas" nearby.

962
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,880
"No Cry Gas."

963
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,800
Right, you mentioned hallucinations earlier...

964
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,560
That could actually be...

965
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,720
caused by that "No Cry Gas."

966
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,720
Moreover...

967
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,920
Whoever taught her how to avoid surveillance...

968
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,880
that person who taught her...

969
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,240
would also know how to avoid surveillance themselves.

970
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,000
Right?

971
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,880
As for Sister Ba's fan...

972
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,040
they seem very much like the person who "killed" her.

973
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,000
They kept encouraging...

974
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,640
pushing her to investigate this matter...

975
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,480
to pursue this.

976
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,840
And even taught her how to do it.

977
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,720
Yes.

978
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,040
The question is: who is this fan?

979
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,920
Very suspicious.

980
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,200
Right, we don't know who the fan is.

981
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,920
I think we need to check the Nan family again.

982
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,600
The method to avoid surveillance...

983
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,040
Let's go.

984
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,800
Alright, we're back here again.

985
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,600
Once again, I came to his room.

986
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,800
Where could she stand to avoid the surveillance?

987
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,480
She couldn't hide.

988
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,760
She has to walk over this way

989
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,360
Isn't this "Surveillance - Do Not Touch"?

990
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,160
So this machine is a surveillance device

991
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,480
Right?

992
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,960
Yes

993
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,760
Xiao Wen

994
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,720
I

995
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,480
I

996
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,240
What about your live monitoring?

997
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,160
I'm live monitoring

998
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
I'll go

999
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,600
look for it

1000
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,080
Let's look for it

1001
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,679
Look for it

1002
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,520
Okay

1003
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,560
We should probably look over there

1004
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,320
This

1005
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,440
We're going the wrong way

1006
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,080
First day on the job

1007
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,159
First day at work

1008
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,480
See, she's basically

1009
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,040
She took that thing from the Southern painter

1010
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,440
Right?

1011
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:19,719
Here it is

1012
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,760
Shine it here

1013
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,320
Isn't this just perfect

1014
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,639
Let's pull that over and take a look

1015
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,639
Bro, bring this over and take a look

1016
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,920
When I look at it here,

1017
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,000
the bottom ring appears black.

1018
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,560
See how that part is black, right?

1019
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,400
But when I take it off, it turns white.

1020
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,719
Is this double-layered?

1021
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,040
The top and bottom layers are different.

1022
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,240
Because this also has that layer.

1023
00:34:59,240 --> 00:34:59,640
Right.

1024
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,040
Yes, remember the design inside.

1025
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,120
There's another layer on top.

1026
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,360
See, there's a coating on this surface too.

1027
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:07,840
Correct.

1028
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,040
So as long as the bottom layer remains.

1029
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,400
It just needs to cover the bottom section.

1030
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,080
That's sufficient.

1031
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,680
Yes, it's two layers.

1032
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,760
Two layers indeed.

1033
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,920
This device requires two films.

1034
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,800
to activate properly.

1035
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,480
The glass already has one layer.

1036
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,040
Right.

1037
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,400
Yes, but then the question arises.

1038
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,320
How to cover such a large area?

1039
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,840
The upper layer has no film at all.

1040
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,560
Couldn't she just crouch-walk through?

1041
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,120
Walking like this wouldn't get captured.

1042
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,520
Exactly.

1043
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,560
If she crouch-walks, she won't be recorded.

1044
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,360
She has to crouch-walk.

1045
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,760
Then at her maximum height line.

1046
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,400
Just cover the exposed portion.

1047
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Right.

1048
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:41,680
Isn't that correct?

1049
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,040
Because the layers are different.

1050
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,880
Block it like this.

1051
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,160
We'll do it this way.

1052
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,440
She'll carry it while walking like this.

1053
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,360
Yes.

1054
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,280
But there's one problem

1055
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,200
I can see your clothes

1056
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,080
but I can't see your head

1057
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,560
You mentioned feet might show?

1058
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:03,800
Right

1059
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,040
Except for the part where you cover your head

1060
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,240
So

1061
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,880
Let's check later

1062
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,080
how the live monitoring works

1063
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,320
Guys, I've got it.

1064
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,960
Let's go to Nanhua's place now.

1065
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,880
I can use his computer.

1066
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,280
to log into my backend system.

1067
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,360
Then we can view the live surveillance feed here.

1068
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,960
Okay.

1069
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,560
Get Nanhua's computer for him.

1070
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,560
Surveillance.

1071
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,280
Done.

1072
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,640
Come on.

1073
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,280
Let me try it.

1074
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,200
Let's figure this out.

1075
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:28,920
Good, very good.

1076
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,360
Can you see us?

1077
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,240
Yes, you two are way too obvious.

1078
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,120
Just hold it sideways.

1079
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,240
Hold it horizontally.

1080
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,480
Hold it horizontally closer to the wall.

1081
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,120
Yes, just like that.

1082
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,080
No, not further in.

1083
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,720
It won't cover like this.

1084
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,520
We can still see it.

1085
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,240
No, tilt it a bit, don't press it flat.

1086
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,560
Tilt it a bit, just...

1087
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:47,960
Let me do it.

1088
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,800
You go.

1089
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,240
Like this?

1090
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,440
Yes, that'll work.

1091
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,000
Right.

1092
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,400
But there's a beam.

1093
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,200
Can you see her moving like this?

1094
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,800
Yes, we can.

1095
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,400
We can see it.

1096
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,120
Still visible.

1097
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
Why can't I see anything?

1098
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,400
So clumsy

1099
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,920
Mainly because it's black

1100
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,760
Yeah, just a black blob

1101
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,320
How could she pass by here

1102
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,800
without noticing the black frame

1103
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,200
So how can we make its

1104
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,040
screen display

1105
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,040
maximized

1106
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,080
If we take this and

1107
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,800
put it in front of its lens?

1108
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,040
Put it in front of its lens?

1109
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,920
Stick it on the surveillance camera.

1110
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,120
Put it inside.

1111
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,520
Someone as big as me couldn't even fit in there.

1112
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,080
Right.

1113
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,760
How many killers are as tall as us?

1114
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,040
He's as tall as me and Liu Xialai combined.

1115
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,560
You two are "accomplices."

1116
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,720
Like this.

1117
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,120
Impossible.

1118
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,160
Because look,

1119
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,840
the camera's coverage

1120
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,520
only reaches about this far.

1121
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,360
Right.

1122
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,120
So when it films up to this point,

1123
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,280
no one

1124
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,440
has done anything.

1125
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,240
She can only

1126
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,400
She has to approach from the side.

1127
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,480
If placing something, it has to be from the side.

1128
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,320
From the side.

1129
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,720
It's not impossible.

1130
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,600
Find a stick or something

1131
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,360
Let me try, here

1132
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,680
Will this work, bro?

1133
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,240
This one's probably not long enough

1134
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,000
Won't stay in place

1135
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,400
We need something like a fishing rod

1136
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:21,960
that kind of thing

1137
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,520
Right?

1138
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:22,960
Yeah

1139
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,880
We need a long one

1140
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,120
We need something longer

1141
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,560
Is this it?

1142
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,280
This wooden stick

1143
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,320
Easel

1144
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,000
Like a selfie stick

1145
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,360
Like this

1146
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,200
Yes

1147
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:44,560
No

1148
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,760
Like this, should it be clipped inside?

1149
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,200
Clip it

1150
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,200
Then she just needs to place it horizontally on top

1151
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,520
Right

1152
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,280
Just block it for that second, cut!

1153
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,680
This is it, definitely this

1154
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,520
Let's try it first

1155
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,520
This shouldn't be facing downward, right?

1156
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,600
Like this

1157
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,120
Screw it on

1158
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,920
Did it go on?

1159
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,280
It's in

1160
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,920
Upward works too

1161
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,200
Is it clipped?

1162
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,840
It's clipped

1163
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,680
Clipped

1164
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,760
Clip it, come on, go up

1165
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,320
Move further inside

1166
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,240
Push it inward

1167
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,960
You need to block all angles of that camera

1168
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,720
Right

1169
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,760
This way it shouldn't be visible

1170
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,560
Let me go check

1171
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,440
Check the live feed

1172
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:21,960
I'll do it

1173
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,240
Wait a moment

1174
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,160
Get down

1175
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,640
Gone, vanished

1176
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,320
Gone

1177
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,720
Gone

1178
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,680
Vanished

1179
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,680
Push it in, push it in

1180
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,760
You need to block that shot

1181
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,200
All sides

1182
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,560
Push it in

1183
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,280
Right

1184
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:51,840
Gone.

1185
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,320
Disappeared.

1186
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,040
It's gone.

1187
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,040
We can turn invisible too.

1188
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,640
Possible.

1189
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,400
So she used this method.

1190
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,320
Wait a minute.

1191
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,840
Then the question arises again.

1192
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,120
How did Bamei manage under surveillance

1193
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,320
to complete these operations?

1194
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,640
But she's definitely a seasoned pro

1195
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,000
Took it and left in one motion

1196
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,600
Is she really tall enough?

1197
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,200
That's what I doubt

1198
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,720
Right

1199
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,600
So it's probably a man, right?

1200
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,160
Like this

1201
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,480
Let me walk through the camera blind spot

1202
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,320
You take a look

1203
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,280
You go

1204
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,000
I'll walk standing up

1205
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,760
Walk standing up

1206
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,800
I'm walking standing up - am I in frame now?

1207
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,880
No

1208
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,640
Say when I'm in frame

1209
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,040
Not yet

1210
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,760
Now you're in

1211
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,400
Step back

1212
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,760
Wait, let me see when you exit frame

1213
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,800
Tell me when I'm out of frame

1214
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,480
Walk again

1215
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,240
Now you're out

1216
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,000
Okay

1217
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,320
You guys come try, come over

1218
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,760
So she could just place the chair directly, right?

1219
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,480
I'm not in frame until here

1220
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,560
Only when I reach here do I enter frame

1221
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,400
When I'm level with the statue

1222
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:52,880
That's when I enter frame

1223
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
Only now am I in frame

1224
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,520
This whole area isn't in frame

1225
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,600
Then when I walk to here

1226
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,520
That's when I exit frame

1227
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,680
So there's quite a large space

1228
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,400
Right

1229
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,880
Then she could definitely place the chair

1230
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,840
Got it

1231
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,640
Come on

1232
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,560
Take it down and redo it

1233
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,680
Do it again, let's recreate the scene

1234
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,200
Okay

1235
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,040
Coming

1236
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,040
"The killer" with her murder weapon

1237
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,680
Here comes the pole

1238
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,720
Can you see me now?

1239
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,280
No

1240
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:14,920
No

1241
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,400
Still no

1242
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:17,840
Not yet

1243
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,640
Take it slowly

1244
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,960
Take your time

1245
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,840
Go for it!

1246
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,560
Is there any?

1247
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,640
Got it, but we need to hurry.

1248
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,600
Hurry up.

1249
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,080
Yes, you need to slide quickly.

1250
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,920
Quickly.

1251
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,360
Three, two, one.

1252
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,120
Got it?

1253
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,680
Okay.

1254
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,480
Got it.

1255
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,360
But it's a bit shaky.

1256
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,360
Check if there's any cached video

1257
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,400
Compare them to see if there's any shaking

1258
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,920
July 15th, check July 15th

1259
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,560
This is the right direction, right?

1260
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,600
Yes

1261
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,240
Someone came here

1262
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,840
Then walked back

1263
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,000
Gone, nothing after that

1264
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,880
Next one?

1265
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,280
Check July 16th

1266
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,040
Right

1267
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,760
There should be some difference

1268
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,800
July 16th, take a look

1269
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,200
It flickered

1270
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:46,920
Did it flicker?

1271
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,120
Flickered for one frame

1272
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,960
Watch it through first

1273
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,720
Look carefully

1274
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,760
Went black for a moment

1275
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,880
Flickered for one second

1276
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,440
This segment was replaced

1277
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,160
Exactly

1278
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,880
Didn't you say there were no editing traces?

1279
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,320
Yes

1280
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,560
What's going on with you?

1281
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,120
My surveillance footage can't be edited

1282
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,240
I'll go back to check that corridor

1283
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,840
Because the surveillance went black for a second

1284
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,960
That blackout moment might be...

1285
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,800
Okay

1286
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,080
But the surveillance was completely black for a second

1287
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,120
How could she make it go completely black for a second?

1288
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,040
If she turned off the lights...

1289
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,880
Check if turning off the lights causes complete darkness

1290
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,600
Take a look

1291
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,200
Go press the switch for a full second of darkness

1292
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,480
You do it

1293
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:38,920
Okay

1294
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,560
Ready?

1295
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:41,560
Go

1296
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,080
Three

1297
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,240
Two

1298
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,800
One

1299
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,600
One

1300
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,920
If it closes,

1301
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,160
it would look exactly the same.

1302
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,640
Yes, it would go dark here,

1303
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,200
but the main light is inside too.

1304
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,880
Then she'll need someone's help even more,

1305
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,360
because if she places it from there,

1306
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,560
she can't press the switch

1307
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,400
while placing it in front of the lens.

1308
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,040
So it must have been done by two people

1309
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,800
One person could have entered from the bookstore

1310
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,200
Then Bamei came

1311
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,480
Bamei came, and then together

1312
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,000
But when leaving

1313
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,720
Bamei was already "dead"

1314
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,800
This person took everything

1315
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,160
away

1316
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,800
Put it in

1317
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,680
When she left

1318
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,280
She could be here

1319
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,800
One person could have done it all

1320
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,880
Right, so it was done by two people

1321
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,600
After the two did it

1322
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,040
Then that person "killed" her

1323
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,320
So that person

1324
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,280
is very likely in the bookstore

1325
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,040
He is in the bookstore

1326
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,040
He must be in the bookstore

1327
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,520
I think we should check the bookstore first

1328
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,120
The thing used to knock them out hasn’t been found yet

1329
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,600
Right

1330
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,840
Why did all four faint at the same time?

1331
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,640
See if there’s any device there

1332
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,960
that made them faint instantly

1333
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,760
Haven't we still not

1334
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,720
thoroughly searched this place?

1335
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,160
No.

1336
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,160
First of all, what's planted here?

1337
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,400
We still don't know, right?

1338
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,160
Our initial guess is...

1339
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,800
Wait a minute.

1340
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,560
Yellow roses.

1341
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:25,960
No.

1342
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,520
Is it possible that a "body" could be hidden here?

1343
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,400
Possibly.

1344
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,680
In this flower bed.

1345
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,720
Repeating old tricks.

1346
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,280
It's not impossible, right?

1347
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,520
Should we dig it up?

1348
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,280
Use this to dig.

1349
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,600
Try digging a couple of times first.

1350
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,080
Give everyone a small shovel.

1351
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,000
Are we digging?

1352
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,680
Found anything?

1353
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,880
There's a box here

1354
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,480
Here's one with an X mark

1355
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,640
There's another piece here

1356
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,120
Don't move

1357
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,840
Why are they all empty?

1358
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,400
Then there should be more

1359
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,200
Look at that board

1360
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,280
What's drawn on it?

1361
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,160
X marks

1362
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:06,920
All marked with X's

1363
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,960
And also

1364
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,400
Here

1365
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,400
Got something

1366
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,880
"Sleep Gas"

1367
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,920
After inhaling

1368
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,280
causes deep sleep for ten hours

1369
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,040
without shedding a drop of "blood"

1370
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,000
It's "Sleep Gas" again

1371
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,200
Collapses immediately upon inhalation

1372
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,080
Won't wake up for 180 minutes

1373
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,160
That drug

1374
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,120
"Sleep Gas"

1375
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,320
Why so many people here?

1376
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,840
Those four were knocked out by "Sleep Gas"

1377
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,320
Drugged unconscious

1378
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,160
Yeah, completely knocked out

1379
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,840
The people who wronged you

1380
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,880
Besides her, there are six more

1381
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,640
All six of us

1382
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,680
We won't be digging and then

1383
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,480
suddenly have someone come up behind us

1384
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,120
and "kill" us, right?

1385
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,560
Don't worry, big brother's here

1386
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,760
Look at this symbol

1387
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,840
What is this symbol?

1388
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,440
This is "e"

1389
00:46:59,440 --> 00:46:59,960
"e mo"

1390
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,480
"e mo"

1391
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,280
There's a photo of her with this, right?

1392
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,560
And the lost medal has been found too

1393
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,760
2019

1394
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,720
Top 10 Trending Articles Award

1395
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,320
Look, there are seven boxes in total here.

1396
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:12,760
It must be

1397
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,520
After they "kill" all of us,

1398
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,600
they'll bury us one by one.

1399
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,880
Each person's keepsake

1400
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,720
There are many people outside now

1401
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,520
coming after us.

1402
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,480
What common traits do we share?

1403
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,320
The first person is already gone.

1404
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:26,960
Already gone.

1405
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,400
So we didn't "commit suicide"

1406
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,040
We were "murdered"

1407
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:36,760
Right

1408
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,760
Since moving into Apartment 11,

1409
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,120
this has been the most difficult day to decide.

1410
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,440
It's completely

1411
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
like a headless fly.

1412
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,600
It's the same method from fifteen years ago.

1413
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,560
The same "cause of death."

1414
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,920
If Lucky likes Youyou so much,

1415
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,520
why would they want to "eliminate" me?

1416
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,600
Aside from Bamei,

1417
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,840
who is this person that all six of us have wronged?

1418
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,600
Who is the "killer"?

1419
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,680
Teng Zhongjie is "dead."

1420
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,800
You've been listed as a suspect.

1421
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,880
I want to reinvestigate

1422
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,200
the "burned corpse" case in the grove three years ago.

1423
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,160
Teng Zhongjie knew everything about you.

1424
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,080
Someone created a double-locked room.

1425
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,280
I suspect that among you six,

1426
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,480
there is one "killer."

1427
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,200
No, no.

1428
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,520
They say

1429
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,720
I "killed" someone.
