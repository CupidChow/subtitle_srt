1
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,680
The year 2022

2
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,880
We found a building by the sea

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,600
with a peculiar architectural design

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,560
It faces the ocean

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,400
standing solitary and aloof

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,840
Its silent window panes

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,960
are arranged in harmonious disorder

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,120
The dimly lit corridor

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,400
covered in dust

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,880
Footsteps echoing

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,280
and sudden cat's meow

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,720
escalate the mysterious atmosphere

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,840
to its peak in an instant

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,040
compelling one's imagination

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,720
What will happen

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,960
So we spent nearly a hundred days

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,960
building up a

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,240
A brand new story world

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,080
Over a thousand blueprints

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,120
Meticulously crafted

21
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,120
20,000 square meters of scenes completely renewed

22
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,520
A story with nearly one hundred characters

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
Intertwined plotlines

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,960
Together forming a 200,000-word

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,640
"Urban fable"

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,280
Over the next few dozen days

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,720
Let us step together into

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,720
this narrative world

29
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,000
Follow the new tenants with mysterious pasts

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,880
To meet the diverse residents of the apartment

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,680
To unravel

32
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,440
the intricate layers of mysteries

33
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,400
And together uncover the building's

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,200
ultimate hidden truth

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,880
This season will unfold over eleven weeks

36
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,920
to tell the story of Apartment No. 11 in Tui City

37
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,760
Six players will move in as new residents

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,520
and occupy Apartment No. 11

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,520
They'll be drawn into mysterious cases

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
By forming the "Apartment Investigation Team"

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,560
they'll visit different floors

42
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,040
meet various long-term residents

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,880
solve their own identity mysteries

44
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,400
and uncover secrets behind each case

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,320
For the first six nights

46
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,520
one new resident's story will be revealed weekly

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,440
The complex relationships between new and old residents

48
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,200
will gradually come to light

49
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,680
Starting from the seventh case

50
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,840
all storylines will intertwine

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,160
As truths are uncovered layer by layer

52
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,240
every choice made by the new residents

53
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,720
will influence the story's direction

54
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,800
and final outcome

55
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,640
In each case

56
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,000
the team must at the crime scene

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,280
identify the "victim"

58
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,800
and use clues

59
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,400
to identify potential suspects

60
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,840
Note:

61
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,480
Suspects aren't limited to

62
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,520
Apartment No. 11 residents and visitors

63
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,880
Even within the investigation team

64
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,200
there might be suspects

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,560
After gathering suspects

66
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,760
the team will interrogate them

67
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,560
and re-examine based on testimonies

68
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,520
Finally voting to identify the "real culprit"

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,760
Only the "real culprit" can lie

70
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,080
Only by finding the true "culprit"

71
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,280
can players win

72
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,320
Players who vote correctly

73
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,760
receive a golden key

74
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,720
If a player is the "culprit"

75
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,840
successful escape earns a golden key

76
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,640
I'm Guo Baoyou

77
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,880
a mystery novelist

78
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,280
May 6th

79
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,760
I moved into Apartment 11 in Tui City

80
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Coincidentally

81
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,360
on moving day I ran into my old friend

82
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,200
Bai Sanwan

83
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,000
and made some new friends

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,560
I'm Liu Xialai

85
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,280
Liu Xialai, pet caretaker

86
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,720
Ke Wuku who loves cosplay

87
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,440
Ke Wuku

88
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,920
Song Piaoliang, craft expert

89
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,280
and Zhou Keke, creative chocolate master

90
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,800
After completing check-in

91
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,560
the manager Xiao He gave us a tour of the apartment

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,440
While going upstairs

93
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,640
we saw a girl at the elevator

94
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,280
Xiao He said

95
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,240
she's the drama queen here, Zhenzhen

96
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,080
But the name Zhenzhen

97
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,040
felt somewhat unfamiliar and strange to me

98
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,480
But this wasn't the only strange thing

99
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,920
While touring Zhou Keke's room

100
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,520
a person in a red hoodie

101
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,800
suddenly jumped off the building before our eyes

102
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,480
We were terrified

103
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,120
and rushed to the third-floor platform to check

104
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,000
Did someone fall?

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,520
Yes

106
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,480
But the "body"

107
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,840
mysteriously disappeared

108
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,800
No one jumped

109
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,520
No one

110
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,920
This window right here we just saw

111
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,560
No one

112
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,360
Except for us six new residents

113
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,160
Agent Teng and other staff members

114
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,400
insisted

115
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,080
they never saw anyone jump

116
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,440
What's going on?

117
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,560
Just as we were about to leave

118
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,040
the TV on the third-floor platform

119
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,640
suddenly started playing a video

120
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,400
Don't

121
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,320
doubt

122
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,040
(no direct translation - part of "怀疑" meaning "doubt")

123
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,520
(no direct translation - part of "怀疑" meaning "doubt")

124
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,400
The blood-red words tell us

125
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,560
what we see is the truth

126
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,800
Mysterious symbols have also appeared

127
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,120
warning us that if we don't uncover the truth

128
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,080
we will all "die"

129
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,760
With anxious hearts

130
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,000
we returned to the room

131
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,560
I always hear a woman crying at midnight

132
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,680
It's someone falling down

133
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,640
Why didn't I see it?

134
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,200
Then where did they hide her?

135
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,240
Is anyone there?

136
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,520
Help!

137
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,320
Anyone here?

138
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,720
"Blood"

139
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,000
Is somebody there?

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,520
Someone come!

141
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,400
Keke

142
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,040
Is that Zhou Keke's voice?

143
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,160
Zhou Keke's voice

144
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,800
Let's go

145
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,000
Come on, let's go to the 7th floor

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,040
Is anyone here?

147
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,320
Coming

148
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,200
Xiao Zhou

149
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,040
What's wrong?

150
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,680
While I was sleeping

151
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,520
"Blood" dripped from here

152
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,040
What "blood"?

153
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,160
Where did it drip from?

154
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,040
Here by the bed

155
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,560
Where exactly?

156
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,360
Inside this?

157
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,000
On top here

158
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,800
Teng Zhongjie, you said everything was fine.

159
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,920
Is this a rat or something?

160
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,520
Got crushed by the machine above?

161
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,400
Or what happened?

162
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,800
This is really terrifying.

163
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,840
It's still dripping.

164
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,560
What's wrong?

165
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,400
Is anyone there?

166
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,080
Go greet them.

167
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,640
Go receive them.

168
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,720
You go first.

169
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,440
Let me find something.

170
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,520
Here, let me help you with this.

171
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,160
What's the matter?

172
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,920
There's "blood" dripping from above me.

173
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,320
Where?

174
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,600
Suddenly there was "blood" dripping down.

175
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
Don't be scared.

176
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,480
No one can go up there.

177
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,160
So if it's really "blood,"

178
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,680
it must be from some rodents.

179
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
No, this is definitely...

180
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,400
Is it coming from the eighth floor?

181
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,040
Cockroaches.

182
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,240
Yes, coming from upstairs.

183
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,280
Who lives on the eighth floor?

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,720
That drama queen.

185
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,280
But on our eighth floor,

186
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,080
she runs a theater.

187
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,200
Zhenzhen.

188
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,320
Is Zhenzhen on the eighth floor?

189
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,080
Let's go.

190
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,160
But why...

191
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,520
Guo Baoyou and Bai Sanwan are missing.

192
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,000
Are Guo Baoyou and Bai Sanwan not here?

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,960
No, I went looking for them.

194
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,440
I wanted to come with them.

195
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,400
Bai Sanwan.

196
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,360
Guo Baoyou

197
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:17,800
Where is everyone?

198
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,280
Where are those two?

199
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,200
Don't panic.

200
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,240
It's fine.

201
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,640
I think we should check upstairs.

202
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,200
Let's go check upstairs.

203
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,840
Okay.

204
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,160
Your place...

205
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
is terrifying.

206
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
It's fine, our feng shui...

207
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,799
being by the sea...

208
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,440
means nothing bad will happen.

209
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,640
This is the 8th floor.

210
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,280
But every time the elevator opens...

211
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,559
I feel so creeped out.

212
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,920
This is one of my long-term clients...

213
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,400
Zhenzhen Theater.

214
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,960
So dark...

215
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,800
Is it always this dark here?

216
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,600
Still no lights?

217
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,240
This...

218
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
How do I get in here?

219
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,440
Why is this so scary?

220
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,320
Don't be afraid.

221
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,400
What is this thing?

222
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,920
Do I have shoe covers or something?

223
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,720
Why do you wear shoe covers everywhere you go?

224
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,440
As an agent,

225
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,480
This is just how it is.

226
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,800
What is this? Why is it so dark?

227
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,480
What's wrong?

228
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,840
What's the matter?

229
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,080
Why are you shouting?

230
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,480
Come here.

231
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,720
I'll hold your hand.

232
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,520
Nothing happened.

233
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,240
You're already scared.

234
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,880
Don't be afraid.

235
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,400
I'm sorry.

236
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,920
Don't worry.

237
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,920
I'll wait for you outside.

238
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,360
No.

239
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,680
Come in quickly.

240
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,360
Let's go see what's going on.

241
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,600
It's so dark here.

242
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,080
This...

243
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,520
Is this theater always this dark?

244
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,560
I

245
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,440
I'm afraid someone is behind me

246
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,960
Who is it?

247
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,920
I'm scared someone might suddenly appear behind me

248
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,640
Later

249
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,720
Wait a moment

250
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,600
Haven't we moved at all?

251
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,880
Move forward

252
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,760
Who was laughing just now?

253
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,320
Someone laughed ahead

254
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,800
Did someone laugh?

255
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,120
That must be Zhenzhen

256
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,360
Let's go see what's up with her

257
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,360
Zhenzhen

258
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,080
The Teng agent you like is here

259
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,040
What

260
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,400
What

261
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,040
Can't see

262
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,640
What

263
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Was there someone just now?

264
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,840
Yes

265
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,360
Maybe we should go out first

266
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,480
Let's find a flashlight before coming back in

267
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,160
That's nothing

268
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,760
Hit him

269
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,160
Ke Wuku

270
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,880
Can you come back and hold on a bit?

271
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,080
I still need one leg to brace against Zhou Keke

272
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,920
No, this is me

273
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,800
This is me, sorry

274
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,880
Thank you, sorry

275
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,800
Dragged me away

276
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,280
Beautiful

277
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,960
No

278
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,200
Where are you?

279
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,160
I can't see you

280
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,640
I found him

281
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,280
What is he?

282
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,560
Who are you?

283
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,160
Who?

284
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,320
Ning

285
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,040
He

286
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
Bai

287
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,640
San Wan

288
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,360
Bai Sanwan

289
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,200
Sanwan

290
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,120
Sanwan, you're looking for trouble

291
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,200
You're crazy

292
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,560
Why are you here?

293
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,320
I'm waiting for someone

294
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,840
Who?

295
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,720
Who are you waiting for?

296
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,400
Have you seen Zhenzhen?

297
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,600
It's too dark to see

298
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,520
Gone, went forward

299
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,920
So dark

300
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,720
Someone ahead

301
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,640
Let's not lose contact

302
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,760
My hand is in front

303
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,480
Can you...

304
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,120
Give me a hand

305
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,840
There's a door here

306
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,600
Come, over here

307
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,360
Such a shabby little place

308
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,520
Scared us so badly

309
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,360
There's light now

310
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,280
Be careful

311
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,480
This place gives me the creeps

312
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,960
I never liked coming here

313
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,800
It's scary

314
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,280
Zhenzhen

315
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,880
This is Zhenzhen

316
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,400
Zhenzhen "died"

317
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,120
What kind of apartment is this?

318
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,360
Did "two people" die?

319
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,840
So now...

320
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,320
No, this is Zhenzhen.

321
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,480
Wait, then the one who fell earlier...

322
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,440
wasn't Zhenzhen.

323
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,360
The one who fell before...

324
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,920
The one who fell...

325
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,040
was someone wearing a red hoodie.

326
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,440
No...

327
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,320
Where did that person go?

328
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,280
Where's Guo Baoyou?

329
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,840
Right, where is Guo Baoyou?

330
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,880
Quick, let's get out of here first.

331
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,480
Don't move.

332
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,920
Don't disturb the crime scene.

333
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,880
Nobody move.

334
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,800
There are bloody footprints.

335
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,640
Bai Sanwan, are these your footprints?

336
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,120
Not mine, look.

337
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,880
But these footprints...

338
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,640
They walked out stepping in blood.

339
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,360
Someone went out.

340
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,400
Guo Baoyou.

341
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,160
Guo Baoyou went out.

342
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,920
Let's go.

343
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,760
Guo Baoyou.

344
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,320
You scared me

345
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,280
Come here

346
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,040
No

347
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,640
Where did you go?

348
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
I couldn’t find you

349
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,560
Why did you come up so early?

350
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,120
Guo Baoyou

351
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,720
Check your shoe sole, the bottom of your foot

352
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,160
That one

353
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
What?

354
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,240
Any?

355
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,040
None at all?

356
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,480
What about the agent?

357
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,280
I don’t have any either

358
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,800
There shouldn’t be any

359
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,520
Zhenzhen

360
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,440
If anything comes up

361
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,360
you can call me, okay?

362
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,400
Let's go find Xiao He first

363
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,000
Let's go look for Xiao He

364
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,920
Let's go

365
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,360
Xiao He

366
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,840
Xiao He, something's happened!

367
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,720
Xiao He

368
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,920
What's wrong?

369
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,920
There's been a "murder" on the 8th floor

370
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,600
"Murder"

371
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,320
Yes

372
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,520
Zhenzhen has "died"

373
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,120
Didn't we just see Zhenzhen?

374
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
When?

375
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,440
In the elevator

376
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,480
She got off the elevator

377
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,440
and then "died" upstairs

378
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,280
Since our apartment

379
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,880
has had a "murder"

380
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,840
As the apartment manager,

381
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,800
I feel responsible

382
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,040
Actually, I have another identity

383
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,280
I'm currently

384
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,600
studying for the bar exam

385
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,520
while working as a trainee manager

386
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,320
Your Zhenguoli Grapefruit Four Seasons Tea looks great

387
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,920
It tastes good too - yes

388
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,200
I've prepared something for everyone

389
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,480
that will help with the investigation

390
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,280
Great

391
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,640
This is the Zhenguoli Investigation Kit

392
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,560
It contains everything

393
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,640
you'll need

394
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,920
for gathering evidence

395
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,080
Like notebooks,

396
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,800
pens,

397
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,240
evidence bags, etc.

398
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,840
And of course,

399
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,600
most importantly

400
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,760
there's the authentic

401
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,600
Zhenguoli Grapefruit Four Seasons Tea

402
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,760
Have a bottle before investigating

403
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,600
to help you

404
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,560
uncover the truth faster

405
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,800
Already started drinking?

406
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,120
How is it?

407
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,160
My mouth is filled with a light tea fragrance

408
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,960
And real fruit pieces you can chew

409
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,520
Honestly

410
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,680
This has real tea and real fruit

411
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,240
The Real Fruit Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring Tea

412
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,800
Really good

413
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,920
Nice, what do you think?

414
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,440
Tastes great

415
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,560
It's genuinely real tea and fruit

416
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,839
With a subtle tea aroma inside

417
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,440
Combined with real fruit pieces

418
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,240
The texture is amazing

419
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,359
I hope it can help me

420
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,599
Quickly find the truth

421
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,480
It definitely will

422
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,640
Makes reasoning easier for everyone

423
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,880
Here

424
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,560
Can we just take any?

425
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:17,960
Yes

426
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,560
One for each

427
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,160
One per person

428
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,880
Everyone gets one

429
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,119
Notebooks, magnifying glasses

430
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,160
I got an instant camera

431
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,400
A pen and two gloves

432
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,840
Am I the captain?

433
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,800
You're the walkie-talkie

434
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,920
What walkie-talkie? I'm the captain!

435
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,200
I'm the walkie-talkie

436
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,960
The walkie-talkie can contact me anytime

437
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,600
I got nothing here

438
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,720
Just some peanuts and seeds

439
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,640
And two packs of pickled vegetables

440
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
Seriously?

441
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,920
Let's take a group photo first

442
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,840
We might not get another chance later

443
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,440
Come on, while we're all still alive

444
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,920
Here

445
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Three, two, one

446
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,760
Then we'll go first.

447
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,400
Okay, go ahead.

448
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,880
I'll contact you immediately if any issues arise.

449
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,840
Brother Teng.

450
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,480
You must ensure.

451
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,600
Our 100% occupancy rate.

452
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,320
Don't worry.

453
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,920
We shouldn't fear problems when they arise.

454
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,320
Okay.

455
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,760
We'll solve problems as they come.

456
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,240
Alright.

457
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,720
This is our small hotel's.

458
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,280
Safe travels, Brother Teng.

459
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,720
Okay.

460
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,840
Stay here and wait for my good news.

461
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,240
Wait.

462
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
What I don't understand is.

463
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,360
Who was that person who fell at the beginning?

464
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,080
An unnamed person "died".

465
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,360
Right, two people "died".

466
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,960
You still haven't said where you went earlier.

467
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,400
What do you mean where I went?

468
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,200
You arrived late too, right?

469
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,760
Yes, I arrived late.

470
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,120
And then?

471
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,920
Where did you go?

472
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,760
I was just in that theater corridor.

473
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,400
What were you doing there?

474
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,720
Why?

475
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,120
Impossible.

476
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,480
We didn't see you when we went up.

477
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,040
Why did you go up?

478
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,880
What were you trying to do?

479
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,480
You guys turned left as soon as you came up.

480
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,800
I was on the right side.

481
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,400
Then why didn't you say anything?

482
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,120
I was about to speak when you all ran to the left.

483
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,920
That's impossible.

484
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,240
We never ran at any point.

485
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,880
We're here.

486
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,200
Arrived.

487
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,920
Just look at my expression - it clearly wasn't me.

488
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,560
There are too many holes in your story.

489
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,880
Both you and Bai Sanwan are suspicious.

490
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,360
Right.

491
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:11,840
It's so dark here

492
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,200
Still no lights?

493
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,520
Turn left

494
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,200
Let's go to the crime scene to find that thing

495
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,080
Slow down

496
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,480
Let's not get separated

497
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,200
Here

498
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,760
Here

499
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,320
Who?

500
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,120
Hold onto me

501
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,760
Come on

502
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,320
Let's go

503
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,720
Come on

504
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,440
Move

505
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,840
There should be nothing here now

506
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,760
Nothing

507
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,280
Okay

508
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,680
Careful, it's a wall

509
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,360
We're here

510
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,320
Ready to go in

511
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,880
Go

512
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,280
Alright

513
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,720
Zhou Keke is something else

514
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,840
The moment he saw Youliang, he immediately let go of my hand

515
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,200
Why are there paw prints here?

516
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,400
A cat?

517
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,800
Whose cat is it?

518
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,560
It's a stray cat from the building.

519
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,400
The cat's paw prints are...

520
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,760
This must be related to the cat.

521
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,720
Right.

522
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,280
But the (human) footprints...

523
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,400
lead that way.

524
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,800
Correct.

525
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,400
This is theater performance

526
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,800
Stage props

527
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,600
One two three four five six

528
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,200
There's one on the ground

529
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,240
Is it red?

530
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,600
This is also a stage prop

531
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,240
Which means

532
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,120
In other words

533
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,800
Are you saying

534
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,760
This "blood"

535
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,880
might possibly not be

536
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,520
real blood

537
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,400
Right

538
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,640
It could have just been spilled

539
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,920
So the "blood" in your room

540
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,160
must have flowed from this drain

541
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,400
into your room

542
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,000
Yes

543
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,480
I just remembered

544
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,080
The 8th floor isn't open today

545
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,040
It's dark, isn't it?

546
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,000
Why did you only remember now?

547
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,360
We've been fumbling in the dark

548
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,640
Sorry

549
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
I got nervous and forgot

550
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,560
After you enter the door

551
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,000
high up on both side walls

552
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,040
there are buttons

553
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,160
Press both buttons together

554
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
and the lights will turn on

555
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,200
You'll need two tall people

556
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,600
Okay

557
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,120
to do it

558
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,400
Do you see those buttons?

559
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,800
Two guys about 1.8-1.9 meters tall

560
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,880
This one, right?

561
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,440
Yes.

562
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,200
Help me up.

563
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,560
Come on.

564
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,760
Let's go.

565
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,120
Go.

566
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,680
Come on.

567
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,080
One, two, three.

568
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,680
And then?

569
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,240
Is it on?

570
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,600
Open the door and check.

571
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,360
It's on.

572
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,520
Come on, it's bright outside

573
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,800
Let's go out and see the brightness

574
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,400
Come out and look

575
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,400
There's so much space here

576
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,360
This entire floor

577
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,400
was rented by Zhenzhen

578
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,640
She rented the whole floor

579
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,480
It's all connected

580
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,320
Right

581
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,440
What is this?

582
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,720
This is another room.

583
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,440
Is it the same as the previous one?

584
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:39,920
No, it's different.

585
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,720
There's no "corpse" here.

586
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,600
And in this room...

587
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,240
did anything else appear?

588
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,000
Anything new?

589
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,120
No.

590
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,280
Nothing.

591
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,480
I see.

592
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,240
There are four rooms.

593
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,760
Right, let's check other places.

594
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,080
I'll go check the other rooms.

595
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,000
The arrangement of each room

596
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,240
is exactly the same

597
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,920
There's also a door

598
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,440
Yes, every room is identical

599
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,800
There's an audience counter here

600
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,240
This camera

601
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,040
is used to record

602
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,240
the audience count for each performance

603
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,640
It only captures movement at entry/exit points

604
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,840
Stores records every two hours

605
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,200
and transmits them to

606
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,880
the theater's backstage computer system

607
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,280
All records are overwritten at midnight daily

608
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,880
Who is this?

609
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,120
Wait a moment

610
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,520
Who is this?

611
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,160
Who is this person?

612
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,200
This person came within the last two hours

613
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,880
Exactly

614
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,920
This is Room 4, right?

615
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,800
Correct

616
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,680
Don't know this person

617
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,600
Never seen them before

618
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,720
We haven't seen this person

619
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,920
We haven't met them, right?

620
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,160
Take a photo

621
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,920
Take a picture

622
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,320
The one in that room just now

623
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:06,960
is Bai Sanwan

624
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,840
Viewing records from the first room

625
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,080
It shows Bai Sanwan

626
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,440
Check the other two

627
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,720
There are more rooms

628
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,000
I'll go check other rooms

629
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,120
Bai Sanwan

630
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,760
Are they starting to clean up the scene?

631
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,080
Suspicious Bai Sanwan

632
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,840
I think he's suspicious

633
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,160
Extremely suspicious

634
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,720
Who's this about?

635
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,720
Who is this?

636
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:38,760
Don't know

637
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,600
We still don't know who he is

638
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,760
But remember his face

639
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,080
Who is this?

640
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,400
This is...

641
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,720
Guo Baoyou

642
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,200
Guo Baoyou

643
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,800
Right?

644
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,880
He...

645
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,640
He's been here

646
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,080
Guo Baoyou is here

647
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,160
Yes, I'm here

648
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,120
What are you doing here?

649
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,160
Why did you come here?

650
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,640
No, it's...

651
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,520
My ex-girlfriend asked me to come up

652
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,960
So I came up to see

653
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,000
Ex-girlfriend?

654
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,960
Who's your ex-girlfriend?

655
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,880
Where's your ex-girlfriend?

656
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,920
My ex is named Jiajia

657
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,320
Jiajia

658
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,640
Why meet here?

659
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,480
Right

660
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,080
I don't know

661
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,000
She sent me a message

662
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,200
We haven't seen each other in a long time

663
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,280
Then one day suddenly...

664
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,000
she broke up with me

665
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,080
I don't know why either

666
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,720
Then she told me...

667
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,000
to come here and meet her

668
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,680
So I came

669
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,000
What did she say?

670
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,600
We met

671
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,520
We met

672
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,560
What happened?

673
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,160
Nothing happened

674
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,040
We just talked briefly

675
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,160
Ended up parting on bad terms

676
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,600
Then why did you come looking for us later?

677
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,400
The lights went out at that time.

678
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
I didn't dare move around.

679
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,440
I heard your voices.

680
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,240
I wanted to wait for you to come over.

681
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,040
Let's leave together.

682
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,640
I promise you.

683
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,840
I'm definitely not the "killer."

684
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,880
So I wouldn't lie.

685
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,200
Did you see anything?

686
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,800
So I wouldn't lie.

687
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,960
I didn't see anything.

688
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,000
What's this? Shining this at me, huh?

689
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,760
Shining this at me.

690
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,680
Wait a minute.

691
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,440
This is Guo Baoyou.

692
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:52,920
And that one...

693
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,240
One is Bai Sanwan.

694
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,320
You wrote Room 1.

695
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,280
Right.

696
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,800
I'm in Room 2.

697
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,640
The person in Room 3 is a stranger.

698
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,360
A stranger.

699
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,960
The two rooms next door...

700
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,880
We're not familiar with them.

701
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,440
Don't know them.

702
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,200
Then Bai Sanwan...

703
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,600
Why were you in that room?

704
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,440
Waiting for someone.

705
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,520
Are you also an ex-girlfriend?

706
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
No, I'm waiting for someone.

707
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,280
Waiting for who?

708
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,480
His room...

709
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,720
Is the room where someone "died."

710
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,520
Were you waiting for Jiajia?

711
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,880
I was also waiting for an ex-girlfriend.

712
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,240
Let's take one more look, alright?

713
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,840
One more look.

714
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,080
Let's go.

715
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,360
That...

716
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,080
Over there ahead.

717
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,920
Is there something there?

718
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,200
Wait a second, let's take a look.

719
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,960
Door open for over 5 seconds will trigger an error

720
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Open and close immediately

721
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,760
This is a one-way door

722
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,960
Open and close immediately

723
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,720
Updates once daily at midnight

724
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,480
Opened

725
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,120
This is connected

726
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,960
No

727
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,080
Quick

728
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
One-way door closure error

729
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,880
It's broken

730
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,520
No, she went to the room next door

731
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,920
Wait a second

732
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,400
I got it

733
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,840
Friends

734
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,920
I've figured out a problem

735
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,000
Where is everyone?

736
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,480
And then the door locked?

737
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,360
Yes, and then this door

738
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,360
is connected to the room next door

739
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Plus there's an error

740
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,480
Can only

741
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,400
It should only work clockwise

742
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:28,960
Only clockwise

743
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,880
Kewuku, right

744
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,040
You can only turn that way

745
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,720
Right?

746
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,000
You can walk through inside, right?

747
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,600
Yes

748
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,680
And it's a one-way door

749
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,960
You can only go through, not come back

750
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,800
Take a look

751
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,400
You take a look

752
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,320
This is a one-way door

753
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,800
Opens and closes immediately

754
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,520
Error if open for more than 5 seconds

755
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,200
Resets daily at midnight

756
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,880
At 2 PM

757
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
One-way door closure error

758
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Just now

759
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,920
Just now I was with that...

760
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,000
Look, it opened

761
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,520
If you don't close it

762
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,000
If left open

763
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,160
Another error appears immediately

764
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,160
Right

765
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,560
Which room is this?

766
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,160
This is Room 3

767
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,080
You can get here from Room 2

768
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,840
From Room 2 to Room 3

769
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,360
It's past Room 4, right?

770
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,120
This is Room 4.

771
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,760
Room 4.

772
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,640
14:13

773
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,680
This is the "crime scene," right?

774
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,440
If it's a one-way door,

775
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,920
you can only enter this room from that side.

776
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,520
Right?

777
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,240
Yes.

778
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,280
This is Room 1.

779
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,040
Let me see.

780
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,200
This...

781
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,120
"No Entry" on this door.

782
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,640
No, you can't... you know...

783
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,440
You can't use this door.

784
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,320
Why?

785
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,240
Right.

786
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,720
Then why?

787
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,160
You can't go from this room to the adjacent one.

788
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,640
Meaning you can't go from Room 1 to Room 2.

789
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,920
Then I'm not a suspect.

790
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,480
Right?

791
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,160
So only Room 4 leads to Room 3.

792
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,680
Correct.

793
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,120
Room 3 can access Room 4.

794
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Room 4 can access Room 1.

795
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,880
Room 1 can't access Room 2.

796
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,840
Yes.

797
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,480
This door connects through.

798
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
There must be a reason.

799
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,000
She might have...

800
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,800
Not necessarily "died" here.

801
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,360
She might have met someone elsewhere

802
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,920
and then was brought here to be "killed."

803
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,400
Then the "killer"

804
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,680
must be among the four of us.

805
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,760
I think so.

806
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,760
It's definitely not me.

807
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,600
It must be among those three.

808
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,240
Why?

809
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,120
Would the "killer" likely say

810
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,000
"I'm the killer"?

811
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,760
"I'm the killer"—

812
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,960
They definitely wouldn't say that.

813
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,440
Besides,

814
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,560
the key point is I'm really not.

815
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,240
Where is everyone?

816
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,440
Coming.

817
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,080
Wait a moment.

818
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,040
Let's gather everyone first.

819
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,960
Zhou Keke.

820
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,800
This whole area is connected.

821
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,320
This...

822
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,520
Found a room.

823
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,640
Who's that?

824
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,240
I'm nearsighted.

825
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,080
Can't see clearly.

826
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,240
Can this be pushed open?

827
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,400
This probably can't be pushed.

828
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,600
Password

829
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,480
Is there a password?

830
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,280
There is a password

831
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,360
Think about all the details we just went through

832
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,200
Try to recall again

833
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,720
Zhen Zhen

834
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,000
Ultra-immersive

835
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,440
Is this related?

836
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:19,880
Zhenzhen

837
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,400
This is Zhenzhen Theater

838
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,720
Seven

839
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,160
No, 72 minus 68

840
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,400
That's 4, right?

841
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,520
Give me two more minutes

842
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,160
Minus two minutes

843
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,440
Equals zero

844
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,240
Could it be 402?

845
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,480
So clever

846
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,280
Could it be 4024?

847
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,240
4024

848
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,480
Try 4024

849
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,480
No

850
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,160
Not quite right

851
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,400
Average, not that smart

852
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,400
Wrong

853
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,600
But 40 makes sense, right?

854
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,160
But what about not drinking water for 24 hours?

855
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,080
How about 40240?

856
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,960
No bathroom breaks needed

857
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,360
Could there be a 5?

858
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,840
Which 5?

859
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,920
Spicy 5

860
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,000
How many digits does this password have?

861
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,880
No problem, let's try them all

862
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,080
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

863
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,680
Eight

864
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,760
Eight digits

865
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,800
An eight-digit password

866
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,400
Possibly

867
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,480
Still not correct

868
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,240
Wrong

869
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
No, then what should we do?

870
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,960
We can't be expected to count this on our fingers

871
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,880
Which day was it 789 days ago?

872
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,480
Could this possibly be related?

873
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,200
After a span of

874
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,080
It shouldn't be this complicated

875
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,800
Maybe it's possible

876
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,000
It's possible

877
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,080
365 times 2

878
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,200
730

879
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,560
Then subtract... what was it...

880
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,920
59

881
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,680
59 minus 30

882
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,400
29

883
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,280
29

884
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,440
This is way too complicated

885
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,960
Subtract 30 days from April

886
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,560
Leaving 29 days

887
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Subtract 29 days from March

888
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,360
So that would be March 2nd, right?

889
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,720
March 2nd

890
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,840
March has 31 days

891
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,440
March 2nd

892
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,200
20200302

893
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,280
That's the date of her last performance, right?

894
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:12,600
Thank you

895
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,440
I'll run one

896
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,360
Awesome

897
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,160
Jiajia and Screenwriter Song

898
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,520
Who is Jiajia?

899
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,360
Jiajia is my girlfriend

900
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,520
Jiajia is his girlfriend

901
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,000
Why is she with Screenwriter Song?

902
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Who is Screenwriter Song?

903
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,240
What is this?

904
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,640
Dating schedule

905
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,560
What does this mean?

906
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,360
Dating itinerary

907
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,040
Monday - meet mama's boy

908
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,720
Who is that?

909
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,080
Tongtong and Cao Yangguang

910
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,840
Who is Cao Yangguang?

911
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,520
No

912
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,520
How many names does she have?

913
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,360
She has many names

914
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,160
She has numerous names

915
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,880
She's called Tongtong with this boyfriend

916
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,560
This one calls her Maomao

917
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,440
This one calls her Xiaoxiao

918
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,280
Mao Xiaotong

919
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:10,680
No

920
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,440
Xiao Mao Tong

921
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,360
Mao Xiaotong

922
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,480
Tong Mao Xiao

923
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,160
Is Sanwan in there?

924
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,080
Yes, Sanwan

925
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,920
Bai Sanwan

926
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,000
Sporty rough guy

927
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,480
Zhenzhen

928
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,840
Is your ex-girlfriend Zhenzhen?

929
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,600
Yes, that's right

930
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,760
Difficulty level: one

931
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,520
You conquered difficulty level one

932
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,040
Jiajia

933
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,120
And me

934
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,760
Isn't this me?

935
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,280
Why does mine say "dumped - no contact"?

936
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,840
Why?

937
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,120
She even schedules meeting days?

938
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,200
So you're all dating the same person?

939
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,600
Never in my wildest dreams

940
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
I never expected this either

941
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,680
Why does Zhenzhen have so many boyfriends?

942
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,160
And what's more...

943
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,760
She assumes a different identity with each boyfriend

944
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,840
Multiple personalities

945
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,520
From this suit...

946
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,360
To this cape...

947
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,080
Formal gowns...

948
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,320
So many masks

949
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,480
And even casual homewear

950
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,080
She must have multiple personalities

951
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,280
Constantly playing

952
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,239
All sorts of roles

953
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,480
So many people already love her

954
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,800
Why does she still do this?

955
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,400
Maybe each person loves something different

956
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,280
Is she someone who can't control herself?

957
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
What do you love about her?

958
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,639
What do I love about her...

959
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,080
I love her wild, passionate intensity

960
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,239
I love how independent she is

961
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,440
Really?

962
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,520
This is the boyfriend ranking list

963
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,000
This one is first place

964
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,960
Second place is Guo Baoyou

965
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,080
Isn't this Bai Sanwan?

966
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,360
This probably means

967
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,080
it was easy to get him, right?

968
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,679
Why am I...

969
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,280
The highest ranked boyfriend is

970
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,639
Why am I one level lower?

971
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,040
Probably the one she thinks most highly of

972
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,199
Right, your ranking is quite high too

973
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,840
Because you're ranked second

974
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,360
Four stars

975
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,440
Other than this five-star, she gave four stars

976
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,480
I got one star

977
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,080
One-star rating

978
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,040
Zero difficulty to get

979
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,800
Yeah, really...

980
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,520
Kind of pathetic

981
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,120
I think the first person is crucial

982
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,160
He's wearing a crown

983
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,200
So among our four rooms

984
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,400
those two strangers we photographed

985
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,720
might be among her boyfriends

986
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,800
It might be one of those two

987
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,520
If you put it that way

988
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,120
Could be

989
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,560
Earlier in the other rooms

990
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,120
Room 1 was Bai Sanwan

991
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,240
Room 2 was me

992
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,120
Room 3 was unfamiliar

993
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,760
Then Room 3 must be Cao Yangguang

994
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,480
Cao Yangguang

995
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,120
And Room 4 was Screenwriter Song

996
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,160
Wait a second

997
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,760
Did you see her just now?

998
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Yes, I did

999
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,480
You saw her?

1000
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,240
Then she "died" afterward

1001
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,640
Right

1002
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,000
You mean...

1003
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,160
After she left you

1004
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,000
she "died"?

1005
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,840
I don't know about that

1006
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,360
I had an appointment with her in Room 2

1007
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,720
You can't enter Room 1 from Room 2, right?

1008
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,800
Correct

1009
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,200
We agreed to meet there at 1 o'clock

1010
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,720
I arrived a few minutes early

1011
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,480
at Room 2

1012
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,400
She also scheduled to meet me at 1

1013
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,600
But I couldn't find her when I arrived

1014
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,720
Your appointment was also at 1?

1015
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,840
Yes, she scheduled to meet me at 1

1016
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,400
Is there a computer here?

1017
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,960
And there's also a box.

1018
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,400
This is Zhenzhen's computer

1019
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,200
There's a computer password

1020
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,400
Right

1021
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,160
Then let's look for things related to Zhenzhen

1022
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,080
people or events

1023
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,240
Date itinerary

1024
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,600
This

1025
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,080
Wait a moment

1026
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,480
No

1027
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,600
Try this string of numbers

1028
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,160
53211004

1029
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,360
Incorrect password

1030
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,680
There's a hint on it

1031
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,280
A secret men must not know

1032
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,640
Let's take one more look, okay?

1033
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,280
Let's go.

1034
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,800
Performances suspended during holidays

1035
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,960
If you need to contact me

1036
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,720
please leave a message at Zhenzhen Theater

1037
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,680
Mailbox 801 on the first floor

1038
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,840
No phones or computers allowed in theater

1039
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
All phones must be stored here before entry

1040
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,200
Magnetic card

1041
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,000
If lost

1042
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,600
please contact Zhenzhen Theater

1043
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,960
No card

1044
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,600
Now

1045
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,040
I think

1046
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,560
we should first go to the first floor

1047
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,680
to check the mailbox

1048
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,000
I think

1049
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,560
You're back

1050
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,640
We're here to check the mailbox

1051
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,960
Which one was her mailbox again?

1052
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,000
801

1053
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,520
There's nothing here

1054
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,480
801

1055
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,320
So no one has sent her anything

1056
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,560
Let's check the office again

1057
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,920
There should be something there

1058
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,560
Office, changing room

1059
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,480
We were just in the office

1060
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,880
And found the computer and boxes

1061
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,920
Could it be stuck in

1062
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,560
Do you have any suspects now?

1063
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,840
Need my help?

1064
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,520
Like maybe looking for

1065
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,560
Contacting

1066
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,440
The suspects

1067
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,840
There's a mama's boy

1068
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,520
Named Cao Yangguang

1069
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,600
Cao Yangguang

1070
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,880
And a screenwriter Song

1071
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,920
Screenwriter Song

1072
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,360
Alright

1073
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,120
I'll go look for them

1074
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,320
See if I can reach them

1075
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,520
I'll summon them here first

1076
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,240
Okay

1077
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,440
Bring them here so I can "interrogate" them

1078
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,480
Get them all here

1079
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,360
Right, I'll check the visitor log

1080
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,960
Brother Teng, what's the situation up there?

1081
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,600
Is it chaotic?

1082
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,160
I know an earth-shattering secret

1083
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,160
What?

1084
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,880
Zhenzhen

1085
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,560
Multiple personalities

1086
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,880
Was simultaneously dating

1087
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,400
A wall full of boyfriends

1088
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,400
No wonder she made those scary

1089
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,000
Those shows and stuff

1090
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,840
So she really has multiple personalities

1091
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,120
Could her keys be in the clothes?

1092
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,240
She has a master locker card here.

1093
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:08,880
What is it?

1094
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,840
This card can open all lockers.

1095
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,440
The one on the first floor?

1096
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,360
Not the first floor.

1097
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,400
At the theater entrance.

1098
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,880
Found the card?

1099
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,160
Found it.

1100
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,760
We found a locker card.

1101
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,200
Let's check the entrance.

1102
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,480
Let's go check the lockers.

1103
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:21,920
Okay.

1104
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,120
Then let's open them one by one.

1105
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,400
It can open every one.

1106
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,200
No.

1107
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:29,920
Won't work.

1108
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,200
Still not right.

1109
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,880
But it didn't say...

1110
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,160
Can it open every one?

1111
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,360
This...

1112
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,960
Number four is a USB

1113
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,600
flash drive

1114
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,600
phone

1115
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,640
Found the phone

1116
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,160
What's on it?

1117
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,920
This is your phone

1118
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,520
This is your phone

1119
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,000
Come on, let's find a place to look

1120
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,560
Find a place to look

1121
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,240
Room one

1122
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,800
You want to see my phone?

1123
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,480
The whole world wants to see your phone

1124
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,160
Who doesn't like looking at phones?

1125
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,080
Here, take a look.

1126
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,440
After all, it's my phone.

1127
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,320
I'm a suspect.

1128
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,200
Are you being this cautious?

1129
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,000
He...

1130
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,440
Don't let him delete anything.

1131
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,360
Look what he's doing.

1132
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,560
Can I even delete anything?

1133
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,360
See? There's nothing.

1134
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,400
Nothing in recently deleted either.

1135
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,080
You're really...

1136
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,040
You're definitely suspicious.

1137
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,120
You're turning this around on me.

1138
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,560
Jiajia and I had such a good relationship.

1139
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,200
Did you just delete something?

1140
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,720
No, I didn't.

1141
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,120
First, I can prove my innocence.

1142
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,440
Zhenzhen told me...

1143
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,920
...to come find her at 1 o'clock.

1144
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,040
So I came.

1145
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,880
And then?

1146
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,640
She told me to meet her here.

1147
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,120
But no one was here.

1148
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,920
Then I went out to wait in the hallway.

1149
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,640
When I went out...

1150
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,120
...the hallway lights went out.

1151
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,600
After it went dark, you all arrived.

1152
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,880
Why didn't you answer your phone?

1153
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,360
This was my call to Zhenzhen.

1154
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,600
You called Zhenzhen?

1155
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,480
I saw no one was here...

1156
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,120
...so I went out to call her.

1157
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,720
She didn't answer.

1158
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,200
Wait a minute...

1159
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,200
What time did we discover the "body"?

1160
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,040
I noticed...

1161
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,000
...when the "blood" started flowing...

1162
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,080
I woke up around...

1163
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,760
1:55 to about 2 o'clock.

1164
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,080
1:55...

1165
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,320
...to 2 o'clock.

1166
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,560
Before 1:50, she was definitely here.

1167
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,960
She sent him a WeChat message at 12.

1168
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,960
At 12 o'clock...

1169
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,240
Zhenzhen was still alive.

1170
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,880
Before 1:50...

1171
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,000
She "died" sometime in between.

1172
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,720
There's still a USB drive we haven't checked

1173
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,680
I think this USB drive

1174
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,720
can be viewed with a phone

1175
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,560
Right?

1176
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,320
We can plug it into a phone

1177
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,000
and open that file

1178
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,320
This...

1179
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,280
Okay

1180
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,880
Let's see

1181
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,240
There is...

1182
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,480
a document

1183
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,960
Stalker Guo Baoyou

1184
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,160
Come here!

1185
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,200
I'm Xiaomian

1186
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,400
Officially reporting "scumbag" Guo Baoyou

1187
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,600
You're a scumbag

1188
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,440
Why does saying that feel so satisfying?

1189
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,760
He looks decent enough

1190
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,320
but his behavior is terrifying

1191
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,800
He actually followed me secretly

1192
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,200
He must have been attracted to my beauty

1193
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:46,600
Girls,

1194
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,920
having this face is such a burden

1195
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,120
So you're a stalker, right?

1196
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,480
Let's beat him up first

1197
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,440
Wait a minute

1198
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,680
I'm not a stalker

1199
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,320
This Xiaomian

1200
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,720
is a waitress at Bai Sanwan's place

1201
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,200
When I went to eat at Bai Sanwan's

1202
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,560
I met Xiaomian

1203
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,600
That day when I went for noodles

1204
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,320
it was very late

1205
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,760
She got off work very late

1206
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,720
Xiaomian said she was going home

1207
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,040
I said I was worried about her safety going alone

1208
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,320
I offered to walk her home

1209
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,240
She refused

1210
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,320
But I was still worried

1211
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,840
So I followed from far behind

1212
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,040
and only left after seeing her enter her home

1213
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,320
You can ask Xiaomian later

1214
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,960
if I did anything to her

1215
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,000
I did nothing

1216
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,360
What's your relationship with Xiaomian?

1217
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,440
I'm just her boss.

1218
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,760
Alright.

1219
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,720
About his...

1220
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,800
He's got plenty of these.

1221
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:30,920
April 30th.

1222
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,760
Today is May 6th.

1223
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,800
Guo Baoyou said,

1224
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,480
Do you know

1225
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,160
this would cause me "social death"?

1226
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,360
Anyone who's been to your place

1227
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,320
knows what a scumbag you are.

1228
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:41,640
Serves you right.

1229
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,400
You've hidden so many secrets at home.

1230
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,040
You need to explain why she'd say this about you.

1231
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,560
And what you said

1232
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,280
was particularly harsh.

1233
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:50,320
Just you wait.

1234
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,120
Just you wait.

1235
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,840
This is all a misunderstanding

1236
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,160
Look

1237
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,200
At 11 o'clock today

1238
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,760
you added this person

1239
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,360
This person is my relative

1240
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,480
Really?

1241
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,560
Hold on with the relative talk

1242
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,880
We'll come back to the relative later

1243
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,760
At 1:30 she sent you

1244
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,280
saying

1245
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,760
"At your service"

1246
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,040
Then at 1:40

1247
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,200
you scheduled a foot massage for 7pm

1248
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,440
Which means at 1:40

1249
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,440
you had time to message her

1250
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,760
Then you called Jiajia repeatedly

1251
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,360
What time were the calls?

1252
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,560
You kept calling Jiajia

1253
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,040
Kept calling

1254
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,120
Kept making calls

1255
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,960
From May 1st to May 5th

1256
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,880
And she never answered, right?

1257
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,400
Right

1258
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,600
First explain this

1259
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,280
You go first

1260
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:37,560
Yes

1261
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,600
I can't explain

1262
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,320
I'll explain when you see the evidence

1263
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,120
What's the big deal?

1264
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,000
She just did some things

1265
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,560
that gave me extreme social embarrassment

1266
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,480
I understand now

1267
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,800
First let's search their room

1268
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,440
Guo Baoyou jijiji

1269
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,560
608

1270
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,200
Go open the door

1271
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,840
Your room is quite nice

1272
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,480
A hard night's work

1273
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,160
A lifetime of happiness

1274
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,800
Top Ten Mystery Web Novel Critics of the Year

1275
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,400
See that?

1276
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,200
A hard night's work

1277
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:29,760
Happiness

1278
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,720
What is this thing

1279
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,760
Guo Baoyou, your room is so luxurious

1280
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,000
You're here

1281
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,040
You're really...

1282
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,600
You stalker

1283
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,600
It says here

1284
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,320
"Escort a thousand girls home"

1285
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,960
Why escort a thousand girls home?

1286
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,360
Taking her home is for her own good

1287
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,440
I'm worried about her safety

1288
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,840
You care about so many people

1289
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,480
Of course

1290
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,560
I'd take a thousand girls home

1291
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,240
Because I have no ulterior motive

1292
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,280
I just enjoy seeing girls home

1293
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,160
I genuinely

1294
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,280
Just want to see you safely inside

1295
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:25,840
Why do you

1296
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,400
You're not part of the security team

1297
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:29,680
Really

1298
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,800
Isn't this Xiaomian?

1299
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,960
Why does she look so much like Teng Zhongjie?

1300
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,440
She's my younger sister.

1301
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:44,840
Is it Zhenzhen?

1302
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,480
This is your sister?

1303
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,960
He's been stalking your sister, bro.

1304
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,480
Bro, look.

1305
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,200
Your sister is accusing him.

1306
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,200
He's been following your sister.

1307
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:55,840
No.

1308
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,040
I can explain.

1309
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,640
I can explain.

1310
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,160
I can explain.

1311
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,200
I can explain.

1312
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:03,600
No way.

1313
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,320
Your sister is accusing him.

1314
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,120
He's been stalking your sister.

1315
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,120
Okay

1316
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,280
You damn stalker

1317
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,680
I'm not a stalker

1318
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,920
This is Zhenzhen

1319
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,080
Why is there an X mark?

1320
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,800
Has she already...

1321
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,520
No, this means she's "dead"

1322
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,440
Already "eliminated"

1323
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,720
Why "send 1,000 girls home"?

1324
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,400
And then you drew this red...

1325
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,400
mark over Zhenzhen

1326
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,000
Is it because you've already...

1327
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,760
"Killed" her?

1328
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,040
No

1329
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,240
Then why the X mark?

1330
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,040
Because...

1331
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,880
I hate her

1332
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,560
She exposed me

1333
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,920
She gave me "social death"

1334
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,920
He has a computer here, right?

1335
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,560
Let's check it

1336
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,040
I can't bear to look at that computer

1337
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,040
There wouldn't be my sister's photos in there, would there?

1338
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,600
No

1339
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,320
What about videos?

1340
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:55,840
I'm not

1341
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,760
Has my sister ever sat on this bed?

1342
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,880
No.

1343
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,480
Do you like her?

1344
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,040
Did you genuinely have feelings for her?

1345
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:06,880
No, I...

1346
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,200
Yes, I admit...

1347
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,040
She is indeed my type.

1348
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,240
But I politely told her...

1349
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,400
I said I wanted to walk her home.

1350
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,240
She declined.

1351
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,640
But I still watched her from afar.

1352
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,560
I didn't disturb her.

1353
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,800
Don't be angry, Your Honor Bao.

1354
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,960
They don't understand the circumstances.

00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,840
"The Case of the Midnight Ghost Sound 'Murder'"

1357
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,760
Synopsis

1358
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,200
Ghostly sounds frequently echo on the uninhabited island

1359
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:33,880
One night

1360
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,920
An islander "dies" after hearing the strange sound

1361
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,520
Is it the ghost's revenge

1362
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,360
Or deliberate "murder"

1363
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,560
Can you deduce the truth?

1364
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,840
Please shout out your answer

1365
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,200
Someone on the island has severe rhinitis

1366
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:46,920
and snores loudly

1367
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,640
Waking the "deceased" at midnight

1368
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,000
Leading to

1369
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,400
The "deceased" rolling off the bed and "dying from the fall"

1370
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,640
In a medieval castle

1371
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,880
The duke mysteriously "dies"

1372
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,880
With strange bite marks at the corners of his mouth

1373
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,800
And "bloodstains"

1374
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,880
Is it a "bloodthirsty maniac"

1375
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,320
Or deliberate "murder"

1376
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,040
The duke accidentally drowns and "dies"

1377
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,000
The duchess has severe internal heat

1378
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,400
While performing CPR

1379
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:04,960
Her gums bleed

1380
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,080
Leaving these traces

1381
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,840
This is ridiculous

1382
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,120
Why is your novel so absurd?

Case Discussion

1384
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,680
On an uninhabited island

1385
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,720
Why would there be people

1386
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,120
When you criticize others' works

1387
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,200
Claiming you can write more hardcore stories

1388
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,920
You're just his anti-fan

1389
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,960
This is your standard?

1390
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,400
I think it's the most juvenile, brainless

1391
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,040
And most plot-hole-ridden story

1392
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,080
Only this person named Gu Lucky says

1393
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,840
"Am I the only one who finds this interesting?"

1394
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,000
"Go Youyou brother!"

1395
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,880
Pay attention to this person's face

1396
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,320
What's wrong?

1397
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,520
This resident is also downstairs

1398
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,960
Are these the current residents?

1399
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,120
Yes, these are our residents

1400
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,800
What's your relationship with Gu Lucky?

1401
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,040
I don't know her

1402
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,720
Guo Baoyou said,

1403
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,200
This isn't my true ability.

1404
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,680
Someone is deliberately sabotaging me.

1405
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,200
Trying to destroy my dreams.

1406
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,480
When I find that person,

1407
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,400
I'll definitely make them pay.

1408
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,440
I want to know,

1409
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,960
why do you think someone is targeting you?

1410
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,440
That's right

1411
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:02,800
Go on

1412
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,360
Tell me

1413
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,920
I was just about to say

1414
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:09,600
The thing is

1415
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,200
I admit

1416
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,240
I've been bragging all along

1417
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,480
I always claimed to be

1418
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,440
the king of mystery novels

1419
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,880
but in reality

1420
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,160
my writing is terrible

1421
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,880
I genuinely can't produce

1422
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,320
anything logical

1423
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,040
So actually I've always

1424
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,160
lacked confidence

1425
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,280
After I met Jiajia

1426
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,120
who also liked mystery novels

1427
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,400
she actually encouraged me a lot

1428
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,320
But suddenly one day

1429
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,360
she started calling me a "pervert"

1430
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,320
said I was a "scumbag"

1431
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,400
Out of nowhere

1432
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:39,840
Right

1433
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,880
Maybe she misunderstood

1434
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,600
She saw some things

1435
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,000
and thought I might be a "creep"

1436
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,560
a bad person

1437
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,240
But that wasn't true

1438
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,320
Then my account and password

1439
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,600
were actually shared with her

1440
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,160
She knew about them

1441
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,200
So she said "I'll make you socially dead"

1442
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,400
She posted all my previous

1443
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,720
messy writings

1444
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,080
online under my name

1445
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,720
Then I got attacked by anti-fans

1446
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,960
She had people cyberbully me

1447
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,280
So after she had others

1448
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:08,960
cyberbully me

1449
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,080
I crossed her out

1450
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,040
I think

1451
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,720
this girl

1452
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,960
no longer has a place in my heart

1453
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,920
So you really hate Jiajia

1454
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,800
Because she caused your "social death"

1455
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,320
You have every reason to "kill" her

1456
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,360
I do have a reason to "kill" her

1457
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,960
But I really didn't do it

1458
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,240
I thought about it

1459
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,840
Even if I wanted to

1460
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,800
I didn't go through with it

1461
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,960
How can you accuse me of "murder"?

1462
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:40,760
I think this is good enough

1463
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,320
Let's move on to the next one

1464
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,440
Is it Bai San Bao?

1465
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,600
Bai San Bao

1466
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,400
Bai San Bao

1467
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:45,840
Bai San Wan

1468
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,320
Bai San Bao

1469
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,040
Alright

1470
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,560
Are you all comfortable with the accommodation?

1471
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,360
Have you stayed there?

1472
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,280
Did we stay there?

1473
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,720
Busy to "death"—my legs are killing me

1474
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,680
Teacher Bai's room is so stylish

1475
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,560
Boss Bai

1476
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,480
You're a motorcycle racer

1477
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,040
That's right

1478
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,840
Used to be

1479
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,600
You have noodles here

1480
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,720
This is too good

1481
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,760
Hot

1482
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,200
Just made

1483
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:20,800
Freshly made

1484
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,400
Try some

1485
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,440
Try the noodles

1486
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,280
You can eat it

1487
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,840
I won't "die" in your room, will I?

1488
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,720
The noodles you made

1489
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,320
No, he made them

1490
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,280
He just made them

1491
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,040
Freshly prepared

1492
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,240
Right

1493
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,480
Who made them for?

1494
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,720
When were they made?

1495
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,120
I won't eat

1496
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:36,960
I'm sorry

1497
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,840
Why only make three bowls?

1498
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,120
Because my name is Bai Sanwan (Three Bowls Bai)

1499
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,320
So I have a rule

1500
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,040
Three bowls in the morning for departed friends

1501
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,000
Three bowls at noon for guests

1502
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,520
Three bowls in the evening for family

1503
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,080
I've heard this song

1504
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,760
"A toast to family"

1505
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,040
Yes

1506
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,560
"A toast to guests"

1507
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,520
How ridiculous

1508
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,160
Getting the computer open

1509
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,600
Yes, this is my computer

1510
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,760
Chat history

1511
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,840
I love reading chat histories

1512
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,280
My best friend said

1513
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,560
This is Zhenzhen

1514
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,880
Video

1515
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,280
Bai Sanwan, you're such a "scumbag"

1516
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,320
You're all "scumbags"

1517
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:25,760
You said we're breaking up

1518
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,640
But I never agreed

1519
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,320
Blocked me and disappeared

1520
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,360
You think that's the end?

1521
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,360
Let me tell you

1522
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,440
Even if you run to the ends of the earth

1523
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,240
I'll still find you

1524
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,000
So "trashy"

1525
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,320
Blocking people and disappearing

1526
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,240
You really are...

Chat history

1528
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,000
This girl is talking about you, right Bai Sanwan?

1529
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,800
You're something else

1530
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,800
Such a beautiful girl

1531
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,880
Was desperate over you

1532
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,240
Posted it online

1533
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,600
Now you're "socially dead" too

1534
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,800
He just replied "get lost"

1535
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,640
You had motive too

1536
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,240
When was this posted?

1537
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,560
February 14, 2020

1538
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,360
Two years ago

1539
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,000
So long ago

1540
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,360
Let's take another look

1541
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,000
Alright

1542
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,400
Photo

1543
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,040
Come on, bring it here so we can all see

1544
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,080
Let's look together

1545
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:18,680
What?

1546
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,400
There aren't any photos of my sister, right?

1547
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,160
The whole world loves your sister

1548
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,280
This photo

1549
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,200
Is basically from when Zhenzhen and I

1550
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,280
first met

1551
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,560
This is Zhenzhen

1552
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,720
Isn't this a gorilla?

1553
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,920
She's wearing a gorilla costume

1554
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,920
You scared me

1555
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,320
Why?

1556
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,040
Because I really like motorcycles

1557
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:42,960
Then one day on the road

1558
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,000
I saw a girl riding a bike

1559
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,640
She looked really interesting to me

1560
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,560
Cool

1561
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,840
So I followed her to the theater

1562
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,920
Never expected she was an actress

1563
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,640
And her performance required

1564
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,120
wearing this gorilla costume

1565
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,920
What we saw as kids

1566
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,760
In the steel cage

1567
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,880
A gorilla riding a motorcycle

1568
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,200
That was all Zhenzhen, right?

1569
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,240
Possibly

1570
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,000
Yes

1571
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,920
Always rushing between shows

1572
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,160
I thought this girl was very independent

1573
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,480
When she sets her mind on something

1574
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,000
she puts her all into doing it well

1575
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,680
That attracted me

1576
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,960
To get closer to her

1577
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,640
I started making her

1578
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,160
noodles every day

1579
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:19,760
and delivering them

1580
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,680
And occasionally watching her performances

1581
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,840
Then one day she came to

1582
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,880
a seat in our shop

1583
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,400
Right behind me

1584
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,320
She was on the phone

1585
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:29,600
crying

1586
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,400
Saying she got fired from the theater

1587
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,040
Because the theater hired a real gorilla

1588
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:38,800
they didn't need her anymore

1589
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,480
Then

1590
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,280
After eating so much noodles

1591
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,800
she probably couldn't fit into those costumes anymore

1592
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,040
Couldn't fit in them

1593
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,680
They didn't need her

1594
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,120
So she decided to rely on herself

1595
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,800
and planned to start a theater

1596
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,280
But she was short on money

1597
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,040
Then I heard about it

1598
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,160
Right then I decided

1599
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:57,840
to help her

1600
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,280
Help her

1601
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,320
I found ways to raise money

1602
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,400
And raised 500,000

1603
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,520
Then anonymously gave it to her

1604
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,240
No wonder she labeled you

1605
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,640
as "zero difficulty to handle"

1606
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,360
This is the eighth floor, right?

1607
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,440
Should be.

1608
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,240
Just drove up here.

1609
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,880
Later I decided I would confess my feelings to her.

1610
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,400
Then one day,

1611
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,400
I personally engraved

1612
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,040
her name on a bowl.

1613
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:23,760
Zhenzhen.

1614
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,200
Gave it to her.

1615
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,240
When she saw those two characters,

1616
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,880
turns out our feelings were mutual.

1617
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,360
She said she'd liked me for a long time too.

1618
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:32,720
Right.

1619
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,160
So we got together.

1620
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,840
On the last day three years ago,

1621
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,200
December 31, 2019.

1622
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:40,520
Yes.

1623
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,040
You two were together

1624
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,760
on February 14th,

1625
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,280
then she called you a "scumbag" online.

1626
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,240
Right.

1627
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,160
So what happened in those two months?

1628
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,720
Because I used to like her

1629
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,680
because she was independent enough

1630
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,680
self-sufficient enough

1631
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,640
After we got together

1632
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,560
she completely changed overnight

1633
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,960
She would always

1634
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,600
cling to you

1635
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,560
cling to me

1636
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,080
I felt like

1637
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,640
she had lost herself

1638
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,920
During that time I kept struggling

1639
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,920
with whether to break up with her

1640
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,960
I broke up with her

1641
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,040
for another reason too

1642
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:12,840
That's why I chose to break up

1643
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,400
But that reason

1644
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,600
I can't tell you right now

1645
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,080
Let's search again.

1646
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,120
Is there anything in the tent?

1647
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,000
Any pockets or compartments?

1648
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,640
Take a look.

1649
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,320
Bai Sanwan loves motorcycles the most.

1650
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,040
Let's search it.

1651
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,520
On this vehicle.

1652
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:34,880
There's a bag here.

1653
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,840
Here's a bag.

1654
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,240
There's a USB memory card here.

1655
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:42,920
Take a look.

1656
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,840
Our Teng Zhongjie is really impressive.

1657
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:45,960
Quick, plug it in.

1658
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,080
Let me see if my sister is in there.

1659
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,280
Your sister?

1660
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,080
How is your sister in the memory card?

1661
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,520
My sister usually tours nationwide.

1662
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,680
Nationwide tour.

1663
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,560
Traveling across the country.

1664

Bai Sanwan: The Athletic Brute Who Dumps Girls at Lightning Speed

1668
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,360
Turns out to be this kind of person

1669
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:09,920
Then the OP (Original Poster)

1670
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,720
I'm Zhenzhen, and Zhenzhen says:

1671
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,120
Do you know

1672
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,840
why everyone calls him Bai Sanwan (Three Bowls)?

1673
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,160
It's definitely not about handing cards after three bowls

1674
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,120
or giving cards after eating three bowls

1675
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,040
that simple

1676
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,960
Every morning he makes three bowls of noodles at home

1677
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:19,840
Once I ate one bowl

1678
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,800
After finishing it completely

1679
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,080
I actually discovered what he hid under the bowl -

1680
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,080
A shocking secret

1681
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,280
Through my investigation,

1682
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,880
I discovered he committed shameful acts.

1683
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,560
I've consulted experts,

1684
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,280
and if this gets exposed,

1685
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,720
it will absolutely ruin his reputation.

1686
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,760
He has two more secrets,

1687
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,960
which I'm still investigating.

1688
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,280
It's about these three bowls.

1689
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,120
At the bottom of these bowls,

1690
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,360
there must be something.

1691
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,080
Which one of you ate from them?

1692
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,520
Did you consume my sister's information?

1693
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,760
We probably need to finish eating to see it.

1694
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,000
No, we can see it now.

1695
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,280
Get something to catch it.

1696
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,840
I think we should keep it in the bowl.

1697
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,000
We'll continue eating later.

1698
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,080
First pour out the soup.

1699
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:52,600
Right.

1700
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,080
Now I'll "devour" it quickly.

1701
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:55,360
I think...

1702
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,280
"Devour"...

1703
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:56,920
"Devour" it all.

1704
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,120
Good brother, I've wronged you.

1705
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,240
I "killed" you.

1706
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,600
The one who "died" was my brother.

1707
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,400
Transfer that bowl's contents to this one.

1708
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,080
That makes sense.

1709
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,080
No wonder they call you Transfer Expert.

1710
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:09,640
So good at transferring.

1711
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,280
Transfer master.

1712
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,760
That man...

1713
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,960
I've wronged you.

1714
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,240
Why do you keep apologizing to men?

1715
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,680
Why do you keep betraying your brothers?

1716
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,360
People like you...

1717
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,040
Alright, give this to me.

1718
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,240
Let me "devour" it quickly.

1719
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:22,920
"Devour."

1720
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,320
Bro

1721
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,480
Let me help you, I'll take a bite

1722
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:32,840
That was so hard

1723
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,520
I'm about to succeed

1724
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,560
I, Zhou Keke

1725
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,120
That's amazing

1726
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,920
That girl, I'm sorry

1727
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,000
That girl, I'm sorry

1728
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,280
That boy, I'm sorry

1729
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:47,760
And then

1730
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,160
I'm sorry

1731
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,160
Brother, I "got you killed"

1732
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,360
Tell us about it

1733
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,040
How did it happen?

1734
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,480
Who are these three people?

1735
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,440
As I just mentioned

1736
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,960
I needed to find a way to help Zhenzhen

1737
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,840
Raise that 500,000 yuan

1738
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,440
Yes, 500,000

1739
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,800
Because I used to be a racer

1740
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,560
So I modified a motorcycle

1741
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,240
I wanted to use a fast vehicle

1742
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:08,960
To make deliveries

1743
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,000
To earn money quickly

1744
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,120
But then I reconsidered

1745
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,880
I realized it might be illegal

1746
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,920
No speeding

1747
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,080
No vehicle modifications

1748
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:17,920
Right, but my bike

1749
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,040
Was already modified

1750
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,440
So I stored it in the warehouse

1751
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,200
Then one day

1752
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,000
My buddy

1753
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,840
Named Baichimian

1754
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,320
Took the bike out

1755
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,840
To deliver food

1756
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,360
But it was too fast

1757
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,840
And caused an accident

1758
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,040
I feel it has a lot to do with me

1759
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,800
Because I was the one who modified this bike

1760
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,600
That's why I say

1761
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,600
My brother

1762
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,360
I've wronged you

1763
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:42,560
I think

1764
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,160
You've been waiting for him to ride this bike of yours

1765
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,120
You wanted something bad to happen to him

1766
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,000
I didn't want that

1767
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Because he's called "Free Noodles"

1768
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,840
Always eating noodles without paying

1769
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,280
Right

1770
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:51,720
Do you know why?

1771
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,720
He doesn't pay you for the noodles

1772
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,640
He doesn't have to pay

1773
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,160
Because the shop belongs to his family

1774
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,320
That's exactly why you wanted to "get rid of him"

1775
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,480
You wanted to take over their family's shop

1776
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,800
I'm an orphan

1777
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,080
I was adopted by his mother

1778
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,480
You're jealous of the love he receives

1779
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,600
It's connected to another case.

1780
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,280
This incident happened right at

1781
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,880
the moment I wanted to break up with Zhenzhen.

1782
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,760
I was emotionally disturbed at that time,

1783
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,320
so I broke up with Zhenzhen,

1784
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,720
then I disappeared.

1785
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,440
That's why she called me a "scumbag."

1786
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,920
Yes, and then that man

1787
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:24,480
I'm sorry to you

1788
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:24,960
Which man is it?

1789
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,440
Who is it?

1790
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,640
I don't want to talk about it.

1791
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,160
I don't want to discuss those matters.

1792
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:32,760
So other people...

1793
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,680
You're not telling us anything.

1794
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,120
It's unrelated to this matter.

1795
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,360
We respect your privacy.

1796
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,800
We've been quite disrespectful already.

1797
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,640
We started picking locks as soon as we entered.

1798
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,720
Some respect we showed.

1799
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,160
Then in the computer's USB drive...

1800
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:44,960
There was that...

1801
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,360
"Anti-Scum Men" alliance.

1802
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,120
I saw this in her room...

1803
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,200
by accident.

1804
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,800
I took a screenshot and sent it to myself.

1805
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,800
What's going on?

1806
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,280
Didn't I leave?

1807
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,440
Then...

1808
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,360
I came back.

1809
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,840
We ran into each other again.

1810
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,040
After this encounter...

1811
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,400
I realized she...

1812
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,560
Had returned to her old self...

1813
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,400
The version of her I liked.

1814
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,560
That's how she was acting.

1815
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,600
Then she wanted to reconcile.

1816
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,600
She keeps changing, right?

1817
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,880
Yes, and I got back with her.

1818
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:14,480
Then one day...

1819
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,600
When I went to the theater to see her...

1820
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,800
She happened to be performing.

1821
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,360
I saw her computer was on.

1822
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,160
It was open to the "Anti-Scum Men" page.

1823
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,160
I took a look.

1824
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,600
She was accusing me there...

1825
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,920
Calling me a "scum man."

1826
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,840
I suspect she's been deceiving me all along.

1827
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,120
The reason I came here...

1828
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,520
was to see clearly what kind of person she really is.

1829
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,320
To understand who she truly is.

1830
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,240
I thought she was a good person.

1831
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,200
She didn't want to say it to your face

1832
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,520
Calling you a "scumbag"

1833
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:49,880
Right

1834
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,200
She only secretly cursed you online behind your back

1835
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:51,840
She just

1836
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,600
She intentionally left her computer on

1837
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,920
Invited you to watch the performance

1838
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,720
And she told the whole world

1839
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,160
Everyone except you

1840
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,600
This is her performance

1841
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,480
This is the performance

1842
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,720
That makes some sense

1843
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,360
Actually you also had motive

1844
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,520
To want to "kill" her

1845
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,040
Fine, I'm a suspect

1846
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,920
You came out around 1:30

1847
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:15,840
from inside.

1848
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,160
I went there at 1.

1849
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:17,840
Wait a minute.

1850
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,120
Let's not focus on when he came out,

1851
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,640
but why,

1852
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,440
when you went upstairs,

1853
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,680
what were you doing there?

1854
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,400
I was waiting for her.

1855
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,640
Didn't she arrange to meet me?

1856
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,720
You were just fumbling in the dark,

1857
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,000
were you at the door?

1858
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:27,600
I arrived first.

1859
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,720
Went inside, no one was there.

1860
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,680
Then I didn't know what was going on,

1861
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,040
so I came out to make a call.

1862
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:31,560
Came out to get the phone.

1863
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,440
Because the phone was outside.

1864
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,400
Got the phone and called her.

1865
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,000
No answer.

1866
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,320
Then you guys showed up.

1867
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,040
Then we went inside,

1868
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,760
and found her "dead."

1869
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,000
Unless when he called,

1870
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,040
she was already "dead."

1871
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:41,720
Because she didn't answer.

1872
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,480
Plus,

1873
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,040
you were already dripping "blood" at that time.

1874
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,320
1:35.

1875
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,840
That's when I got the phone.

1876
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,320
I'm sure I saw her.

1877
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:48,960
Okay.

1878
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,720
So she was alive before 1:35.

1879
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,240
Right.

1880
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,640
"Died" after 1:35.

1881
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,920
Between 1:35 and 1:50?

1882
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,440
Yes, in that window.

1883
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,200
There's Zhenzhen's computer

1884
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,480
The password hint is

1885
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,560
"A secret men can't know"

1886
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,360
Anti-"Scumbag" Alliance

1887
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:20,680
Anti-"Scumbag"

1888
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,920
Anti-"Scumbag" Alliance

1889
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,280
Did you get in?

1890
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,200
I'm in.

1891
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,040
Is this a chat log?

1892
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,720
Tell Screenwriter Song

1893
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:30,800
I lost my phone

1894
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,000
This is my new number

1895
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,960
We talked for ten minutes

1896
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,000
Jiajia, you got a new number

1897
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,880
But don't forget

1898
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,440
our past promise

1899
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,600
Don't interact with other guys

1900
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,120
What's below this?

1901
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,360
"Charlotte's Troubles"

1902
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,200
"Charlotte's Troubles"

1903
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,120
"Annoying Charlotte"

1904
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,760
Can you please reject his confession?

1905
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,840
I'm afraid you'll get hurt

1906
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,720
Can you stay single forever?

1907
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:52,880
Forever yearning for freedom

1908
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,760
Is that okay?

1909
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,400
Understood

1910
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,760
I won't even promise you that

1911
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,840
Listen to it 999 times

1912
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,800
Pi played in reverse

1913
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,560
Can I take back what I just said?

1914
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,680
Charlotte

1915
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,200
I once used 98% of

1916
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,200
my strength to love you

1917
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,920
But now I'm tired

1918
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,600
I'm truly exhausted

1919
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,640
Maybe someday

1920
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,320
I'll accept another love

1921
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,360
But it won't be

1922
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,480
the same way I loved you

1923
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,080
Because you taught me

1924
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,040
love requires reservation

1925
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,640
But if you leave me now

1926
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,560
my life will only have

1927
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,200
scissors left in it

1928
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,200
Because you were my rock

1929
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,880
You must tremble

1930
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,360
You know what?

1931
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,160
Although in my social circle

1932
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,200
there are ten million people living in Iceland

1933
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,360
when Iceland's population is only 350,000

1934
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,360
You don't know

1935
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,440
You don't care

1936
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,880
You only care about yourself

1937
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,360
Why do I sound like a lunatic?

1938
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,080
My boxing cloth

1939
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:40,960
I didn't even know

1940
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:41,640
Our movie

1941
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,000
when did we film a Kunqu opera version?

1942
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,800
Ordinary people can't raise their voices that high

1943
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:48,880
Screenwriter

1944
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,240
Zheng Nengbian and Screenwriter Song

1945
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,000
Plagiarism

1946
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:52,840
Plagiarized

1947
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,160
And also

1948
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,160
Next page

1949
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,440
I went through great pains

1950
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,760
on a niche literature website

1951
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,120
to find evidence of your plagiarism

1952
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,400
Your talent is a fraud

1953
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,880
Your famous work "Charlotte the Annoying"

1954
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,200
contains twenty thousand words

1955
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,880
yet it shares nineteen thousand nine hundred ninety-seven words

1956
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:06,640
with the online work "Charlotte's Troubles"

1957
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,520
nineteen thousand nine hundred ninety-seven words

1958
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,680
Only three words in the entire text are different

1959
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,720
and those are your name

1960
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,960
Don't think just because only two people have viewed it

1961
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,560
that no one would discover your plagiarism secret

1962
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,400
You miscounted

1963
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,840
Including the title, it's four words

1964
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,600
Period

1965
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,280
She discovered Screenwriter Song's plagiarism

1966
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:19,640
Right

1967
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,400
If you still refuse to break up

1968
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,480
I'll post your plagiarism evidence

1969
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,280
online

1970
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,400
Jiajia, you've changed

1971
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,640
How dare you speak to me like this

1972
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,000
If you don't obey

1973
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,360
you'll be punished

1974
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,160
What was the date?

1975
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,400
May 3rd

1976
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,480
May 5th

1977
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,680
That was yesterday

1978
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,320
Yesterday or the day before

1979
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,080
There was a post

1980
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:41,760
Forum

1981
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,000
Online forum

1982
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,440
On there

1983
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,440
Forum: "Anti-Scum Men" Alliance

1984
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,000
"Scum men" crimes

1985
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,840
At first

1986
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,280
Gifts noodles to act like a "nice guy" (but actually scum)

1987
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,400
Breaks up unilaterally after getting what he wants

1988
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,120
Pretending to be caring

1989
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,360
Faking kindness

1990
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,440
"Scum men" should stop pretending

1991
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,640
Dumps you after getting what he wants

1992
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,000
Ghosts you and turns cold

1993
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,520
Better to punish them than suffer yourself

1994
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,640
If you've also encountered "scum men"

1995
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,360
I can help you get revenge

1996
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,440
Testing the law personally

1997
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,400
Top comment

1998
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,360
Unimportant brown sugar water

1999
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:06,880
Great

2000
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,360
The world has suffered from "scum men" for too long

2001
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,200
So that "boyfriend wall" of hers

2002
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,560
is basically exposing who's a "scumbag"

2003
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,120
When sisters report bad guys to her

2004
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,480
she helps them get revenge on those scumbags

2005
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,320
So I misunderstood Jiajia

2006
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,160
Jiajia's actually a good person, right?

2007
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,200
I thought she was

2008
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,480
dating multiple guys at once

2009
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,480
But she's actually righteous

2010
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,400
She saw Xiao Mian's situation

2011
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,960
then got close to you to help

2012
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:35,440
And then here

2013
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,200
"Campus Heartthrob" Cao Yangguang

2014
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,240
isn't sunny at all

2015
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,480
He's terrifyingly shady

2016
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,160
He seems to collect girls' belongings

2017
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,680
Hair clips, lipsticks, floral dresses...

2018
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,000
You don't think he...

2019
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,360
Sisters, we need to investigate

2020
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,560
This Cao Yangguang is dangerous

2021
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,000
I approached him under the alias Tongtong

2022
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,400
He actually stole from me at the theater

2023
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,040
Then Zhenzhen posted a

2024
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:52,880
video

2025
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:57,880
High heels

2026
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:00,640
"Whatever I want"

2027
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,320
"I'll eventually obtain"

2028
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Isn't he...

2029
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,240
When Zhenzhen was walking ahead

2030
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,800
he stole her shoe from behind

2031
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,360
How didn't Zhenzhen notice?

2032
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,880
No, after Zhenzhen discovered

2033
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,200
Who

2034
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:20,200
Who

2035
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,760
found out?

2036
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,479
Zhenzhen was secretly filming him

2037
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:24,439
Cao Yangguang

2038
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:25,200
It's definitely him

2039
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:30,439
The theater's backend system

2040
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,080
Here's an audience counter

2041
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,439
This camera

2042
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:39,000
records attendance for each performance

2043
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:39,520
Look at this

2044
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,279
Check the top one first

2045
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,640
This can be opened

2046
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,080
There's surveillance footage

2047
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:43,680
Here we go

2048
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,520
Footage incoming

2049
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:52,040
Bai Sanwan

2050
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,080
That's you

2051
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:53,560
Bai Sanwan

2052
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,279
You entered normally through Door 1

2053
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:55,920
Right?

2054
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,560
Yes

2055
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,840
Now let's check the second one

2056
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,240
Night vision

2057
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,439
The lights were already off at this point

2058
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,359
Look at number three

2059
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:04,920
Bai Sanwan came out

2060
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,040
You've seen her, you're lying

2061
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,560
I haven't seen her

2062
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,760
She entered when it was dark

2063
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:09,640
Then when you saw the lights were off

2064
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,319
You came out

2065
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:10,920
Exactly

2066
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,240
I really didn't see her

2067
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,120
If I'd seen her, I would have told you

2068
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:14,520
Let's check Room 2

2069
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,160
Check Room 2's surveillance

2070
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:21,080
Guo Baoyou

2071
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,200
You also entered when the lights were on

2072
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,479
Then the second one

2073
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:30,800
Went dark again

2074
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,920
Why did it go dark again?

2075
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:37,240
Then Zhenzhen left first

2076
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:37,960
The dark one came out

2077
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,399
Always entering and exiting in darkness

2078
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:40,920
Clothes

2079
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,000
They changed clothes

2080
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,120
What about you? You didn't come out

2081
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:47,680
I'm still inside

2082
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,600
She came out first

2083
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,320
Then you came out

2084
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,640
Then there's nothing wrong with you

2085
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,600
For now at least

2086
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,960
Look at Room 4's door

2087
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,040
Look at (Song) the screenwriter's

2088
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,360
Screenwriter Song

2089
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:07,720
Here comes Zhen Zhen again.

2090
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,480
Zhenzhen is here again

2091
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,120
What clothes is she wearing?

2092
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:10,760
A suit

2093
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:11,200
Changed into

2094
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,280
new clothes

2095
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,320
looking sharp

2096
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,080
She came out first

2097
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,120
Zhenzhen's suit came out first

2098
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,240
Okay, let's check Room 3

2099
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,480
Cao Yangguang

2100
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,520
The lights went out again

2101
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,520
Why is Zhenzhen going into every room?

2102
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,120
Colorful clothes

2103
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,960
What does that prove?

2104
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,400
She's been using different aliases

2105
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:40,960
Right

2106
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,520
To deceive different people

2107
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:45,920
Then Zhenzhen came out

2108
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,480
Wearing colorful clothes, completely colorful

2109
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,240
Xiao Cao, Cao Yangguang

2110
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,120
How many people did she meet today?

2111
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,000
She must have met everyone

2112
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:57,920
Except she didn't meet me

2113
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,920
I didn't see her

2114
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:03,960
Who is this?

2115
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,720
Someone's trying to go in

2116
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,640
Who is this?

2117
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,320
Me

2118
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,000
Teng Zhongjie

2119
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,760
And clearly looks frightened

2120
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,960
The secret is out.

2121
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,280
Can it still be called a secret?

2122
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,520
I don't know Zhenzhen.

2123
01:11:59,240 --> 01:11:59,840
Zhenzhen.

2124
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,880
Who is Zhenzhen?

2125
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,280
She's one of my many admirers.

2126
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,760
The reason I came here...

2127
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,200
was to see clearly...

2128
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,520
what kind of person...

2129
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,440
she really is.

2130
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,600
Why did the "blood" he found in Room 3...

2131
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,120
appear in Room 1?

2132
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,960
Time to witness the miracle.

2133
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,240
There's something here.

2134
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,120
This is so cool.

2135
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,240
Secret passage.

2136
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,240
Hidden compartment.

2137
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,520
Also studied some mechanics.

2138
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,160
You...

2139
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:25,640
Do you know me?

2140
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,200
Why are you impersonating my sister?

2141
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,840
You're following me? You actually...

2142
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:29,360
At this moment...

2143
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,080
You're the only one present.

2144
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,240
All the evidence points to him.

2145
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:32,480
Right.

2146
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,000
You know the last person I'd suspect...

2147
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:34,520
is you.

2148
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,160
This matter...

2149
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,680
You'd better not interfere.

2150
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,720
Don't rush.

2151
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,400
She didn't "die"

2152
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,080
I don't want to investigate this case anymore

2153
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,240
Mom, I want to go home
