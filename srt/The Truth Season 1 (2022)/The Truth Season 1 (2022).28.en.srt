1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,200
"Meet You Project"

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,680
Initiated by Yura Doll

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,440
These six people in the "Meet You Project"

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,440
are here to help us

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,320
Today is the day

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,400
to start over

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,680
April 1st is the reset time

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,080
They altered our paths

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,080
All the things that were supposed to happen

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,680
How can we prove it's real?

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,640
Right now there's a specific point in time

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,000
April 1st, 2025

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,400
Why start over from this day?

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,160
We need to reset

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,680
We still have a computer we haven't opened

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,480
There's still the computer

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,280
We forgot about this

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,760
What's written on this computer?

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,080
Password

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,840
No password

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,960
"Meet You"?

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,000
"Meet You"

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
No

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,640
Song Piaoliang

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,760
Song Piaoliang, yes

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,120
Song Piaoliang, the two of them

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,440
What was the date you two started dating?

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,440
20241030

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,480
Still not right

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,600
20241230

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,360
1230

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,600
1230 is correct

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,400
Here we go

34
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,080
What day was that?

35
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,000
The day he "died"

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,840
Look at this

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,440
How much he loves you

38
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,360
He really loves you

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,200
Too bad we couldn't tell when we saw him

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,080
He did all this for you

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,920
Maybe you should marry him

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,040
Let's get married

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,960
What

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,400
No, not the day I "died"

45
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
How awful

46
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,640
What is this

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,720
The day to change the tragedy, right?

48
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,480
July 8th

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,920
Indeed

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,000
It's a video

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,320
I came as a doll

52
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,880
One week ago

53
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,360
You asked me many things

54
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,400
About the future

55
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,360
I hesitated for a long time

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,520
But decided to record this video

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,960
To tell you at the right opportunity

58
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,120
I truly come from

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,400
The year 2025 before the reset

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,120
I really was Song Piaoliang's boyfriend

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,920
That year

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
I met Song Piaoliang who was recovering from heartbreak

63
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,400
She was determined to use marriage

64
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,960
To secure emotional safety in love

65
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,520
I thought when two people just met

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,160
We shouldn't rush things

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,800
But I never expected

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,840
That saying "no rush"

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,160
Would become the last straw for her

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,320
She jumped from the 9th floor

71
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,480
Of Apartment 11 to "commit suicide"

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,160
Afterwards I drowned in regret

73
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,120
Unable to free myself

74
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,800
Perhaps because of my countless prayers

75
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,800
I truly obtained a chance for redemption

76
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400
January 2025

77
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
I actually received a

78
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,880
Paper describing how to "time travel"

79
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,440
Who would give it to him?

80
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,720
April 1st, 2025

81
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,680
Apartment 11

82
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,120
Will experience strong magnetic interference

83
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,120
Time and space will warp

84
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,160
At this moment

85
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,680
I just need to wait on the third floor platform

86
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,840
To see the time portal

87
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,840
If I enter the portal

88
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,000
I can "travel" back to

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,160
April 1st, 2022

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,000
There's now a specific time point

91
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,320
April 1st, 2025

92
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,440
Why start over from this day?

93
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,600
9th floor of Apartment 11

94
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
is an ominous place

95
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,760
From 2022

96
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,880
to 2025, during these three years

97
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,360
starting with Ba Mei

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,920
Bai Sanwan

99
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,160
Liu Xialai

100
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,400
Zhou Keke

101
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,440
Guo Baoyou

102
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,920
Ke Wuku

103
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,280
and Song Piaoliang

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,800
a total of seven people

105
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,600
jumped to their deaths one after another

106
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,760
During the investigation process,

107
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,040
I joined together with Jiajia,

108
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,960
Fang Xiaomei,

109
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,880
Ju Yangsheng,

110
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,720
Boss Fei,

111
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,040
Uncle Li,

112
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,080
to voluntarily form a mutual aid group of friends and family.

113
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,040
So I decided

114
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,480
to share the secret of time reset

115
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,160
with everyone,

116
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,680
giving those of us who've lost our most important people

117
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,120
one chance at salvation.

118
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,040
Beautiful.

119
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,240
Do you know why we call it

120
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,040
the "Meet You Again Project"?

121
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,720
Because after losing you,

122
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,880
I missed you so much.

123
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,720
Every day I reminisced

124
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,320
about our time together.

125
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,920
You loved drinking that premium fresh milk

126
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,760
Real Fruit Grapefruit Four Seasons Tea.

127
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,000
Every moment

128
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,120
we spent making that special grapefruit tea

129
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,960
every memory

130
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,480
was a testament to our love.

131
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,680
After you left,

132
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,560
when I missed you,

133
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,320
I would drink a bottle.

134
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,840
So I named this chance to see you again

135
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,520
the "Meet You Again Project",

136
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,560
using "when tea meets fruit, I meet you" as our code.

137
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,920
Hoping everything could restart,

138
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,600
to change the tragedy.

139
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,440
I toast to him.

140
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
Thank you.

141
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,160
You've worked hard.

142
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,440
Everything is going according to plan.

143
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,720
Your lives have been rewritten.

144
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,800
There's no reason for you to be on the ninth floor again.

145
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,960
But last week,

146
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,240
you told me

147
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,880
Piaoliang and your memories became confused.

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,800
Right.

149
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
Those whose memories you altered,

150
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,120
or whose lives you changed,

151
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,680
their memories will have discrepancies.

152
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,600
But why is it that I

153
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,840
can clearly picture

154
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,080
Zhang Doll's face in my mind?

155
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,920
Zhang Doll's face.

156
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,280
Yes.

157
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,320
You can see

158
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,640
things that happened in the previous timeline.

159
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,120
We found this is due to magnetic field disturbances.

160
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,880
Anyone who's been to the "Question Mark Sculpture"

161
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,440
will remember some

162
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,840
things they've experienced before.

163
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,280
We climbed up that

164
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,160
that staircase.

165
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,440
The "Question Mark Sculpture," right?

166
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,640
Because this place

167
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,160
is one of our internet-famous check-in spots.

168
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,960
I think everyone should come here.

169
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,480
That spot where they stand to take photos.

170
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,120
Right.

171
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,840
Didn't you pester us to go

172
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,080
clean up there?

173
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,760
Yes.

174
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,680
I sent you a message,

175
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,320
saying, "Help my brother clean up."

176
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,560
That day we went to the platform.

177
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,200
I remember now, yes.

178
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,320
On your first day moving in,

179
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,040
you did go there.

180
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,120
The woman in red you saw "jumping to her death,"

181
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,000
that woman in red,

182
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,720
was the first person to "jump to her death"

183
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,880
in the previous timeline.

184
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,200
That was Bamei.

185
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,120
But it's okay,

186
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,400
I'll stop all of this.

187
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,080
What we saw this morning was

188
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,160
images from disordered memories

189
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,040
Memories... they must be memories

190
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,920
That's why only we saw them

191
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,560
Others couldn't see

192
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:27,880
Right

193
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,920
There's no one there

194
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,760
We're not staying here anymore

195
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,280
Your "haunted house"

196
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,320
No, why didn't I see it?

197
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,680
Wait, you guys didn't see

198
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,920
someone falling down?

199
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,960
Did someone fall down?

200
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,400
Yes

201
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:37,800
Yes

202
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,240
We didn't see anything

203
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,680
Xiao He

204
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,360
What happened?

205
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,120
You're pretending not to see again

206
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,960
So that means no one "died" today

207
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,840
Now the question is who gave the doll

208
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,560
a letter that "travels" through time and space

209
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,760
And we still have one question

210
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,320
that remains unanswered

211
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,880
That is why

212
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,800
we all chose to jump here

213
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,120
Why did we all come here

214
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,760
Who guided us to this place

215
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,760
Then the similarity between Bamui and us

216
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,360
They're here.

217
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,760
Wait, how did you get in?

218
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,960
Are you going to do this to me too?

219
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,600
Why does everyone always appear suddenly...

220
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,520
Right in front of my face?

221
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,160
A-Lai.

222
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,880
How did you get in?

223
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
You'll see...

224
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,720
Everything leaves traces.

225
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,880
Look at this path...

226
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,080
All these...

227
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,400
Passcodes you've cracked.

228
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,760
Impressive, right?

229
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,360
You've seen the video too.

230
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,560
Yes.

231
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,680
How did you obtain...

232
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,200
the method of...

233
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,160
"time travel"?

234
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,120
Who gave it to you?

235
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,080
I just found it.

236
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,000
On the third-floor platform.

237
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There was a piece of paper...

238
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,240
I picked it up then.

239
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,040
Found it.

240
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,440
So in 2025...

241
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,400
you were on the third-floor platform...

242
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,760
and found this paper?

243
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,120
Right.

244
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,400
Then at that spot...

245
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,160
while waiting for the magnetic field...

246
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,200
you actually saw a time tunnel?

247
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,640
Yes.

248
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,760
Then you entered the tunnel...

249
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,800
and "traveled" back to 2022?

250
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,280
Correct.

251
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,640
And the paper said...

252
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,080
"This is your only chance."

253
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,800
No limit on participants either.

254
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,480
Good question

255
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,600
There was no limit on the number of people

256
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,240
So I came back

257
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,720
Reset the timeline

258
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,120
I lost the note

259
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
During the "time travel"

260
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,880
It got blown away by the wind

261
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,400
After the timeline reset

262
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,679
Some people gradually

263
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,640
Started experiencing memory confusion

264
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,760
While others

265
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,039
Remembered things from the previous timeline

266
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,000
Thought their loved ones had disappeared

267
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
When in reality they just hadn't

268
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,760
Met their loved ones yet

269
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,560
I was afraid people would seek the truth

270
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,520
And discover the secret of the timeline reset

271
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,480
So I used the arcade owner

272
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,200
To spread some mysterious rumors

273
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,360
About the doll museum

274
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,040
To mislead people

275
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,920
The legend says

276
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,560
That in this doll museum

277
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,640
Some people entered but never came out

278
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
I didn't want people focusing on

279
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,920
The magnetic field and spacetime aspects

280
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,800
I also put up "dilapidated building"

281
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,280
"No climbing" signs

282
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,280
At that "Question Mark Sculpture" spot

283
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,040
We specifically didn't want anyone to approach it

284
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Going near there would trigger

285
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,360
more memory confusion

286
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,200
But I never expected

287
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,040
that Xiao He would take you there

288
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,240
to check it out on your very first day

289
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,280
Everyone, come down quickly

290
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
It's deteriorated over time

291
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,960
Sorry about that

292
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,400
Don't

293
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,520
But time reset

294
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,680
There was only that one chance

295
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,560
And then...

296
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,400
none of us got another chance

297
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,280
to "time travel" again

298
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,080
So you stayed in this year with us?

299
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,960
How come you never met

300
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,400
the version of you from this era?

301
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Right

302
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,280
Isn't the rule of time travel that

303
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,000
you can't interact with your past self

304
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,440
or something like that?

305
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:39,800
Yes

306
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,280
Right?

307
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,040
Correct

308
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,880
Have you encountered

309
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,560
the 2022 version of Lai Wan'ou?

310
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:43,920
Yes

311
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,320
After the time reset,

312
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,760
I retained memories from before,

313
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,520
but I'm still me.

314
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,880
Meaning there's still only one person.

315
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,760
Yes, only one person.

316
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,320
Who taught you how to make "No-Cry Gas"?

317
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,680
It was the previous shop owner.

318
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,280
They were the ones selling it.

319
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,080
Who was the previous owner?

320
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,040
Who was the former owner?

321
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,720
I don't know who it was.

322
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,600
Because we only communicated online.

323
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,320
Did you take over this shop?

324
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,760
Yes.

325
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,000
I purchased this shop.

326
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,680
It was to treat Song Piaoliang.

327
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,440
Because she was becoming increasingly anxious.

328
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,080
And this is for hypnosis therapy.

329
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,560
So you did all this just for her?

330
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,480
Yes.

331
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,800
The person who developed this drug...

332
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,640
was definitely not him.

333
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,920
I've also locked away all these "No-Cry Gas"...

334
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,000
and secured them.

335
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,880
I haven't let the current employee...

336
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,760
sell these items.

337
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,560
In which month did you take over?

338
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,000
June 1st, Children's Day

339
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,640
June 1st

340
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,400
After he took over, it disappeared

341
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,720
Did you design this shop's logo?

342
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,640
Or was it already there before?

343
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,560
The moon one

344
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,080
I never made any adjustments

345
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
When we first came to the apartment

346
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,040
we noticed those words on the TV

347
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,600
What?

348
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,800
Was it you who reminded us?

349
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,600
I don't know about those

350
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,040
No

351
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,960
Must

352
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,760
suspect

353
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,440
doubt

354
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
You

355
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,200
see

356
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
what

357
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,120
you

358
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,000
is the key

359
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,760
That person should be the boss

360
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,720
There's another person who knows about our memory confusion

361
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,880
So there should be another "time-traveler"

362
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,080
Didn't you say before

363
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,600
you saw a girl in red jump off a building?

364
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,640
Yes, Bamui

365
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,280
The girl jumped

366
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,240
Actually, she was the first

367
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,000
among your

368
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,560
group of seven

369
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:46,920
The first one

370
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,160
to jump off a building

371
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,480
And I remember she's supposed to jump tomorrow

372
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,280
She'll jump tomorrow

373
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,560
Right

374
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,600
But I knew nothing

375
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,640
about her identity

376
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
However, I found her public account

377
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,760
and through it

378
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,040
I contacted her

379
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,960
Then tricked her into coming

380
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,760
and tied her up in

381
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,520
the intensive treatment room

382
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,480
Don't think I can't find you just because the lights are off.

383
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Where is she?

384
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:13,800
Don't scream.

385
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,560
Help!

386
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,440
Quick, cuff her.

387
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,280
Xiao Bamei.

388
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,840
Unlock.

389
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,880
Coming to rescue you right away.

390
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,960
I have no idea what you're talking about.

391
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,320
I have more important matters now.

392
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,560
I really have to go, it's urgent.

393
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,880
We've already let her go.

394
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,640
Yes, sorry about that.

395
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,240
Wait, what?

396
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,960
No.

397
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,840
You let her go?

398
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,680
Yes.

399
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,200
She's out now.

400
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,480
She might "die" tomorrow.

401
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,240
We've actually made things worse.

402
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,160
Then it's over, she'll jump tomorrow.

403
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,760
We're going to the 9th floor now.

404
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,000
We'll guard the rooftop now.

405
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,080
Hurry.

406
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,840
To the 9th floor.

407
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,040
Wait a minute.

408
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,680
What's wrong?

409
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,080
The elevator only goes to the 8th floor.

410
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,600
Then we need to take the stairs to the 9th.

411
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,000
Quick, call the building manager.

412
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,800
To go with you.

413
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,680
Aren't you coming with us?

414
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,800
Right, I can't go.

415
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,280
Because I saw...

416
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,640
Song Piaoliang jumping off the building.

417
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,800
I'm afraid of heights, it traumatized me.

418
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,560
He's afraid of heights.

419
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,680
Yet he'd rather let his girlfriend...

420
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,560
Go to the 9th floor again.

421
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,800
He'd rather have you jump again.

422
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,160
Hoho, we want to go to the ninth floor.

423
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,080
Do you know how to take us there?

424
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,120
Ninth floor.

425
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,880
The ninth floor has been abandoned for a long time.

426
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,360
Even the elevator there doesn't work.

427
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,280
I'll take you up the stairs.

428
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,840
Wait for me at the eighth-floor elevator lobby.

429
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,520
Go to the 9th floor

430
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,760
This is the 9th floor

431
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,360
This floor has been abandoned for a long time

432
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,000
What's that placed in front?

433
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,520
Is that a memorial tablet?

434
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm a little scared

435
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,800
Why is there a memorial tablet?

436
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,680
Whose is it?

437
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,320
Probably someone called Mr. Nan

438
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,680
What does the card say?

439
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,000
Let me see

440
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,760
"In memory of the 15th anniversary of Painter Nan's passing"

441
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,840
It's a 15th anniversary memorial

442
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,280
"May you in heaven"

443
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,040
"always have the finest brushes"

444
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,000
Fifteen years ago...

445
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,240
Does this have any connection to us?

446
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,160
Probably not

447
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,720
It's like the legend of Ma Liang's magic brush

448
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,680
Maybe this time-space vortex was painted by him

449
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,280
Possibly

450
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,840
This was probably the painter's studio

451
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,400
Right?

452
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
Why did you come to the 9th floor?

453
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,080
Are you also here to pay respects to Painter Nan?

454
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,680
No

455
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,880
Here's the thing

456
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
The six of us are from the future

457
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,840
So today we're

458
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,280
bringing some information from the future

459
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,000
to prevent certain events

460
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,920
Don't worry about it

461
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,680
Can you share some future information

462
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,200
with me?

463
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,560
Sure, I'll tell you

464
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,960
The next lottery numbers are

465
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,880
Great

466
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,560
Thanks, bro

467
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,000
Go buy it

468
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,600
What exactly are you doing on the 9th floor?

469
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,320
We're looking for Bamei

470
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,760
We're searching for Bamei

471
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,880
Have you seen Bamei?

472
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't know any Bamei

473
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,800
If you want to check the 9th floor,

474
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,280
there are actually surveillance cameras here at all times.

475
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,680
Are you investigating something?

476
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,080
Okay.

477
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,000
Yes, where can we view it?

478
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,640
Sure, you want to check the surveillance footage, right?

479
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,280
Alright, let me get my colleague.

480
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,480
Because our property management

481
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,840
just got a new staff member named Xiao Wen.

482
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,000
He's specifically in charge of

483
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,280
the entire building's surveillance system.

484
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,960
Let me ask him.

485
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,800
He just arrived.

486
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,440
Xiao Wen.

487
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,560
This is Xiao He.

488
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,560
We'd like to check the 9th floor surveillance footage.

489
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Alright.

490
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,920
I took a look

491
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,160
This surveillance footage only shows

492
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,720
what happened after midnight

493
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,520
That's all there is

494
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,880
The only notable time was around 5 PM

495
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,280
when a man was carrying a bouquet of flowers

496
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,640
with a card attached

497
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,560
But after he passed by

498
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,800
he came out shortly after

499
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,400
When he exited

500
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
he wasn't carrying anything anymore

501
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,520
Over the past few days

502
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,920
many people have been carrying flowers

503
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,760
passing through here

504
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,240
which means he's quite popular

505
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,000
Any distinctive features about that man?

506
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,200
The one you saw today

507
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,760
Is that right?

508
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,320
Yes

509
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,680
About that man you saw today

510
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,840
any distinguishing characteristics?

511
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,640
Couldn't see his face clearly

512
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,240
Okay, I know you couldn't see his face

513
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,880
How tall was he?

514
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,120
Was he fat or thin?

515
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,400
Long or short hair?

516
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,080
What clothes?

517
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,720
What was he wearing?

518
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,360
How was he dressed?

519
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,720
Dressed

520
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,600
Dressed

521
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,160
Those last two words ruined it

522
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,840
Accurate judgment

523
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,080
Just an ordinary man

524
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,520
Okay

525
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,440
An average confident guy, right?

526
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,640
Isn't that so?

527
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,320
Understood

528
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,880
Got it

529
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,840
Hanging up

530
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,480
Wait

531
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,000
Wait a minute

532
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,320
What does this man have to do

533
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,319
with what we're investigating?

534
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,079
Is there any connection?

535
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,359
We should still go find

536
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:06,960
Xiao Ba

537
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,480
Xiao Ba

538
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,280
Ba Mei

539
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
It's very late now.

540
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,440
The hallway is quite chilly too.

541
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,440
You wait here.

542
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,040
Who knows how long we'll have to wait.

543
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,920
How about we go to the property management's monitoring room?

544
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,119
With so many pairs of eyes watching at the same time,

545
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,560
we probably won't miss anything, right?

546
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,040
So we're going to the property monitoring room first, right?

547
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,000
Alright.

548
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,080
It sounds like a fire alarm

549
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,120
The kid has grown up

550
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,480
and has already started learning to scare people

551
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,760
Stare, go up and stare

552
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,120
No, mainly look at the one above

553
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
This one

554
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,360
The one passing by here

555
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,720
This surveillance camera can see

556
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,240
everyone passing by the 9th floor

557
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,520
Let me make a prediction for you

558
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,440
Bamei will pass by here soon

559
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,240
and then jump off the building

560
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,560
Right, we'll just watch from here

561
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,240
Yeah

562
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,640
We'll livestream her jump from multiple angles

563
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,320
Right

564
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
If she does come by

565
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,040
you'll go save her

566
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,920
Yeah

567
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,000
You'll catch her at the third-floor platform

568
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:51,800
Right

569
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,960
Why isn't anyone here yet?

570
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,760
But come to think of it

571
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,080
Bamei seemed quite optimistic

572
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,560
True

573
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,360
A bit eccentric though

574
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,000
She doesn't seem like someone who'd jump

575
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,960
Indeed

576
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,280
Maybe she became optimistic

577
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,960
after meeting us

578
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,000
Back when we first

579
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,920
first met

580
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,520
Maybe we knew each other in a past life

581
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,160
Past life

582
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,680
That's good, good term

583
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,840
I suggest we don't use "timeline"

584
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,720
such a convoluted term

585
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,880
Let's just say "past life", okay?

586
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,080
Yeah, fine

587
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,040
Why is no one here yet?

588
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,000
They waited the first half of the night

589
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,080
We're waiting the second half

590
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,920
No, we can't fall asleep

591
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,480
If we doze off

592
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,800
we might miss crucial clues

593
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,360
Right

594
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,280
Hello everyone

595
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,600
Hello everyone

596
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,320
You've worked hard

597
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,960
I brought you some late-night snacks

598
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,000
Thank you

599
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,760
Have you seen anything?

600
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,360
Nephew

601
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,960
Can you make anything out from this?

602
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,960
Who is this?

603
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,440
Is that Xiao He?

604
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
This is Xiao He.

605
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,240
Xiao He, that's Xiao He

606
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,360
He's reading a book

607
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,880
He's reading a law book

608
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,640
It was yesterday

609
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,840
When the sun comes up, I climb the hill

610
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,760
Here we go again

611
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,400
What's wrong?

612
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:32,760
It's gone again

613
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,680
Look, the "corpse" is gone again

614
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,040
You're pretending not to see it again

615
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,400
See what?

616
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,280
But he said

617
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,640
He didn't see anyone fall

618
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,960
See what?

619
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,040
This time Xiao He saw it

620
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,240
Xiao He

621
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,400
Did someone fall near you?

622
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,240
That's right.

623
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,160
Something suddenly fell down.

624
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,840
Right next to me.

625
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,920
It was a person.

626
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,440
How could he see it again?

627
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,920
We didn't see her walk past either.

628
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,760
Right.

629
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,920
We didn't see her walk past.

630
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,680
We clearly saw

631
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,160
no one passed by the 9th floor

632
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,280
Right, no one passed by

633
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,720
Our security room's surveillance

634
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,640
definitely has no issues

635
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,720
Therefore this suicide jump

636
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,600
is definitely not that simple

637
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,720
I want to investigate this with you to get to the truth

638
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,640
to prove our surveillance

639
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,040
is working properly and has no problems

640
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,600
Let's go take a look

641
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,040
Let's go

642
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,200
You're finally here

643
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,480
There really is a "corpse"

644
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,440
What are you doing?

645
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,720
Someone really fell down

646
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,840
I finally saw it

647
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,720
Now I'm just like you

648
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,000
I doubted you before

649
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,640
I'm sorry

650
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,400
Bamei "died"

651
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,720
Actually, she was the first

652
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,640
among the seven of you

653
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,880
to jump off the building

654
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,600
Any wounds?

655
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,240
None, right?

656
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,600
Just the head—it's bleeding

657
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,720
From the fall

658
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,280
There's a tear on her clothes

659
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,800
Was it ripped by someone?

660
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,040
Or maybe cut with a knife?

661
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
This looks like a knife cut

662
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,360
Or maybe it got snagged on something

663
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,560
Wait—there's something on the clothes

664
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:09,960
Hold on

665
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,040
Key

666
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,120
Take off your shoes and let me check

667
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,440
There's always something on your shoes

668
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,760
Is there something on her chest?

669
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,240
What is this?

670
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,280
Is something tied there?

671
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,880
What is this thing?

672
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,160
Let me see

673
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,480
This should be a...

674
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,000
Most likely a camera

675
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Is it the kind that...

676
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,960
Necklace-style camera?

677
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,200
Yes

678
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,040
Zhenzhen used one before

679
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,040
Our TV here

680
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,760
seems to be able to operate it directly

681
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,400
Just plug it in and it should play

682
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,200
Okay, I'll go operate it

683
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,960
I'll go handle it

684
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,640
Alright

685
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,360
But if we say it like this...

686
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,240
Bamei was "killed" by us

687
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,200
No, she wasn't "killed" by us

688
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,120
If we hadn't let her out...

689
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,760
It's coming

690
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,520
Here it comes

691
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,400
Got it

692
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,200
We've got it, right?

693
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,680
This is the 9th floor, right?

694
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,760
This went to that memorial altar

695
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,840
The door next to the 9th floor

696
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,280
But she clearly didn't go there

697
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,840
She entered Nanhua's place

698
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,120
Don't come any closer

699
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,520
Stay away

700
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,040
I'm just here to investigate

701
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,160
the truth about Nanhua's "death"

702
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
I have absolutely no

703
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,680
ill intentions toward you

704
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,520
toward you

705
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Who are you?

706
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,440
But how did she avoid the surveillance?

707
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,200
No idea.

708
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,720
Why didn't we

709
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,160
see her in the surveillance footage?

710
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,320
But that corridor is the only way through,

711
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,360
and it's under surveillance.

712
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,320
So if you want to enter her room,

713
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,640
you must pass through that area.

714
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,000
No

715
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,920
There's another possibility

716
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,600
The time we were looking

717
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,720
She had already gone in

718
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,960
No

719
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,920
Actually, I think

720
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,960
there might be another way

721
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
to reach the end of that hallway

722
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,560
Either there's another path

723
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,120
or she was there before we entered

724
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,880
or she was there before we entered

725
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,640
Should we go check the ninth floor?

726
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,600
Let's take a look on the ninth floor

727
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,840
But when Bamui entered the room

728
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,320
she clearly knew

729
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,480
what should be inside

730
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,160
Did you notice?

731
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,480
Right

732
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,080
She said, "I didn’t come to disturb you"

733
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,920
Who was she explaining that to?

734
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
Ninth floor

735
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,920
This is the only way

736
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,560
She will definitely be caught on camera

737
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,680
If she comes up here

738
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,640
How could she

739
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,720
How could she possibly get away

740
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,200
Earlier in the surveillance room,

741
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,440
we didn't see Bamei pass through this hallway.

742
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,320
But

743
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,920
Bamei still jumped down from upstairs.

744
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,440
Is it really this eerie?

745
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,440
Stay away from us

746
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:40,760
What are you doing?

747
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,800
We mean no harm

748
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,200
We just want to investigate

749
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,960
the painter's "death"

750
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,360
Why is Xiao Song so bold today?

751
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,400
Go, move aside

752
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,120
I'll do it

753
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,680
It's so dark over here

754
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Alright, can't see anything

755
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,200
I'm going to turn this off

756
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,920
Alright, I'm starting now

757
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,680
I am the recorder

758
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,320
Can't see anything here, I'll turn it off

759
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,680
Can't see a thing

760
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,480
I'm going to turn this off

761
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,800
Turned off

762
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,080
Alright, can't see anything

763
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,000
It's so creepy here

764
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,160
Wait, isn't there any light here?

765
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,160
Hold on, what's this on the ground?

766
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,560
What?

767
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,320
Let's open it and see

768
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,240
That scared me "to death"

769
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,080
It's just a paint box

770
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:45,920
Really

771
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,600
Come

772
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,360
Come here

773
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,360
What's wrong?

774
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,960
Come here, Liu Xialai

775
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,520
I have to pull you

776
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,640
I don’t want to go

777
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,360
Come

778
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
I don’t want to go

779
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,240
I don’t want to go either

780
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
I don’t want to go

781
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,800
This is

782
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,720
the window leading directly to the third-floor platform

783
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,280
Wait, there's this bottle here again.

784
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,480
"No-Cry Gas"

785
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,520
There's "No-Cry Gas" again.

786
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,000
No!

787
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,400
The light turned on.

788
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,280
Don't!

789
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,120
Go ahead, Brother Bai.

790
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,040
Bro, if someone comes out,

791
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,280
you keep them under control, okay?

792
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,760
Can't open it.

793
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,000
It should just light up briefly.

794
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,960
No shadow, no one inside.

795
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,360
No shadow, no one inside.

796
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,840
Listen,

797
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,640
no matter who comes out,

798
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,880
I'll definitely punch them.

799
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,480
Really?

800
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,160
Really.

801
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,360
Really.

802
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,760
Come on.

803
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,720
What are you doing?

804
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,400
Don't be afraid.

805
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,440
Mannequin

806
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,520
Take a look.

807
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,960
I'll definitely punch him.

808
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,560
I'll definitely punch him.

809
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,520
Definitely punch him.

810
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,880
Forget it.

811
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,400
Can it be opened?

812
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,240
Open the door.

813
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,600
A key should be inserted here.

814
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,800
Could it be this one?

815
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,440
There's a key here.

816
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,000
You really

817
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
have some skills, bro.

818
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,240
Worthy of being our security brother.

819
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,440
Smart frosted glass.

820
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,120
There's a remote inside.

821
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,840
Here, you try the remote.

822
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,640
See what it does.

823
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,400
Turn

824
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,160
on

825
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,960
the

826
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,360
lights.

827
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,000
Finally,

828
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,520
it's bright now.

829
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,320
What does "smart frosted" mean?

830
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,320
Why is this thing placed here?

831
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,000
I don't get it.

832
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,640
Just a simple mannequin.

833
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,520
Just a mannequin.

834
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,960
But this smart frosted glass cabinet

835
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,520
must have some purpose.

836
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,200
This should be the painter's studio,

837
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,760
right?

838
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,880
The things he draws are all so scary.

839
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,040
Here

840
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,640
Look

841
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,400
2007

842
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,120
2007

843
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,280
2007 Artist of the Year

844
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,280
Artist of the Year

845
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,720
"The Vanishing Woman"

846
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,880
Yellow roses symbolize forgiveness

847
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,960
You will surely be

848
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,520
Where the yellow roses fall

849
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,480
Guardian of mine

850
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,720
What is this thing?

851
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,880
Why is there a painting here?

852
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,840
But there's nothing here

853
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,640
It feels like it can be pulled out

854
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,680
This should come out when pulled

855
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,920
There's something behind this

856
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
But this paper is inside

857
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,160
What purpose does this serve?

858
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,000
Take a look at this.

859
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,400
Look at the window.

860
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,600
This is it.

861
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,160
The window that leads directly to the third-floor platform.

862
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,720
Here, see?

863
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,400
Didn’t she miss something on her?

864
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,000
She must have fallen from here

865
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,120
But why?

866
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,840
Why would she squeeze through here and jump?

867
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,840
Didn’t the alarm go off just now?

868
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,800
The surveillance doesn’t cover this spot yet.

869
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,080
Just a white figure rushed past.

870
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,600
So Sister Ba didn't jump voluntarily

871
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,920
She was "killed" by someone

872
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,360
They must have knocked her out first

873
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,600
Then threw her down from this spot

874
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,400
Not necessarily knocked out though

875
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,040
Maybe just like this

876
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,120
They threw her down directly

877
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,320
You're quite skilled at this

878
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,480
You've reconstructed the entire method

879
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,600
Confess, why did you do it?

880
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,560
Wait a minute

881
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,360
Someone could walk through here

882
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,440
And look, there are footprints here

883
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,640
A secret passage

884
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,120
You're taller, take a look

885
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,280
I think we might be able to go up there

886
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,120
I'll go in first

887
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,960
You're so brave, really

888
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,400
Check inside

889
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,640
See if there are any hidden compartments

890
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,240
That wall can be pushed, right?

891
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,440
Come on, guys

892
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,560
You go ahead, we'll wait for you

893
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Actually, no need to do it like this

894
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,040
Let's go

895
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,680
We're leaving

896
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,160
Be careful

897
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,240
This is an open-air area

898
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:07,920
Watch out

899
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,600
What's this?

900
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,400
A spiderweb?

901
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:10,960
Is this for real?

902
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,920
Is there a small cabin here?

903
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,560
Is this some kind of sunroom?

904
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,720
A place for growing flowers

905
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,920
Judging by its state of disrepair

906
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,080
it's been abandoned for a long time

907
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,280
Look, there are even spiderwebs now

908
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,400
Yes, there's another door here.

909
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:40,840
Let's take a look.

910
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,600
Wait a moment

911
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,320
This spot is a track

912
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,400
You can also push it

913
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,480
This is a track

914
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,560
Come on

915
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,880
You need to push it back

916
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,520
Come out

917
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,240
You come out first

918
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,160
Another "dead" person

919
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,760
There's another person here

920
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,440
I encounter this on my first day at work

921
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,800
Here's another one

922
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,000
Here's another one

923
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,160
There's another person here

924
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,160
Why are there so many people here?

925
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,960
Welcome everyone

926
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,600

"Let's Begin Deduction"

934
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,360
This

935
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,120
is our case review hall

936
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
As the saying goes

937
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,760
When tea aroma meets fruit pieces

938
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,199
milk becomes more delicious

939
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,120
Congratulations on successfully uncovering

940
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,159

00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,320

Cheers

945
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,840
Moreover, today's episode

946
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,679
actually

947
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,960
can be said to be quite special

948
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,480
Yes

949
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,560
So after solving

950
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,719
many questions

951
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,800
we discovered even more mysteries

952
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,840
Furthermore

953
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,480
our characters

954
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,880
all "committed suicide" by jumping off buildings in the future

955
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,360
Right

956
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,880
We were saved

957
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,360
Yes, so why did our characters

958
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,840
end up taking such a desperate path?

959
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,560
And what methods do we have

960
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,520
to help more people

961
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,520
who are similarly trapped in despair

962
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,120
stuck in such quagmires?

963
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,160
Therefore we hope

964
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,360
to invite our old friend

965
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,720
Professor Ma Ai

966
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,200
from China University of Political Science and Law

967
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,840
a criminal psychology professor

968
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,560
to help us analyze

969
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,760
and give us some advice

970
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,480
Hello

971
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,280
Professor Ma

972
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,360
Hello, Professor Ma

973
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,240
Hello

974
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,880
Greetings, Professor Ma

975
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,600
Come

976
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,840
I think each of us

977
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,800
could share with Teacher Ma

978
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,880
our character's

979
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,400
inner psychological state

980
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,040
and why they ultimately chose

981
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,560
to jump off a building

982
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,440
Yes, regarding young people

983
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,200
many are only children nowadays

984
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,240
facing tremendous work pressure

985
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,000
struggling away from home

986
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,760
those working away from home

987
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,520
often feel quite lonely

988
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,240
When experiencing severe distress

989
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,040
and overwhelming loneliness

990
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,600
how should one cope?

991
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,400
There are three main factors

992
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,600
that lead someone to suicide

993
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,240
First is personality traits

994
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,120
We can categorize

995
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,400
two types of people

996
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,400
the more vulnerable type

997
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,000
and the more resolute type

998
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,040
Which type is more prone to suicide?

999
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,600
That must be

1000
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,200
weakness

1001
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,800
Weakness, right?

1002
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,240
No

1003
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,760
strong-willed

1004
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,640
Strong-willed people

1005
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,720
act impulsively in the heat of the moment

1006
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,160
This is driven by personality

1007
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,120
Secondly

1008
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,200
It's about values

1009
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,640
Any "suicide"

1010
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,600
is preceded by certain events

1011
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,760
certain setbacks

1012
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,680
that turn into pressure

1013
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,480
leading to what we call in psychology

1014
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,280
what we call in psychology

1015
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,960
frustration-aggression

1016
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,960
except the target of this aggression

1017
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,200
becomes oneself

1018
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
This becomes a matter of values

1019
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Why do I say this?

1020
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,080
Because

1021
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,560
how you view

1022
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,040
setbacks matters

1023
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,400
Thirdly

1024
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,920
there may be psychological disorders

1025
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,000
These psychological disorders

1026
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,440
can encompass many things

1027
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:31,760
Right

1028
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,240
The most common we see is depression

1029
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,440
falling into depression

1030
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,760
Young people struggling in big cities

1031
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,040
lack social support systems

1032
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,680
Thus

1033
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,000
making them feel lonely

1034
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,360
feel pressured

1035
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,040
especially feeling helpless

1036
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,840
This helplessness

1037
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,200
is the main reason someone wants to escape

1038
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,640
One should try every means possible

1039
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,240
to make oneself happy

1040
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,680
using various methods

1041
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,200
to find friends

1042
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,960
and people to talk to

1043
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,160
to relieve one's pressure

1044
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,640
Right

1045
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,920
I "committed suicide" out of guilt

1046
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,640
I thought I had found my father

1047
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,880
But then I discovered someone wanted to harm him

1048
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,640
So I took care of that person

1049
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,720
I eliminated them first

1050
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,560
Later, the truth came out

1051
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,520
After the truth was exposed

1052
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,840
I feared legal punishment

1053
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,360
So I chose to end my life

1054
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,720
This "suicide" out of guilt

1055
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,640
Using our earlier

1056
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,600
small framework to analyze

1057
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,840
is fundamentally a values issue

1058
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,400
Meaning your understanding

1059
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,600
of the situation was mistaken

1060
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,880
You couldn't face

1061
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,800
your future self or society

1062
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,760
Your personal integrity was compromised

1063
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,440
My character

1064
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,040
He acted out of guilt

1065
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,720
Zhou Keke received

1066
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,400
something like a flyer for

1067
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,480
a "Youth Photo Studio"

1068
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,640
Then he sent Sister Cai

1069
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,960
into that place

1070
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,840
In the end, Sister Cai

1071
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,720
"died" in that scam

1072
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,760
at the Youth Photo Studio

1073
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,040
He couldn't bear it

1074
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,040
and jumped from the ninth floor

1075
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,600
This is the oppression

1076
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,640
But you'll notice

1077
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,240
Zhou Keke did this

1078
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,200
to achieve two things

1079
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,400
First, to prove himself

1080
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,800
Even if this deceived you

1081
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,880
and the outcome was this

1082
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,760
it wasn't my own doing

1083
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,880
It wasn't my true intention

1084
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,760
Isn't this self-justification

1085
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,680
that it wasn't intentional?

1086
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,080
Proof

1087
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,120
The second point

1088
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,480
is the inability to bear

1089
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,920
the resulting

1090
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,960
what psychology terms

1091
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,600
the punishment of the superego

1092
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,240
In other words, the stronger your moral sense

1093
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,160
and sense of conscience,

1094
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,080
the harder it is for you to accept

1095
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,000
the harm caused to others.

1096
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,040
This type of "suicide"

1097
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,600
to a large extent

1098
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,400
is what we call "altruistic suicide"—

1099
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,160
driven by guilt toward others

1100
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,040
to punish oneself.

1101
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,960
When attributing blame,

1102
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,200
people tend to lean two ways:

1103
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,800
One is external attribution,

1104
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,560
the other is internal attribution.

1105
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,520
External attribution

1106
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,680
often involves saying

1107
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,640
"It's all because of the circumstances."

1108
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,440
Internal attribution, however, leads one to believe

1109
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,880
"It's all my fault."

1110
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,800
This relates to your personality—

1111
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,480
the more upright and uncompromising you are,

1112
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,920
the more likely you are to make this choice.

1113
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,560
Taking all the blame—

1114
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,120
"It's all my fault,"

1115
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,680
"I'm to blame."

1116
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,640
"If I hadn't done this,"

1117
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,840
that wouldn't have happened."

1118
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,520
Yes, this is called internal attribution,

1119
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,200
leading to self-punitive behavior.

1120
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,560
In this story,

1121
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,280
my character was initially named Ke Wuku,

1122
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,400
but later became Ke Wuku (with a different meaning).

1123
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,840
This "ku" (bitterness)

1124
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,760
actually represents

1125
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,960
how after his brother "killed" someone,

1126
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,640
he wanted to take the blame for his brother.

1127
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,720
He jumped off a building himself,

1128
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,080
so that

1129
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,600
people would think "Ku" had died.

1130
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
This way no one

1131
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,120
would hold Ku accountable anymore.

1132
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,040
This approach of his

1133
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,840
what kind of mentality is this?

1134
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,120
Actually it's similar to

1135
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,600
Zhou Keke's situation earlier.

1136
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,360
To protect your brother,

1137
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,600
you chose

1138
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,280
what was really the worst possible method.

1139
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,920
And it was truly bitter.

1140
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,840
You merely look alike,

1141
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,280
but in terms of timing,

1142
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,280
fingerprints,

1143
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
and numerous pieces of evidence,

1144
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,560
you might not actually

1145
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,400
help clear his guilt.

1146
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,640
Your death might be "in vain."

1147
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,800
So unjust.

1148
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,560
You're so wronged.

1149
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,200
Ku, what a tragic child.

1150
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,760
So bitter.

1151
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,680
Desperate to save his brother.

1152
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,360
From a psychological perspective,

1153
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,840
it's still this kind of excessive sense of responsibility

1154
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,160
believing that one's actions

1155
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,400
can genuinely help others

1156
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
but actually has the opposite effect

1157
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,840
I'm anxious because

1158
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,560
at thirty years old

1159
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,120
Yes,

1160
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,520
I'm still not married

1161
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:32,840
Right,

1162
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,680
This anxiety

1163
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,440
has put tremendous pressure on you

1164
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,360
Psychologically,

1165
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,480
there are indeed some psychological barriers

1166
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,040
Poor psychological resilience

1167
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,840
Psychological resilience is like a rubber band

1168
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,560
A person

1169
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,040
must be able to stretch

1170
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,840
and also contract

1171
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,360
Right?

1172
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,240
Only this way

1173
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,480
can you have good psychological resilience

1174
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,840
With good resilience

1175
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,680
when facing

1176
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,280
different problems and pressures

1177
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,200
you can adapt to them all

1178
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,840
But have you noticed?

1179
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,080
Song Piaoliang

1180
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,440
Under the influence of society's expectations

1181
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,960
kept stretching herself thinner

1182
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,880
Until she couldn't

1183
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,280
handle new pressures anymore

1184
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,000
and completely snapped

1185
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,640
Yes

1186
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
It was a case of

1187
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,920
suicide caused by pressure

1188
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,240
and psychological unhealthiness

1189
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,120
That's right

1190
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,440
Facing these uncertainties

1191
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,240
when things started

1192
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,560
deviating from her plans

1193
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,760
she panicked

1194
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,160
The main solution

1195
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,280
is actually

1196
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,880
to change one's perspective

1197
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,680
How you view the situation

1198
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,720
We don't need

1199
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,360
to follow paths others have taken

1200
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,400
to walk our own road

1201
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,920
Exactly

1202
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,360
I followed my lover in death

1203
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,120
A love suicide

1204
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,160
Love-struck fool

1205
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,480
Hopeless romantic

1206
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,920
We'd make such a perfect pair

1207
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,240
I wanted marriage, you were lovestruck

1208
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,120
Had we met earlier

1209
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,920
we wouldn't have taken this tragic path

1210
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:52,800
True

1211
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,640
In cases like heartbreak,

1212
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,080
we actually call it a mood disorder.

1213
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,520
This falls under mental illness.

1214
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:02,840
Right.

1215
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,120
This is a typical mental illness.

1216
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:05,800
When someone

1217
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,240
experiences something unpleasant,

1218
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,400
it's natural to feel emotionally upset.

1219
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,840
This is called an emotional state.

1220
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,200
It makes us feel very bad.

1221
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,600
But this bad mood

1222
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,080
usually lasts two or three months,

1223
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,400
four or five months at most,

1224
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,840
and you can basically recover on your own.

1225
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,560
If after half a year

1226
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,160
or even longer,

1227
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,960
you still can't move on,

1228
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,720
and you see your ex-girlfriend's shadow

1229
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,920
in everything you do,

1230
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,920
it means you have a mood disorder.

1231
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,120
This mood disorder

1232
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,880
has disrupted your entire psychological environment,

1233
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,120
and completely

1234
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,640
taken control of your life,

1235
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,440
making you

1236
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,120
be led by something that's already happened.

1237
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,720
Yes.

1238
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,440
If it continues for over a year,

1239
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,120
you'll enter a depressive state.

1240
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,440
Is there any way

1241
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,880
As friends

1242
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,280
Or as people close to them

1243
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,560
When someone has these emotions

1244
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,040
What can we do?

1245
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,280
Many suicides

1246
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,320
Really show no warning signs

1247
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,640
Right

1248
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,200
When you have friends around you

1249
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,280
Who are facing difficulties

1250
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,320
We should learn to help each other

1251
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,280
The ways to help

1252
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,520
First is companionship

1253
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,600
Be there for them often

1254
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,200
Listen to them

1255
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,360
The second and most crucial

1256
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,840
Is to get them to see a professional psychologist

1257
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,520
You should guide them to seek

1258
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,360
Professional help

1259
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:23,760
Yes

1260
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,160
Because only professional psychologists

1261
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,840
Can identify the root cause

1262
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,200
And help them fundamentally

1263
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,440
Make psychological adjustments

1264
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,960
And behavioral adjustments

1265
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,720
I understand

1266
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,720
Let professionals do professional work

1267
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,480
Professional work

1268
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:41,880
Good

00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,840
