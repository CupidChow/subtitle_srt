1
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,960
There are three cases today

2
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,120
From a long time ago

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,760
The case of the Southern painter

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,520
His wife's "corpse"

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,120
And Bamei's "corpse"

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,480
The "killer" must be one of you

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,480
The Southern painter's body

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,720
Contained large amounts of illegal psychotropic substances

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,120
Components of "No-Cry Gas"

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,720
BKQ0005

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,800
Bamei's fan

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,000
Actually kept guiding her

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,320
To use that

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,520
"No-Cry Gas"

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
To "kill" the Southern painter

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,040
The same person who "killed" Bamei

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,680
It's the same person

18
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,920
And the same method

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,560
It's this "e mo"

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:46,880
Right

21
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,320
So "e mo" is the fan

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,280
The one who wronged you

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,840
Besides her, there are six others

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,760
The six of us

25
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,880
So we didn't "commit suicide"

26
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,480
We were "murdered"

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,200
Right

28
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,840
We and that Bamei

29
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,840
Who did we all wrong together?

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,560
The person we wronged today

31
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,360
Is connected to this young girl's murder

32
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,440
There might be some connection

33
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,480
Teng the agent "died"

34
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,840
I want to reinvestigate

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,640
Three years ago

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,520
The "burned corpse" case in the grove

37
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,560
I strongly suspect

38
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,800
Teng the agent's "death" is connected

39
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,600
To the "murdered"

40
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,360
Female student

41
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,000
And you six

42
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,240
Are all connected

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,600
Alright, since that's the case,

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,680
According to Teng Zhongjie's letter,

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,120
I strongly suspect that

46
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,240
all six of you are involved in this case.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,160
You're all suspects.

48
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,920
But after all, I'm just one person,

49
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,160
and one log can't support the whole structure.

50
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,200
So I hope you can

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,920
monitor each other

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,800
and help me investigate this case together.

53
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
We don't want to cooperate with other agencies.

54
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,200
The rest of you,

55
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
don't you want to prove

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,160
your innocence?

57
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,760
Not really.

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,520
There's no need.

59
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,360
No one suspects us except you.

60
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,000
Right.

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,960
Well, in that case,

62
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,720
I've prepared the Zhenguoli investigation kits

63
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,640
for everyone.

64
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,840
Please help yourselves to them.

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,480
They're already placed in the room.

66
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,280
Get them yourselves.

67
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,920
Because this case

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,720
is connected to all of you.

69
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,920
You can't escape involvement.

70
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,720
So your rooms

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,960
will all be searched by me.

72
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,120
Then we'll meet up

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,440
at the property management surveillance room.

74
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,880
Alright.

75
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,520
Then I'll leave it to you

76
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,440
to investigate the scene.

77
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,760
I'll go check your rooms.

78
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,080
Alright, today our group of

79
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,400
rather incompetent

80
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
detectives

81
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,480
has once again gathered in a room

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,920
to uncover the true

83
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,720
"death" circumstances of Teng Zhongjie

84
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,080
Let me show you

85
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,040
what my useless teammates

86
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,720
are up to

87
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,880
At home, he's still playing on the computer

88
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,320
pretending to play games

89
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,680
Wait, I don't get it

90
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,200
what's this keyboard for?

91
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,520
These are the people

92
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,760
No idea what they're doing

93
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,400
Completely clueless

94
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,120
First thing they do is play with someone else's computer

95
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,640
What's this thing here?

96
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,560
Open the umbrella

97
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:26,920
Let's see

98
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
You do it

99
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,680
If I do it, I won't grow taller

100
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,720
Opening umbrellas indoors

101
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,640
makes you stop growing, right?

102
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,160
No, opening umbrellas indoors "kills" your uncle

103
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,480
No no, it "kills" your uncle

104
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,560
Really?

105
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,440
"Kills" your uncle?

106
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,400
Is that so?

107
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,280
You can try

108
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,880
Why are you all so superstitious?

109
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,160
We are all time travelers

110
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,840
Believe in science

111
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,680
Get off my head

112
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,600
I need to grow taller

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,440
Need to take care of

114
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,080
Uncomfortable

115
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,640
Stomach discomfort

116
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,840
You're his uncle.

117
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,320
Teng Zhongjie

118
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,840
Take care, Teng Zhongjie

119
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,240
Don't tamper with the crime scene

120
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,720
There's definitely something to this

121
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,960
See, everything else is here, right?

122
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,400
This dumbbell was thrown here, wasn't it?

123
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,440
There's also this mark on the ground

124
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,200
No, this should be a trace

125
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,480
There's also this black mark here

126
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,160
Let's check others first

127
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,200
I think we should check the person first

128
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,080
This is...

129
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,600
Is this a face mask?

130
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,880
Face mask

131
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,800
This is...

132
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,800
"Smothered"

133
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,360
Cell phone

134
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,400
Cell phone and notebook

135
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,120
Flip through it to see if there's anything

136
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,720
Okay

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,400
Some pages are torn out

138
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,240
There are signs of torn pages

139
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,000
Several pages were torn out here

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,240
Two pages were torn out here

141
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,960
There's nothing, right?

142
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,560
Nothing at all

143
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
Should we spray some alcohol?

144
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Blank book (literally "wordless heavenly book")

145
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,800
Let me try spraying it first

146
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,000
Nothing there

147
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,920
It's password protected

148
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,640
What would Teng Zhongjie use?

149
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,760
You need to experience it

150
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,240
The pain the "deceased" felt at that time, right?

151
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,200
Yes

152
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,560
"Pressed to death"

153
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,600
Being pinned down

154
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,560
Being "smothered to death"

155
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,240
No, this is the opposite way

156
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,960
Doesn't matter

157
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,360
Press it left and right

158
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,960
Alright, that works too

159
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,600
Right?

160
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:07,880
Yes

161
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,920
We all looked through

162
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,800
this small gap in the door to see.

163
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,320
We could just see his feet.

164
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
The voice sounded like him.

165
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,280
No, there were two possibilities.

166
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,240
I think there are two possibilities.

167
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,880
One is that

168
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,600
he was "smothered to death."

169
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,080
The other possibility is

170
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,960
he was already dead,

171
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,200
then pushed aside,

172
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,360
and someone was impersonating Teng Zhongjie's voice.

173
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,720
Impersonating Teng Zhongjie's voice.

174
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,880
But how could he impersonate

175
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,720
Teng Zhongjie's voice?

176
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,880
It was Teng Zhongjie speaking.

177
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,960
Are we sure what we heard

178
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,480
was Teng Zhongjie speaking?

179
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,120
It should be.

180
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm certain it was Teng Zhongjie's voice.

181
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,320
But could there be a voice changer?

182
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,040
Like the one Conan uses,

183
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,760
with the bowtie device

184
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,000
that changes voices?

185
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,200
Tetris?

186
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,480
Look at Teng Zhongjie,

187
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,080
he's so embarrassed

188
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,120
he's curling his toes in awkwardness.

189
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,040
Wait a minute,

190
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,640
what is this thing?

191
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,440
What kind of medicine is this?

192
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,320
"Energy Boost Pills"?

193
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,600
Why does everyone living here

194
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
love taking medicine so much?

195
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
Right, everyone has to take pills.

196
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,120
They make you energetic, huh?

197
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,400
Yes, like it makes you hyper.

198
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,200
Put it in my pocket for now.

199
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,080
We should look for his medical records.

200
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Should we check this box?

201
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,360
Probably.

202
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,320
What does putting it up there mean?

203
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,080
It's testing how tall we are,

204
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,520
right?

205
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,080
If you two stack up, you'd be 4 meters tall.

206
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,720
You try.

207
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,760
Even if I'm on top, I can't reach.

208
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,600
You're not tall enough either.

209
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,200
I can't do it.

210
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,760
This

211
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Check if there's anything inside

212
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,960
There is

213
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,520
Tuishi Hospital medical record

214
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,160
Medical record

215
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,040
Xiao something-Teng

216
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,480
Xiao Jing

217
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,840
Xiao

218
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,800
Xiao

219
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,280
Xiao

220
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,240
Xiao something-Teng

221
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,080
Xiao Qi-Teng

222
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,720
Ba-mei, Qi-Teng

223
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,640
The "Ba-mei" he mentioned is his sister

224
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,840
But actually he didn't erase it completely

225
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,320
But here it looks like Xiao Teng-Teng

226
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,480
Xiao Teng-Teng

227
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,320
Little Teng-Teng

228
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,640
That makes sense

229
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,360
Let's see what illness he has

230
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,480
Patient complains of:

231
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,640
Self-reported:

232
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,320
Chronic lack of energy

233
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,080
Difficulty breathing

234
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,480
And occasional skin allergies

235
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,520
Diagnosed as "Major-Minor Illness Syndrome"

236
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,600
This condition may cause

237
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,040
Sudden death risk at any time

238
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,800
Treatment recommendations:

239
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,640
Get adequate rest

240
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,400
Avoid exhaustion

241
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
No running, clubbing or 857 (party dancing)

242
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,880
and other strenuous activities

243
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,440
Take twice monthly:

244
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,800
"Vitality Pills"

245
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,760
Apply to allergic skin areas 3 times daily:

246
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,480
"Tu Yi Tu" ointment

247
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,200
This is the ointment, right?

248
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,800
His face had allergies

249
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,440
So what he applied was medicine

250
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,640
You something...

251
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,840
You Jing-Shen

252
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Not that Bu Sheng-Bin anymore

253
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,640
July 15, 2022

254
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,159
11:00 AM

255
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,200
Collapsed at work

256
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,240
Taken to hospital by colleagues

257
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,280
Required hospitalization for observation and treatment

258
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,720
July 17, 2022

259
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,120
11:00 AM

260
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Patient has regained consciousness

261
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,480
48 hours

262
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,840
He was unconscious for two days

263
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,040
No running or intense dancing (857)

264
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,080
and other strenuous activities

265
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,760
This one?

266
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,920
So this is

267
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,080
Teng Zhongjie's "cause of death"

268
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,600
Practicing this "to death"

269
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,400
Prone to "sudden death"

270
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,120
I told you

271
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,560
Told you not to practice but you insisted

272
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,000
Right

273
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
Told you to avoid strenuous exercise

274
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,760
Yes

275
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,000
"Death" because he did 857

276
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,360
He did 857, right?

277
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,640
He did it at home

278
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,360
857

279
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,040
Can we unlock his phone?

280
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,800
It's password protected

281
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,520
What?

282
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,880
Yes, Xiao Tengteng

283
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,960
Little Tengteng

284
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,400
Little

285
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,240
Teng

286
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,280
Teng

287
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,640
Teng

288
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,880
Look

289
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,640
Little Tengteng opened it

290
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,040
Little Tengteng

291
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,920
Teacher Lou's home password

292
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,400
19890510

293
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,440
Teacher Lou's home password

294
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:32,960
So he knew

295
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,160
Teacher Lou lived here

296
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,560
The "corpse burning" case back then

297
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
Teacher Lou was identified as the "murderer"

298
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Tui Hui Investigation Agency

299
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,800
Failed to send

300
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,840
Tui Hui Investigation Agency

301
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,560
I've investigated everything thoroughly

302
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,840
The investigation at Teacher Lou's home

303
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,680
confirmed to me

304
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
that the "killer" in the grove case

305
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,720
was someone else

306
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,800
The "killer" was yet another person

307
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,320
Yes

308
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,440
He said the one who "burned the body"

309
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,120
wasn't Teacher Lou

310
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,640
A heinous "murder case" occurred

311
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,600
Teacher Lou "committed suicide" out of guilt

312
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,960
If the public had been more rational back then

313
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,120
and hadn't collectively attacked Teacher Lou

314
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,000
but patiently waited for investigation results

315
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,200
perhaps Teacher Lou's tragedy

316
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,640
wouldn't have happened

317
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,680
And my younger sister Bamie

318
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,480
wouldn't have suffered retaliation because of it

319
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,200
Sister Bao was the one who instigated

320
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,440
Xiao Bamei's "suicide"

321
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,600
She has already been taken away for investigation

322
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,640
Xiao Bamei

323
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,720
and Teacher Lou's jumping incident

324
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,040
Yes, that's right

325
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,160
are also related

326
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,880
Now I finally know...

327
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,600
Haven't finished typing

328
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,200
Didn't send it out

329
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,160
Like this

330
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,600
Let me check

331
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,680
His phone's background usage

332
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,920
So diligent

333
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,840
Let me show everyone

334
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,800
Kept charging

335
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,120
And turned on low power mode

336
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,520
With such high battery level

337
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,680
Still using low power mode

338
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,040
Must have been manually set

339
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,080
Isn't that a bit excessive?

340
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,960
Your analysis

341
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,880
is very reasonable, right?

342
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,640
No

343
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
I think we should check these shoes

344
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,400
I feel like...

345
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,200
The insoles

346
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,040
Have we checked them already?

347
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,080
Are there height-increasing insoles?

348
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,920
No

349
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,880
Why so condescending?

350
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,400
What's going on?

351
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,200
Brother Teng's height is okay

352
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,680
Brother Teng is 1.8 meters tall

353
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,920
Not bad, Brother Teng

354
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,320
Take a sniff

355
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,840
See if there's

356
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,880
any other smell

357
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,280
You smell it

358
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,200
Okay

359
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,240
Nothing in the shoes

360
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,560
What else?

361
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,360
Just need to check one more thing

362
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,080
The headboard

363
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,000
Can the headboard move?

364
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,280
This place

365
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,040
What's wrong?

366
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,840
There is

367
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,880
It's a

368
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,600
Come take a look

369
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,280
How should we look at it?

370
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,560
But this is clearly a clue

371
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,480
Just four dots

372
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:38,960
Right

373
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,000
You're lying on the same bed as Teng Zhongjie

374
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,640
It's a red mark

375
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Exactly four dots

376
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,880
And then a circle

377
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,120
Looks like some adhesive

378
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,200
Marks from something being stuck

379
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,000
What could this be?

380
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,240
Have we seen

381
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,040
anything red?

382
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,120
Four dots and a circle

383
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,440
What the hell

384
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,960
It could stick a square

385
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,280
Or stick a circle

386
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,880
That's roughly the idea

387
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,640
That circle

388
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,840
Look, there's black stuff on it

389
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,720
What's wrapped around this?

390
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,080
Look

391
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,240
Wrap it up

392
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Is it a thread?

393
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,760
This thread...

394
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,840
Could it be related to the one inside?

395
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
There might be a connection.

396
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,240
Because there's another one over there.

397
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,640
Right.

398
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,560
Yes, there's one over there.

399
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,520
We just haven't figured out what's on the ground yet.

400
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,040
Haven't identified this thing yet.

401
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,200
Come on, let's go.

402
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,600
Let's go.

403
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,240
Let's finish searching this room first.

404
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Home security camera

405
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,680
This surveillance system caches in real-time

406
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,880
to a local folder

407
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,080
Every six hours

408
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,080
uploads local files to the cloud

409
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,880
Cloud storage retains

410
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,960
24 hours of surveillance footage

411
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,840
There's surveillance

412
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,560
Check the computer

413
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,040
Then we can check the footage

414
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,560
July 28th

415
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,240
12:00 to 18:00

416
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,880
That was yesterday

417
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,600
Wait a moment

418
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,600
This surveillance

419
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,640
It's right here

420
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,920
Let's see if there's any blackout

421
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,080
Observe carefully

422
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,280
12:00 to 6:00

423
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,840
No one came

424
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,200
No one came before 6:00

425
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,560
18:00 to 24:00

426
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,160
The first person is about to appear

427
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,520
Let's see who it is

428
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,040
Okay

429
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,440
Alright

430
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,040
Who is this?

431
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,200
See? I told you who it was

432
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,360
You

433
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,200
Me

434
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,680
6:30 PM on July 28th

435
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,080
He gave me a small note

436
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,440
That's right.

437
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,320
What time is Old Bai?

438
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,160
Everyone has it.

439
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,840
Go ahead.

440
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,080
You have it too.

441
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,760
Everyone has it.

442
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,480
Just show it directly.

443
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,920
This one of yours...

444
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,120
I have it too.

445
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,720
Come on, take a look.

446
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,600
Yes

447
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:30,960
I

448
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,560
June 28th, 6:30 PM

449
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,280
Come to Room 205 for details

450
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,760
What's this at the beginning?

451
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,200
Finish reading it

452
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,000
At the beginning it says

453
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,520
Because I miss you terribly

454
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,080
I hope you'll come meet me

455
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,720
Why can't yours be seen?

456
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,640
Hurry up

457
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,000
Come

458
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,320
I know you will today

459
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,240
"Kill" me

460
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,680
But I still hope you

461
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,600
Can reform yourself

462
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,120
I know you're now with your beloved

463
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,920
Living happily together

464
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,360
But you still can't hide

465
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,760
The big secret from three years ago

466
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,920
June 28th, 18:30

467
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,440
Come to Room 205 for details

468
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,560
Ten minutes

469
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,000
Right

470
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,760
I know you've now found

471
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,560
A lover to marry

472
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,160
But you still can't hide

473
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,720
The big secret from three years ago

474
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,120
June 28th, 7:30 PM, come to Room 205

475
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,200
Forty-five, right?

476
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,160
I know you've found your father

477
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,760
But you still can't hide

478
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,520
The big secret from three years ago

479
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,800
28th, 8:30 PM

480
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,120
Come to Room 205 for details

481
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,840
Left at forty-five

482
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,720
Also forty-five

483
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,000
I know you've regained

484
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,680
Your loving girlfriend and brother

485
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,320
9:30 PM, come to Room 205 for details

486
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,280
Forty

487
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,160
His is ten minutes

488
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,600
June 28th

489
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,080
22:30

490
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,760
Come to Room 205 for details

491
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,520
Also forty

492
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:39,960
Ten minutes

493
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,080
June 28th, 23:30

494
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,120
Come to Room 205 for details

495
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,720
Twenty minutes for you

496
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,640
Right

497
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,360
You also had a secret three years ago

498
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,880
Three years ago

499
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,400
We all had a big secret three years ago

500
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,760
Three years ago

501
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,880
July 30, 2019

502
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,200
In the woods beside Tuilihai Avenue

503
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,920
A "corpse burning" case occurred

504
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,840
All six of you

505
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,120
Are connected to this case

506
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,800
How long did everyone see him stay?

507
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,000
Actually, it was about ten minutes.

508
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,720
I think there's a big difference.

509
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,840
Ten minutes and fifteen minutes.

510
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,600
The things done are different.

511
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Song is fifteen, right?

512
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,000
Yes.

513
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,800
Guo fifteen.

514
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,840
Liu ten minutes.

515
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
Ke ten minutes.

516
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,760
Lao Bai ten.

517
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,600
Ke is twenty.

518
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,680
Why did you stay for so long?

519
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,600
No reason.

520
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,960
Just chatting, talking.

521
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,560
These two pages were torn out.

522
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,240
He gave me a small note.

523
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,120
Everyone got one.

524
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,240
Is this the notebook?

525
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,080
Yes.

526
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,200
For two pages...

527
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,600
Do we need to write this much?

528
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,240
No need.

529
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,560
Let's piece it together.

530
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,320
Right, let's combine them.

531
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,040
We'll assemble it.

532
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,320
Come on, Brother Bai goes first.

533
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,200
Check if it's this sheet.

534
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,440
Can we fit them together?

535
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,000
Correct.

536
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Okay.

537
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,880
Eleven o'clock.

538
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:00,880
Good.

539
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,280
That means there's another page.

540
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,880
Yes.

541
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
Which means someone else was here.

542
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,760
Then there must be...

543
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,280
Check the next video, the 29th.

544
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,119
After midnight.

545
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,560
See who came in the dead of night.

546
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,160
Who visited late at night?

547
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,520
From dawn to morning, probably no one.

548
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,160
Not necessarily.

549
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,160
Then no one came after that.

550
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,560
He didn't come out either.

551
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,119
What's wrong with you guys?

552
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,520
Our eyes are about to go blind.

553
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,200
No.

554
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,760
Mine...

555
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,600
My vision is all wavy now.

556
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,800
But we didn't see anyone...

557
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,680
building anything here.

558
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,440
Right.

559
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,320
Maybe we can't see from this angle.

560
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,960
Yes.

561
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,720
This footage should show Xiao He.

562
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,840
Six o'clock.

563
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,480
Seven o'clock.

564
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,000
No one.

565
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,440
Xiao He should be coming soon.

566
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:50,960
Xiao He.

567
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,440
Forty-five

568
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,480
When I came here at noon today

569
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,080
No matter how much I knocked, he didn't answer

570
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,560
So I peeked through the door crack

571
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,880
and saw his playing cards

572
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,680
stacked into a tower over there

573
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,640
I was really anxious at that time

574
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,840
So I pushed the door open and went in

575
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,280
The door was open

576
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,400
There were many playing cards scattered on the floor

577
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,920
And then he was...

578
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:20,960
Wait a minute

579
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,680
Wait a moment

580
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,280
He deliberately took a look

581
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,160
Take a look

582
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,960
He paused after walking here

583
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,600
Glanced at it

584
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,160
Then walked away

585
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,480
Bring him back to me

586
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,280
This "murderer"

587
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,720
But actually not

588
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,120
We

589
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,000
But it might just be because

590
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,320
He wanted to check this surveillance

591
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,080
If it could capture

592
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,480
Whether it could

593
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,080
Right, that's his detective logic

594
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,120
Sensitive, isn't it?

595
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
What does this mean?

596
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,680
Xiao He

597
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,920
It's moving

598
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,640
Check the surveillance

599
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,600
He came directly to this spot

600
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,040
and watched for two minutes

601
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,080
He watched from 11:58 until midnight

602
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,680
before leaving

603
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,080
He was on a phone call

604
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,240
So that means

605
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,200
when we left

606
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
there wasn't anything at the entrance

607
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,320
There were no playing cards, right?

608
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,120
No

609
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,320
There definitely weren't any when we left

610
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,600
That means someone was inside

611
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,040
They set it up after we left, right?

612
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,160
Look at this

613
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,400
This one

614
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,720
Right

615
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,400
The video project is here

616
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,680
Such professional software

617
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,680
Play it.

618
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,320
Don't doubt it

619
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,080
This is what we saw on the first day

620
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,920
What you saw

621
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,960
Don't question it

622
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
You

623
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,760
saw

624
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
(with emphasis)

625
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,120
is

626
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,000
the crucial point

627
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,320
This video was made by Teng Zhongjie

628
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,880
This was edited by him

629
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,720
There's still a bit left, right?

630
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,360
Yeah.

631
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,400
This again.

632
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,680
The truth behind that symbol.

633
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,960
Brother Teng, how could something like this appear?

634
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,880
How should I know?

635
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,920
Is he investigating

636
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,120
or did he do this?

637
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,200
He definitely wants to uncover this secret

638
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,040
I feel that

639
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,680
and then

640
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,000
if we don't investigate this thoroughly

641
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,520
because he knows this thing is dangerous

642
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,800
that's why he told us

643
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,080
"Don't doubt what you see"

644
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,920
or you will "die"

645
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,400
The reason is

646
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,560
if we're not here

647
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,880
to investigate this matter

648
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,840
we might "die"

649
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,280
Right?

650
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,800
We haven't "died" yet

651
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,400
That's what it means, right?

652
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,880
On his computer

653
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,160
there's local surveillance video editing software

654
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,400
He knows how to

655
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,560
He can edit

656
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,120
edit

657
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,880
local surveillance footage

658
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,920
Operation history shows

659
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,280
pasting

660
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,200
overwriting

661
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,800
specifically from 12:05 to 3:00

662
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,560
Someone altered this surveillance record

663
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,680
and did it remotely

664
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,680
The trial version only allows one operation

665
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,800
and just one-time use

666
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,520
Good thing we found that document

667
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,800
It says changes can only be made

668
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,320
within a few hours

669
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,560
Every six hours

670
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,440
local files get uploaded to the cloud

671
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,120
Cloud files can't be edited

672
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,240
Yes, it's divided in six-hour segments

673
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,520
Four segments total

674
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,280
Six hours each

675
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
From midnight to 3 AM

676
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,000
this segment was altered

677
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,840
It automatically uploads at 6 AM

678
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,120
So he must have changed it

679
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,120
using this software before 6

680
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,840
Right, he changed it

681
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,400
Otherwise he wouldn't have made it

682
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,080
Changing it later would be useless

683
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,920
That means after we left at midnight

684
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,080
he came back again

685
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,600
and finished building this card structure

686
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,640
Then our surveillance was pointless

687
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,240
Let's check

688
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,600
that video footage from midnight to 3 AM

689
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,640
for any differences

690
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,320
I'll start from the beginning

691
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,800
Because there's five minutes at the start

692
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,200
Here

693
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,760
Can you tell what this is?

694
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,840
Can't make it out

695
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,680
Is this visible?

696
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,800
There might be something at 3 o'clock

697
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,600
where it skips slightly

698
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,760
Was there movement at 3?

699
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,640
The angle shifted

700
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,480
See, when we first watched it

701
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,320
we weren't thorough enough

702
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
Right, it shook like this

703
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,120
At this spot

704
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,080
Watch it frame by frame

705
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,480
See it?

706
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,080
It froze for a moment

707
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,120
The camera moved vertically

708
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,800
Yes

709
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,680
It was definitely edited

710
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,600
What's this extra thing?

711
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,040
There's an additional

712
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,480
Isn't it?

713
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:37,800
I see it

714
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,680
That white object

715
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,240
Right?

716
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,320
Yes

717
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,760
What is this thing?

718
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,520
Let's go take a look

719
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,200
There's a label

720
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,880
This area has been disinfected

721
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,680
Disinfection worker Hao Baojie

722
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,600
Contact number

723
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,080
Your brother

724
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,920
So it was my brother who did this?

725
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
That means during this time period

726
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,640
Hao Baojie came here to clean

727
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,760
Right

728
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,600
Hao Baojie was here

729
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,200
So Hao Baojie

730
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,280
might know something

731
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,000
It didn't appear until 3 o'clock

732
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,360
So from 12:05

733
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,480
until 3 o'clock

734
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,120
And he came and left

735
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,920
So he's completely out of frame

736
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,280
Yes

737
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,520
Looking at it this way, Hao Baojie

738
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,600
definitely isn't the one

739
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,080
Because he altered the surveillance

740
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,240
He wouldn't put up that notice

741
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,840
We can ask him

742
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,520
See if he has

743
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,760
He might have heard

744
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,440
or seen something

745
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,000
Then I'll call

746
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,040
Call my brother

747
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,240
Do you have a phone?

748
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,760
I have a phone

749
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,560
Indeed

750
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,480
My 5 million inheritance

751
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:37,920
Forgot

752
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,440
What?

753
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,040
We don't have this inheritance

754
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,360
Can't you see this huge diamond ring?

755
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,800
Have you forgotten who my husband is?

756
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,160
Isn't your husband that Lai Wanou?

757
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,640
Right?

758
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,240
You can come back

759
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,640
Let me tell you

760
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,840
My husband deserves half the credit

761
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,120
Thank your husband

762
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,280
Her partner is indeed capable

763
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,160
Hey, little brother

764
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,960
Bro

765
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
What do you need from me?

766
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,680
I wanted to ask you something

767
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,280
On July 29th

768
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,760
from midnight to 3 AM

769
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,960
what were you doing during that time?

770
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,040
I was disinfecting the apartment building

771
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,240
When I was on the second floor

772
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,160
What time did you start disinfecting?

773
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,280
The second floor

774
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,080
At 2:15

775
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,640
What time did you arrive?

776
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,560
I got there at 2

777
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,320
After disinfecting, I also took out the trash

778
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,400
I've been too busy today.

779
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,760
I meant to do another round of collection.

780
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
But didn't have time.

781
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
Where do you usually put the trash?

782
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,480
The trash bin.

783
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,440
So it's in this hallway trash bin, right?

784
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,400
It's in the bin opposite Teng Agency.

785
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,800
Okay.

786
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,960
Understood.

787
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
I collected the trash at 2:15.

788
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,120
It's still in my garbage truck.

789
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,920
Where did you take the trash?

790
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,640
Let me check.

791
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,360
I'll have Xiao He deliver it to you later.

792
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,920
Alright.

793
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,760
Also,

794
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,200
When you came to disinfect,

795
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,840
did you notice

796
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,400
anything unusual about Teng Agency's office?

797
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Or hear any sounds?

798
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,760
Did you hear anything?

799
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,480
No.

800
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,920
I was too focused on my work.

801
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,520
Too focused.

802
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,000
Fighting every single bacterium.

803
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,840
Then did you see

804
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,400
when you came,

805
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,480
any acquaintances or anything?

806
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,160
No, not at all.

807
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,640
You didn't meet anyone at all, right?

808
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,400
I was working all alone.

809
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,320
How alone? Just how alone?

810
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,000
So you didn't hear

811
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,400
any movement inside, correct?

812
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,600
No.

813
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,360
Fine, alright then.

814
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,720
That's it.

815
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,280
That's all, bro.

816
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,240
You go back to work.

817
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,960
I'll call you if anything comes up.

818
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,720
Goodbye.

819
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,560
Okay

820
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,520
Indeed

821
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,600
Great

822
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,280
Pretty impressive

823
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,560
He's investigating us.

824
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,960
Let me see

825
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,800
The year 2025

826
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,600
Afternoon of April 1st

827
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,440
I saw a beam of light on the third-floor rooftop

828
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,720
In the darkness

829
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,600
A beam of light in the darkness

830
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,480
Then on the observation deck

831
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,280
I found a piece of paper

832
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,240
That gave me a chance to start over

833
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,440
He also "time-traveled"

834
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,840
I am the one everyone loves

835
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,640
Teng Zhongjie

836
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,400
There's nobody here

837
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,240
No one

838
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,360
He's also a time traveler

839
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,160
Yes

840
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,800
I discovered

841
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,320
there's actually a "Meet You" project

842
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,360
They seem to be time resetters too

843
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,920
But I can't trust them

844
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,080
They formed a voluntary mutual aid group

845
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,040
To give those of us who lost loved ones

846
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
One chance at salvation

847
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,800
The note

848
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,680
During the "time leap"

849
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,920
Got blown away by the wind

850
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,640
He came back with them

851
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,400
But he

852
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,960
Doesn't trust them

853
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,600
This

854
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,200
All seven of them

855
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,360
Used this symbol

856
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,960
And "died" by jumping off buildings

857
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,000
In their previous lives

858
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,560
We've used the "No Cry" device before too

859
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,240
In the previous timeline

860
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,640
I already asked the detective agency

861
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,560
To investigate

862
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,760
All online clues related to this symbol

863
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,200
Point to Apartment 11

864
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,720
Understanding this symbol

865
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,400
Means understanding

866
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,560
The truth about my sister's "death"

867
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,520
Is the breakthrough

868
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,320
So besides that "Meet You" project

869
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,240
He actually

870
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,000
Wanted to come back to save his sister

871
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,120
Because they're victims

872
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,040
That's why I trust them to investigate

873
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,200
We need to use the 50% discount coupon

874
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,560
To lure them to Apartment 11

875
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,360
This gives 50% off

876
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,280
Here's a 50% discount coupon

877
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,440
Everyone has discount coupons

878
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,120
This is Teng's plan

879
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,600
So

880
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,240
He used discount coupons to bring us six

881
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,920
Beautiful and handsome young people

882
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,680
Here

883
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,640
Because he wanted to investigate

884
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,000
And have us help him with this case

885
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,200
So that video

886
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,120
was made by Teng Agency

887
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,480
just to make us investigate this thing

888
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,000
Right

889
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,760
Everyone will

890
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,080
"die"

891
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,600
What is this?

892
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,480
It's getting more urgent

893
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,800
Here

894
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,320
I investigated step by step through them

895
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,400
The apartment's flyers

896
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,840
For purchase please call

897
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,120
Mrs. Ju from the Ju family

898
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,960
Little Wang

899
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,880
Tracked down the source of "No-Cry Gas"

900
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,560
At the Insomnia Convenience Store

901
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,400
Turns out it's secretly sold

902
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,560
to make people forget anxiety

903
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,920
A gas that treats insomnia

904
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,160
Why would Little Sister need this?

905
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:13,880
Sacred artifact

906
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,400
Can it really make me happy?

907
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,160
Sacred artifact

908
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,080
This is his sister, right?

909
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,400
Yes

910
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,800
Do you remember the note from yesterday?

911
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,120
Sister, don't get close

912
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,040
Don't investigate further

913
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,040
There was a note in the trash that said

914
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,680
Sister

915
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,720
Stop investigating the Nan painter's case

916
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,360
Listen, or you'll "die"

917
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,880
It might be

918
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
Probably Teng the agent

919
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,200
Teng the agent wrote it for her

920
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,720
Right

921
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,040
Yes

922
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,080
Correct

923
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,800
Big brother is so useless

924
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,560
I kept emphasizing

925
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,200
Telling you not to approach this symbol

926
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,520
Don't investigate the Nan painter's "death"

927
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,640
Someone must be exploiting

928
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,240
the ghost legend of the Nan painter's "death"

929
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,800
to "kill" you

930
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,040
But you wouldn't listen

931
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,240
Unfortunately I was sick and fainted

932
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,880
Couldn't save you

933
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,760
It was during those days he was unconscious

934
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,680
Two days, forty-eight hours

935
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,200
She died

936
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,880
So he always believed

937
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,640
that this was an

938
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,000
organization that would "kill" everyone

939
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,800
Yes

940
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,040
And this "Bukki"

941
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,680
everything about it

942
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,600
is connected to this apartment

943
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,160
It's about timing

944
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,320
That place earlier

945
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,200
All seven of them had used

946
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,600
this symbol

947
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,280
before jumping to their "deaths"

948
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,800
He said

949
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,840
"All seven of us had used this

950
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,080
before jumping to our 'deaths'"

951
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,120
"So in the future

952
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,440
we didn't "commit suicide"

953
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,080
we were "murdered""

954
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,400
Right

955
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,120
The first one is already gone

956
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,360
Indeed

957
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,000
So they were twins

958
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,520
They actually invited the wrong person at first

959
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,960
He originally wanted to invite me

960
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,040
So actually you...

961
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,560
He was looking for Ku

962
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,720
He wanted to save Ku

963
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,200
Because Ku would take the blame and jump

964
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,920
Ku wouldn't do that sort of thing

965
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,960
Would you take the blame?

966
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,760
Right

967
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,040
Found a piece of paper

968
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
This isn't duct tape

969
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,080
This is a piece of paper

970
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,400
It appears to have been torn

971
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,640
It was just stuck here

972
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,600
There should be another one underneath

973
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,280
And a drawing too

974
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,160
There's adhesive there, see?

975
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,080
A drawing must have been posted here too

976
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,600
Where's the drawing?

977
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,080
Probably someone tore it off

978
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,600
You're amazing, brilliant!

979
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,840
Now you're following the clues

980
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,960
Exactly

981
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,400
Right, my brother just mentioned

982
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,320
He hasn't taken out today's trash yet

983
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,040
Maybe the "killer" left some evidence

984
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,080
And it's in that trash can

985
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,600
Let's check

986
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,720
Anything?

987
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,400
Here

988
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:37,840
Rope

989
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,840
Look at this

990
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,600
What did I tell you?

991
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,520
Voice changer

992
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,200
Conan

993
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,080
After "dying"

994
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,240
Pushed him aside

995
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,440
Then pretended to be Teng Nakamichi speaking

996
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,480
Could there be a voice changer?

997
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,360
Like Conan's

998
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,080
Using a bowtie

999
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,320
To change voices with it

1000
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,840
Voice changer

1001
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,560
Yes, Conan's voice changer

1002
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,560
Voice conversion

1003
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,840
So that means the person talking to us

1004
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,560
Wasn't really Teng Nakamichi

1005
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,040
Right

1006
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,480
He might have "died" long ago

1007
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,320
There's a note here

1008
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:13,800
What is this?

1009
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,400
Tuitui Supermarket

1010
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,720
Product name

1011
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,040
Liquid nitrogen tank

1012
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,600
Latch nose

1013
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,240
Phosphorus powder

1014
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,040
Cotton thread

1015
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,560
Tuiqiang voice changer

1016
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,440
This voice changer only costs 50 yuan

1017
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,760
All these items for just 100 yuan

1018
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,320
Is this the flammable phosphorus powder?

1019
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,960
Yes, it has a very low ignition point

1020
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,720
Wait, why would he...

1021
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,400
...have a space heater at home?

1022
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,480
It's a bit cold

1023
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,360
Old man's cold legs

1024
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,200
When using the computer

1025
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,640
He points the heater at his legs

1026
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,160
I don't believe it

1027
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,920
White phosphorus is flammable

1028
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,560
Could it be related to the space heater?

1029
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,720
This black substance on the ground

1030
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,800
Could these be marks from burning phosphorus powder?

1031
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,480
I think this is ash from a burnt string

1032
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,160
that fell to the ground

1033
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,280
So someone coated this string

1034
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,520
with phosphorus

1035
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:13,880
This particular line

1036
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,240
was positioned exactly where

1037
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,680
it would be triggered when opening the door

1038
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,120
There are marks here too

1039
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,560
Look

1040
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:25,920
Up here

1041
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,520
A string must have been tied here

1042
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,040
Do you see it?

1043
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,320
Wait a moment

1044
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,600
Where does this string lead to?

1045
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Wait a moment

1046
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,320
Look at this handle

1047
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,240
This blackened part—can you see it?

1048
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,880
Where the wire passed through

1049
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,160
Should all be scorched areas

1050
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,000
So this spot should be too

1051
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,560
When I came in,

1052
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,080
this door was locked from the inside.

1053
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,160
A "locked room" murder case.

1054
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,080
Yes.

1055
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,840
Did he use this to close the door?

1056
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,400
Using this thing?

1057
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,960
I think he used this dumbbell

1058
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,680
to create some mechanism

1059
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,480
to close this door.

1060
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,320
To lock the door.

1061
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,240
Possibly.

1062
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,520
Right.

1063
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,960
Let's see how to use the string.

1064
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,880
He probably burned this string in the end.

1065
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,520
To create the locked room effect?

1066
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,360
Yes.

1067
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,000
Hand me the string.

1068
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,720
Here.

1069
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,240
For example,

1070
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,840
this end

1071
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,560
must be tied here, right?

1072
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,480
Because the force

1073
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,080
must work this way to close it.

1074
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,640
Right, we need to work backwards.

1075
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,080
First step is to loop it here,

1076
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,280
then route the remaining string.

1077
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:42,840
Correct.

1078
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,880
First guide it that way.

1079
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,760
Okay, this will

1080
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,240
snap the door shut.

1081
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,680
Pulls it shut.

1082
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,560
This

1083
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,080
here.

1084
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,400
Dumbbell.

1085
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,160
So it's this

1086
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,320
like this.

1087
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,680
Wrap it here.

1088
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,840
Tug - the string isn't straight.

1089
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,520
The dumbbell is needed to control

1090
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,719
the tautness of the string.

1091
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,480
I think the dumbbell should be suspended in the air

1092
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,040
This way

1093
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,600
Wouldn't that create a straight pulling force?

1094
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,480
Right, it needs to be like this

1095
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,000
Yes, you suspend the dumbbell in the air

1096
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,639
Okay

1097
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,040
Look

1098
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,560
Good

1099
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
For example, look

1100
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,600
The door and this

1101
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,480
See?

1102
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,080
Alright

1103
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,280
Now I'm done with this

1104
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,080
I'll leave you

1105
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,040
I'm leaving now, baby

1106
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,960
No

1107
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,679
It won't close here

1108
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,679
It's already inserted

1109
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,840
When he pulls with force, it'll just go over

1110
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,840
No

1111
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,560
Just put this on the ground

1112
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,480
Right

1113
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,600
Because when the door moves

1114
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,320
There's still pulling force

1115
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,280
Yes, it'll lift it up

1116
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,600
Come on

1117
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,639
I'll leave the door open for him

1118
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,080
One two three

1119
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:55,920
Too late

1120
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,639
Still too late

1121
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,400
We're still too late

1122
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,840
You can't make it taut all at once

1123
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,800
It's tightening too quickly now

1124
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,160
It's not working

1125
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,480
My brain's stuck

1126
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:05,880
A little

1127
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,960
"Killing" someone isn't easy

1128
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,400
Really not easy

1129
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,040
So friends

1130
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,440
Don't do illegal things

1131
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,840
And it's so mentally exhausting

1132
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,000
With six of us

1133
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,400
We're still struggling with this

1134
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,880
Yeah

1135
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,520
This is ridiculous

1136
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,720
This is how useless we are

1137
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,000
And we're trying to "kill" someone

1138
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,640
We're not cut out for this

1139
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,360
In this lifetime

1140
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,960
We can only be good people

1141
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,560
That's fine

1142
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,640
Lack of natural talent

1143
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,800
Well, some people can do it

1144
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,520
Like that Ke Wuku guy

1145
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,240
Seems he got caught

1146
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,360
Indeed

1147
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,040
Let's take a look

1148
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,520
See where the ash reaches

1149
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,120
See there's no black mark here

1150
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,160
Burned perfectly to this point

1151
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,560
The dumbbell's wire was tied from here to there

1152
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,920
This is one

1153
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,440
Might actually be two wires

1154
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,360
This single one is for the door

1155
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,280
and this cabinet

1156
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,680
This one is for the dumbbell

1157
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,520
Just the dumbbell

1158
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,240
No

1159
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,800
Then what's the purpose of this wire running here?

1160
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,680
If he

1161
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,920
For example, if the door is left open like this

1162
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,720
Tie a wire here

1163
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,200
To make it form that connection

1164
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,800
Then

1165
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,040
The dumbbell is to provide some tension here

1166
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,400
To prevent the door from closing

1167
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,480
Then on that side

1168
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,840
How does it burn then?

1169
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,480
Right, and here it didn't hold

1170
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,040
So it went past

1171
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,360
Then add another wire

1172
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,680
Right

1173
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,480
First close both of these completely

1174
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,240
Close them tight first

1175
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,360
Let's first test the closing force

1176
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,240
If it can connect

1177
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,800
Up to here

1178
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,080
You might have some extra length here

1179
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,520
About right

1180
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,080
I think

1181
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,440
Okay

1182
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,120
You close the cabinet

1183
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,240
Okay

1184
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,040
That should work

1185
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,160
So when closing the door

1186
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,800
This door is connected to this wire

1187
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,040
It pulls the dumbbell away

1188
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,440
Right

1189
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,400
Once the dumbbell is pulled

1190
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
The door will be closed

1191
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,120
When the cabinet closes

1192
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,960
Snap

1193
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,200
Yes

1194
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,680
That's right

1195
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,120
That side is the dumbbell

1196
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,560
This side is

1197
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,800
We can tie this to the door

1198
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,160
Can tie it anywhere on the door

1199
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,800
Will it hold?

1200
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,560
Let go for a second

1201
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,520
Okay, good

1202
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,600
It's holding

1203
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,960
I need to measure this length too

1204
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,440
Wait a moment

1205
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,840
We just need someone to come out

1206
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,480
I'll play the "killer"

1207
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:07,960
This side

1208
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,440
You play the "killer"

1209
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,280
Come on

1210
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,760
That's about right

1211
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,680
Straighten it

1212
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,040
Okay

1213
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,000
Be a little more lenient, no problem

1214
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,000
Committing a crime

1215
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,760
Goodbye, Teng the middleman

1216
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,680
Goodbye

1217
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,880
That's enough

1218
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,160
Just this section is fine

1219
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,760
Okay, come in

1220
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,400
You're the "killer"

1221
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,520
No

1222
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,320
Just joking

1223
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,640
I think we're quite clever

1224
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,720
Indeed

1225
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,240
Alright

1226
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,720
Case solved

1227
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,400
That's how it was done

1228
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,080
And then like this

1229
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,840
Okay, let's go home

1230
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,080
Wait, this latch plate

1231
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,440
We haven't examined this yet

1232
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,600
There's also this thing

1233
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,680
Yes, this one

1234
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,280
He might have replaced a latch plate

1235
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,400
Why would he replace it?

1236
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,360
So this latch plate

1237
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,200
Either it was broken

1238
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,240
Or when he entered

1239
00:37:59,240 --> 00:37:59,520
Possibly

1240
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,200
It was damaged

1241
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,360
Was damaged

1242
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,080
Or not

1243
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,520
Damage

1244
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,640
Teng Zhongjie isn't stupid

1245
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:05,760
Impossible

1246
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,280
There's another questionable spot

1247
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,240
It's that

1248
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,720
The one on top

1249
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,760
Yes, that four dots and a circle

1250
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,440
Hey, how's the investigation going?

1251
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,400
If you're almost done

1252
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,640
Come to the property management surveillance room

1253
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,840
I'll wait for you here

1254
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,320
Let's go

1255
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,960
Okay

1256
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,520
Take Teng Zhongjie's phone

1257
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,560
Let's go

1258
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,280
What's the liquid nitrogen tank for?

1259
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,760
Liquid nitrogen is extremely cold

1260
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,040
For cooling

1261
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,960
What was he cooling?

1262
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,120
Then I presume everyone

1263
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,000
has already completed the scene investigation

1264
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,640
Correct

1265
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,480
Before I explain to everyone

1266
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,280
about the scene investigation findings

1267
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,160
Allow me to take my position

1268
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,400
Take my position

1269
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,200
You can't go up.

1270
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,120
You were the first one sitting there.

1271
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,520
After examining the scene, we found

1272
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,680
you're the prime suspect.

1273
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,480
Really?

1274
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,040
Yes.

1275
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,160
Then tell me,

1276
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,600
what evidence at the scene points to me?

1277
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,000
Because of the "victim's" testimony.

1278
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,600
We just revived Agent Teng.

1279
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,680
Agent Teng said

1280
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,720
it was Xiao He.

1281
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,600
He said Xiao He

1282
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,280
is gone.

1283
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,680
What exactly was found at the crime scene?

1284
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,480
Let us tell you

1285
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
what we found.

1286
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,080
Because today is

1287
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
July 29, 2022.

1288
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,680
We were all collectively invited by Xiao He

1289
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,000
to Agent Teng's room door.

1290
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,640
Right.

1291
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,560
Actually, in Agent Teng's room,

1292
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,920
we discovered a big secret.

1293
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,160
That our Agent Teng is actually

1294
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,720
quite extraordinary.

1295
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,080
He knows about the time reset,

1296
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
and he might even be

1297
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,560
the one who reset time.

1298
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,280
Then his younger sister

1299
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,240
Xiao Bamei

1300
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,200
is just like us

1301
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,360
In the future,

1302
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,440
she might one day

1303
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,520
Bamei will "die"

1304
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,360
Last week,

1305
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,640
someone was supposed to "commit suicide"

1306
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,920
And the six of us

1307
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,240
were organized by Teng the agent

1308
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,120
to live together in Apartment 11

1309
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,520
This was Teng the agent's plan

1310
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,640
He used 50% discount coupons to lure

1311
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,280
six beautiful and handsome young people

1312
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:39,960
to come here

1313
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,560
Yes

1314
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,280
Right

1315
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,920
He organized us into Apartment 11

1316
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,080
to investigate

1317
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,760
his sister's impending "death"

1318
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,120
and find out who's selling "No Cry Gas"

1319
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,800
Right, and Teng the agent also discovered

1320
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,200
the "Meet You" organization

1321
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,040
but he deeply distrusts them

1322
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,640
I discovered

1323
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,120
there's actually a "Meet You Project"

1324
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,200
They seem to be time-space resetters too

1325
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,880
But I can't trust them

1326
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,920
He came back with them

1327
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,000
That's why he found us

1328
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,440
gathered six victims

1329
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,560
Because as victims

1330
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
I feel most at ease having them investigate

1331
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,000
Yes, finding six victims

1332
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,560
makes him trust us a bit more

1333
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,840
He wants us to investigate this matter

1334
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,000
Right

1335
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,040
This is the new issue we discovered

1336
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,720
From the scene, right?

1337
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:11,960
Yes

1338
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,360
Okay

1339
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,240
Actually, I also went to each of your rooms

1340
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,760
and found a lot of clues

1341
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,400
July 30, 2019

1342
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,840
What is this?

1343
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,080
What?

1344
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,360
A notebook

1345
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,360
Tablet

1346
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,440
What is this?

1347
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,080
Liu Xialai's computer

1348
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,560
Because I suspect

1349
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,880
there might be a "killer" among you

1350
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,800
Later I'll give you the evidence

1351
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,880
But you can't take

1352
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,480
the evidence from your own room

1353
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,120
You need to accuse each other

1354
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,760
Okay

1355
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,120
You'll search six rooms alone

1356
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,000
But here, take this

1357
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,440
Bai Sanwan's room is yours

1358
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,520
Why are you taking my bowl?

1359
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,240
You've even brought this bowl

1360
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,680
It's evidence

1361
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:48,920
Here

1362
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,640
What are you doing?

1363
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,520
How about this one

1364
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,680
Liu Xialai's room is yours

1365
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,400
Alright

1366
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,560
Let's take a look

1367
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,120
Here, he also has a computer

1368
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,400
You have a lot of stuff

1369
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,360
Why do you look a bit scared?

1370
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,080
The pretty one's yours

1371
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,440
Here, Zhou Keke's is yours

1372
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,880
Too shabby

1373
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,240
Keke's room has nothing (at all)

1374
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,080
Thanks

1375
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,840
Here, Ke Wuku's is yours

1376
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,440
Everyone can first look at

1377
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,200
the clues I've given you

1378
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,480
Check what's inside their rooms

1379
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,240
to see what's actually there

1380
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,160
As for these clues, I've already

1381
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,320
looked through most of them

1382
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,360
So I have an idea

1383
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,920
Later, we'll mainly listen to

1384
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,880
your interpretations of these clues

1385
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,360
What is this?

1386
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
Whose is he looking at?

1387
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,400
Mine

1388
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:48,880
This humble one's

1389
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,600
So you're actually a "playgirl"

1390
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,440
That's not true

1391
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,000
Who

1392
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,840
You

1393
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,560
How am I a "playgirl"?

1394
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,680
You even have a kid

1395
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,640
Stop putting on an act

1396
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,160
Yeah, she hid it well

1397
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,440
She even has a second child

1398
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,920
A second child? Why didn't you say so earlier?

1399
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,960
We're both uncles

1400
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,080
I should've brought an umbrella earlier, right?

1401
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,680
No, you should still go find your child.

1402
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,080
Call them over to hold the umbrella.

1403
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,400
Buy a small umbrella for your child.

1404
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,400
Let your child hold an umbrella.

1405
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,520
Are all five of us gone?

1406
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,320
All left.

1407
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,880
If we've seen enough,

1408
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,480
we'll go up one by one.

1409
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,560
Or I'll let Song Piaoliang go first.

1410
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,560
You go up first.

1411
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,840
Then if anyone gets

1412
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,280
evidence against Song Piaoliang,

1413
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:32,760
No,

1414
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,440
why do we always make a girl

1415
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,600
take the lead?

1416
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,200
You go.

1417
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,320
Let me tell you,

1418
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,520
What are you doing?

1419
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,400
Don't scare me.

1420
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,840
I have a weak heart.

1421
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,440
Come, first

1422
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,160
She has a notebook

1423
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,360
In this notebook

1424
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,040
On the first page

1425
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,520
At 25 - fall in love

1426
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,800
With a strange man

1427
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,280
Actually he's not strange

1428
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,080
Who's this?

1429
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,520
This is

1430
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,120
Teacher Lou

1431
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:09,840
Teacher Lou

1432
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,880
Teacher Lou

1433
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,080
You and Teacher Lou

1434
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,760
Then

1435
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,080
At 26

1436
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,040
Get engaged

1437
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,080
At 27

1438
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,960
Get married

1439
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,400
Married

1440
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,040
You were married?

1441
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,120
At 28

1442
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,880
First child born

1443
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,080
At 30 - second child

1444
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:27,960
Second child born

1445
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,480
Two

1446
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,280
Tell me

1447
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,000
Tell me

1448
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,560
How could you have such a happy family?

1449
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,400
So you're Teacher Lou's

1450
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,200
Wife

1451
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:37,920
Widow

1452
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,120
What's your relationship with Teacher Lou?

1453
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,480
Just say you can't be a detective

1454
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,840
Look at that picture

1455
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,320
I photoshopped that myself

1456
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,800
If you put it that way

1457
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,320
All our images are retouched

1458
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,880
What evidence do you have to say

1459
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,560
that this is retouched?

1460
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,400
Suddenly so meticulous

1461
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,800
No, this is retouched

1462
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,200
But we used to be colleagues

1463
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,320
Didn’t I work as a teacher at a school before?

1464
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,480
What kind of teacher?

1465
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,320
Handicrafts teacher

1466
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,880
Which school still hires handicrafts teachers?

1467
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,160
Tuishi University

1468
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,840
Handicraft teacher

1469
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,400
It's a vocational school

1470
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,320
Vocational school

1471
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,320
Okay, go on

1472
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,960
When I was a teacher

1473
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,160
I met him

1474
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,520
He kept

1475
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,360
Doing this to me

1476
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,920
Does he have eye problems?

1477
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,560
Yes, he kept smiling at me

1478
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,200
He smiled at me

1479
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,760
I thought he liked me, yes

1480
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,320
He liked me

1481
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,400
You thought he liked you

1482
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,400
Then you photoshopped these pictures

1483
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,600
Then you edited these photos

1484
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,480
I liked him

1485
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,520
You liked him too

1486
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,400
Yes

1487
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,480
Why didn't you confess?

1488
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,080
If confessed, wouldn't you be together

1489
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:50,840
if you both liked each other?

1490
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,840
I did confess

1491
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,720
He didn't like me

1492
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,720
Got rejected

1493
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,720
Was rejected

1494
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:58,680
Yes

1495
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,320
He gave me wrong signals

1496
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:03,840
So remember

1497
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,360
Don't keep smiling at other girls

1498
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,520
Not even smiling

1499
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,680
But he smiled at me

1500
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,160
But he smiled at me, you know

1501
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:11,960
It's just that

1502
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,000
So between you and Teacher Lou

1503
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,240
It was just a beautiful misunderstanding

1504
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,240
And then you got rejected

1505
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,480
He said "I don't like you"

1506
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,600
"You're delusional"

1507
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,800
Just thought I overinterpreted things

1508
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,760
So you resented him deeply

1509
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,880
Who wrote this for you?

1510
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,760
Dear teacher,

1511
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,280
Recently,

1512
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,560
I can't attend your handicraft class anymore.

1513
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,600
The final exams are coming up soon,

1514
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,760
and every Tuesday

1515
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,160
I have to go to Teacher Lou's house for extra lessons.

1516
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,040
See you next semester.

1517
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,080
Who wrote this for you?

1518
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,000
This actually means that

1519
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,280
the young girl in her prime,

1520
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,280
who was "murdered" in the grove

1521
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,520
and then "burned,"

1522
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,080
that girl,

1523
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:53,760
Xiaojing,

1524
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,000
was actually my student.

1525
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,080
I really liked her too,

1526
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,680
because she was usually very well-behaved.

1527
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,160
And then,

1528
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,120
that day she left me a note

1529
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,520
and gave me that shawl,

1530
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,760
telling me

1531
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,680
that she couldn't come to my class recently

1532
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,480
because she had to

1533
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,120
go to Teacher Lou's house on Tuesdays.

1534
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,920
Tuesday,

1535
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,480
was the day she was "killed."

1536
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,680
Do you suspect this girl

1537
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,680
was "killed" by

1538
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,040
Teacher Lou, right?

1539
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,520
Okay

1540
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,600
Now then

1541
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,760
Here comes a new lead

1542
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,000
An account from Meimei Planet

1543
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,080
reposted about the girl's "death"

1544
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,120
with some details

1545
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,120
I saw this girl

1546
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,000
enter Apartment No. 11

1547
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,880
on July 31st

1548
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,400
There's also a photo of Fang Xiaomei

1549
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,720
taken downstairs at our Apartment No. 11

1550
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,680
taking a selfie

1551
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,640
with the "victim girl" likely

1552
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,600
about to enter our apartment in the background

1553
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,640
Fang Xiaomei did see

1554
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,680
her enter Apartment No. 11

1555
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,240
Right

1556
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,080
And your comment was

1557
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,480
This Mr. Lou

1558
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,600
takes advantage of his youth and good looks

1559
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,200
to have inappropriate relationships with female students

1560
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,280
Xiaojing was

1561
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,600
a student in the handicraft club at Tuishi University

1562
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,800
Like a lamb to the slaughter

1563
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,320
she fell victim to his "cruel hands"

1564
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,240
I must speak out

1565
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,080
You claimed to be an eyewitness

1566
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:11,760
You saw

1567
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,560
her actually enter Apartment No. 11

1568
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,480
Moreover

1569
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,760
yesterday afternoon

1570
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,000
you personally saw

1571
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,720
her enter Mr. Lou's apartment

1572
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,960
Netizens

1573
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,520
investigate this man thoroughly

1574
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:31,960
This Teacher Lou

1575
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,280
lives in Apartment 11?

1576
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,840
Teacher Lou does live here

1577
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,840
Right inside this Apartment 11

1578
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,120
Which unit?

1579
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,400
I don't know which unit

1580
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,520
But he definitely lives here

1581
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,960
Didn't you see it yourself?

1582
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,000
Actually, I found out

1583
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,160
You went on a blind date on July 30th

1584
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,320
The matchmaker sent you a private message

1585
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,680
"Offline matchmaking event today"

1586
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,680
You were the first to check in

1587
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,000
The event lasted over ten hours

1588
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,400
Did you find any suitable matches?

1589
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,600
A few were quite good

1590
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,200
I need to screen them carefully

1591
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,200
So you were matchmaking, right?

1592
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,520
On the day of the incident

1593
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,920
Yes, I was matchmaking all day

1594
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,760
She genuinely didn't see it.

1595
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,600
Someone entered Teacher Lou's room.

1596
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,520
She falsely accused.

1597
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,200
Claiming she saw it.

1598
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,880
This is what I need to apologize for.

1599
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,160
Go on, explain in detail.

1600
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,160
On the day of the incident, I was on a blind date.

1601
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,920
I didn't see her.

1602
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,600
Enter Teacher Lou's room.

1603
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,360
The reason I wrote this is because

1604
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,360
Meimei Planet posted

1605
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,080
she entered apartment number 11

1606
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:41,920
So I also knew

1607
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,920
that on Tuesday

1608
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,680
she was going to Teacher Lou's for class

1609
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,000
So I made the connection

1610
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,880
I thought it must be

1611
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,640
that she went to Teacher Lou's place

1612
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,520
You just based this on

1613
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,280
your own thoughts and assumptions

1614
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,080
and posted this kind of

1615
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,800
unverified information online

1616
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,560
I was wrong, I'm sorry

1617
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,400
If this matter

1618
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,480
has nothing to do with Teacher Lou

1619
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,760
then wouldn't you be

1620
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,800
someone who added fuel to the fire

1621
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,560
That's right

1622
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,560
I'm sorry

1623
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,360
I apologize to Teacher Lou

1624
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:04,960
Really, you...

1625
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,520
Yes, there's something wrong with you

1626
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,960
Listen, how could you do this

1627
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,760
Teacher Lou later

1628
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,480
couldn't cope with it

1629
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:13,880
right?

1630
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,880
and went down

1631
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,160
I'm somewhat related to this matter

1632
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,960
but

1633
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,200
it's not "fatal" anyway

1634
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:21,720
not "fatal"

1635
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,640
But I did make a mistake

1636
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,280
I advise everyone

1637
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,400
not to act like I did

1638
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,360
Because I've been

1639
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,560
feeling guilty for a long time

1640
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,280
Guilt is useless.

1641
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,320
If guilt were useful,

1642
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,280
what would we need the police for?

1643
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,640
Saying sorry won't help either.

1644
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,000
Right.

1645
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,640
I advise you all to stop making a fuss now.

1646
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,600
Every single person here

1647
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,040
is involved in this.

1648
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,800
Anyway, let me vent first.

1649
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,920
Yeah, mainly just to vent.

1650
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,160
We'll talk when they "interrogate" us.

1651
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,520
Let's condemn this first.

1652
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,080
Just condemn it.

1653
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,440
It's so infuriating.

1654
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,720
How could anyone do such a thing?

1655
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,480
Seriously.

1656
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,920
A young girl actually did this.

1657
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,880
I'm sorry.

1658
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,240
Our teacher Ma just talked about

1659
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,080
"killing both body and soul."

1660
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:55,680
Really?

1661
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,400
When an avalanche happens,

1662
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,680
no single snowflake is innocent.

1663
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,640
Sorry.

1664
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,600
I'm that big snowball.

1665
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,000
I'm a blockhead.

1666
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,480
Not a snowflake, but a snowman.

1667
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,440
You're a snowman.

1668
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:05,960
Come back.

1669
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,520
Teng Zhongjie.

1670
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,000
What did I tell you last night?

1671
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,720
Yes, right.

1672
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,880
Go back, sit down.

1673
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,120
Go.

1674
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:16,880
Sit back down.

1675
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,320
Go.

1676
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,440
What's going on?

1677
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,120
Didn't you go

1678
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,640
to see Teng Zhongjie last night?

1679
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,360
What happened?

1680
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,640
Honest talk. A frank conversation.

1681
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,440
Honest. Right.

1682
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,200
He suddenly asked to meet me.

1683
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,320
Then he told me,

1684
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,920
"Have you forgotten about three years ago,

1685
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,320
when Teacher Lou jumped to her death?"

1686
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,200
Because in that note,

1687
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,800
didn't he mention my marriage?

1688
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,080
I wasn't very confident about the doll either.

1689
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,480
Afraid he didn't love me anymore.

1690
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,440
Right, we're about to get married.

1691
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,320
How could I let him

1692
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,040
just...

1693
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:44,520
ruin it.

1694
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,200
So he threatened you with "online harassment"?

1695
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,080
Yes, because this really happened.

1696
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:48,960
And her "death"

1697
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,160
was indeed related to me.

1698
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,200
So I went.

1699
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:52,760
After arriving,

1700
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,360
I entered his place but didn't see him.

1701
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,480
I peeked through a small gap

1702
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,040
and saw him lying there.

1703
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,920
Then he said,

1704
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,440
"I know what kind of person my sister was,

1705
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,760
but none of us were good people either."

1706
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,200
He said I actually never saw

1707
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,640
Xiaojing enter Teacher Lou's place.

1708
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,240
But I think she did go.

1709
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,920
Let's be clear about one thing:

1710
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,600
If you

1711
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,800
affect my marriage,

1712
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,400
I can't guarantee what I might do.

1713
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,560
So you threatened to "kill" him?

1714
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,360
Yes, I can't guarantee

1715
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,280
what I might do.

1716
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,120
But when I said that,

1717
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:16,840
he stopped talking.

1718
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,520
I think I intimidated him.

1719
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,600
You know, I shut him up.

1720
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,480
Then I left.

1721
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,280
He didn't dare speak.

1722
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:21,720
Right.

1723
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,840
First online harassment, now threats.

1724
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,560
You really are...

1725
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,240
You're really...

1726
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,880
All your power is in your mouth, really.

1727
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,440
Actually, your matter isn't that serious

1728
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,040
Just go over there

1729
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,840
and admit it boldly

1730
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,280
Have a heart-to-heart talk with them

1731
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,800
Play a truth-telling game

1732
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,000
If he truly loves you

1733
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,200
he'll understand you

1734
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,800
and accept you

1735
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,280
right?

1736
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:39,880
Yes

1737
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,320
You should trust your partner

1738
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:41,800
You...

1739
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,520
Go read some books

1740
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,320
"Marriage Psychology"

1741
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,680
So you really... yes

1742
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,800
Like "Accurate People Reading"

1743
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,320
and similar stuff

1744
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,400
You should study them carefully

1745
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,080
This is how I feel

1746
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,200
Look what we discovered

1747
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,200
The note signed "e mo" says

1748
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,520
"You've all wronged him"

1749
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,280
This "him" is probably Teacher Lou

1750
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,760
or Xiao Jing

1751
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,000
Both of them have "died"

1752
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,800
Xiao Jing "died" first

1753
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,160
Teacher Lou "committed suicide" by jumping off the building out of guilt

1754
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,200
Now regarding Teng Zhongjie

1755
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,360
Why investigate Teacher Lou about this matter?

1756
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,640
Probably because of his sister

1757
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,720
exposed this incident

1758
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,760
and then "got his sister killed"

1759
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,120
Yes

1760
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,600
He probably wants to investigate his sister

1761
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,280
why his sister was "killed"

1762
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:12,760
But

1763
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,600
the person who "killed" Teng Zhongjie

1764
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,280
I don't know what his

1765
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,160
motives are, right

1766
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,040
Afraid he might find out?

1767
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,880
So it's unclear right now

1768
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,080
What's going on with Teng Agency, right?

1769
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,000
Alright, come back.

1770
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,080
Next, I'd like to hear from Zhou Keke

1771
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:54,680
Go ahead

1772
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,640
I don't have any issues

1773
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,040
Be polite to Keke, all of you

1774
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,200
Keke really doesn't have...

1775
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,440
On the contrary, the less evidence someone has

1776
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,520
The more likely they are to be the "culprit"

1777
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,080
Is he feeling a bit flustered now?

1778
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,920
Yes, look - this board can't even lie flat

1779
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,400
He's deliberately messing with this board

1780
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,640
Can't this be laid flat?

1781
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,800
You're acting suspicious right now

1782
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,440
Confess, Keke

1783
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,440
You should explain yourself first

1784
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,200
What should I say?

1785
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,520
What are you doing?

1786
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,040
I'm...

1787
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,280
What are you doing? Rowing a boat?

1788
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,600
No

1789
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,720
Why can't this be leveled?

1790
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,680
Because you can't make it level

1791
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,440
This is hilarious

1792
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,000
Indeed

1793
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,040
Absolutely

1794
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,640
Come on, Guobaoyou - present the evidence

1795
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,280
Here

1796
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,880
First, I have here

1797
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,320
July 31, 2019

1798
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,680
Your chat records with Bamie

1799
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,400
You know Bamie?

1800
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,080
You could say that

1801
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,800
At that time Zhou Keke

1802
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,920
His account was called "Sweet Food Exploration"

1803
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,920
I'm a food exploration blogger

1804
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,200
Right

1805
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:03,840
Food exploration blogger

1806
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,600
Bamie contacted this food account

1807
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,480
Saying "Finally found you"

1808
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,400
There's no informant in this world

1809
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,960
that Bamie can't track down

1810
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,760
Then he asked

1811
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,400
"Hello dear"

1812
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,880
"Are we discussing a collaboration?"

1813
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,240
Then Bamie sent

1814
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,640
a screenshot from a video

1815
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,520
This video

1816
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,240
was one of his food exploration videos

1817
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,320
There's nothing important in this part

1818
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,160
The key point is here

1819
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:35,840
From here

1820
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,800
A person came running over

1821
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:38,840
Who was it?

1822
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,520
This person was Teacher Lou

1823
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,240
But Teacher Lou was cross-dressing as a woman at the time

1824
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,880
Then Bamai asked him

1825
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,040
Where did you take this photo?

1826
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,760
I want more information about this person

1827
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,000
If you need it, I can help you take more photos

1828
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,080
Is there payment?

1829
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,080
Bamai said the price was negotiable

1830
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,320
Definitely more than you earn from restaurant reviews

1831
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,720
So Keke went to investigate

1832
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,760
Right, I actually just accidentally

1833
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,000
filmed that restaurant review video

1834
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,920
Then Bamai

1835
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,760
saw the person I captured

1836
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,040
and asked me to investigate

1837
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,080
At that time I had just graduated

1838
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,200
I was an orphan

1839
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,840
and had no money

1840
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,800
So I thought I might as well earn some money

1841
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,640
So I helped her by

1842
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,280
following and photographing that person

1843
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,000
I didn't know why

1844
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,320
he was wearing women's clothes

1845
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,200
just thought he was strange

1846
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,600
After following him for two days

1847
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,080
I discovered

1848
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,960
that this was actually

1849
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,800
the "murderer" Teacher Lou from

1850
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,040
the "Grove Burning Murder" case

1851
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,960
Then I sent a photo

1852
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,080
took a picture of

1853
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,600
Teacher Lou's front door

1854
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,920
Should be room 509

1855
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,960
Remembered, 509 right?

1856
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,000
509

1857
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:35,800
So I sold this information

1858
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,720
to Bamai

1859
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,840
for five hundred yuan

1860
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,120
Five hundred, yes

1861
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,080
Then Bamai that same day

1862
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,440
wrote it into a public article

1863
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,080
and published it

1864
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,400
At that time

1865
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,000
it caused quite a stir for a while

1866
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,080
So you helped Bamai

1867
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,280
dox Teacher Lou

1868
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,880
Basically...

1869
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,720
So your secret from three years ago

1870
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,560
was this matter?

1871
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,960
Why call it a secret?

1872
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,480
Because

1873
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,800
About three days after she exposed it

1874
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,600
Teacher Lou "committed suicide" by jumping off a building

1875
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,520
So I feel deeply ashamed in my heart

1876
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,680
Because I think

1877
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,680
After all, it was me who exposed him

1878
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,800
to the public eye

1879
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,520
Then everyone attacked him

1880
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,920
So you were also an instigator

1881
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,720
An "accomplice"

1882
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,000
You were also a snowflake

1883
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,360
That's why I feel so guilty

1884
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:17,880
Okay, moving on

1885
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,400
That's enough

1886
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,520
Alright, now let's criticize him

1887
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,680
Okay

1888
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,520
How could you do this?

1889
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,480
Right.

1890
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,520
You harmed Sister Cai.

1891
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,400
You did these things...

1892
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,360
It's so infuriating.

1893
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,200
It's outrageous.

1894
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,120
For some money...

1895
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,440
For just 500 yuan.

1896
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,640
Let's cut ties.

1897
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,040
I can't believe I knew someone like you.

1898
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,600
I'm really...

1899
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,120
Ashamed.

1900
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:34,760
Humiliated.

1901
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,240
I want to see...

1902
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,280
When you sit there later...

1903
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,760
I'll enjoy myself first.

1904
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,480
Dear audience,

1905
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,640
This is our detective team.

1906
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,440
How could you do this?

1907
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,640
Speechless.

1908
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,880
Are you worthy of Biubiu?

1909
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,320
What did you talk about with Teng Agency?

1910
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:47,760
Yes.

1911
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,160
We talked about this matter.

1912
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,440
He said he would expose that thing from three years ago...

1913
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,480
Make it public.

1914
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,480
Because he thinks...

1915
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,160
That I was also...

1916
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,120
Someone who added fuel to the fire.

1917
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,000
Did you...

1918
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,360
Develop murderous intentions toward him?

1919
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:58,920
No.

1920
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,320
We just talked briefly and I left.

1921
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,080
I thought it was pointless.

1922
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,920
Did you two...

1923
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,200
Not smoothly. He was aggressive with me.

1924
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,920
You didn't say any harsh words at the end?

1925
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,720
No.

1926
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,120
Our Keke is very gentle.

1927
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,040
Wouldn't say harsh words.

1928
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,200
When he was leaving, he just...

1929
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,400
Said "Teng Agency, you're really bad."

1930
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,560
That was really harsh for me.

1931
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,120
Extremely harsh.

1932
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,040
Scared me "to death".

1933
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,760
Next up is Guo Baoyou

1934
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,640
Guo Baoyou

1935
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,760
This is the most exciting part

1936
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,560
Here comes Guo Baoyou

1937
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,400
Thank you

1938
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,280
Guo Baoyou's part is my responsibility now

1939
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,840
I must admit it's quite thrilling

1940
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,800
Maybe you should scold me first

1941
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,120
No, we need to hear the whole story first

1942
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,240
Then we'll think about how to scold you

1943
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,360
First, in your room

1944
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,960
There's a 2019 calendar

1945
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,120
And it says

1946
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,040
"Started seeing Xiao Jing home in 2019"

1947
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,040
This girl is Xiao Jing, right?

1948
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,320
Only on July 30th

1949
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,560
The day Xiao Jing "died"

1950
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,440
You didn't see her home

1951
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,360
Why didn't you see her home that day?

1952
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,680
Why only that particular day?

1953
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,480
Did you know she was going to "die"?

1954
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,880
You did it on purpose

1955
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,760
Go turn yourself in

1956
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,480
You sent her away

1957
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,640
You sent her to the afterlife

1958
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,800
This story is very long

1959
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,560
Xiao Jing was my girlfriend

1960
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,440
I believe

1961
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,080
I'm someone who knows the truth about this matter

1962
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,600
She came back and told me

1963
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,920
"I discovered"

1964
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,160
"Teacher Lou's secret"

1965
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,120
Secret

1966
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,640
That Teacher Lou has

1967
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,160
The prime culprit

1968
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,400
Rage surged from the depths of my heart

1969
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,080
Evil thoughts arose in my mind

1970
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,400
You "killed" her

1971
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:07,720
It was you

1972
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,280
He was scratched by Xiao Jing's nails

1973
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,520
"Killing" him wouldn't benefit me

1974
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,320
You "murdered" him

1975
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:11,960
And took his jade

1976
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,200
What's wrong with people like you?

1977
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,680
None of us are good people

1978
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,840
Yet you still couldn't hide

1979
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,720
The big secret from three years ago

1980
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,360
Besides us

1981
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,960
He also wrote notes to others

1982
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,720
I didn't want anyone to discover I "killed" someone

1983
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,680
Catch him

1984
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,280
You're the one who hit me like that

1985
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,080
I admit it

1986
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,480
I will "kill" him

1987
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,160
So your heart has grown somewhat dark

1988
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,600
Perhaps Xiao Jing did this to herself by accident

1989
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,240
The two of them could have collaborated in this crime

1990
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,440
What's the matter?

1991
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,480
That song from inside the doll is playing again here

1992
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,600
Zhou Keke, look what you've done

1993
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,600
I think you're just a "pervert"

1994
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,880
I'm covered in goosebumps

1995
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,960
Just give me the death penalty, I'm tired

1996
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,480
Since you know the truth

1997
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,680
Then you can just wait to "die"
