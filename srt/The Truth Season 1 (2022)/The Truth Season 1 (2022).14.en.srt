1
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,760
Family

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,920
I found in our apartment

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,600
my father whom I haven't seen for eighteen years

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,080
Uncle

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,440
Didn't you try to look for him?

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,760
Butler

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,600
The butler "died"

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Our family was temporarily formed

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,160
We were just trying to make some money

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,640
Another one

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,600
Doll

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,120
Don't attend the family reunion banquet

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,440
It's foretelling "death"

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,160
Paperclip symbol

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,480
They seem like an organization

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,960
I experienced my dearest one

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,760
jumping to their death

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,080
Connected - the person we saw

19
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,120
Then who exactly is this person?

20
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,800
"See You" hopes everything is well

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,920
This can't represent all six of us, right?

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,440
What other secrets haven't you told us?

23
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,040
"See You" time

24
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,720
Don't forget

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,120
This season will unfold over eleven weekly episodes,

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,160
telling the story of Apartment No. 11 in Tui City.

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,080
Six players will move in as new tenants,

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,200
residing in Apartment No. 11.

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,880
They'll be drawn into a series of mysterious cases,

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,720
forming the "Apartment Investigation Team"

31
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,800
to visit different floors,

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,640
meet various long-term residents,

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,520
solve their own identity mysteries,

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,600
and uncover secrets behind each case.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,480
The first six cases

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,320
will gradually reveal each new tenant's story weekly.

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,160
The complex relationships between new and old residents

38
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,720
will also come to light.

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,200
Starting from the seventh case,

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
all storylines will intertwine,

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,560
as truths are gradually revealed.

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,480
Every choice made by the new tenants

43
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,960
will influence the story's direction

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,280
and final outcome.

45
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,320
In each case,

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,240
the team must at the crime scene

47
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,759
identify the "victim,"

48
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,080
and based on clues,

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,720
pinpoint relevant suspects.

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,280
Note:

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,800
Suspects aren't limited to

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,720
Apartment No. 11 residents and visitors.

53
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,080
Even within the investigation team,

54
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,240
there might be suspects.

55
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,800
After gathering suspects,

56
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,600
the team will question them

57
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,200
and re-examine based on testimonies,

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,720
then vote to identify the "true culprit."

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,080
Only the "true culprit" can lie.

60
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,880
Only by finding the real "culprit"

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,560
do players win.

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,600
Players who vote correctly

63
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,520
receive a golden key.

64
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,960
If a player is the "culprit"

65
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,200
and escapes detection, they get a golden key.

66
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,240
Chase him

67
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,960
Violent dismantling?

68
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
Look how fun this is

69
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,800
Indeed

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
Push Fun Escape Room

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,680
Come on, let's go

72
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,760
Bai Sanwan, you kicked down someone's door again

73
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,120
Why do you always kick doors?

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,680
This guy

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,880
Too violent

76
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,280
Kicked doors at Apartment 11 too

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,600
Kicks doors in escape rooms too

78
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,800
That was my brother just now, not me

79
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,280
No wonder your hair's so messy

80
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,840
Let's go

81
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,200
Push Fun, we'll come play again next time

82
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,880
Let's go back

83
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
My stomach hurts

84
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,400
Wait for me

85
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,400
Is this act really necessary?

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Are you sure?

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,040
Stop commenting already

88
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
What's wrong with you?

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,600
No, I'm really suffocating

90
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,960
I can't breathe right now

91
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,080
Still saying it with a smile

92
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,360
No, I'm really suffocating now

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,160
Can't catch my breath

94
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,480
He's feeling dizzy

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,520
What should we do then?

96
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,160
So you should give me some space

97
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,200
Big brother's trying to catch him again

98
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,440
Look

99
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,960
He's blocking the door

100
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,280
Big brother's going after him again

101
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,560
Sanwan, kick him

102
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,320
Kick him

103
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,680
Why are you lying down now?

104
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,680
So you really don't believe me?

105
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,040
What do you think?

106
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,240
You're lying there so comfortably

107
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,960
Who would believe you?

108
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,720
Look at you

109
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,760
Who would believe?

110
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,880
No,

111
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,280
I was just resting.

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,480
What should we do then?

113
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,160
Do we need to

114
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
get you some medicine or something?

115
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,720
No need.

116
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,320
Just let me rest

117
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll be fine after a short break.

118
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,960
What do you mean?

119
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,320
Watch out.

120
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,960
Keep an eye on him.

121
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,440
Me?

122
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
You've got a problem.

123
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,640
What does this have to do with me?

124
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,360
You seem to be stalling.

125
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,520
What's wrong?

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,960
What does this flashing red light mean?

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,040
Is the elevator broken?

128
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,640
What's wrong with the elevator?

129
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,800
In case of elevator malfunction,

130
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,640
please contact the property office on B1.

131
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,040
Let's go to the property office.

132
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,800
The office seems to be over there.

133
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,600
Office.

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,200
It's this way.

135
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,000
Right.

136
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,440
Here.

137
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,800
Hello.

138
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,040
Kick the door.

139
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,720
Don't.

140
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,280
Property management.

141
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,720
Hao the Janitor

142
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,760
Little bro

143
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,320
Big bro

144
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,320
Big bro

145
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,400
You've grown taller again, little bro

146
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,880
Yeah

147
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,720
What's up?

148
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,120
What are you guys doing here?

149
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,160
The elevator's broken

150
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,880
We need to go upstairs

151
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,400
The elevator's out of order

152
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,440
We're looking for the property management office

153
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,240
Elevator's not working

154
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,120
That's beyond my pay grade

155
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,400
Here's what we'll do

156
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,160
I'll open the office first

157
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,920
You guys wait in the office

158
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,280
Then I'll find someone to take a look

159
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,800
You're being pretty casual about this, big bro

160
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,640
Bro, we're not exactly sure

161
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,720
that we're the good guys here

162
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,160
Come in

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,880
Bro, this place is filthy.

164
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,560
Bro.

165
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,320
Why is it so dirty?

166
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
Who's this?

167
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,800
Bro, whose stuff is this?

168
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,800
Deputy Manager Fu.

169
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,280
Any updates?

170
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,240
Today's my birthday.

171
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,800
I'm treating everyone to dinner.

172
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,640
For this birthday today...

173
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,360
Tomorrow someone else can treat.

174
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,200
Eating, eating, always eating.

175
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,960
You've got two hours.

176
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,680
Come back right after eating.

177
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,200
I won't be joining.

178
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,840
Residents have reported...

179
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
the elevator buttons in our building are broken.

180
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,680
I'll check it out.

181
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,280
Then at 12:30...

182
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,640
the elevator malfunctioned.

183
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,800
I'm stuck inside with no signal.

184
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,320
Is anyone in the office?

185
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,800
Help me!

186
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,920
He's trapped inside.

187
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,520
Who's inside?

188
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,200
Deputy Manager Fu.

189
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,920
Hello? Is anyone in the office?

190
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,600
We're all outside.

191
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,560
No one's there.

192
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,040
Help me!

193
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,240
The elevator dropped a little.

194
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,200
Is anyone of you in the office?

195
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,760
Quick, press the green button on the control panel!

196
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,600
Emergency brake!

197
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,240
Control panel.

198
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,440
Green button for emergency brake.

199
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:36,960
Here it is.

200
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,160
Emergency brake!

201
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,760
The elevator fell down

202
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,560
Did that elevator come down?

203
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,120
Go take a look

204
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,480
It probably fell down, I think

205
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,920
It's open

206
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,240
We need to pry it open

207
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,520
Deputy Manager Fu is "dead"

208
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,240
Look what you've done

209
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,080
What's wrong with you?

210
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,520
Why did you have to do this to him?

211
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,040
No way

212
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,240
Deputy Manager Fu is just gone

213
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,040
It's open over there

214
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,720
What's happening?

215
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,600
Who is this?

216
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,400
Deputy Manager Fu

217
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,720
Deputy Manager Fu

218
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,200
Old Fu

219
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,160
Let's get Deputy Manager Fu out first

220
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,760
Otherwise...

221
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,960
This elevator is quite dangerous

222
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,160
Phone

223
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,000
Take the phone

224
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,600
Be careful, the whole elevator is smoking

225
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,520
And that box too

226
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,400
It's so choking

227
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,840
Old Fu, how could you collapse just like that?

228
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,360
What?

229
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,040
Deputy Manager Fu, why did you collapse?

230
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,120
He's not breathing

231
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,640
Deputy Manager Fu is really "dead"

232
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,560
Come here, little brother

233
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,040
What's up, bro?

234
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,800
Let me tell you

235
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
Stop forming cliques here

236
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,480
You five

237
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,840
must have messed with something in the office

238
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,160
Emergency brake

239
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,560
He's the one who pressed it

240
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,600
Your accuracy is impressive

241
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,039
I got it

242
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,360
Look

243
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,799
There's one here

244
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,720
with "bloodstains"

245
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,360
Could it be because

246
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,919
I know now

247
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,480
Deputy Manager Fu

248
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,560
Probably when he was inspecting the elevator

249
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,960
the elevator suddenly malfunctioned

250
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,560
Maybe his head hit this

251
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,160
He damaged it

252
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,400
Don't move yet

253
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,000
Preserve the scene

254
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
Secure the crime scene

255
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,880
You already pulled him out from inside

256
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,320
And now you're securing the scene?

257
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,360
That was the scene

258
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,440
Either this way

259
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,800
Cleaner, you go work first, okay?

260
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,240
I'll go notify

261
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,960
the other residents

262
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,600
because Elevator #2 has some issues now

263
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,000
Go quickly

264
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,280
Then you guys help check

265
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,120
what's at this scene, alright?

266
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,200
Just now

267
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,040
Who did he hide his phone with just now?

268
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,760
The phone just now

269
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,800
The phone

270
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,840
Take a look

271
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,520
Open it and check

272
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,040
Teacher Jie-jie

273
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,960
Called for ten minutes

274
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
June 24th

275
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,440
Today, it's today

276
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,960
Let's examine the "corpse"

277
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,400
Sorry, we need to remove your clothes

278
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,200
Our apologies

279
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,640
What's in the pants pocket?

280
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,880
No, there's nothing here

281
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,600
Here's something

282
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,480
There's "blood" here, see it?

283
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,880
Is this "blood"?

284
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,440
Chest area

285
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,640
Why is the "blood" here?

286
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,560
Did you see that?

287
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,280
It's inside the chest area

288
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
There's something in the pocket

289
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,600
Why is it inside the pocket?

290
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,240
Right, and the outside of the pocket isn't torn

291
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,800
There isn't any

292
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,760
What does that mean?

293
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,120
Is it possible that

294
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,720
this clothing was changed later?

295
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,960
That corner

296
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,600
I think that corner

297
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,800
might not be his fatal injury

298
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,920
It was fabricated to look like

299
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,760
he died from hitting it

300
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,920
Possibly

301
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,960
So he's trying to pin it on me

302
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,160
I pressed that

303
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,360
I just finished the call. How about you guys?

304
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,840
We found that on his chest

305
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,000
there's "bloodstains"

306
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,800
So it wasn't an accident?

307
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,120
It seems like homicide

308
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,160
That's perfect

309
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,880
I've brought the Zhenguoli deduction kits

310
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,040
for everyone

311
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,120
Everyone take one first

312
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,320
With these Zhenguoli deduction kits

313
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,520
let's start deducing

314
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,480
I suggest we go to the property management office first

315
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,720
Because in the property office

316
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,520
Deputy Manager Fu's workstation is there

317
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,680
Let's go check the property office

318
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,520
Hao the cleaner is inside here.

319
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,000
Will you ever stop?

320
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
Why did you follow me here?

321
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,840
Get out.

322
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,600
Wait a minute.

323
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,200
Brother, let me ask you something.

324
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
Why is this place such a mess?

325
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,640
I was just about to clean when you showed up.

326
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,000
What are you doing?

327
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,600
There's so much work.

328
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,280
You're rummaging through everything.

329
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,440
When will I ever finish?

330
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
I'll have to work until late at night.

331
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,800
Don't worry about it.

332
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
We'll help you with it.

333
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,800
You said it yourself.

334
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
That's what you meant, right?

335
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,440
Do you even know how to do this?

336
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,200
Cleaning runs in our family.

337
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,920
Right.

338
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,360
Fine.

339
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,240
My brother and I are both in the cleaning business.

340
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,000
So it's all good.

341
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,440
Alright then.

342
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,360
I trust my little brother.

343
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,920
Here, I'll give you some tools.

344
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,160
Okay.

345
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,120
Like this.

346
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,160
Get to work.

347
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,600
Why hasn't your bipolar disorder improved yet?

348
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
I've told you not to lose your temper all the time.

349
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,960
Last time you yelled at me, bro.

350
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,720
I'll leave it to you.

351
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,200
Alright.

352
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,600
Don't worry, bro.

353
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,640
I'll come back later to check.

354
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,360
Do a good job.

355
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,760
Do it properly.

356
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,840
I think we should first check...

357
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,440
Deputy Manager Fu's...

358
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,840
...what's on this workstation.

359
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,640
I'll do it.

360
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,720
Come on.

361
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,680
Let's search together.

362
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,720
Let's clean this up first.

363
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,360
So dirty.

364
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
This place...

365
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,520
...is filthy, full of trash.

366
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,680
See what else is here.

367
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,840
Don't just...

368
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,960
...throw away all these papers...

369
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,520
Take a quick look through the trash...

370
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,400
...for any small clues left behind.

371
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,200
Xiao He

372
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
Xiao He, you're quite active on Weibo

373
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,080
Quickly delete the post on your Weibo

374
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,920
"The Head-Scratching 'All-Hands Meeting Drama'"

375
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,640
Delete it

376
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,880
Here, open this and take a look

377
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,760
Dear fellow office workers

378
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,320
We've arrived once again at

379
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,640
the head-scratching 'All-Hands Meeting Drama' time

380
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,440
Just want to let you all know

381
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,120
how much our office

382
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,560
is filled with 'All-Hands Meeting Drama'

383
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,680
First, let's take a look at

384
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,000
the composition of our office staff

385
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,400
Our property management team structure

386
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,120
is mainly composed of three tiers

387
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
The first tier is our General Manager Zong

388
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,560
The second tier consists of Deputy Manager Fu

389
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,720
and Deputy Manager Shen

390
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,200
The third tier includes our service staff:

391
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,960
Agents Teng and Xu

392
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,440
Housekeeper Hao

393
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,720
Security guard Xiao Bao

394
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,600
And the apartment's intern manager

395
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,040
me

396
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,600
Xiao He

397
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,040
Continuing from last time,

398
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,240
let's delve deeper into our office's

399
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,360
web of personal grudges and drama.

400
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,440
April 30th,

401
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,040
our company held a

402
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,640
"Plum Blossom Appreciation" event,

403
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,480
but it turned into a series of misfortunes.

404
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,760
Our property manager, General Manager Zong,

405
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,360
was truly unlucky.

406
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,320
While giving his speech on stage,

407
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,000
the giant installation hanging above him

408
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,800
suddenly fell,

409
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,000
"killing" him on the spot.

410
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,560
From then on,

411
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,840
our company descended into chaos.

412
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,440
Originally,

413
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,840
Deputy Managers Shen and Fu

414
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,240
shared equal favor from leadership.

415
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
But as the event organizer, Deputy Manager Shen

416
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,560
was caught by Deputy Manager Fu's schemes

417
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,160
and immediately fired,

418
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,080
banished from his workstation.

419
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,600
Thus,

420
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,320
our Deputy Manager Fu seized complete power,

421
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,440
becoming the winner of this office intrigue.

422
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,800
Now, about our apartment's

423
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,400
much-despised cleaner Hao,

424
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,960
the cleaner Hao who faces constant disdain.

425
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,840
He stinks!

426
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,600
Keep him away from me!

427
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,560
Fine.

428
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,840
He's universally disliked,

429
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,920
Cleaner Hao appears tolerant,

430
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,560
but secretly harbors deep hatred for both.

431
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,280
Then there's our hair-struggling agent Xu,

432
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,840
Agent Xu who's fighting to keep his hair.

433
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,360
He vows not to let Zong and Fu

434
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,120
continue exploiting him,

435
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,280
swearing to defend his last remaining hair.

436
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,120
Who is Agent Xu?

437
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,000
Well...

438
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,040
Will he take advantage of this turbulent situation

439
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,320
to stir up some trouble?

440
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,720
Be sure to watch the next episode of

441
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,800
"Hair-Losing Corporate Feuds"

442
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,160
Many interpersonal relationships have become complicated.

443
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,800
Gossip accounts

444
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,520
From what we can see now,

445
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,760
he's the most suspicious one, right?

446
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,280
Because he got him fired,

447
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,680
right?

448
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
But Manager Xu

449
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,080
also wants to "get rid of" him.

450
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,240
Manager Xu doesn't get along with either of them.

451
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,840
Right, Hao the janitor doesn't get along with them either.

452
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,200
Exactly.

453
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,400
The most intense conflict is between these two.

454
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,880
Assistant Manager Fu has this here.

455
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,280
The cabinet isn't open.

456
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,080
The cabinet won't open.

457
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,040
It seems to be locked.

458
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,160
So we should try something first.

459
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,080
Should we find the key?

460
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,720
Maybe a paperclip could pick it?

461
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,520
Do you have that skill?

462
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,280
Who has this skill?

463
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,640
Who's good with their hands?

464
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,320
Let me try.

465
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,520
You've got the touch.

466
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,600
We should keep an eye on you.

467
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,520
You're kinda scary.

468
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,360
I don't know whether to be excited.

469
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,440
Can you pick it or not?

470
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,640
You sound like a pro.

471
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,760
Damn, it's stuck now.

472
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,360
We're screwed.

473
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,320
Your brother led us here.

474
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,920
Now you're breaking the cabinet.

475
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,840
It's you two brothers.

476
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,080
And it was you who pressed

477
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,120
that elevator button.

478
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,720
I got it out.

479
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,480
Find the key.

480
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,720
Go look for the key.

481
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,360
Pour it out

482
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,840
Here

483
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,320
I knew it must be in the trash.

484
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,280
Yeah, I figured as much.

485
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,200
One of you must have accidentally thrown it away.

486
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,240
Here we go again

487
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,920
Another one

488
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,720
Yet another doll

489
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,960
Let's hear what it says

490
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,400
Don't go to work

491
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,800
Disobey and you'll "die"

492
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,440
Don't go to work

493
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,840
Disobey and you'll "die"

494
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,800
Don't go to work

495
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,760
What are we doing now?

496
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,720
Then to save our lives

497
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,160
Let's clock out

498
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,840
Let's call it a day

499
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,320
Today's deduction is up to you

500
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,880
So satisfying

501
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,520
So satisfying

502
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,560
What are they enjoying so much?

503
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,320
Open

504
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,920
Little card

505
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,160
Happy home

506
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,280
Feels as good as coming home

507
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,240
He went there again last night

508
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,360
The mandatory Friday morning routine

509
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,760
Calling the teacher to check in

510
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,840
This is what he did this morning

511
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,880
The call he made to the teacher

512
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,760
Whose location haven't we checked yet?

513
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,640
Look at this

514
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,400
Oh no, look

515
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,800
The life pressure is insane

516
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,599
This is clearly a family

517
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,960
So he's under tremendous pressure

518
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,720
The whole family

519
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,839
Elders above, children below

520
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,640
Exactly

521
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,720
Old Shen, let's go have some fun when you're free.

522
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,280
Brother Fu

523
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,560
They both had a good time

524
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:32,840
This is...

525
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,480
Did he send it to him?

526
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,880
Yes, Deputy Manager Fu sent it

527
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,200
This thing of his...

528
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,560
Who is this?

529
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,240
He goes there quite frequently

530
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,120
He went there last night

531
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,240
They both went there last night

532
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,240
I think today we should

533
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,000
make it our ultimate goal

534
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,120
to find this "Happy Homeland"

535
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,960
Let's go check out

536
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,880
what kind of magical place this is

537
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,600
Look at this

538
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,440
Xu Zhongjie's

539
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,640
Xu Zhongjie is an "office slave"

540
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,600
This guy

541
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,240
probably has psychological issues

542
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,880
Yeah

543
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,560
And look

544
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,200
"Office slave" essential heart pills

545
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,840
And this

546
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,280
"Office slave" essential anti-anxiety meds

547
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,960
"Office slave" essential hair care (hard to maintain)

548
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,680
Haven't these all been opened already?

549
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,200
Look at this.

550
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,880
Weekly work report.

551
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,720
Weekly work report.

552
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,320
Why is there "blood"?

553
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,200
Pushing us to "death".

554
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,080
Don't think you'll get off easy either.

555
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,480
One has "died".

556
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,840
You'll be next.

557
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,000
It's him.

558
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,560
Look how much work there is every day.

559
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,440
Worked to "death".

560
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,520
Look.

561
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,440
Monday, the first day.

562
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,640
As requested by the manager.

563
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,000
Make a 3,000-page Plan A.

564
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,680
The next day.

565
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,160
Revise 2,999 pages.

566
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,640
Slides.

567
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,760
The third day.

568
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,960
Then produce a 3,000-page Plan B.

569
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,640
And a 4,000-page Plan C.

570
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,080
After presenting.

571
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,880
The bosses and clients still think.

572
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,480
Plan A is best.

573
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,040
Change back to Plan A.

574
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,120
The whole week was wasted.

575
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
Aren't we just being toyed with?

576
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,360
So.

577
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,200
He also has a "murder" motive.

578
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,440
He also has motive to "kill" the general manager.

579
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,480
Has a "murder" motive.

580
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:05,880
Look at him.

581
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,600
Pushing us to "death".

582
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,920
Don't think you'll get off easy either.

583
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,160
So he has the strongest motive.

584
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,080
I think.

585
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,160
When he says one has "died".

586
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,400
Could it be.

587
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,360
The person "killed" by the falling cat.

588
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,600
Exactly the one "killed" by the falling cat.

589
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,000
You'll be next.

590
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,680
It might mean.

591
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,920
Today is when he "passed away".

592
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,800
He also has that

593
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,160
He also has that in his drawer

594
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Happy Hometown card

595
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,400
Everyone has one

596
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,560
You can check his back

597
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,920
Check his back - does he go often?

598
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,280
He goes much more frequently than that person

599
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,160
His is full

600
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,840
His card

601
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,120
But he's been going for a shorter time

602
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,720
That one started going in April

603
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,880
He only started going in June

604
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,840
Did he go on the evening of the 23rd?

605
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,400
The night before the incident

606
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,840
He went

607
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,240
He went

608
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,560
All three of them went

609
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,360
On the evening of the 23rd

610
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,080
They all met there

611
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,280
So this happy hometown

612
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,480
just how happy is it really?

613
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,600
Let's search again first.

614
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,840
Hao the cleaner was here too

615
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,320
Hao the cleaner had a good time too

616
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,440
First let's see how many times he enjoyed himself

617
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:22,880
Quite a few times actually

618
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,960
He went there on the evening of the 23rd too

619
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:27,920
So they were...

620
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,040
All at the same place last night

621
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,760
Team building

622
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,320
Team building

623
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,120
So they were...

624
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,480
He left this car

625
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,080
Whose phone is this?

626
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,080
Found the phone

627
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,040
This phone...

628
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,680
Belongs to my brother

629
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
This photo of your brother...

630
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,480
It's photoshopped

631
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,320
Album, just the album

632
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,960
Boss

633
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,840
I think General Manager Zong's "death"

634
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,080
Has other suspicious aspects

635
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,640
Someone might have tampered with the giant device that day

636
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,720
Causing it to "kill" General Manager Zong

637
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,640
I'm still investigating

638
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,560
I'll report when I have results

639
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,240
This is from June 17th

640
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,800
Who is this?

641
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,840
Who is this?

642
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,880
No, Hao the cleaner recorded someone else

643
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
He took it secretly

644
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,600
Who did he record?

645
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,480
It's Deputy Fu

646
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,880
Deputy Fu

647
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,560
He's wearing glasses

648
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:09,800
Deputy Fu

649
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,120
Deputy Fu

650
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,000
I checked - none of those three wear glasses

651
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,880
The "deceased"

652
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,920
He said there are suspicions

653
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,480
Someone deliberately "killed" him

654
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,120
It might be him

655
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,080
But didn't he already because of this matter...

656
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,520
Already left

657
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,360
Already resigned

658
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,200
Right, he's still investigating this matter

659
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,840
Come on, next one

660
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,360
Look at the next one

661
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,000
The one with the cat

662
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,160
The shape of a cat

663
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,200
Right, that's the one

664
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,160
Hao—there's a "Hao" here

665
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,600
Hao the Janitor

666
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,360
Hao the Janitor's cleaning towel

667
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,600
Hao the Janitor cleaned there at the time

668
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,480
Hao the Janitor is suspected of tampering with the screws

669
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,280
Right, he had the chance

670
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,960
The cat was on top

671
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,000
He was there—at the scene

672
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,120
Right, he was at the scene

673
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,920
Whose computer is this?

674
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,480
Take a look

675
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,320
Check the workstation

676
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,120
There's a speaker—it's Fu's

677
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,000
In other words

678
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,560
Hao the Janitor thinks Fu suspects him

679
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:53,960
Right

680
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,360
So your brother wanted to take him out

681
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,320
So your brother also had a "murder" motive

682
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,000
No, because he might've planted this handkerchief

683
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,400
there

684
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,840
to frame my brother on purpose

685
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,400
No

686
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,440
This is probably

687
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,160
Your brother thought he had evidence on him

688
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,760
He's convinced your brother did it

689
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,120
Because of the button you pressed

690
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,080
that "killed" someone

691
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,080
Let's look at the next one

692
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,800
Next one

693
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,280
Every piece points to your brother

694
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,840
Start asking

695
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,120
"I accidentally caused someone's 'death'"

696
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,520
"And had conflicts with the 'deceased'"

697
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,720
"What should I do if someone exposes me?"

698
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,520
He asked this question online

699
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:27,880
Right

700
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,040
It was my brother asking, right?

701
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,400
Yes

702
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,640
I think I believe my brother

703
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,720
Not objective at all

704
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,400
He thought

705
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,840
that he accidentally caused someone's "death"

706
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
But actually he didn't

707
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,680
I get it

708
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,800
Maybe he wiped that cat

709
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,480
Wiped that cat

710
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,640
So he thought it was his doing

711
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,280
But someone else might have loosened it

712
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,600
Right, he thought while wiping

713
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,200
He loosened it

714
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,040
How could he

715
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,280
How could wiping

716
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,440
Cause it to loosen?

717
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,240
It was just too satisfying

718
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,120
He went there for pleasure

719
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Went there for pleasure

720
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,840
My brother is that happy place

721
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,760
This

722
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,600
I'll erase this

723
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,680
Is this his password?

724
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
The computer has a password, right?

725
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,600
Yes

726
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:10,880
Scratch-off ticket

727
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,360
1023

728
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,200
1023

729
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,800
Okay

730
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,320
Teng Agency Energy Video

731
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,160
Let's watch the Teng Agency Energy Video

732
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,600
We're calling you, Deputy Manager Fu

733
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,200
Help us film a video

734
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,000
Come on

735
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,040
I'll show it to the boss

736
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,640
I'll lead our property management's energetic young team

737
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,800
To demonstrate our determination to meet KPIs

738
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,880
Hold it steady

739
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,440
Let's go

740
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,280
Guys

741
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,760
Come on

742
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,480
Hello boss

743
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,360
Our slogan is:

744
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,560
Work warriors

745
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,600
Work spirit

746
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Workers are the elite

747
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,280
Our principle is:

748
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,800
As long as the money's right

749
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,320
We'll even break glass

750
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,960
Our goal is:

751
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,440
100% satisfaction

752
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,920
100% safety

753
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,400
100% occupancy

754
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,360
Boss

755
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:00,960
You see

756
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
QR codes are displayed in the lobby

757
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,200
Scan anytime, anywhere

758
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,000
To check employees'

759
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,280
KPI progress

760
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:06,920
When I handle things

761
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,160
You can rest assured

762
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,520
Scan the QR code

763
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,360
Look

764
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,200
General Manager Zong: 0 votes

765
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,240

Go to the comments section

772
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,160
Let's see what's in the comments

773
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,560
Apartment No. 11 is too eerie

774
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,160
Besides hearing a woman crying at midnight

775
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,840
There are even bizarre rumors

776
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,880
It's said there's a small shop

777
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,080
That calls itself "Happy Home"

778
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,640
But offers mysterious services

779
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,840
Workers who enter mysteriously disappear

780
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,120
Recently, several elderly people

781
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,000
Have gone missing in the commercial street

782
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,040
Could there be supernatural forces at work?

783
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,800
That can make people vanish into thin air?

784
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,040
The shop is located at Apartment No. 11

785
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,280
Basement level 1, Dakaiyan Street

786
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,040
B129

787
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,680
Whatever you do, don't go there

788
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,000
Let's go

789
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,160
Let's go to Happy Home

790
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,920
Don't rush

791
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,840
There's more later

792
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,200
A shoutout to our group

793
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,720
That detective team

794
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,400
Not only are they handsome

795
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,840
They actually found my sister's toy

796
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,360
This person is called "Cat Doesn't Eat Fish"

797
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:55,920
Downstairs

798
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,800
Do you remember someone called

799
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,560
That one called Miao Miao

800
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,720
He wants to hug Bai Sanwan

801
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,240
Come on

802
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,000
I've been stuck on one question

803
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,200
Why only hug those two?

804
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,640
Don't know

805
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,360
No idea

806
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,120
What's the difference between us four and them two?

807
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,520
We should just go straight to that

808
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,440
awesome place and check it out

809
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,000
Let's go

810
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,880
Let's move

811
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Eye-Opener Street

812
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,960
B129

813
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,160
Let's go to Happy Homeland

814
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,440
The cat won't eat fish

815
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,160
Kitty

816
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,200
Still won't hold me

817
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,400
Come

818
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,040
Here

819
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,760
He

820
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,000
Hold me

821
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,960
This works

822
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,000
Try seeing if he'll hold you

823
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,560
This time again

824
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,680
He'll definitely hold me

825
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,160
See?

826
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,600
He still only holds both of us

827
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,880
Let you eat this

828
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,480
Let us eat

829
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,160
There's black and white ones

830
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,640
He wants you to eat this

831
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,400
You eat the black one

832
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
You eat the white one

833
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,680
Then you two will merge

834
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,320
Black and white

835
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,120
Cheers

836
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,360
You go try

837
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,560
See if there's any change this time

838
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,520
It's her birthday today

839
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,800
It just pushed right on my belly

840
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,200
Well done

841
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,320
Excellent

842
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,560
You're a cat with principles

843
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,360
It still only hugs the two of us

844
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,560
Finished eating

845
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,120
All done

846
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,520
Meal's over

847
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,440
Okay

848
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:54,920
Let's go

849
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,360
Let us go

850
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,160
Okay, goodbye

851
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,440
Alright

852
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Go

853
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,760
Can we at least shake hands?

854
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,360
Is a handshake okay?

855
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:00,840
No

856
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,880
Not allowed

857
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,360
Negative

858
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,320
Don't humiliate yourself

859
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,000
Let me tell you

860
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Goodbye

861
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,600
Stop

862
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,080
Come

863
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,440
Go

864
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,440
Quick

865
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:21,880
This is

866
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,880
B129

867
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,840
Fei Mao Foot Spa

868
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,160
B129

869
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,840
B129

870
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,680
This is where the fun is

871
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,680
Enough fun

872
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,200
Anyone here?

873
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,840
Who is it?

874
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,760
Miss

875
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,240
Customers

876
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,440
Hello, boss lady

877
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:42,760
Hello

878
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,360
Cool, are these all your classmates?

879
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,040
Yes, they are

880
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,280
Your friends?

881
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:48,960
Yes

882
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,000
Come in quickly

883
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,120
He's also here for a wash

884
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,920
Foot wash

885
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,160
All visitors are guests

886
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,120
Come

887
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,840
Make yourselves at home

888
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,160
No, who is this?

889
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,640
How do you know this beautiful lady?

890
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,600
Remember what I said at the beginning?

891
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,520
This foot massage parlor downstairs

892
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,920
is run by one of my relatives.

893
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,880
At 11 o'clock today,

894
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,160
you added this person.

895
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,760
This person is my relative.

896
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,280
Really?

897
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,080
This is my sister-in-law.

898
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
Yes.

899
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,320
Hello, sister-in-law.

900
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,520
He's been here before.

901
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,600
I've been here too.

902
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,520
You've been here too.

903
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,080
Right.

904
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,000
And it's related to you again?

905
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,760
Have a seat first.

906
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,240
Taller people lie over here.

907
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,880
No.

908
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,320
What about the person who just came in?

909
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,720
Someone just came in.

910
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,880
How about this:

911
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,400
Let's enjoy life first.

912
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,160
Experience it.

913
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,880
Relax a bit.

914
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,520
Then we'll ask questions, okay?

915
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:38,680
Right?

916
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,040
Come on.

917
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,600
Come here.

918
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,320
Lie down.

919
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,640
Come.

920
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,400
Come here, sweetie.

921
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:45,840
Come.

922
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,520
Lie down.

923
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,160
Come.

924
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,120
Relax.

925
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,920
Alright, don't be nervous.

926
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,960
Relax your mind.

927
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,400
Come.

928
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:50,920
Then.

929
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,720
Come on, give me your phone.

930
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,320
Will you hand them over yourselves or shall we take them?

931
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,240
You'll have to hand them over eventually.

932
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,640
This is my sister, you can trust her.

933
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,240
Trustworthy.

934
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,000
Is this it?

935
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,200
Yes.

936
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,440
I want you to relax.

937
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
Enjoy yourselves properly.

938
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,400
Technicians, come here.

939
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,520
I feel inexplicably excited.

940
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,240
I wonder why.

941
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,480
Really?

942
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,240
You're not really going to wash feet, are you?

943
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,560
No way.

944
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,960
Our slogan is:

945
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,520
Salute

946
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,840
Fei Maojiao is at your service

947
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:46,960
Thank you

948
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,760
Good work

949
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,440
Come on, take your positions

950
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,160
I want to salute again

951
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,840
I'll take this

952
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,240
Is this for real?

953
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,960
No way

954
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,440
Sis, this isn't quite appropriate

955
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,320
This matter...

956
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,880
I don't want to either

957
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,560
I'm not very good at this

958
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,560
How can you be so shameless?

959
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,520
I have no choice

960
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,560
I'm being forced into this

961
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,000
Look how nice

962
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,120
This row is really good

963
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,480
Why so conscientious?

964
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,360
Taking off shoes

965
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,680
Come on

966
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,440
It's a bit hot

967
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,360
It's okay

968
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,480
Get used to it

969
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,720
Have you soaked long enough?

970
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,160
Pretty good

971
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,640
That's enough

972
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,320
It's done

973
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,920
No

974
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,400
First step

975
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,240
Yes, first step

976
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,840
Why is there a next step?

977
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,520
Let's see how the kidneys are doing.

978
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,440
Put some strength into it

979
00:30:59,440 --> 00:30:59,920
Come on

980
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,360
Let's check how their stomachs are doing here.

981
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,040
It hurts here

982
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,400
Ke Wuku is almost crushed

983
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,760
After examining the stomach

984
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,640
We can check

985
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,800
how their sleep is

986
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,520
Sleep quality

987
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,240
Sleep

988
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,560
Sleep is okay

989
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,640
My sleep is okay

990
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,560
I think my sleep is okay

991
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,920
It hurts here

992
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,360
I'm doing okay

993
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,040
I'm not doing well

994
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,720
My arm hurts

995
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
Arm

996
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,520
Then let's check our bladder meridian

997
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,000
How is it?

998
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,560
This is fine

999
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,760
Bladder is good

1000
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,440
Liu Xialai, stop holding it in

1001
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,280
Let's see how Ke Wuku's bladder is

1002
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:56,960
He can't hold it well

1003
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,520
Going to the toilet

1004
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,160
No way

1005
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,920
Sister

1006
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,400
Now everything flows smoothly

1007
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,800
We've cleared your meridians, right?

1008
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,360
The Ren and Du meridians, correct?

1009
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
There's someone sweating over there

1010
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,000
No

1011
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,240
What brings you here

1012
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,600
today?

1013
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
Yes, our building's property management

1014
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,320
Do they come here often?

1015
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,480
Because all the property management around our area

1016
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,440
pretty much come here regularly

1017
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,400
Yes, that lady

1018
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:23,880
I'd like to ask

1019
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,440
about earlier

1020
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,360
Our agent Xu entered here

1021
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:26,920
You

1022
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,200
They're in the VIP area

1023
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,240
There's a VIP area?

1024
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,960
We want to go to VIP too

1025
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,000
Right?

1026
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,800
VIP, huh?

1027
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,040
It's not that easy

1028
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,240
to become one

1029
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,920
What qualifies someone?

1030
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,800
You need to meet our three requirements

1031
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,800
What's "enough"?

1032
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,040
Come on, technician sisters

1033
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,680
Our first "enough" is

1034
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,160
Have you been doing this long enough?

1035
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,760
Long enough?

1036
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
"Long" here means

1037
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,520
the duration of your work

1038
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
whether it's long enough

1039
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,520
Enough

1040
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,880
Very long

1041
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,320
Yesterday you worked the longest

1042
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,160
I worked way too long yesterday

1043
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,000
Yesterday I worked from 8:30

1044
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,240
until 2:30 at night

1045
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,040
That's quite long

1046
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,080
Yes, it is

1047
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,800
How about you?

1048
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,280
When I was filming before

1049
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,000
There was one week straight

1050
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,120
when we filmed 18 hours daily

1051
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,640
Actually got used to it

1052
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,160
Because I genuinely love it

1053
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
As it should be

1054
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,400
Indeed it should

1055
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,120
Coco

1056
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,440
About your chocolate

1057
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,720
How long does it usually take you to make?

1058
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,440
That takes ages

1059
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,560
Normally developing one chocolate

1060
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,600
takes me ten years

1061
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,680
Sister

1062
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,160
Keep it up

1063
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,240
He hasn't woken up yet

1064
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,960
He's awake

1065
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,440
I can confirm

1066
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,280
It really has been ten years

1067
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,400
I saw it

1068
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,880
Alright

1069
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,600
Quick, brother-in-law

1070
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,640
The longest I've ever worked

1071
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,520
was probably

1072
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,960
when I was eighteen, I went

1073
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,560
to participate in a show

1074
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Yes, that show

1075
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,480
For three straight days

1076
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,920
I basically only slept

1077
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,520
one or two hours each day

1078
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,880
My working hours

1079
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,040
I usually stream

1080
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,600
My longest was five points

1081
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,320
Five hours

1082
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,880
That's impressive

1083
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
Just kept talking

1084
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,199
Right

1085
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,600
I've been at it long enough

1086
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,360
I started in this line of work at fourteen

1087
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,239
Then you didn't start as early as me

1088
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,760
I'm older than you

1089
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,960
Pretty must have been at it for a while

1090
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,920
Her daily working hours

1091
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,760
Only last two hours

1092
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,080
Because it takes about an hour and a half

1093
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,159
Then half an hour to remove it

1094
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,600
That's about right

1095
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,600
Once I finish applying makeup, I'm done for the day

1096
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,920
What's the second "enough"?

1097
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,400
Sisters, the second "enough"

1098
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,040
Are you lonely enough?

1099
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
Are you lonely enough?

1100
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,159
Are you lonely enough?

1101
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,560
Loneliness means

1102
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,239
How long has it been

1103
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,719
since you've been with your family?

1104
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,239
Because of work commitments

1105
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,480
We're all still young

1106
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,520
Young people should work hard outside

1107
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,760
Actually, we've gotten used to it

1108
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,120
Right? Because essentially

1109
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,280
after leaving one film crew

1110
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,120
we join another

1111
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,760
All along,

1112
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,520
we've been with coworkers

1113
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,840
and work-related

1114
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,920
collaborating friends

1115
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,760
Actually, it's not too bad

1116
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,120
Besides, many people are away now

1117
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,920
and haven't seen their parents in ages

1118
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,560
Actually, everyone feels lonely now

1119
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,800
So within this loneliness

1120
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,640
we find some

1121
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,160
friends and people to huddle together for warmth

1122
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,440
From all walks of life

1123
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,480
Everyone has it tough

1124
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,360
Yes, actually everyone

1125
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,320
Let's do the third one, okay?

1126
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,640
The third "enough", sisters

1127
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,480
Are you strong enough?

1128
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,680
Strong enough?

1129
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,160
I actually think we

1130
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,960
young people today are quite resilient

1131
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,640
We admit

1132
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,600
we thought we weren't strong enough

1133
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,560
but after overcoming this hurdle

1134
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
we realized it wasn't that bad

1135
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,280
Super resilient

1136
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,560
We didn't even cry just now

1137
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:28,920
Right

1138
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,920
We've been through so many "murder cases"

1139
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,320
and still live in Apartment 11

1140
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,400
We're truly so tough

1141
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,280
So brave

1142
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,760
Are we qualified to join VIP

1143
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,800
membership?

1144
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,800
After hearing your story, you qualify

1145
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,680
So I'll give you our

1146
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,720
VIP card

1147
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,360
here you go

1148
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,760
This is the VIP card

1149
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,680
I only have three left now

1150
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,720
We have many new services here

1151
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,680
including foot sole wrinkle removal

1152
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,000
Foot sole V-line treatment

1153
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,440
and other new treatments

1154
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,120
You might want to consider them later

1155
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,800
Alright?

1156
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,360
Okay, thank you sis

1157
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,120
Sisters

1158
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,840
Let's wrap up

1159
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,040
Let's go to the next room

1160
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,680
Okay?

1161
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,720
Thank you

1162
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,880
Great work

1163
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,360
So how do we enter

1164
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,840
this VIP area?

1165
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,480
Find it yourself

1166
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,200
Self-discipline

1167
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,760
Wait a moment

1168
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,640
This card must be usable somewhere

1169
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,680
Look, there's a phrase here: "A drop of kindness"

1170
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,120
Look

1171
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,160
Do you see its color?

1172
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,960
Red, right?

1173
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,080
"A drop of kindness"

1174
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,920
Only these few words

1175
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,360
It's arranged vertically

1176
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,640
The colors are different

1177
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,280
"A drop of kindness"

1178
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,480
"A drop of kindness should be repaid with a spring"

1179
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,520
Wait a minute

1180
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:25,840
Is this...

1181
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,040
Could there be some kind of button?

1182
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,480
The Yongquan acupoint

1183
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,000
Yongquan (Gushing Spring)

1184
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,520
I think the foot is important

1185
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,920
What does this mean?

1186
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,360
Happy Home key

1187
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,280
Here, put it here

1188
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,400
Clanging sound

1189
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
It's open

1190
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:45,880
Open

1191
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,240
Let's go

1192
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,680
Go

1193
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,840
This is the Happy Home

1194
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,400
This is the real Happy Home

1195
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,560
The outside was just a facade

1196
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,640
Low-cost rest

1197
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,480
For workers with limited budgets

1198
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,520
To have a place to stay

1199
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,960
Message reply service

1200
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,800
For workers on vacation or off-duty

1201
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,840
To have no worries

1202
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,320
Shift replacement service

1203
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,480
They can cover shifts and reply to messages

1204
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,040
Meaning there are people here to do your work for you

1205
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,360
That's why they asked if we've worked long enough

1206
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,120
If we're strong enough

1207
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,960
If we're lonely enough

1208
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,080
For those workers who are

1209
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,800
Physically and mentally exhausted

1210
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,000
To provide a place to rest

1211
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,880
There's a note here left by someone.

1212
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,840
K-U-KU

1213
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,840
Work is so exhausting.

1214
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,880
After enduring one day and night, there's another day and night.

1215
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,680
Walking dogs, picking up kids, delivering food.

1216
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,080
Plus doing laundry deliveries.

1217
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,560
I feel like my boss's personal servant.

1218
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,320
K-U-KU

1219
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,640
Ke Wuku, you work here?

1220
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,400
Part-time job.

1221
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,560
This...

1222
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,680
No pain, no gain.

1223
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,080
Fu...

1224
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,760
That must be Deputy Manager Fu.

1225
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,040
There's also an Assistant Fu.

1226
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,840
This belongs to Hao the cleaner. Should we take it?

1227
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,920
Take it too.

1228
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,080
Because he's also a suspect.

1229
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,240
Good people get good rewards.

1230
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:57,520
That's all.

1231
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,200
Okay, that's about it.

1232
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,240
Let's search and see if there's anything.

1233
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,920
There's a card swipe spot here

1234
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,280
Didn't we just get a card?

1235
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,120
Try it

1236
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,080
There's a door opening sound over there

1237
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
That glass panel is a door

1238
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,280
It's open

1239
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,880
Wait for me a moment

1240
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,280
Hold on, bro

1241
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,160
Your brother already went in

1242
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,320
Let's go, move inside

1243
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,000
Wait a second

1244
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,680
Who's in front of me?

1245
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,360
Me

1246
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,280
Who's ahead of me?

1247
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,000
Come down

1248
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,240
I'm here

1249
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,840
Get down

1250
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,560
I'll reach out my hand

1251
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,200
Someone grab me

1252
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,880
I've got you

1253
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,240
Okay

1254
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,160
Thanks

1255
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,520
What's this?

1256
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,120
This is grass

1257
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,400
Come on

1258
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,040
Hurry up

1259
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,800
Who?

1260
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
There's a threshold by the steps

1261
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,240
Who is this?

1262
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,880
It's me

1263
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,800
Here, want to hold onto me?

1264
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,480
Doesn't matter

1265
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,440
Grab my clothes

1266
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,640
Steps here

1267
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:00,960
Watch out

1268
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,360
You guys are really...

1269
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,760
It's pitch black in here

1270
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,480
My brothers

1271
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,160
Someone's here

1272
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,760
Grab him

1273
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,280
Got him

1274
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:23,880
Pin him down

1275
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,200
Kick him

1276
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,280
Caught him

1277
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,000
Who's this?

1278
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,560
That's me

1279
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,800
I caught someone

1280
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,880
Okay, you hold him

1281
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,000
Got him

1282
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,360
Hold him

1283
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,720
Here

1284
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,640
Stop making noise

1285
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,200
Don't you know this is a sleeping area?

1286
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,320
Can we sleep too?

1287
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,760
Look for a light

1288
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,320
In my hand right now

1289
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,480
This is the person we just caught

1290
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,240
Someone take him

1291
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:47,960
Who's this?

1292
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,440
I've got him

1293
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,320
Let me see

1294
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,280
Is there anything we can...

1295
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,920
Let me go

1296
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,160
So fake

1297
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,240
Stop making those sounds

1298
00:40:59,240 --> 00:40:59,640
Okay?

1299
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,360
Thanks, man

1300
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,040
Can you last long enough?

1301
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,680
Will you hold out?

1302
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,400
No

1303
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,120
Why is he still panting?

1304
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,840
He keeps panting aggressively

1305
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,360
Don't laugh

1306
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,200
I'm telling you, don't laugh

1307
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,840
Why are there so many celebrities?

1308
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,000
Wait, what are you?

1309
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,480
He's Xu Zhongjie

1310
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,520
Isn't this supposed to be their happy home?

1311
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,720
Why does it look like a dormitory?

1312
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,120
No

1313
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,760
These managers

1314
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,000
Why do they have to deal with some elderly men

1315
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,200
Because they are...

1316
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,840
They are very

1317
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,920
quieter

1318
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,760
Look at the wall

1319
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,840
Look at the wall

1320
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,360
Okay

1321
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,520
Keep quiet

1322
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:09,880
Keep quiet

1323
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,760
Sleep well

1324
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,480
There's also a card here

1325
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:20,760
Useless

1326
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,640
Search everyone's beds

1327
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,880
See if there's that thing

1328
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,800
Deputy Manager Fu

1329
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,920
Check the "deceased's" bed

1330
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,920
This bed is so comfortable

1331
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,400
Tooth-achingly sweet (oops) chocolate

1332
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,640
What does "tooth-achingly sweet" mean?

1333
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,320
This is "oops"

1334
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,600
This is the chocolate I made

1335
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,760
Do you know Sister Cai?

1336
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,440
Yes, I do

1337
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,280
Who is she?

1338
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,000
Sister Cai

1339
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,040
She's a very good friend of mine

1340
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,680
She buys my chocolate from me

1341
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,320
She really loves eating it

1342
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,240
We have a great relationship

1343
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,200
So her dentures were actually

1344
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,520
ruined from eating this

1345
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,120
From eating his

1346
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,040
How could you give chocolate to an elderly person?

1347
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,560
She loves eating it

1348
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,840
But her health can't handle it

1349
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,720
Nothing at all?

1350
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,800
Is there nothing on Deputy Manager Fu's bed?

1351
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:34,800
No.

1352
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,480
There's nothing on Hao the cleaner's bed either.

1353
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:45,880
Old man

1354
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,120
Can you sleep?

1355
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,720
Ignoring me, old man?

1356
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,320
Old man, show us the way

1357
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,240
What should we do now?

1358
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,400
Alright, old man

1359
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:00,880
Give him a massage

1360
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,960
Brush him down

1361
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,840
No, his back can't take it

1362
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,280
What is this thing?

1363
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:07,880
Take it

1364
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,840
Isn't this my sister-in-law?

1365
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,880
To protect your safety

1366
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,480
I will use my whole life

1367
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,960
to guard your safety

1368
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,840
Protecting your safety

1369
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,640
Who is that?

1370
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,400
This is your brother

1371
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,400
No

1372
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:26,960
He's not your brother

1373
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,080
Why is he protecting your safety?

1374
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,200
How would I know?

1375
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:29,760
Ask him

1376
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,600
Pick him up

1377
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,120
Phone

1378
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,920
Near his head

1379
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,560
Turn him over

1380
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,800
Okay, check your phone.

1381
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,680
What's the matter, Manager Fu?

1382
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,280
Where is he?

1383
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,320
He should be on the 7th floor now.

1384
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,240
The "Perfect Family" game.

1385
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,480
Playing some detective game.

1386
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,080
Still solving cases.

1387
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,680
Let me tell you something.

1388
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,920
Don't think just because he can solve cases.

1389
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,760
that he wouldn't commit crimes.

1390
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,920
Now about General Manager Zong's "death".

1391
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,320
I think someone did this intentionally.

1392
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,120
It could only be you or Ku.

1393
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,040
I will investigate this thoroughly.

1394
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,200
No.

1395
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,640
Wait.

1396
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,160
Damn it, Ku.

1397
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:20,480
We're done for.

1398
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,600
Still hiding things.

1399
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,000
Ku.

1400
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:22,760
Bring him to justice.

1401
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,240
Said we'd investigate him and his sister.

1402
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,520
Then Manager Fu "died".

1403
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,320
So he's a suspect today.

1404
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,160
His sister is also a suspect.

1405
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,520
But

1406
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,960
he also said he would protect them both

1407
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,080
he might also "kill"

1408
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,080
because to protect them both

1409
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,720
Right

1410
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,720
Are you there?

1411
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,480
This is Xiao He.

1412
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,960
Do you currently have

1413
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
any suspects?

1414
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,000
I can help you

1415
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,840
look for them first.

1416
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,240
Let me see.

1417
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,960
Our current suspects are:

1418
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,240
Hao the Cleaner,

1419
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,520
Xu the Agent,

1420
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,000
and Deputy Manager Shen.

1421
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,320
Also the boss of Fei Maotui,

1422
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,040
and one more suspect

1423
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,920
we've already detained.

1424
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,800
We'll take him to "execution ground" soon.

1425
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,360
Straight to execution.

1426
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,200
Later we'll directly

1427
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,440
Who is it?

1428
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:08,800
Me.

1429
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,280
Ke Wuku.

1430
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,320
Then how about you three

1431
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,120
go to Ke Wuku's room?

1432
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,640
Who?

1433
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,640
Will you go to Ke Wuku's room?

1434
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,440
I don't mind.

1435
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:16,920
Either way.

1436
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,800
Okay, good luck.

1437
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,680
I'll go with you.

1438
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,320
Let's go.

1439
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,280
Then the three of us

1440
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,160
Okay.

1441
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,800
My house key

1442
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,200
is under the doormat.

1443
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,000
Under the doormat.

1444
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,920
*sinister laugh* With me here,

1445
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,200
putting everything together

1446
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,480
just to find you.

1447
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,920
Why did you set it so high?

1448
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,160
What are you talking about?

1449
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,640
He's Zhou Keke.

1450
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,640
Right.

1451
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,360
Sorry.

1452
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,240
So what should we do now?

1453
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
This should be

1454
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,400
the key to opening some place.

1455
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,000
I think it might be this cabinet

1456
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,400
There's space behind it, I think

1457
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,160
There must be some mechanism

1458
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,040
I'm sorry

1459
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,400
In this basin

1460
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,320
Open the door

1461
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:35,920
Open the door

1462
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,840
The moment to witness a miracle

1463
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,000
Here

1464
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,640
This should be a substitute workplace.

1465
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,680
No

1466
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,160
There's "bloodstains" in this fridge

1467
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,440
Alright, let's split up and search one by one.

1468
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,120
Let's check the computer first.

1469
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:25,680
Check the computer first.

1470
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,560
Then I'll search the cabinet.

1471
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,360
You check the computer.

1472
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,040
I'll look at the computer.

1473
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,960
Do you want to come take a look first?

1474
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,560
at these things?

1475
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,160
Authentic tea, real fruit - "Meet You with Pomelo"

1476
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,560
Remember our "Meet You with Pomelo" promise

1477
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:48,480
Wait a moment

1478
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,480
Does this picture look wrong to you?

1479
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,000
How many hands?

1480
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,400
Six

1481
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:51,720
Six

1482
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,200
Six

1483
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,240
Does that mean it's the six of us?

1484
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,280
When you jumped down

1485
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,560
At the moment you jumped

1486
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,920
what were you thinking?

1487
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,800
Is anyone there?

1488
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,320
The apartment

1489
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,960
This is where he fell from

1490
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,280
That day he "died" right here

1491
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,000
That means...

1492
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,160
Are you her son?

1493
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,400
No, she's my sister-in-law.

1494
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,320
Fu Fu and your sister-in-law are a couple.

1495
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,240
This is my brother.

1496
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,240
What's your brother's name?

1497
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,480
My brother's name is

1498
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:29,920
Ke Wu Ku.

1499
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:38,560
I'm here.

1500
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,480
You see,

1501
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,760
my greatest regret

1502
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,880
is that when you were seriously ill,

1503
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,920
I couldn't even take half a day off

1504
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,920
to be with you.

1505
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,560
All my regular customers know

1506
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,880
this is why I opened Happy Hometown.

1507
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,360
But what they don't know is

1508
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,000
that you, my beloved,

1509
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,480
were actually crushed by work.

1510
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,520
After two days of emergency care at the hospital,

1511
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,800
we still couldn't save you.

1512
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,920
I hope

1513
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,280
no other worker will suffer like you did.

1514
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,560
This was probably posted by a woman.

1515
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,600
Yes, it's Fei'er.

1516
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,040
His sister-in-law.

1517
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,720
was crushed by work.

1518
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,240
He's here.

1519
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,120
Deputy Manager Shen.

1520
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,640
Let me put an end to all this.

1521
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,840
This is the device that hit him.

1522
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,360
He circled a screw.

1523
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,160
To make it fall.

1524
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:22,800
Custom-made.

1525
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,040
Do not loosen this screw.

1526
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,600
Or the doll will fall within ten minutes.

1527
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,640
Sister Cai.

1528
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,520
Female, 72 years old.

1529
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,240
Large eyes.

1530
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,440
Fair skin, elegant demeanor.

1531
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,120
Loves chocolate.

1532
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,240
Last seen wearing a white undershirt.

1533
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,120
Caramel-colored coat.

1534
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,120
May 24th.

1535
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,080
Dressed up nicely.

1536
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,280
Left home and hasn't returned since.

1537
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:41,600
Keep this for now.

1538
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,240
Let's keep this one first.

1539
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,520
Let's take things one by one.

1540
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,080
Now we have multiple clues coming at once.

1541
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,000
Let's examine them bit by bit first.

1542
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,480
Backstage password.

1543
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,200
Find a password.

1544
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:52,760
Can't Live Without You.

1545
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,960
That anniversary.

1546
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:54,840
No.

1547
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,880
20140214.

1548
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,640
April order records

1549
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,280
April 29th

1550
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:04,960
You found April 29th

1551
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,960
Order placed on the 29th

1552
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,760
Deputy Manager Shen said

1553
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,280
Help me reply to messages for two hours

1554
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,440
The reply period is

1555
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,080
tonight from

1556
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,680
10 PM to 12 AM

1557
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,920
Foot bath parlor shift coverage service

1558
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,400
Deleted

1559
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:19,800
Deleted

1560
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,360
And now this tablet

1561
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:25,920
hasn't been checked yet

1562
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,440
The problem is

1563
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:26,920
checking the tablet

1564
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,720
There's a lot of stuff on the tablet

1565
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,640
Looking at WeChat, right?

1566
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,640
Deputy Manager Fu

1567
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,200
The one who wears glasses

1568
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:31,680
"The deceased"

1569
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,720
June 24, 2022

1570
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,120
Which is today, right?

1571
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:36,600
Today

1572
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,200
12:30 PM

1573
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,000
Is anyone in the office?

1574
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,960
Then at 12:30

1575
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,320
the elevator malfunctioned

1576
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,400
I'm stuck inside with no signal

1577
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,480
Is anyone in the office?

1578
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,560
He was trapped inside

1579
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,200
Who's inside?

1580
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:46,880
Deputy Manager Fu

1581
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,400
He sent this here

1582
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:50,800
I know

1583
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,040
Someone sent this on his behalf

1584
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,200
Someone sent it for him

1585
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,440
Exactly what we suspected

1586
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:54,800
Right

1587
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,160
This is what we found in his office

1588
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,240
on his computer

1589
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:58,720
Yes

1590
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,560
I think everything about him

1591
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,320
was to fake the crime timeline

1592
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,560
Understood

1593
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,440
We're on the fourth floor

1594
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,840
The one with the carpet

1595
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,680
406

1596
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:20,600
Here

1597
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:20,960
Okay

1598
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,840
Should we grab an umbrella as a weapon?

1599
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,600
Right, why are there three umbrellas here?

1600
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:28,960
Right?

1601
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,280
Maybe it's going to rain inside his room

1602
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,240
Here's what we'll do with the umbrellas

1603
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,160
First, let's untie this

1604
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,120
Get ready

1605
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,520
Opening umbrellas indoors stunts your growth

1606
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,280
The two of us

1607
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,960
I think I'm pretty much done growing

1608
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
I can still struggle a bit more

1609
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:44,800
Come out

1610
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,840
Why is there a black and white one here?

1611
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:02,440
This

1612
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,480
This is him

1613
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,560
So his sister is his

1614
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,120
This is his

1615
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,160
brother

1616
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,680
This is his brother-in-law

1617
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,200
This is his sister

1618
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:15,560
His brother

1619
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:15,880
Right

1620
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:16,840
He

1621
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,520
It's his brother and sister-in-law

1622
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,360
There's writing on the back of the photo

1623
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:31,960
Brother Ku

1624
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,800
Those who exploit you to the point of "spitting blood"

1625
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,400
should all pay the price

1626
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:36,800
So what does it mean?

1627
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,680
Was his brother also a "corporate slave"?

1628
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,120
And then worked himself to "death"?

1629
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:39,960
Brother Ku

1630
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,840
Have you noticed

1631
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,920
that all these posters in Ku's room

1632
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,800
are almost all side profiles or back views?

1633
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,280
He must also be someone

1634
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,480
with an extremely lonely heart

1635
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,440
Is there anything else here?

1636
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,120
What's written on this? What does it say on the back?

1637
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,160
Is there anything in these cardboard boxes?

1638
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:09,720
What do you think?

1639
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,000
Possibly

1640
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,040
So this is what the umbrella is for

1641
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,760
I found it

1642
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,480
Is this what we're supposed to take?

1643
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,160
There's nothing here

1644
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,320
Wait, there's still

1645
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,480
"The Qiao Family's Descendants"

1646
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,920
Name: Ke Wuku

1647
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,160
Occupation: Actor

1648
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,080
Plays Qiao N's grandson

1649
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,240
Is he your family's child?

1650
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:34,840
No

1651
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,200
Brother Ku, I'll listen to you

1652
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,400
I've said goodbye to being a "corporate slave"

1653
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:41,880
What does this mean?

1654
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,320
Shocking

1655
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,640
Supporting actor actually more handsome than lead

1656
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,480
Wonder how the lead actor feels about this

1657
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,480
Isn't the lead actor just...

1658
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,320
Him

1659
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,360
So after being secretly photographed

1660
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,920
He finally doesn't have to be a "corporate slave" anymore

1661
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,000
Meaning he's debuted

1662
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,360
Right

1663
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,160
Singing and dancing debut certificate

1664
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,560
Mr. Ke Wuku

1665
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,080
Mentored by

1666
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,440
Mentored by famous singer Zhou Qian

1667
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:00,800
Zhou Qian

1668
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,800
Excellent at both singing and dancing

1669
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,400
Zhou Qian

1670
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,720
Zhou Qian dances so poorly

1671
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,880
But Ke Wuku kept telling us

1672
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,400
He is a

1673
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,520
Do-whatever-he-wants

1674
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,280
Freelancer

1675
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,880
Take a look, Brother Bai

1676
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,480
This is from your film crew

1677
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,160
He was just an extra

1678
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,200
Started as your supporting actor

1679
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,320
Now he's debuted as a singer-dancer

1680
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,160
Well

1681
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:17,800
Okay

1682
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,040
He's got so much stuff

1683
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:21,720
To be honest

1684
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,720
This is my first time at his place

1685
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:25,760
Yeah

1686
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,000
Let's see what else there is

1687
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:37,680
Phone

1688
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:42,880
Photo

1689
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,440
Has

1690
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,680
Giant cat plush assembly diagram

1691
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,000
He has the design blueprint for that

1692
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,800
There's writing at the bottom

1693
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,080
Custom-made plush

1694
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,480
Do not loosen

1695
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,480
This nail

1696
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,520
Or the plush will within ten minutes

1697
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,440
The timeline is clear now

1698
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,600
What kind of picture is that above?

1699
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,160
Wedding

1700
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:58,960
Wedding photo

1701
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,880
And a little flower girl

1702
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,520
Is it just the three of them?

1703
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,120
They're not a family of three

1704
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,200
Anyway this wedding photo

1705
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:07,760
One flower child

1706
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,040
That should be quite crucial

1707
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,200
That person should be

1708
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,240
the one who possesses this doll assembly diagram

1709
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,400
Don't think just because you've joined

1710
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,600
the "Bai Song Guo Zhou Liu Ku" detective team

1711
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,640
that makes you incredibly cool

1712
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,280
You can solve cases

1713
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,800
but you can also commit crimes

1714
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,280
I've discovered General Manager Zong's "death"

1715
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,760
was deliberately fabricated by someone

1716
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,520
It could only be you or Boss Fei

1717
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,160
I'm warning you

1718
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,800
I will investigate this to the very end

1719
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,160
Let's search for this again

1720
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:47,560
clue

1721
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,040
There's a computer here, guys

1722
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,040
Nothing here

1723
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,560
Why is there a handsome photo?

1724
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,280
Recycle Bin

1725
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,000
He deleted a surveillance video

1726
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,520
Kewuku

1727
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,160
He's definitely hiding something from us

1728
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:15,880
There's something wrong with him

1729
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:17,880
What's wrong?

1730
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,640
My stomach hurts

1731
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,200
You seem to be stalling for time

1732
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,600
Don't assume just because he solves cases

1733
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,680
that he wouldn't commit crimes

1734
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,920
Speaking of investigating him and his sister

1735
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,040
then Deputy Manager Fu "died"

1736
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,080
Brother Ku, those who exploit you to the point of making you cough blood

1737
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,800
should all pay the price

1738
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,440
Today is June 24, 2022

1739
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,480
Deputy Manager Fu "died" in the elevator

1740
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,320
Deputy Manager Fu "died"—there's something fishy about it

1741
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,000
Old Fu "died" in an elevator accident

1742
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,440
It has nothing to do with me!

1743
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,240
I don’t believe it

1744
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,680
That event you organized

1745
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,280
The equipment crushed and "killed" your General Manager Zong

1746
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,440
Whoever went up to the rooftop

1747
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,160
is very likely the "killer"

1748
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,560
In your office fridge

1749
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,360
we found a pool of "blood"

1750
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,400
Why is there a pool of "blood"?

1751
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,560
I "killed" him

1752
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,680
So he’s the one who "caused my brother’s death"

1753
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,400
I’ve always wanted to avenge my brother

1754
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,680
You’re dodging the main point

1755
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,720
Because you "got rid of" General Manager Zong

1756
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,320
It’s open

1757
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,320
There’s another space inside

1758
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,720
No

1759
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,480
Brother Bai

1760
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,360
Brother Bai

1761
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,880
He turned off the lights

1762
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,000
Old Bai locked us in

1763
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,440
