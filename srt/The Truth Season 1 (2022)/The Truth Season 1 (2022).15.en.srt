1
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,760
Deputy Manager Fu is "dead"

2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,600
Let's go to the property management office

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,400
You drove us to "death"

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,440
Don't think you'll get away with this

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,880
Agent Xu is the prime suspect

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,920
Your brother also had a motive to "kill"

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,360
These two people

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,440
Had the most intense conflict

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,800
This is the real happy home

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,920
General Manager Zong's "death"

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,800
Could only have been you or Boss Fei

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,880
He deleted a surveillance video

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,720
He's suspicious

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,600
Let's summarize what happened

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,560
Today is

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,720
June 24, 2022

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,440
We discovered

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,560
inside the elevator

19
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,680
there was a "corpse"

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,640
Deputy Manager Fu

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,840
"died" inside the elevator

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,840
We discovered the property management office

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,200
Xu the Agent

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,440
Deputy Manager Shen

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,080
Hao the Cleaner

26
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,960
and Deputy Manager Fu

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,440
There were some grudges between them

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,440
They also went there on the evening of the 23rd

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,560
Last night they were all at the same place

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,640
They had a team-building event

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,280
They all visited one particular place together

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,560
called B129 Happy Homeland

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,080
Inside there

34
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,040
we discovered an even bigger secret

35
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,200
That our Kewuku and Boss Fei

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,080
seem to have some kind of grudge

37
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,160
with Deputy Manager Fu

38
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,120
conflicts

39
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,200
The relationships are quite complicated

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,000
Today we essentially have

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,680
five suspects

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,320
Kewuku

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,520
Boss Fei

44
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,240
Xu the Agent

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,800
Deputy Manager Shen

46
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,040
and Hao the Cleaner

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,280
Five suspects

48
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,600
During today's questioning process

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,720
we want to find out

50
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,200
where the primary crime scene is

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,920
and each person's

52
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,280
final timeline

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,240
Another thing is

54
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,960
the truth about General Manager Zong's "death"

55
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,200
It's highly likely to be related

56
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,960
to Deputy Manager Fu

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,640
Our Deputy Manager Shen has arrived

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
The deputy manager is here

59
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,680
Greetings, respected residents

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,840
Our slogan is

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,120
100% occupancy rate

62
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,480
100% satisfaction rate

63
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,000
100% sense of security

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,080
100% cleanliness standard

65
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,080
The sense of security is truly substantial

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,200
We've achieved none of these

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,600
It's my honor to chat with you all

68
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,440
May I sit down now?

69
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,240
Absolutely

70
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,560
Please have a seat

71
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,080
Thank you so much

72
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,440
How did he...

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,640
come back from another era?

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,680
This is how he greets people

75
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,560
Do you have any questions for me?

76
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,440
Feel free to ask anything.

77
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,280
We all know

78
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,160
you have elderly parents to care for

79
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,240
and young children to raise

80
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,120
with tremendous pressure

81
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,840
and desperately need this job

82
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
You're being too considerate of me

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,080
Moreover, we know that on April 30th

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,720
at the event you organized

85
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,160
"Plum Blossom Rhymes"

86
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,040
a major incident occurred

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,720
equipment fatally crushed your

88
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,640
General Manager Zong

89
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,320
Do you suspect me of something?

90
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,360
This is such an injustice against me

91
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,400
In fact, because of this incident

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,880
I got fired from our company

93
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,120
Today is actually my last day at work

94
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,840
I was indeed in charge of that event

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,760
But this accident

96
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,400
has absolutely nothing to do with me

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,800
After receiving the event assignment on the 28th

98
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,240
I took the workers that same day

99
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,040
up to the rooftop

100
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,560
to install that giant installation

101
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,760
I supervised them

102
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,840
tightening every single screw

103
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,880
How could it possibly fall?

104
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,120
I was so exhausted that day my cervical spondylosis flared up

105
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,040
So I had to go to the foot massage parlor

106
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,480
to rest and relax a bit

107
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,480
But normally

108
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480
when it doesn't affect work

109
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,360
that's when I would purchase those services

110
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,200
Oh come off it!

111
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,560
You go there every day

112
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,960
It's like your second home

113
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,240
We've all seen your little card

114
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,080
stamped full of marks

115
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,640
That card

116
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,600
On the evening of April 29th

117
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,200
at 10 PM

118
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,600
why did you hire a message proxy?

119
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,680
April order records

120
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,320
April 29th

121
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,000
Look at April 29th

122
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Order on the 29th

123
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,800
Assistant Manager Shen said:

124
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,320
"Help me reply to messages for two hours"

125
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,480
Proxy reply time:

126
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,120
tonight

127
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,000
from 10 PM to midnight

128
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,600
That day I was

129
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,640
working overtime continuously

130
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,400
I was just too exhausted

131
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,360
and wanted to take a break

132
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,800
General Manager Zong

133
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,960
You probably don't like him much,

134
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,600
because usually

135
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,080
he's always exploiting you, right?

136
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,760
But as you said,

137
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,240
I have elderly parents and young children

138
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,080
Life isn't easy

139
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,840
Showing loyalty to General Manager Zong

140
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,640
work enthusiasm

141
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,560
and demonstrating the right attitude

142
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,160
is my only chance for promotion

143
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,040
Maintain enthusiasm

144
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,080
So you didn't want to "kill" them

145
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,160
Doesn't it make you angry?

146
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,120
He bullies you like this every day

147
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
You're really scaring me

148
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,880
I...

149
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,080
His "death" has nothing to do with me

150
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,200
Don't wrongfully accuse me

151
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,640
I saw a design blueprint

152
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,360
that only you possess

153
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,360
You're not going to say that's

154
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,280
the installation diagram for the giant device

155
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
Yes, exactly - that big cat

156
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,200
Where did you find it?

157
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,480
Where do you think we should look for it?

158
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,200
Why are you so nervous?

159
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,320
This blueprint is our company's internal document

160
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,840
I lost it before

161
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,040
You lost it?

162
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,920
This is also within our company

163
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,120
It's against regulations

164
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,840
I have another job to go to later

165
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,560
I have another job to go to later

166
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,520
Everyone, please don't talk about this

167
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,640
The blueprint states

168
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,080
This cat

169
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,680
If any part is triggered

170
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,120
After ten minutes

171
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,320
The cat will automatically fall down

172
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,440
Whoever goes to the rooftop

173
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,320
Is very likely

174
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,560
To be the one who "killed" General Manager Zong

175
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,280
Such a "murderer"

176
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,840
I used to suspect that it was

177
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,800
my competitor

178
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,960
Deputy Manager Fu

179
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,720
After all, he wasn't working that day

180
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
yet showed up at the event site

181
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,640
Do you usually get along with Deputy Manager Fu?

182
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,360
Actually, I misunderstood him before

183
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,320
I investigated afterwards

184
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,440
Old Fu went to the rooftop during the event

185
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,640
because he saw I was exhausted

186
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,560
and came to check on my work progress

187
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,040
Moreover, my wife told me

188
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,560
he had visited my home looking for me

189
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,760
saying he wanted to recommend me for a new job

190
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,400
Plus he previously gave me

191
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,320
a Happy Hometown membership card

192
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,920
so I could go relax

193
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,000
I've long held no resentment toward him

194
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
He's just a kind-hearted old man

195
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
a gruff exterior but warm-hearted old man

196
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,120
Hao the janitor appears restrained

197
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,280
but actually harbors deep hatred for both of them

198
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,600
Then there's our pet groomer Xu

199
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,080
who said we must never let Zong and Fu

200
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,720
continue to exploit

201
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,360
The first day following the manager's orders

202
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,600
to prepare a 3000-page Plan A

203
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,720
Isn't this just toying with us?

204
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,240
You're missing the point

205
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,800
You said you and Deputy Manager Fu

206
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,360
just had a minor

207
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,800
disagreement

208
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,360
disagreement

209
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,960
But in fact, you even wrote a

210
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,840
Accident Liability Statement

211
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,280
Wait, the note got mixed up

212
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,960
Accident Liability Statement

213
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,040
Report him

214
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,960
And you specifically named names in it

215
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,080
You clearly stated

216
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,960
that Deputy Manager Fu framed you

217
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,800
by loosening the screws

218
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,960
You don't suspect

219
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,640
that I "killed" Deputy Manager Fu, do you?

220
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,760
It was definitely you - no doubt about it

221
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,560
Impossible

222
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,600
How could that be?

223
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,480
Old Fu

224
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,960
"died" in an elevator accident

225
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,360
It has nothing to do with me

226
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
We never said it was an elevator accident

227
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,920
I saw the messages in the group chat

228
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,400
This afternoon

229
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,360
I was having a farewell lunch with colleagues

230
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,800
When I saw the news

231
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,080
I rushed back immediately

232
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,160
Let's ask then

233
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,360
What time did you arrive at the company?

234
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,760
I clocked in at 8:30 this morning

235
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,320
Around 10 o'clock or so

236
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,040
I went to the office to clean up my workstation

237
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,360
Then I saw Lao Fu

238
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,120
He seemed to be at his workstation

239
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,360
You saw Lao Fu, right?

240
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,320
When you went to the office at 10

241
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,720
Yes, in the office

242
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,960
He was calling a teacher

243
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,720
Seemed to be talking about their child

244
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,960
At 11:30

245
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,040
I went with Xu the agent

246
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
and Xiao Bao

247
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,560
We went out for a farewell meal

248
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,880
Now we can speculate

249
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,440
Deputy Manager Fu

250
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,000
was probably "killed" before 12:30

251
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,880
(already "killed")

252
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,560
Yes, right

253
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,960
Just saw him at 10 o'clock

254
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,560
Then you didn't see him anymore

255
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,640
I didn't pay attention anymore

256
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,720
I was busy packing my things

257
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,640
and wasn't in a good mood

258
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,000
Right

259
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,400
Why quit that happy old haunt?

260
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,280
"Plum Blossom Serenade"

261
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,160
After this accident happened

262
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,480
I've been feeling quite unsettled

263
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,560
I was wondering if

264
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,480
I shouldn't go to that lounge anymore

265
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,520
Maybe things would get better

266
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,159
So I didn't really want to

267
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,240
go to Happy Homeland anymore

268
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,559
But after a month

269
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,280
you started going again

270
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,320
to Happy Homeland

271
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,440
You're talking about last night, right?

272
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,360
I was thinking

273
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,440
it was my last day at work

274
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,560
just wanted to go relax there

275
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,000
But why wasn't it just you?

276
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,360
You

277
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,520
Deputy Manager Fu

278
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,920
Hao the cleaner

279
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,520
and Xu

280
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,120
All four of you

281
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,880
went there last night, didn't you?

282
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm not sure about that

283
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
I just went there to relax

284
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,360
and fell asleep soon after

285
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
Dear respected residents,

286
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,640
Do you have any other questions?

287
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,800
Almost done

288
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,920
If anything comes up

289
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,800
feel free to call me anytime

290
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,880
Please wait a moment

291
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,560
I have a favor to ask

292
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,400
The property management company makes us work excessive overtime

293
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,920
We're often forced to work 24-hour shifts

294
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,760
I've checked the labor laws

295
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,480
Generally speaking

296
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,080
our daily work hours shouldn't exceed

297
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,640
eight hours

298
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,200
or 44 hours per week

299
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,600
Right

300
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,360
Yes, before you leave

301
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,280
could you please talk to the boss for us?

302
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,240
Ask him not to make us

303
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,600
work such brutal overtime

304
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,720
I'll have a serious talk with the boss before leaving

305
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,320
Thank you

306
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,640
We really appreciate it

307
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,840
Dear respected residents

308
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,320
Goodbye everyone

309
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,480
Next

310
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,160
Who would you like to question?

311
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,720
Hao the Janitor

312
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,880
I have a long-standing grudge against him

313
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,160
Alright, I'll call him over

314
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,040
Do YOU have a grudge against him

315
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,920
Or do YOU have a grudge against him?

316
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,640
No

317
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,120
Because last time we entered Hao's place

318
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,040
Hao the Janitor...

319
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,640
yelled at us

320
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,280
You know what?

321
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,920
Did you know there's a door here leading outside?

322
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
Why should I tell you?

323
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,640
Get out now!

324
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm the homeowner

325
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,360
Out!

326
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,960
No

327
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,200
This is my home

328
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
We were indeed in the wrong

329
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,640
Even though I was wrong

330
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,520
he shouldn't have yelled at the girl

331
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,600
What gives him the right?

332
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,200
What kind of logic is that?

333
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,240
You should sit there and interrogate yourself

334
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,880
Look at yourself

335
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,400
This just won't do

336
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,640
What if I "killed" someone?

337
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,680
Why are you yelling at me?

338
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,680
Why keep asking?

339
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,360
What's there to ask?

340
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,120
Our guy is here

341
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,960
Hot-tempered guy

342
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,640
What are you doing?

343
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,080
What are you doing all day?

344
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
What?

345
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,000
You entered this room

346
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,360
and still don't get it?

347
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,920
Deputy Manager Fu

348
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,160
Wasn't it you who "pressed" him to death?

349
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,880
Your brother pressed him to death

350
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,800
Your brother did it

351
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,640
Little bro, this has nothing to do with you.

352
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,440
It's those guys over there.

353
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,400
You can't be this protective of them.

354
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,920
He could easily get me locked up.

355
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,360
Listen to me.

356
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,920
You need to adjust your attitude.

357
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,720
What about you?

358
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,080
Others don't need to use this board.

359
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,360
But you must get this board ready for me.

360
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,200
You can't come out.

361
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,440
Right.

362
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,600
Hurry back.

363
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,360
You scared me to death.

364
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,680
No need.

365
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,000
I can control myself.

366
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,360
Does anyone have any questions?

367
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,680
Anyway, I trust my brother completely.

368
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,720
Little brother, why don't you come over?

369
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,160
We can sit together.

370
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,240
No need.

371
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,320
You take the seat.

372
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,040
There are limited chairs.

373
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,760
Here's the thing.

374
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,120
Well...

375
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,240
Why does he look so nervous to me?

376
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,000
Why would you be nervous looking at me?

377
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,480
Go ahead and ask.

378
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,080
Why are you more nervous than him?

379
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,040
Who's questioning whom here?

380
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,600
Today you...

381
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,840
Why did you today...

382
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,880
put us in that room?

383
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,520
The property management office.

384
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:00,960
What gives you the right...

385
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,440
to just let us in like that?

386
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,040
You can wait here in the property office.

387
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,920
I'll open the door for you.

388
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,640
Is it really this casual?

389
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,400
Indeed.

390
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,960
No, you were standing outside...

391
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,640
You wanted to go in...

392
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,760
I couldn't let you stand outside.

393
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,840
Plus, with my little brother here...

394
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,480
Right.

395
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,240
Ordinary people wouldn't let you in.

396
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,640
Thank you.

397
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,280
Thank you, brother.

398
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,720
Thanks, little brother.

399
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,600
Thank you, little brother.

400
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,080
Thanks.

401
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,360
No need for thanks.

402
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,160
This first question...

403
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,720
is just being polite with people.

404
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,640
Why are you being polite?

405
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,440
If you want to ask, just ask.

406
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,280
Don't...

407
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,560
He might stand up in a moment.

408
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,080
Wrong.

409
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,040
There's a small card box in your car.

410
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,840
Happy hometown.

411
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
You keep going there, don't you?

412
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,920
What's that place for?

413
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,040
You said you went there.

414
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,880
What do you think people do there?

415
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,000
They go for fun.

416
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,440
Definitely for pleasure.

417
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,600
Or to relax.

418
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,760
There's a video on your phone.

419
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,520
A recording of Deputy Manager Fu.

420
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,640
The content shows.

421
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,400
Him calling the boss.

422
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,520
Hello, boss.

423
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,400
I think that.

424
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,520
General Manager Zong's "death".

425
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,760
Is a bit suspicious.

426
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,680
I believe someone did it on purpose.

427
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,160
Are you nervous?

428
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,520
Because you "killed"
General Manager Zong

429
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,360
(earlier line completes the thought)

430
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,120
Why do you think I "killed" him?

431
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,760
Then why were you secretly recording him?

432
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,920
Actually, same as you

433
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,280
I also thought at the time

434
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,480
General Manager Zong's "death"

435
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,400
was suspicious

436
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,600
(emphasis on suspicious)

437
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,160
Then when I heard

438
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,280
some gossip about it

439
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,000
I figured I'd record it

440
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,680
Just out of curiosity

441
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,240
(emphasis on curiosity)

442
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,760
I've heard

443
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,200
that you and General Manager Zong

444
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,360
and Deputy Manager Fu

445
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,080
don't get along well

446
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,200
They seem to dislike you at first sight

447
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,720
Why?

448
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,280
Someone as adorable as me

449
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,560
with such a kind face

450
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,960
What's adorable about you?

451
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,680
Look

452
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
Your so-called "kind face"

453
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,040
You'd better show it to me

454
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,680
Between Deputy Manager Fu and Deputy Manager Shen

455
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,800
who do you get along with better?

456
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,840
Manager Shen

457
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,080
he's just

458
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,320
an overachiever

459
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,640
I don't interact much with him

460
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,240
As for Old Fu

461
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,280
At first I thought

462
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,080
he was a bootlicker

463
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,720
always following General Manager Zong around

464
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,800
Not a great guy

465
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,880
But later I realized

466
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,040
he's actually alright

467
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,640
He's harsh in speech but kind at heart

468
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,680
When General Manager Zong was alive

469
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,760
he always disliked me

470
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760
wouldn't let me or my car get close to him

471
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,160
He thought we smelled

472
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,080
so he kept us at a distance

473
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,400
General Manager

474
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,880
He stinks so bad

475
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,760
Keep him away from me

476
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,400
Okay

477
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,120
This deputy manager

478
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,960
acts like a bootlicker

479
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,600
just hovering around

480
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,160
shooing me away

481
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,120
Go away

482
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,760
Don't stay here

483
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,360
Later I heard him tell Teng the agent

484
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,480
Actually he's afraid of Manager Zong

485
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,400
would really get angry at me

486
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:00,960
and deduct my pay

487
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,120
And he follows Manager Zong around all day

488
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,960
actually just trying to keep him happy

489
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,280
When he's happy, he yells at us subordinates less

490
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,160
Easier

491
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,400
to get by

492
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,000
So I think

493
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,640
this person

494
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,600
really

495
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,880
isn't what he appears to be

496
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,920
He's actually quite decent

497
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,600
When General Manager Zong "died" that day,

498
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,160
were you at the crime scene?

499
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,280
I was.

500
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,840
I was responsible for cleaning the entire event venue.

501
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,200
Did you leave anything behind there?

502
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,040
Leave what?

503
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,400
Didn't you take photos?

504
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,320
I secretly recorded the conversation.

505
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,840
I took photos.

506
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,640
You secretly photographed his computer screen,

507
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,960
there's a photo

508
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,880
right next to that thing,

509
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,800
your handkerchief was found.

510
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,600
That was a screenshot from their computer.

511
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
What's the use of you being here now?

512
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,400
You mean that towel, right?

513
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:47,960
Yes.

514
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,240
Yes.

515
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,640
It's mine.

516
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,600
What does that prove?

517
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,880
Every one of you

518
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,920
has my towel.

519
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,720
Why did you photograph that?

520
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Don't you think

521
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,080
well, today Deputy Manager Fu

522
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,760
called the superiors,

523
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,640
and then he thought

524
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,720
someone else was behind this case,

525
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,600
and he discovered

526
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,760
you were at the crime scene

527
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,720
and left a towel behind.

528
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,160
So you developed "murderous intent,"

529
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,680
you thought

530
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,880
"Okay, he already knows my secret,"

531
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,840
so you decided to "eliminate" him.

532
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,880
You even left the door open for us,

533
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,720
letting your brother in

534
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,800
to act as the secondary "killer."

535
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,720
My logic is crystal clear.

536
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:20,680
Highlight.

537
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,240
Then let's close the case.

538
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,840
No, don't close it yet.

539
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,480
Alright

540
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,040
It seems

541
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,720
There's no hiding it anymore

542
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,360
President Zong's "death"

543
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,880
is indeed related to me

544
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,920
But

545
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,360
I really didn't mean to "kill" him

546
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,240
Here's what happened

547
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,840
I was originally

548
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,160
responsible for cleaning the venue that day

549
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,720
including the third floor

550
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,480
and that huge installation

551
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,920
But it wasn't until President Zong

552
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,880
was giving his speech on stage

553
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,480
that I remembered

554
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,360
I hadn't cleaned the third floor

555
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,920
So I rushed from the first floor to clean it

556
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,680
Who knew that thing was so unstable

557
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,520
When I put some force into it

558
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,440
it fell down

559
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,160
right onto President Zong's head

560
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,359
Did you touch some screws

561
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,200
or what happened?

562
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,520
After the screws came loose

563
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,400
ten minutes

564
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,440
it fell

565
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
I was just cleaning

566
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,200
How would I

567
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
know there were screws in that thing?

568
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,280
I had no idea about any screws

569
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,120
Meaning it might not have been you who pushed them down

570
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,880
You were just messing around there

571
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,480
It was already loose

572
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,440
It really wasn't me

573
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,680
So you went online to look up that information

574
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,080
About indirect "killing"

575
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,360
Negligent injury, "killing"

576
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,440
What time did you arrive at the company today?

577
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,600
At eight.

578
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,320
I arrived at eight.

579
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,640
Yes, I reached the office at eight.

580
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,280
After changing clothes,

581
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
I started cleaning.

582
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,280
When was the last time you saw Deputy Manager Fu?

583
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,160
When was it?

584
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,440
Around ten-something.

585
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,080
I think he was in the office.

586
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,160
I was putting away tools

587
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,040
and happened to see him.

588
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,840
I spotted him.

589
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,000
I heard him on the phone,

590
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,720
talking about his child.

591
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,440
About the child's matters.

592
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,640
Yes, discussing the child's affairs.

593
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,920
Probably calling the teacher.

594
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,440
Understood.

595
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,440
Little brother, you don't think...

596
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,280
that I "killed" him, do you?

597
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,400
Of course not, I trust you.

598
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,120
If you did "kill" him...

599
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,000
I'd go to prison for you.

600
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,480
If you insist...

601
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,400
then big bro will take the blame.

602
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,520
No no, just joking.

603
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,000
Just kidding.

604
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,080
It's fine, I'm going to work now.

605
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,720
It's alright, bro.

606
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,200
Go ahead and get busy, bro.

607
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,440
Trust me, bro.

608
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:36,760
Goodbye.

609
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,080
Trust me, bro.

610
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,800
Bye, big bro.

611
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,120
Okay, I trust you.

612
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,200
This way, Mr. Xu (the agent).

613
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,200
Brother Xu

614
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,680
Mr. Xu (the agent)

615
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,360
You're awake

616
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,440
I understand

617
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,520
Blowing a kiss

618
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,880
Blowing a kiss

619
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,800
Blowing a kiss

620
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,000
Why are we doing mime acts all of a sudden?

621
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,040
What do you want?

622
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,720
Speak up

623
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,440
Ask

624
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,360
Come on

625
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,840
Let's take it one by one, come on

626
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,320
Do you know what this is?

627
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,840
This is your weekly work report

628
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,520
This isn't mine

629
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,680
This isn't yours

630
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,520
This belongs to my senior colleague

631
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,000
Is this senior colleague...

632
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,760
the one who always cries?

633
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,360
Smart

634
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,280
Cry-bro

635
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:52,880
Right

636
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,640
Your collection

637
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,600
Photos left behind by your senior

638
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,320
One is a photo of his younger brother

639
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,480
The other is a photo of his lover

640
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,920
It's not that you wanted to protect them

641
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,280
Actually, it was your senior who wanted to protect them

642
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,560
Right?

643
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
No

644
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,560
I also want to protect them

645
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,760
Because my senior treated me very well

646
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,920
I regarded him as my own elder brother

647
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,440
So his younger brother

648
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,760
I also regard him as my own younger brother

649
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,080
His wife

650
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,920
What do you want to do?

651
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,280
Is just my sister-in-law

652
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,960
Just my sister-in-law

653
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,040
You should take good care of her

654
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,920
That's what it means

655
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,440
So after my "late" brother passed away

656
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,080
Have you

657
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,440
In what way

658
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,400
Taken care of the two of us?

659
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,720
Topping up your phones

660
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,960
Or getting data plans

661
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,160
I've been quietly doing all these for you

662
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,960
Since you're so determined to protect them

663
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,440
If someone wants to take them down

664
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,000
Then you'd have to step in, right?

665
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,240
In his phone

666
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,440
Isn't there also a video?

667
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,360
What's that about?

668
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,240
This video was recorded by you

669
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,080
Deputy Manager Fu

670
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,880
With this Boss Fei

671
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,080
Now regarding General Manager Zong's "death"

672
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,120
I think someone did it intentionally

673
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,160
It could only be you or Ku

674
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
I will definitely investigate this thoroughly

675
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,840
Is it because of this matter

676
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,640
That you developed "murderous intent"?

677
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,640
To be honest,

678
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,800
I did think about it.

679
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,160
Then what did you do?

680
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,880
I was a bit scared.

681
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,080
And then...

682
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,480
My original plan was,

683
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,080
if they dared to investigate further,

684
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,000
and it affected

685
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,240
my sister-in-law and younger brother's safety.

686
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,800
Safety.

687
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,680
I would take action.

688
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,680
Then let me ask you

689
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,440
Is it because you think

690
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,000
Fei and him

691
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,040
Actually loosened

692
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,200
The screws on that big statue

693
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,680
I don’t know what a "big statue" is

694
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,960
There’s also something like

695
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,600
A big statue

696
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,400
Big statue

697
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,880
I really don’t know about this

698
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,840
Because I wasn’t there that day

699
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,120
What were you doing?

700
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,240
I was meeting a client

701
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,000
Okay

702
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,400
Alright

703
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,440
Tell me about you and Brother Ku

704
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,880
Brother Ku took good care of me

705
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,600
Actually

706
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,120
When I first joined the company

707
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,960
He was actually quite handsome

708
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,280
Which part

709
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,840
Can't see it

710
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,480
I really can't tell

711
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
Because I'm not what I used to be

712
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,720
When I first came here a year ago

713
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,840
I was over 1.8 meters tall

714
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,680
That's a bit exaggerated

715
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,040
Life has worn me down

716
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,600
You're saying

717
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,920
I came here full of ambition

718
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,480
Where's that ambition now?

719
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
I'm stingy to the core

720
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,760
Let me tell you

721
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,200
Even my scalp is losing color now

722
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,040
Really

723
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,120
My health is in shambles

724
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,720
Look

725
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,600
I see it

726
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,600
It's all because of General Manager Zong

727
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,520
and Deputy Manager Fu

728
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,800
exploiting me

729
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,600
Years of exploitation

730
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,400
made me go bald

731
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,760
And what's more

732
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,520
My buddy Ku

733
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,920
had it really tough

734
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,360
Did you see

735
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,560
that work report of mine?

736
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,040
This is Ku's work report

737
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,320
These "bloodstains" on it

738
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,640
are from Ku vomiting blood

739
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,280
How did Ku end up "dying"?

740
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,080
From overwork and stress

741
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,880
He literally worked himself to death

742
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,600
Too exhausted

743
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,640
Just too exhausted

744
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,480
Pure exhaustion

745
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,800
This counts as an occupational injury

746
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,480
Ku was at work

747
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,040
at the workplace

748
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,280
due to work-related reasons

749
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,160
and then "passed away"

750
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,520
This is a classic case of occupational injury

751
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,000
Alright, I want to ask

752
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,960
who wrote these words?

753
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,760
Did you write this?

754
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,360
"Driving us to death"

755
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,280
You won't get away with this

756
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,880
One has "died"

757
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,680
You're next

758
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,920
I wrote it

759
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,560
When General Manager Zong left

760
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,200
I felt so satisfied

761
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,800
I believe bad people should get their comeuppance

762
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,560
And who is this "you"?

763
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,600
Deputy Manager Fu

764
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
You wanted him "dead" too

765
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,000
Of course I wanted him "dead"

766
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,240
And he really did "die"

767
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,640
But I want to tell you

768
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,840
I hope

769
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,880
about Deputy Manager Fu's "death"

770
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,640
I just once thought

771
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,840
once

772
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,000
why

773
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,840
Deputy Manager Fu was a good person

774
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,000
Brother Ku actually once

775
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,040
was almost fired by the company

776
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
At that critical moment

777
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,640
Deputy Manager Fu referred a big client to him

778
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,600
gave him his own private client

779
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,480
and that's how he stayed

780
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,880
Moreover, when I

781
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,080
first joined the company

782
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,720
I was in a very bad mental state

783
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,280
Deputy Manager Fu secured for me

784
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,800
an opportunity to recuperate at headquarters

785
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,520
So I'm very grateful

786
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,760
Also, I discovered

787
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,080
General Manager Zong's

788
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,120
accident report

789
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,160
Previously he threatened

790
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,440
my sister-in-law and younger brother

791
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,280
saying he had evidence

792
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,800
He said he would keep investigating

793
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,160
But yesterday

794
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,320
I found

795
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,120
he classified the accident as

796
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,000
"accidental death"

797
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,880
meaning he doesn't want to investigate anymore

798
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,320
Yes

799
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,600
He didn't blame my sister-in-law and brother

800
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,240
What time did you arrive at the company today?

801
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,040
I arrived at the company at 8:30.

802
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,520
At that time,

803
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,680
Deputy Manager Fu

804
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,920
and Deputy Manager Shen were already there.

805
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,600
Then at 10, I heard Deputy Manager Fu

806
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,400
make a phone call to his child's teacher.

807
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,080
At 11:30,

808
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,440
Xiaobao, the security guard downstairs,

809
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,680
said it was his birthday today

810
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,760
and invited us out for lunch.

811
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,280
What time did you finish eating?

812
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:17,640
We were halfway through the meal

813
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,520
when at 12:30,

814
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,800
we received

815
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,120
a distress message from Deputy Manager Fu

816
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,040
saying he was in danger in the elevator.

817
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,000
So we rushed back immediately.

818
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,040
We were in the underground mall at that time.

819
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
Why did you run when we met you?

820
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,760
Right,

821
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,960
I didn't run.

822
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,600
Let's go.

823
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,600
This is just how fast I walk

824
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,440
Walk again and let me see

825
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:39,840
Too fast

826
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,520
Walking swiftly like flying

827
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,760
I don't walk very fast in the dark

828
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,440
Got caught immediately

829
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:44,960
Right

830
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,280
Did I walk?

831
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,560
Did I walk in the dark?

832
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:47,960
You did

833
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,040
"Wriggling"

834
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,520
Then I really don't know

835
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,120
Because I was asleep

836
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,760
I fell asleep afterwards

837
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,280
And I have severe sleepwalking

838
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,440
Then I had a dream

839
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,120
I dreamed I came to a wax museum

840
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,120
I saw many celebrities

841
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,800
Like that Song Zuer

842
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,720
The one that looked kinda ugly

843
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,640
That means it was made realistically

844
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,240
Very realistic

845
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,320
Made very realistically

846
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,000
You really... you...

847
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,360
You...

848
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,880
Speechless

849
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,040
He doesn't even have hair anymore

850
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,880
Spare his life

851
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,720
When was the last time you saw Deputy Manager Fu?

852
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,720
Ten o'clock.

853
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,240
Ten o'clock.

854
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,360
All at ten o'clock.

855
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,960
All at ten o'clock.

856
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,200
Who do you think usually had the most conflicts with Deputy Manager Fu?

857
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,400
The deepest grudges?

858
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:29,960
I don't know.

859
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,440
But Hao the cleaner told me...

860
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,480
he "died" in an elevator accident.

861
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,040
Well said.

862
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,080
You're next.

863
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,160
Watch your back.

864
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,120
I'll never take the elevator again.

865
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,920
From now on, I'll only use the stairs.

866
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,840
Last week, a girl...

867
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,640
"died" falling down the stairs.

868
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,120
Let me tell you...

869
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,480
I'll work on the first floor from now on.

870
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,600
My office is moving to the first floor tomorrow.

871
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,840
And someone "died" washing their hands.

872
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,280
Someone "died" using the toilet.

873
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,160
When this room rotates...

874
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,320
fifteen "killers" appear over there.

875
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,560
and start stabbing you.

876
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,160
But if the room rotates back, it's safe again.

877
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,480
Where are we? Say it.

878
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,440
We're in...

879
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,680
the place where accidents happen.

880
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,240
Accident Apartments.

881
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,040
Yes, it's all true.

882
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,240
Have you ever ghostwritten chats?

883
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,680
No, I never ghostwrite.

884
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,720
I always chat personally.

885
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,480
Understood.

886
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,680
No one else can replicate my style.

887
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,800
What do you think of Sister Fei?

888
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,840
Could she have "killed" President Zong?

889
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Sister Fei would never do that.

890
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,880
Why?

891
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,800
Because she has to take care of her younger brother.

892
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,760
I don't think she would...

893
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,080
...kill someone she hates.

894
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,480
She has responsibilities holding her back.

895
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,880
So you killed for her instead?

896
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,520
You could protect them...

897
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,560
...and eliminate all their problems.

898
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,200
I have a wife and kids too.

899
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,720
Do you?

900
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
I will someday.

901
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,320
You...

902
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,720
It's definitely him.

903
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,520
Bring the executioner's blade.

904
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,160
The main thing is he sleepwalks, you know?

905
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,880
You just killed someone...

906
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
...without even realizing it.

907
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,320
Impossible.

908
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,880
I don't know.

909
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,280
I truly didn't know.

910
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,120
I'm innocent.

911
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,520
Someone like you? Hard to believe.

912
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
He's just spouting nonsense.

913
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,960
"Death penalty" then.

914
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,960
I'm tired.

915
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,320
Put the wig on and take him away.

916
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,200
I'm really innocent!

917
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,520
Thank you.

918
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,560
What are you doing now?

919
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,040
Taking a nap.

920
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,080
I'm going to Happy Homeland.

921
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,440
Sorry.

922
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:08,960
Goodbye.

923
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,160
I really

924
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,760
Why does my brother have a friend like this?

925
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,400
You don't want to admit it, do you?

926
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:15,920
Really

927
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,920
Anyway, currently I feel

928
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,360
Out of these three

929
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,240
He's still the most suspicious one

930
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,400
Boss Fei is here.

931
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,520
Boss.

932
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,160
Please have a seat.

933
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,240
Take the honored seat.

934
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,480
What's with this grand setup?

935
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,040
It's okay, don't be nervous.

936
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,280
We're all friends here.

937
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,160
Alright, boss.

938
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,000
The masseuse is here.

939
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,200
Don't.

940
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,720
Full assault.

941
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
Begin the full assault now.

942
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,200
Then check if she's sleeping well.

943
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,040
Which of our six masseuses would you like?

944
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,080
Stop.

945
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,120
They're good people.

946
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,240
Sis, they're good people.

947
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,160
Is she your sister-in-law or your sister?

948
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,040
She's my sister-in-law.

949
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,800
But I usually call her sis.

950
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,160
Alright then, sister-in-law.

951
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
I have some questions for you.

952
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,720
Okay.

953
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,600
Because we later used some methods

954
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,160
to locate your office.

955
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,600
And discovered your husband

956
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,320
"died" from work exhaustion.

957
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,960
Yes.

958
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,800
So that's why

959
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,000
you opened this "Happy Home"

960
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,360
kind of studio?

961
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,040
Because I used to be

962
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,640
a programmer at a big tech company.

963
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,560
So I've experienced

964
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,920
the constant overtime work too.

965
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,360
And because my husband

966
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,000
had his accident while working,

967
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,360
so

968
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,040
Old Fu helped me apply for compensation.

969
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,800
When my husband was alive,

970
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,200
his favorite thing was

971
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,960
foot baths and massages.

972
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,600
So I

973
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,720
opened this foot massage shop

974
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,360
hoping that

975
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,640
workers like my husband

976
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,120
under their high-pressure jobs

977
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,880
can have a place to catch their breath

978
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,520
Tell us about

979
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,720
your happy place here

980
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,720
and all the services you offer.

981
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,800
Besides basic massage,

982
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,280
we also provide shift coverage,

983
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,400
message replying services,

984
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,880
and we arrange for

985
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,200
people who've lost jobs

986
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,440
to come work here

987
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,920
doing basic tasks.

988
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,040
So those resting people

989
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,320
come to log their WeChat

990
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,040
on your devices,

991
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,120
then go rest?

992
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,120
Yes, but we only do this late night

993
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,320
or on weekends,

994
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,200
handling simple replies for them -

995
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,000
very basic responses like

996
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,480
"Okay,"

997
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,640
"Received,"

998
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,080
etc.

999
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,040
Just these basic replies.

1000
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,400
She can log into anyone's account

1001
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,160
and casually message anyone

1002
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,480
She has access to these people's

1003
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,960
complete chat histories

1004
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,160
Who's replying?

1005
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,120
Sometimes it's me

1006
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,640
sometimes other staff members

1007
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
It depends

1008
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,200
since I'm not always available

1009
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,360
Another question

1010
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,600
Is this proxy chat service

1011
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,440
within your

1012
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,360
business license scope?

1013
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,000
Well...

1014
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,840
Actually this matter

1015
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,920
proxy replying is illegal

1016
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,120
This job substitution service

1017
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,680
actually harms those people

1018
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,760
Why?

1019
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,280
Because

1020
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,040
employment contracts typically

1021
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,880
have personal exclusivity clauses

1022
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,240
the principle of personal performance

1023
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,640
So if the company discovers

1024
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,240
that someone else

1025
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,760
is doing their work

1026
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
they have the right to fire them

1027
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,400
and it might leak company secrets

1028
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:41,840
Right?

1029
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,360
Correct

1030
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,880
I didn't think it through

1031
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,040
You're very straightforward

1032
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,440
You admit your mistakes

1033
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,160
After this incident

1034
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,440
I'll go back and fix it immediately

1035
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,920
Yes, go back and fix it right away

1036
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,080
The computer with a wedding photo

1037
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,760
It's yours, right?

1038
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,680
Then we found in it

1039
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,840
an April 29th

1040
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,920
shift substitution record that was deleted

1041
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,480
Substitute service

1042
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,200
Deleted

1043
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,360
April 29th

1044
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,640
Was deleted

1045
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,280
I'm not sure

1046
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,560
But we found in your private account

1047
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,840
That deleted record

1048
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,320
It was Deputy Manager Shen

1049
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,440
That night

1050
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,720
From 10 PM to midnight

1051
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,880
Asked you to chat on his behalf, right?

1052
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,560
You in the group chat

1053
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,400
Replied to a message for him

1054
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,880
On April 30th

1055
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,920
At the "Plum Blossom Rhyme" event

1056
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,480
Had their General Manager Zong

1057
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,520
Stand in the center position

1058
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,000
And drew a diagram

1059
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,640
As an indication

1060
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,040
The office area

1061
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,200
Who has access to that room?

1062
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,680
Our staff, probably.

1063
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,440
Your staff?

1064
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,960
Well...

1065
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,920
Does it include anyone from our property management?

1066
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,520
Property management are all my VIPs.

1067
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,880
None of my employees are in there.

1068
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,199
Can your brother enter?

1069
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,040
He'd need permission too.

1070
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,280
Right, we should ask her.

1071
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,199
Ke Wuku

1072
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,120
Something else was found on the room's computer.

1073
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,239
A place that's...

1074
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,600
completely unfamiliar to us.

1075
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,199
Then we found Ke Wuku.

1076
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,280
April 29th

1077
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,080
From 9:30 to 10:30

1078
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,600
He was continuously using the computer.

1079
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,400
I was the one who replied to that text message.

1080
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,920
The one on the 29th, right?

1081
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,960
Why did you send that message?

1082
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,640
No reason, I just thought it was the main point.

1083
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,000
Or did someone instruct you to reply that?

1084
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,640
No.

1085
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,000
I just really don't like him.

1086
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,280
Okay.

1087
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,360
I found in your office drawer

1088
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,800
a blueprint.

1089
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,360
You're quite the snoop.

1090
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,000
Yes.

1091
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,720
Had to look.

1092
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,160
Alright.

1093
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,040
That blueprint is

1094
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,000
for the "killer" giant cat

1095
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,320
that crushed the general manager.

1096
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,360
Do you remember that blueprint?

1097
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,000
I vaguely recall it.

1098
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,320
Who gave it to you?

1099
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,320
I found it.

1100
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,240
You found it?

1101
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,560
Where?

1102
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,800
Quite the crucial find.

1103
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,040
Found it right in our shop.

1104
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,640
Did you show it to anyone?

1105
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,520
No.

1106
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,000
So you secretly kept it?

1107
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,440
Why would I be sneaky?

1108
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,120
Watch your tone.

1109
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,280
I just found it

1110
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,600
and kept it there.

1111
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,760
Then I left it there.

1112
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,040
There was a small note below:

1113
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,360
"If this screw loosens,

1114
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,720
within ten minutes

1115
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,720
it will fall."

1116
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,240
Next to it was written:

1117
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,440
"Let me end this."

1118
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,520
Did you write this?

1119
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,880
You wrote it.

1120
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,200
I want to ask,

1121
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,160
who wrote these words?

1122
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
Did you write this?

1123
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,880
Yes, I did.

1124
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,840
So you still want him to "die"

1125
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,160
Right?

1126
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,200
Yes

1127
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,160
You had motive, right?

1128
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,840
Had motive.

1129
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,760
Admit it.

1130
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,520
And you also knew

1131
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
how to make him "die," right?

1132
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,080
Right.

1133
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,960
But currently there's no evidence proving

1134
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,400
that you went to tighten the screws that day.

1135
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,920
Then you find it.

1136
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,720
Right.

1137
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,120
See?

1138
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,560
Look at my teacher.

1139
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,840
See how step by step

1140
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,000
he's skillfully guiding me.

1141
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,120
On the day the incident happened at the event,

1142
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,680
where were you?

1143
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:00,720
At the shop.

1144
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,280
Did your brother go?

1145
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,160
He...

1146
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,360
He probably didn't go either, right?

1147
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,200
What would he be doing there?

1148
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,520
I don't understand why you're still

1149
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,120
investigating that matter.

1150
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,720
Deputy Manager Fu

1151
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,200
has already ruled it as an accident.

1152
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,680
What more are you looking for?

1153
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,440
I really don't understand.

1154
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I think all her responses

1155
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,160
are just evasive excuses

1156
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,640
rather than straightforward answers.

1157
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,040
She's refusing to talk now.

1158
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,000
Come on, let's just chat casually,

1159
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,280
have some small talk, alright?

1160
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,120
No more interrogating.

1161
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
How's business lately?

1162
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,280
That's way too casual.

1163
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,560
Weren't you the one who wanted small talk?

1164
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,480
Were you on good terms with Deputy Manager Fu?

1165
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,920
I think my husband was closer to him.

1166
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,000
Between you and Deputy Manager Fu,

1167
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,760
were there any arguments?

1168
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,160
He did tell me

1169
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,600
that he suspected I "killed"

1170
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,680
General Manager Zong.

1171
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,040
Yes.

1172
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,760
So you resented him

1173
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,560
and "killed" him?

1174
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
I've already said it before.

1175
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,680
Deputy Manager Fu already knows.

1176
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,840
The general manager's "death"

1177
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,880
was an accident.

1178
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,240
He no longer suspects.

1179
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,720
What reason would I have to "kill" him?

1180
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,960
Moreover, he treated all of us

1181
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,480
really well.

1182
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,360
My compensation was

1183
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,200
all applied for by him.

1184
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,560
Indeed, the matter of acting as a substitute

1185
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,960
without a business license

1186
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,000
was also something he helped me conceal.

1187
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,520
"Killing" him, for me,

1188
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
what benefit would there be?

1189
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,080
What other evidence have you searched for?

1190
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,120
In her office, we

1191
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,040
found a tablet.

1192
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,480
It can also log into

1193
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,680
Deputy Manager Fu's WeChat.

1194
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,720
A tablet.

1195
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,520
Saying I was trapped in the elevator,

1196
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,600
and then what?

1197
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,320
Someone help me.

1198
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
It was her message.

1199
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,200
That's where it was sent from.

1200
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,560
I didn't reply

1201
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,240
Was his information synced?

1202
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,920
I'm not sure

1203
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,840
No, definitely not synced

1204
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,520
At our place

1205
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,240
We saw them appearing one by one

1206
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,560
We were synced

1207
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,080
Right

1208
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,640
The elevator malfunctioned

1209
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,560
I'm stuck inside with no signal

1210
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,600
Is anyone in the office?

1211
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,680
He's trapped inside

1212
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,320
Who's inside?

1213
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,960
Deputy Manager Fu

1214
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,840
Is anyone in the office?

1215
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,640
We're all outside

1216
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,640
No one

1217
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,120
Help me

1218
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,960
The elevator dropped slightly

1219
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,280
Or maybe I forgot to log out

1220
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,760
Or something

1221
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,040
Currently this WeChat account

1222
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,240
Is logged in from three sources

1223
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,320
One is the "deceased's" office

1224
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,440
His computer has this WeChat logged in

1225
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,000
His own phone

1226
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,240
And another is my sister's office

1227
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,240
Are you sure on the tablet

1228
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,480
That message wasn't replied by you?

1229
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,480
Okay

1230
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,760
In your office refrigerator

1231
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,440
we found a pool of "blood"

1232
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,680
Ask her

1233
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,400
Confront her

1234
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,280
why there's a pool of "blood"

1235
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,000
Wait, doesn't your fridge

1236
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,920
have some meat or something?

1237
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,640
I don't believe it

1238
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,720
We'll call the police right now

1239
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,160
to get that "blood" DNA tested

1240
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,600
Fine, after you get the results

1241
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,280
then come ask me

1242
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,040
Impressive

1243
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,880
Sister Fei would never

1244
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,760
Because she has to take care of her brother

1245
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,080
I was the one who replied to that text

1246
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,560
The one on the 29th, right?

1247
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,480
Maybe she didn't "kill" anyone

1248
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,720
But she was

1249
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,760
"an accomplice"

1250
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,280
helping cover it up

1251
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,600
Covering up is possible, right?

1252
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,920
If she helped cover it up

1253
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,960
then there are only two people

1254
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,720
One is Kuku

1255
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,280
one is Xu

1256
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,400
The three of them protect each other

1257
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,200
No, my sister isn't like that

1258
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,280
Your sister isn't like that?

1259
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
We'll "interrogate" you soon

1260
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,240
Still saying your sister isn't like that?

1261
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,520
The two sisters exchanged coded signals

1262
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,160
I noticed

1263
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,640
The two of them

1264
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,440
No

1265
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,160
No, she is

1266
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,440
I smiled at my brother

1267
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,200
That was our eye contact signal

1268
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,360
We made eye contact

1269
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,880
This is my family

1270
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,440
They're the only family I have left in this world

1271
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:53,720
Right?

1272
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,760
My brother also "passed away"

1273
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,480
Who else is taking care of me?

1274
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,080
There's also Xu Zhongjie

1275
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,800
Xu Zhongjie

1276
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,920
Right

1277
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
You're going to have a new brother

1278
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,560
There's one more thing

1279
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,200
I found in your drawer

1280
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,800
a missing person notice for Sister Cai

1281
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,640
What's that about?

1282
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,800
This Sister Cai

1283
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,520
has been missing for a month

1284
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,640
I hired her because she was elderly

1285
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,840
That's why I

1286
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,280
brought her into my shop

1287
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,920
to work as a cleaner

1288
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,640
She was a cleaner

1289
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,520
Sister Cai

1290
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,920
told me on the day she left

1291
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,520
she was going to do something important

1292
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,360
Then she disappeared

1293
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,440
Yes, and then she vanished

1294
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,320
There's also a photo in your computer

1295
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,160
taken below Apartment 11

1296
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,880
a photo

1297
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,560
Then you said

1298
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,280
when you jumped down from there

1299
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
what were you thinking?

1300
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,080
That was much earlier

1301
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,480
I think that has nothing

1302
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,200
to do with this matter

1303
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:49,880
I don't want to talk about it

1304
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Can I communicate with my brother?

1305
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,600
Still not allowed

1306
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,280
Not allowed

1307
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,120
Brother, behave yourself

1308
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,720
Hand gesture

1309
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,520
She just did this

1310
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,320
Goodbye

1311
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,200
Tie up her brother

1312
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,360
Go ahead

1313
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,400
Give him a foot massage

1314
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,960
Start by pressing his stomach

1315
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,320
Stop

1316
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,800
His sister's little blanket hasn't been taken away yet

1317
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,800
Don't let his sister's blanket

1318
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,560
Come into contact with him

1319
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,240
They will

1320
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,440
Exchange information

1321
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,560
We really are

1322
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,720
Being oddly meticulous about unimportant details

1323
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,720
Brother Bai enters

1324
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,520
Just ask like this

1325
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,280
What are you doing?

1326
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,520
You sound like a school dean

1327
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,360
Why are you there?

1328
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,000
Pretend you're feeling unwell

1329
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,080
Deliberately stalling for time

1330
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,480
Then making us see

1331
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,240
this elevator situation

1332
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:25,960
No

1333
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,080
I genuinely wasn't pretending

1334
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,800
I was truly feeling unwell

1335
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,160
It just happened to coincide

1336
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,760
Yes.

1337
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,600
You have a memorial tablet for your brother at home.

1338
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,040
And the past of your brother and sister.

1339
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,440
Right?

1340
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:43,960
Yes.

1341
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,200
There's also a photo with the words.

1342
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,760
There's also a photo with the words.

1343
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,840
"Brother Ku."

1344
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,000
Those who exploit you to the point of making you "spit blood."

1345
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,360
Should all pay the price.

1346
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,800
You wrote this, didn't you?

1347
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,200
Yes.

1348
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,560
Who do you want to make pay the price?

1349
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,640
Make.

1350
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,960
President Zong

1351
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,200
Because he's the one who "killed" my brother

1352
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,560
I am

1353
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,560
a child raised by my elder brother

1354
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,040
He treated me extremely well

1355
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,000
This General Manager Zong

1356
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,280
was his superior at the time

1357
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,000
He often made my brother

1358
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,720
do all kinds of unreasonable tasks

1359
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,440
Frequently forced him to work 24-hour shifts

1360
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,320
or even 48-hour shifts

1361
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,240
This kind of overtime work

1362
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,280
Then around the beginning of this year

1363
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,760
my brother suddenly fell ill one day

1364
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
and couldn't be saved

1365
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,360
So after learning about this

1366
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,080
I've been wanting to avenge my brother

1367
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,840
That's why I

1368
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,280
harbored "murderous intent" toward him

1369
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,880
Later I quit my job

1370
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,040
moved to this apartment

1371
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,360
started doing odd jobs

1372
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,920
and then met you all

1373
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,760
Actually I

1374
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,600
quite enjoy

1375
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,400
this peaceful and comfortable life now

1376
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,080
Peaceful

1377
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,120
It hasn't been peaceful, has it?

1378
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,440
But every month, someone

1379
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,160
anonymously

1380
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,960
deposits money into my account.

1381
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,600
Someone anonymously sends you money?

1382
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,920
Yes, and I just asked around—

1383
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,400
I think this person must be

1384
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,080
Xu Zhongjie.

1385
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,600
Let him continue speaking

1386
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,120
You see...

1387
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,600
They have to volunteer the information themselves

1388
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,240
Bro, ask more questions

1389
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,080
We found something in your room's computer

1390
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,440
We discovered one more thing

1391
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,600
A surveillance video

1392
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,000
Yes

1393
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,240
April 29th, 9:30 PM

1394
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,440
You were in your sister's work area

1395
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:51,960
What were you doing?

1396
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,080
I was replying to messages

1397
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,280
The question I just asked your sister

1398
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,560
You were actually the one who replied, right?

1399
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,720
I was the one who sent that text

1400
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,240
The one on the 29th, correct?

1401
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,880
We found another piece of evidence

1402
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,720
There's a photo in your phone

1403
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,280
An opportunity

1404
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,720
A photo that could "kill" General Manager Zong

1405
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:18,880
This is the one

1406
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,440
The picture you found

1407
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,560
He found it in his sister's office drawer

1408
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,960
He saw this thing

1409
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,680
And took a photo

1410
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,120
Just tell us

1411
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,720
You saw this thing

1412
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,360
Thought your sister wanted to "kill" the general manager

1413
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,400
So you took a photo

1414
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,760
To shift the blame onto yourself

1415
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,160
To take the fall for your sister

1416
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,000
Xu thought it was the two siblings

1417
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,720
So he decided to

1418
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,040
Take the blame for them again

1419
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,360
Is that what it means?

1420
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,200
I was the one who "killed" him.

1421
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,760
So you admit it

1422
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,720
Because when you were "interrogating" her earlier

1423
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,400
she revealed everything

1424
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,480
Took all the blame upon herself

1425
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,680
She said she was the one who sent the information

1426
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,320
The blueprints and such - she handled them

1427
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,840
But actually, you were the one who sent them

1428
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,480
You mean...

1429
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:07,880
Yes

1430
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,640
How did you make General Manager Zong

1431
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,200
"die"

1432
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,720
On April 29th

1433
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,400
in the evening

1434
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,240
I was at my sister's foot massage shop

1435
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,000
when I suddenly received

1436
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,800
a request

1437
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,920
from Deputy Manager Shen

1438
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,560
asking me to help him

1439
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,000
manage his WeChat for two hours

1440
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:28,600
After logging into

1441
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,520
his WeChat account

1442
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,680
I saw that the next day

1443
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,600
on April 30th

1444
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,080
he was going to hold

1445
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,720
this "Plum Blossom Rhyme" conference

1446
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,120
and I noticed

1447
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,560
General Manager Zong would also attend

1448
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,200
Then coincidentally at the workstation that day

1449
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:40,600
I saw

1450
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,160
the blueprint for this giant cat installation

1451
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,080
If I could just make General Manager Zong

1452
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,560
after taking the stage

1453
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,200
stand at my designated spot

1454
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,760
right beneath this cat

1455
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,920
and then I could loosen the screws

1456
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,160
ten minutes in advance

1457
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,080
This way

1458
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:53,640
he could

1459
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,040
just like a workplace accident

1460
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:55,760
"die" accidentally

1461
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,160
Just now, your sister said she was the one who wrote that.

1462
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,000
Agent Xu said he was the one who wrote this.

1463
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,600
Regarding the matter with General Manager Zong,

1464
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,000
both of them were trying to protect me.

1465
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,400
That's why they kept taking the blame for me.

1466
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,240
They both knew about it.

1467
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,400
Even though I never told them,

1468
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,800
they might have figured it out

1469
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,480
in their own way.

1470
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,160
They came to that conclusion.

1471
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:17,520
Right.

1472
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,360
Guo Baoyou

1473
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,680
It shows your mentality

1474
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,600
is as small as can be

1475
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,840
Comparing people leads to "death"

1476
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,120
Comparing goods leads to discarding

1477
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,440
Look at that younger brother

1478
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:34,800
Although

1479
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,120
he "killed" someone

1480
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,960
but he's been sincere with us

1481
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,120
Wait a minute

1482
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,120
He admitted to "killing"

1483
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:40,680
and you think he's good?

1484
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,680
I didn't even "kill" anyone

1485
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,320
None of the deaths were my doing

1486
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,160
You also had "murderous intent"

1487
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,480
You used the cruelest method

1488
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,280
Yes, your method

1489
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:48,800
You really

1490
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,920
how many hours did you deceive us?

1491
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,640
No, it was instant "death"

1492
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,120
Last night I had nightmares

1493
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:54,600
All about

1494
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,440
poisonous gas, I was afraid to breathe

1495
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,320
I was furious

1496
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,560
I felt like in my room

1497
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,680
I was even afraid to use the bathroom

1498
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,680
I felt like there were feet in the bathroom

1499
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,160
Learn how to be a decent person, Guo Baoyou

1500
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,040
Comparing people

1501
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,640
You and that deputy manager Fu

1502
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,840
made a phone call in June

1503
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,320
right?

1504
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,720
This matter is quite strange

1505
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:14,760
One day

1506
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,480
I received his friend request

1507
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,280
After accepting it

1508
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,080
he said

1509
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,440
about General Manager Zong's "death"

1510
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,440
he thought it must be

1511
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,600
either me or my sister

1512
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:23,960
one of us

1513
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,800
Then I wanted to know

1514
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,160
why he suspected me

1515
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,120
what he knew

1516
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,800
I specifically called him

1517
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,920
to try to sound him out

1518
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,880
Did he mention any evidence?

1519
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,360
He said he currently has evidence

1520
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,520
but he wasn't ready

1521
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:39,920
well,

1522
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,520
to show you yet

1523
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,840
Right, and then I would

1524
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,640
investigate until the truth comes out

1525
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,880
Then I became somewhat

1526
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:46,880
panicked

1527
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,160
So you panicked

1528
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:49,640
and "killed" him

1529
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,640
I didn't "kill" Deputy Manager Fu.

1530
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,920
One day when I was in the office,

1531
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,600
I suddenly noticed

1532
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,840
that he had classified General Manager Zong's "death"

1533
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,960
as accidental injury in the final report.

1534
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,760
This was despite him knowing that my sister and I

1535
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,600
suspected it might be murder.

1536
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,320
This matter

1537
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,720
was something he was aware of.

1538
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,520
I was shocked when I saw this.

1539
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,520
Why would he

1540
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,720
Others had described him before

1541
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,320
as someone who

1542
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,920
has a sharp tongue but a soft heart.

1543
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,160
Perhaps he'd also witnessed

1544
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,240
how helpless my sister-in-law and I were

1545
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,120
after leaving my brother.

1546
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,320
I thought to myself,

1547
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,280
if that's the case,

1548
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,760
then perhaps we could all coexist peacefully.

1549
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,480
Wait a moment

1550
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,560
Driver's phone call

1551
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,960
Answer

1552
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,440
Speakerphone

1553
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,840
Hello, Lao Fu

1554
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,680
Hello, driver

1555
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,640
At 10 am this morning

1556
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,920
Why didn't you call me?

1557
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,880
I didn't call you at 10 am today

1558
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,800
Because I called the teacher instead

1559
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,400
Yes, I am the teacher

1560
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,720
You're the teacher?

1561
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,200
Aren't you the driver?

1562
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:08,800
Yes

1563
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:09,960
I am a driver

1564
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,200
But my surname is Shi

1565
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,200
And given name is Fu

1566
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,560
So it's Driver Shi Fu

1567
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,280
You're the teacher

1568
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,640
I see, your surname is Shi

1569
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,880
Driver Shi

1570
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,360
Right

1571
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,480
Okay, got it

1572
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,880
So the purpose of your call now

1573
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,320
is to ask how he's doing, right?

1574
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,560
Yes, because today

1575
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,160
he didn't call me

1576
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,240
So I thought it was quite strange

1577
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,320
He usually calls me every Friday at 10 am

1578
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,480
without fail

1579
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,840
But today he didn't call

1580
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,920
Nothing else then?

1581
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:36,880
Driver

1582
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,880
That's all

1583
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,520
Okay, goodbye

1584
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,040
Everyone said they heard him making phone calls.

1585
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,040
Right.

1586
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,200
He called the teacher.

1587
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,360
Isn't this the teacher?

1588
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,280
This isn't the teacher.

1589
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,200
This is the driver.

1590
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,200
He called that teacher.

1591
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,480
That teacher is called Sister Jie.

1592
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,240
He called the school teacher.

1593
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:55,840
What about this one?

1594
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,480
This one is called Driver Shifu.

1595
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,160
Because this driver's surname is Shi and given name is Fu.

1596
00:51:59,160 --> 00:51:59,800
He's called Shifu.

1597
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,400
Driver Shi.

1598
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,040
But he did make phone calls.

1599
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,680
Then call the teacher back.

1600
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,520
This teacher is from Tianjin.

1601
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:13,920
Hello?

1602
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,040
Sister Jie.

1603
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,080
Sister Jie.

1604
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,440
What's up?

1605
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,120
Sister Jie.

1606
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,320
So... what are you busy with?

1607
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,040
Work.

1608
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,200
Haven't gotten off work yet.

1609
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:24,720
You're really busy.

1610
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:25,840
Well...

1611
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,320
Let me ask you something.

1612
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,080
About...

1613
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,160
Deputy Manager Fu.

1614
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,160
You're familiar with him, right?

1615
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,880
He's the parent of one of my students.

1616
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,960
Did you have any arrangement with him...

1617
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,280
About contacting at specific times each week?

1618
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,760
No, he was always busy with work before.

1619
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,440
He didn't contact me often.

1620
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,120
That's why I found it strange this morning.

1621
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,800
He's never asked me about...

1622
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,840
his child's grades before.

1623
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,240
But he called me this morning.

1624
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,680
Never before.

1625
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,880
Are you sure it was Old Fu?

1626
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,720
His voice was a bit low this morning.

1627
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,200
Like he had a cold.

1628
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,160
I was wondering if he wasn't feeling well.

1629
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:05,960
Okay.

1630
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,880
Sorry to trouble you.

1631
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,200
Alright, get back to work, Sister Jie.

1632
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,640
I'll get back to work.

1633
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,240
Go ahead and work.

1634
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:20,760
He

1635
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,280
Look

1636
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:21,840
That sticky note of his

1637
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,240
says "call the teacher"

1638
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,120
but actually it's for

1639
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,600
calling the driver

1640
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,280
to get information

1641
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,480
Not to call this teacher

1642
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,480
to get information

1643
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,640
So

1644
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,400
If someone

1645
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,680
pretended to be Deputy Manager Fu

1646
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,760
and saw this note

1647
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,040
they might mistakenly think

1648
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,040
they should call the school teacher

1649
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,560
Because normally when people see that note

1650
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,280
their first instinct is to call the teacher

1651
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,000
not the driver

1652
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,440
Right, the driver

1653
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,080
So the person who appeared

1654
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,040
in that office at 10 o'clock today

1655
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,560
might not have been Deputy Fu

1656
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,360
But they all saw

1657
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:52,920
Right

1658
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,000
Then why would this be fake?

1659
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,320
Right, he actually made the call

1660
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,000
That might overturn

1661
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,760
all previous suspects

1662
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,640
We need to see which suspect

1663
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,600
gave false testimony

1664
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,800
But when we were talking earlier

1665
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,680
several people were alibied together

1666
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,840
Deputy Manager Shen

1667
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,840
Hao the cleaner

1668
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,080
and Xu the agent

1669
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,120
But they were all at the office

1670
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,680
together at 10 o'clock

1671
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,600
They alibied each other

1672
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,160
You saw Old Fu, right?

1673
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,120
When you went to the office at 10

1674
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,520
Yes, in the office

1675
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,760
calling a teacher

1676
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,600
seemed to be talking about their child

1677
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,560
Around 10 o'clock

1678
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,200
I heard him on the phone

1679
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,920
talking about

1680
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,640
the child

1681
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,760
Yes, about the child

1682
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,520
Then at 10 I heard Deputy Manager Fu

1683
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,320
call his child's teacher

1684
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,640
I feel like we're stuck here

1685
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,840
I think what we need now is

1686
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,400
new evidence

1687
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,600
Yes, we need new evidence

1688
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,360
Deputy Manager Fu

1689
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,400
Is he actually good or bad?

1690
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:07,720
We

1691
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,280
still don't know yet.

1692
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,440
Some people think he's bad,

1693
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,480
others think he's good.

1694
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,280
There's another issue:

1695
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,280
Why does everyone say

1696
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,960
they saw Deputy Manager Fu

1697
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,320
in the office at 10 o'clock?

1698
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,360
That's also suspicious.

1699
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,200
Very suspicious.

1700
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,280
And then that person

1701
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,160
the one who made the call

1702
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,400
actually dialed wrong -

1703
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,480
reached the real teacher.

1704
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,440
So there are many inconsistencies.

1705
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,560
I feel like maybe everyone

1706
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,160
is hiding something?

1707
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:35,880
I just saw

1708
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,400
when you were at this workstation

1709
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,480
in your video

1710
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,000
exactly this spot

1711
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,880
Look

1712
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,840
this door was open

1713
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,000
meaning there's also a door here

1714
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,640
so this door can be opened

1715
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,200
Exactly

1716
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,240
It's a rotating flower pot

1717
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,680
It's open.

1718
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,480
The door is open.

1719
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,120
It's open.

1720
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,800
There's another new place

1721
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,800
There's another place inside

1722
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,200
Right?

1723
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,640
Let's go

1724
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,400
You go in first

1725
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,520
No

1726
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,200
Brother Bai

1727
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,440
What is this place?

1728
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,640
Old Bai locked us in here

1729
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,360
Old Bai locked us in

1730
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:43,960
Brother Bai

1731
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:48,920
No

1732
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,120
He's doing something

1733
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,520
There's something in the flowerpot

1734
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,120
Look

1735
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,080
He turned off the lights

1736
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,280
What is he doing?

1737
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,080
He turned off the lights

1738
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,600
We can't see him now

1739
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,480
Happy Hometown Workers' Confession Session

1740
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,760
Here's Deputy Manager Fu's employee badge

1741
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,280
He was actually a member

1742
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,720
Meaning before he "died" yesterday

1743
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,840
He had visited this foot massage parlor

1744
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,040
Let's play a "roasting" game

1745
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,080
No one noticed

1746
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,720
He fell from the stairs

1747
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,120
That's how he accidentally "died"

1748
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,800
This Old Fu

1749
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,280
His "death" wasn't accidental

1750
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,200
This matter isn't that simple now

1751
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,720
"Sudden death"

1752
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,200
Cat's paw

1753
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:50,680
"Died" on the stairs

1754
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,720
This is the real crime scene

1755
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,040
The player guessed by most people

1756
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,040
Will be the loser

1757
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,240
Has to eat cold bitter melon salad

1758
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,040
Did someone tamper with the bitter melon?

1759
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,200
Then how could he be sure he'd be the one eating it?

1760
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,400
Maybe the "killer" wrote this

1761
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,080
If I just wanted you to "die"

1762
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,840
You're the only one who could harm Old Bai

1763
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,600
Is human nature really this dark?

1764
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,200
