1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,200
Someone "died"

2
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,280
This should be Song, the delivery guy

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,360
He installed surveillance in Fang Xiaomei's home

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,640
To spy on Fang Xiaomei's family, right?

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,240
Anyway, the two of them were very sweet together

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,840
Good

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,480
Liu Xialai

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,600
Had an argument

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,840
Why is this in my house?

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,680
(Hao) The cleaner

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,520
So Xiaomei and Yueguang were in an online relationship

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,840
Cao Yueguang

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,360
Song Huo

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:40,960
Fang Xiaomei

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,880
This "scumbag couple" plotted murder for money

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,000
"Killed" Cao Yueguang

17
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,760
There's a traitor among us.

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,400
How despicable.

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,600
Just wait and see how he's going to "interrogate" you.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,160
Seriously.

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,720
Good work today, everyone.

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,240
Or,

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,920
Who wants to briefly summarize

24
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,280
the suspect's identity?

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,600
I'll do it.

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,520
Let me summarize.

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,960
Go ahead, you do it.

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,000
Just confess already.

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,800
Justice before family.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,520
You go first.

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,200
We'd like to hear

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,480
You first.

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,360
I'd like to hear everyone's suggestions.

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,880
Suggestions, everyone's suggestions.

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,240
The key people in today's case are:

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,039
"The deceased"

37
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,639
Song Huo

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,800
Directly related

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,520
First

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,400
Liu Xialai

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,320
and Liu Xialai

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,840
One person directly related

43
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,320
is named Cao Yueguang

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,200
Then with Cao Yueguang

45
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,720
there's another directly connected person

46
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,360
named Hao Baojie

47
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,520
With these three people

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,640
there's someone connected to all

49
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
named Fang Xiaomei

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,040
Why is there a hole here?

51
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,120
There's suddenly a hole

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
I think it's very strange

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,600
How did you get in?

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,880
Do you know him?

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,680
I don't know him

56
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,600
The three of us went to Liu Xialai's room

57
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,680
Cao Yueguang's phone

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,120
Why is it with Liu Xialai?

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,560
Why is it with Liu Xialai?

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
Meimei, it's still me

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,000
Changed number to add you

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,880
Because I need to tell you something important

63
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,600
I recently had surgery

64
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,160
I look different from before

65
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,480
Also due to some personal matters

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,680
I changed my name to Liu Xialai

67
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,200
Liu Xialai is Cao Yueguang

68
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,960
There's a combination lock here

69
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:02,960
(Password) how many digits?

70
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,120
What is it?

71
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,840
Three letters

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,360
Cao Yueguang

73
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,920
Cao Yueguang

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,720
It actually worked

75
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,680
There is

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
and an ID card

77
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:17,880
Whose?

78
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,160
Cao Yueguang's ID card

79
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,960
What does he look like?

80
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,640
That's him

81
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,440
Adoption certificate

82
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,840
This certifies that Mr. and Mrs. Cao from Tuishi City

83
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
have adopted a boy

84
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,720
born on January 8, 1997

85
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,960
renamed as Cao Yueguang

86
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,800
His room has an ID card

87
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,680
showing it's Cao Yueguang

88
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,600
There's also an adoption certificate

89
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,120
And then?

90
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,440
Liu Xialai's phone

91
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,800
shows through WeChat that

92
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,440
he is actually "Moonlight Treasure Box"

93
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:48,760
Which means

94
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,600
Liu Xialai

95
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,720
is "Moonlight Treasure Box"

96
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,640
The top donor

97
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,880
Top donor

98
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,280
Top donor

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,720
"Top donor" is acceptable

100
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,960
Therefore

101
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,080
Liu Xialai is Cao Yueguang

102
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,680
In Hao the cleaner's room

103
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,720
we found something

104
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,240
He summarized a relationship chart

105
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,400
showing Song Huo and Xiaomei conspired

106
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,840
to commit murder for money

107
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,800
against Cao Yueguang

108
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,680
Why would a cleaner

109
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,440
monitor Xiaomei's room

110
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,640
and talk about "scumbags"

111
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,760
and "gold-diggers"?

112
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,920
On that relationship chart

113
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,520
Cao Yueguang's murder case

114
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,640
has a photo attached

115
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,920
labeled "blood brothers"

116
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,600
So

117
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,680
Hao the cleaner is Cao Yueguang's brother

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,200
meaning Liu Xialai's brother

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Today,

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,320
the suspect

121
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,760
First,

122
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,680
Liu Xialai (also known as Cao Yueguang)

123
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,960
why did he "kill" Song Huo?

124
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,720
His motive was self-preservation.

125
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,480
In Liu Xialai's room,

126
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,200
we found a small surveillance camera

127
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,720
that captured

128
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,440
Song Huo

129
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,920
contacting a mysterious "killer"

130
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,720
sending messages

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,240
requesting them to "kill" Liu Xialai

132
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,560
on May 13th.

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,160
The young man's heart is racing.

134
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,040
Why is it beating faster and faster?

135
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,800
Second,

136
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,720
why did Hao Baojie "kill" Song Huo?

137
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,400
His motive was to avenge his brother.

138
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,240
Revenge.

139
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,240
Why did Xiaomei "kill" Song Huo?

140
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,720
This place,

141
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,640
currently our three-person investigation

142
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,120
cannot directly confirm a motive,

143
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,640
but why can we confirm

144
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,680
she is a suspect?

145
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,000
Because

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
today we discovered that from Xiaomei's room

147
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,800
to the crime scene

148
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,320
it was like this:

149
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,040
This place,

150
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,480
which is Hao Baojie's room,

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,920
this place

152
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,320
is where the "victim" was.

153
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,240
The only ones with direct access

154
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,840
were Hao Baojie

155
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,360
and Xiaomei.

156
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,520
Therefore, based on this,

157
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,480
we can deduce

158
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,680
that Xiaomei had the means to commit the crime.

159
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,360
Thus, Xiaomei is also our prime suspect.

160
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,240
What have you been through

161
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,720
That's amazing

162
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,480
Very good

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,960
Everything we have matches your story

164
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,320
Look

165
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,080
This is what we found in Xiaomei's room

166
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,560
Her personal diary

167
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,280
The first entry says

168
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,000
I accidentally came across

169
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,760
Xiaomei's video online

170
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,600
Since you're a fashion blogger

171
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,000
Do you think my fabric

172
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,920
is boyfriend material?

173
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,560
And confessed

174
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,240
Confessed

175
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,840
Confessed

176
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,480
This was Valentine's Day

177
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,640
February 14, 2021

178
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:27,920
Last year

179
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Then Xiaomei said

180
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Starting today

181
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,120
I'm no longer alone

182
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,920
You're the light in my darkness

183
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,800
They became official

184
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,160
Then in 2022

185
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,200
Didn't you always want to hear me sing

186
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,640
your favorite song?

187
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,160
"A Light in the Darkness"

188
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,200
The song "A Light in the Darkness"

189
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,960
Here

190
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,600
He can

191
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,120
Let him sing

192
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,000
The muscle one

193
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,520
Quick

194
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,880
Muscles can't hold on, quick

195
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,320
Right

196
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,680
Look, his lips match

197
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,520
Muscle memory

198
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,680
You know this song

199
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,280
Stop pretending

200
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:10,880
Let me tell you

201
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,200
Your lips moved

202
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,440
Maybe you should sit over there first

203
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,360
Ask (Liu) to come down first, maybe

204
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,920
Ask (Liu) to come down first

205
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,960
He's a bit nervous

206
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,440
Look at his Adam's apple

207
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,160
bobbing up and down

208
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,160
Come on, let's ask.

209
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,200
So you're (Cao) Yueguang?

210
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,760
Yes.

211
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,800
Do you know Song Huo?

212
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,240
Yes, I do.

213
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,320
Did Song Huo cause

214
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,360
that car accident of yours?

215
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,240
Did he steal your five million?

216
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,240
No.

217
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,280
He was

218
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,480
trying to steal my five million.

219
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,040
Can you explain in detail about your dispute

220
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,400
with Song Huo outside the bank that day?

221
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,840
Also, another question.

222
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,160
We noticed this money

223
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,040
was actually withdrawn from

224
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,680
your adoptive mother's account.

225
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,240
Right?

226
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,880
Yes.

227
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,480
This money was given to me by Mother Cao.

228
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,280
I was adopted by their family as a child.

229
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,840
Mother Cao passed away a year ago.

230
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,560
At that time,

231
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,000
Mother Cao was worried that

232
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,120
Father Cao and their biological child

233
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,240
didn't treat me well.

234
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,920
They were unkind to me.

235
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,840
So she gave me five million

236
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,200
to find someone to love

237
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,840
and live well.

238
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,159
This money rightfully belongs to me.

239
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,440
Yes.

240
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,559
So who is Mrs. Cao's biological son?

241
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,400
Mr. and Mrs. Cao's biological son

242
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,280
is named Cao Yangguang.

243
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,120
You're very familiar with him.

244
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,800
The little boy from last week.

245
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,360
Actually, back then,

246
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,800
why did I withdraw that 5 million?

247
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
It was because

248
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,680
Mr. Cao and Cao Yangguang

249
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,040
found out about my 5 million

250
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,240
and kept coming to demand the money from me.

251
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,000
So I thought,

252
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,520
"Fine, I'll give it to you.

253
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,000
I don't want it anymore.

254
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,600
I don't want anything.

255
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,680
I want my dignity."

256
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,200
After I withdrew the money,

257
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,760
when I was about to deliver it to the Cao family,

258
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,560
a car came dangerously close to me.

259
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,760
It kept forcing me

260
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
to the edge of a cliff.

261
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,440
It wrecked my car.

262
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,880
Then someone got out

263
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,800
and tried to rob me.

264
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,000
He actually took my watch

265
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,240
and wallet from me.

266
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,240
At that moment,

267
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,080
I fought back against him.

268
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,600
During the struggle,

269
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,000
I saw his face clearly.

270
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,800
It was today's "deceased," Song Huo.

271
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,880
Then he ran away.

272
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,240
Actually, that five million

273
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,160
is still in my trunk

274
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,520
and wasn't stolen by him

275
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,840
So through this opportunity

276
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,400
I started thinking

277
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,280
why should I keep suffering like this

278
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
why should I return this money

279
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,760
I might as well take this money

280
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,840
and start a new life

281
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
So I created

282
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,680
a "fake death" scenario

283
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,560
left my pants and shoes on the shore

284
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
pushed the car into the sea

285
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,640
to make them think I "died"

286
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,680
went to get plastic surgery

287
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,040
changed back

288
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,840
My name was Liu Xialai from the very beginning

289
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,960
Do you know

290
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,320
why Song Huo wanted to "kill" you?

291
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't know

292
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,360
He must have wanted to steal my money

293
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,600
I know

294
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,040
Song Huo kept lurking around my house

295
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,640
I suspected he would enter my home

296
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,720
So in my room

297
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,840
I installed surveillance cameras

298
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,600
Through this surveillance

299
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,560
I discovered something

300
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,880
He entered my room

301
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
and took the bank card

302
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,320
containing five million yuan

303
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,520
Perhaps because Song Huo found out

304
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,400
that he was actually

305
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,000
Right

306
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,240
So the people who know Liu Xialai is Cao Yueguang

307
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,960
how many are there?

308
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,000
After I had plastic surgery

309
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,080
I went to see Xiaomei again

310
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,480
I added her on WeChat

311
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,440
I told Xiaomei

312
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,480
Inside the power distribution room,

313
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,320
we discovered

314
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,040
Didn't we find a phone?

315
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,840
It was Song Huo's phone.

316
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,640
Then,

317
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,880
the boss also found out

318
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,960
that his phone account

319
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,880
could be switched.

320
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,480
Song Huo's phone

321
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,840
had both Song Huo's WeChat

322
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,320
and Meimei Planet's WeChat.

323
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,040
Right, his phone could switch accounts.

324
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,760
There was a Meimei Planet

325
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,560
and a

326
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:23,920
account.

327
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
"I'll switch accounts to add you"

328
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,040
"to tell you"

329
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,920
"something very important."

330
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,320
Xiaomei said,

331
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,880
"Alright, I understand."

332
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,680
"Let's keep in touch via text."

333
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,880
After his plastic surgery,

334
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,360
the person he contacted was always Song Huo.

335
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,080
Right.

336
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,240
So only Song Huo knew

337
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
he wanted to "kill" Song Huo

338
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,200
because Song Huo wanted to "kill" him.

339
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,720
Right.

340
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,240
Song Huo wanted to ("kill" him)

341
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,880
because he knew he was Cao Yueguang.

342
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,000
So you know,

343
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,080
when I cut you off with my car

344
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,640
and tried to "kill" you,

345
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,400
I wanted to rob you.

346
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,880
You knew I was a "killer."

347
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
Anyway, Song Huo "killing" him

348
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,800
had strong motives.

349
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,400
Therefore,

350
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
knowing this, he wanted to counter-"kill."

351
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,000
This makes sense.

352
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,600
Do you have any other questions?

353
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,280
There's one more question.

354
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
You were adopted.

355
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,520
Which means your biological brother

356
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,960
might be that Hao Baojie.

357
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,440
I didn't know about this.

358
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,160
But

359
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,760
when I was little,

360
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,720
I had a biological brother

361
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,600
named Liu Xiah Hao.

362
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,920
We were very young

363
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,200
when we got separated at age seven.

364
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,400
Liu Xiah Hao, Baojie...

365
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,560
They are brothers.

366
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,880
In Hao Baojie's room

367
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,360
we found a computer

368
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,160
That computer

369
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,560
was actually the surveillance system for Fang Xiaomei's home

370
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,720
In the surveillance footage

371
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,840
Liu Xialai appeared

372
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,520
with Song Huo

373
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,160
having an argument at home

374
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,280
Song Huo

375
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
seemed to be writing

376
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,400
some kind of guarantee letter

377
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,720
He wrote it

378
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,320
today

379
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,680
May 13th at 11:00 AM

380
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,760
Why did you go see Song Huo?

381
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,920
And why were you arguing?

382
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,600
In the end he wrote you

383
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
"May 13th at 11:00"

384
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,960
That was written

385
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,880
to tell you

386
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,680
what would happen at that time?

387
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,400
That might be Song Huo's "time of death"

388
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,480
I'd like to see that video

389
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,320
Don't you remember?

390
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,760
What were you two talking about

391
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,840
in Xiaomei's room?

392
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,720
I

393
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,960
I didn't know about this

394
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,960
It's over

395
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,840
He's a twin

396
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,480
So the one with dual personalities is him

397
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,960
I really didn't know

398
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,320
No

399
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,560
Then let me ask you

400
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,400
How do you explain

401
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,920
You saw Song Huo hiring a "hitman"

402
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,200
to eliminate you on the 13th

403
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,240
Actually, I knew

404
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,600
he was coming to "kill" me today

405
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:56,840
Right

406
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,520
By inviting everyone to my place

407
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,880
he wouldn't dare act recklessly

408
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,960
You're using us

409
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,960
Which of us can actually protect you?

410
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,520
You're the strongest among us

411
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,080
If even you can't handle it

412
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,600
Just give him a bowl of congee

413
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,640
Give him a whole pot of congee (wordplay: "Guo Zhou")

414
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,760
Make him wet his pants (wordplay: "Liu Yi Ku")

415
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,440
Soak his pants

416
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,600
But

417
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,760
Perhaps it's precisely because he knew

418
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,160
Song Huo

419
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,880
wanted to "kill" him

420
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,600
Yes

421
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,000
Exactly

422
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,160
That room behind yours

423
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,640
The one that looks like a specimen room

424
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,120
What's it for?

425
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,160
Secret passage

426
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,520
There are knives and a cat on his desk

427
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,680
That's part of my job

428
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,000
Many people who really love their pets

429
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
When their own pets

430
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,000
pass away

431
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,640
I have a skill

432
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,320
I can preserve them as specimens

433
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,480
or cremate them

434
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,800
and make a memorial

435
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,440
I'm in pet funeral services

436
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,200
Yes, exactly

437
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,840
Pet mortician

438
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,800
Suddenly so heartwarming

439
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,560
Just instantly

440
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,360
Very heartwarming, right?

441
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,400
Alright, hurry up

442
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,160
Don't sit there, it's cold

443
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,040
I feel a bit sorry

444
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,920
Good friend, come back quickly

445
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,360
Come back

446
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,760
You see

447
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,000
Everyone wants to ask now

448
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,960
Which suspect

449
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,240
Definitely (Hao) the cleaner

450
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,760
(Hao) the cleaner

451
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,800
Hao the cleaner, right?

452
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,480
Then I'll go call him over

453
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,400
He's coming

454
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,640
Snapped at me

455
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,360
Angry guy

456
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,880
I feel a bit sorry

457
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,400
I feel a bit sorry

458
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,560
Have a seat, Liu Xiahao

459
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
While it was wrong of me to enter your room,

460
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,560
I discovered that

461
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,000
you've also done some very improper things.

462
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,400
Why did you

463
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,720
install surveillance in Fang Xiaomei's room?

464
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,800
Why spy on her private life?

465
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,760
Here's the thing:

466
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,040
I believe Fang Xiaomei and Song Huo

467
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
are connected to my brother's "death."

468
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,520
So to investigate thoroughly

469
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,400
without being detected,

470
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,320
I installed surveillance.

471
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,960
Later you found out

472
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,560
that through

473
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,200
monitoring their household situation,

474
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,920
you discovered Xiaomei and Song Huo

475
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,520
seem to have an unusual relationship.

476
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Not just unusual -

477
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,800
they're actually a couple.

478
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,280
Because Song Huo could come and go freely

479
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,320
in Fang Xiaomei's home

480
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,000
and their behavior was very intimate

481
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,560
But aside from the intimacy shown in your video

482
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,920
did you witness any other intimate moments?

483
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,440
No

484
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,720
Because I didn't pay attention to those things

485
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,520
We care deeply about this, you know

486
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,600
You must have seen something

487
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,640
Can I just pay for a membership?

488
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,040
Even with membership you can't see it

489
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,120
because I deleted it that same day

490
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,960
No, I mean how intimate were they?

491
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,200
What kind of intimacy did you see?

492
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,880
The intimacy we witnessed

493
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,760
was normal intimacy

494
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,800
He's asking about the not-so-normal kind

495
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:50,920
Well, no...

496
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,960
That kind of closeness he mentioned...

497
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,840
It's just...

498
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,760
Look, you're Xiaomei...

499
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,240
I'm Song Huo...

500
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,000
We entered the room...

501
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,360
See...

502
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,000
Pretty...

503
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,760
Pretty...

504
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,480
Closeness...

505
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,599
This is what closeness means...

506
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:07,760
No...

507
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,359
What exactly do you want from me?

508
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,200
If there's nothing important...

509
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,680
I still have work to do...

510
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,800
Wait, hold on a second...

511
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,079
Because Song Huo "died"...

512
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,359
Right...

513
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,720
You know?

514
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,480
"Died"...

515
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:17,920
Song Huo...

516
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,839
The doorknob of an abandoned electrical room...

517
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,520
Was electrified and "killed" him...

518
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:21,960
We discovered...

519
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,440
Someone wrapped wires around the doorknob...

520
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,760
Then he deserved it...

521
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,640
He should have "died"...

522
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:30,720
No.

523
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,880
Bad people should be punished by the law,

524
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
not by other people.

525
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,560
Right?

526
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,960
Then why are you looking for me?

527
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,320
We suspect you're involved.

528
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,280
In your room,

529
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,120
we found a pair of couple's watches.

530
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,000
The men's watch

531
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
was worn by Song Huo.

532
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,880
Why was the women's watch with you?

533
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,240
Yes, why was this watch with you?

534
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,840
Here's the thing.

535
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,760
That watch

536
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,560
was my brother's keepsake.

537
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,960
My younger brother

538
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,400
had been out of contact with me for a long time.

539
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,560
I came to Tuishi City specifically to find my brother.

540
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
On April 1st,

541
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,640
someone sent me a WeChat message

542
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,080
saying my brother had been adopted by the Cao family.

543
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,440
The next day I went to the Cao family to find him,

544
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,440
but the adoptive father said

545
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,360
my brother had "died."

546
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,200
But no matter how much I asked,

547
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,040
the adoptive father wouldn't tell me anything.

548
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,120
He only gave me his belongings -

549
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,520
that couple's watch gift set.

550
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,880
Inside was a letter from my brother to Fang Xiaomei.

551
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,560
That's how I learned

552
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,920
Fang Xiaomei was my brother's girlfriend.

553
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,880
So I wanted to find Fang Xiaomei

554
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,480
to ask about my brother's situation.

555
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,400
A perfectly healthy person

556
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,720
just suddenly "dies" like that?

557
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,000
After searching everywhere,

558
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,360
I found Fang Xiaomei online.

559
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,360
She's a fashion blogger,

560
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,400
and this girl

561
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,040
has no concern for her privacy at all.

562
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,640
That's how

563
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,240
I learned she also lives in Apartment 11.

564
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,800
This apartment is really a strange place.

565
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,880
Do you know the secret passage in your apartment

566
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
leads to an abandoned electrical room?

567
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,280
The secret passage leads to the abandoned electrical room.

568
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,480
How did we get into your room?

569
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,360
We sneaked in through there, didn't we?

570
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,120
I don't know.

571
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,400
Even if he knows, he wouldn't tell you.

572
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,720
Inside your own room

573
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,760
there's a one-way lock.

574
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,760
Once opened, you can enter a...

575
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,800
But all I know is

576
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,920
that room only leads to Fang Xiaomei's place.

577
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,000
You didn't go further inside?

578
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,600
No.

579
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,800
Even if he really would tell you,

580
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,560
he still wouldn't tell you.

581
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,440
That's right.

582
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,600
I knew Fang Xiaomei lived in

583
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,400
Room 610.

584
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,960
Originally, I wanted to confront Fang Xiaomei directly

585
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,760
and get some answers.

586
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,880
But that day,

587
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,120
a man came out of her room.

588
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,360
That man was wearing

589
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,600
the unique watch

590
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,880
my brother gave to Fang Xiaomei.

591
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,560
I realized this wasn't simple.

592
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,200
I had to investigate.

593
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,680
I had to avenge my brother.

594
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,560
To avoid alerting them,

595
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,600
I thought

596
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,040
maybe I could go through the ventilation shaft

597
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,320
from my room in that direction.

598
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,040
Sure enough, the two rooms were adjacent,

599
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,280
but there was a wall.

600
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,920
I could only dig through

601
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,720
when Fang Xiaomei wasn't home.

602
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,320
Then you sneaked into their house

603
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,360
Installed surveillance in their home

604
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,000
Yes

605
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,880
No

606
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,480
I also found

607
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
My brother's "death" report

608
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,720
"Death" report

609
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,920
Found in Fang Xiaomei's house

610
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,800
What did it say?

611
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,280
It stated

612
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,120
My brother was killed for money during a withdrawal

613
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,960
An investigative report, right?

614
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,040
Is it an investigative report?

615
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,240
Which means

616
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,040
Fang Xiaomei knew about this too

617
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,680
Investigative report

618
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,040
Yes

619
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,680
This is what I found in her home

620
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,320
Moreover

621
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,920
I also noticed something suspicious

622
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,600
Fang Xiaomei had a phone

623
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,000
Which I also discovered

624
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,600
There was a

625
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,680
Private WeChat Moments post

626
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,400
Saying "I'm sorry"

627
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,880
It said "I'm sorry"

628
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,320
Yes

629
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,200
Just "I'm sorry"

630
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,320
Then there was your brother's

631
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,920
Screenshot of my brother's WeChat Moments

632
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,160
Mentioning five million

633
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes

634
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That's when I learned

635
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,280
My brother was wealthy

636
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,120
So I believe

637
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Fang Xiaomei must have targeted my brother for his money

638
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,720
And conspired with Song Huo

639
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,280
To "murder" my brother

640
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,720
Yes

641
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,360
At 11 o'clock this morning

642
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,080
where were you?

643
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,040
At 11 I was in the common area

644
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,360
You were in the common area?

645
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,120
Yes

646
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,320
From 10:30 to 11

647
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,920
I was sweeping the floor

648
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,000
From 11:30 to 12

649
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,160
I emptied the trash bins in two elevators

650
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,240
Then I went back home

651
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,120
only to find you rummaging through my place

652
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,400
After kicking you out

653
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,840
I stayed inside

654
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,960
That power distribution room on the first floor

655
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,560
does it count as a common area?

656
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,280
The power distribution room

657
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,200
Yes, it does

658
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,680
Was there anyone else besides you at that time?

659
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,880
You were working alone?

660
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,360
I'm the only cleaner in this entire building

661
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,200
I'm sorry

662
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,480
My apologies to everyone

663
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,400
I'll hire a few more

664
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,240
Don't bother

665
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,600
One is enough

666
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,720
There's another folder on your computer

667
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,880
marked with a question mark

668
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Did you find the answer to that question mark?

669
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,760
That question mark

670
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,640
No

671
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,880
Haven't found the answer

672
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,680
I was startled too at that time

673
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,440
Don't know who it was

674
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,000
Also there's this:

675
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,800
He (Liu) came down

676
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,400
and was arguing with Song Huo

677
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,160
Do you know what they were arguing about?

678
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,280
Liu Xialai

679
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,000
This person here

680
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,920
Hurry up and acknowledge each other

681
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,520
Talk quickly

682
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,920
No

683
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,480
Please

684
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,840
Don't joke about this matter

685
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,480
Alright?

686
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,920
My brother has already "died"

687
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,760
Please show some respect for my brother

688
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,280
No

689
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,240
That's not

690
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,960
Are you called Liu Xiahai?

691
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,280
Yes

692
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,040
Stop

693
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,640
This isn't fun anymore

694
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,240
No, I'm not joking

695
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,680
I'm Liu Xialai

696
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,160
Right, you must be my brother

697
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,880
What?

698
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,920
I didn't expect it to be you

699
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,240
Impossible

700
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,040
Absolutely impossible

701
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,640
We haven't seen each other in over ten years

702
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,200
What does he look like

703
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,800
I don't even know now

704
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,640
If you say so, then it must be

705
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,040
I had plastic surgery

706
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,960
We lived in City A when we were kids

707
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,240
After our father passed away

708
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Our mother tried to raise both of us

709
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
But she couldn't manage it

710
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,800
She could only choose to take me

711
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,280
The two of us

712
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,320
Moved to Tui City to live

713
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,520
But our grandparents

714
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,360
Wanted

715
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
To keep the Liu family lineage in City A

716
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,720
So they kept you there

717
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,280
Then my mother took me to Tui City

718
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,600
Our mother passed away three years later too

719
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,960
So you really are

720
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,400
This is (Liu) Xialai

721
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,480
The proof of when you were adopted by the Cao family

722
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,000
Later I changed back to my

723
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,800
Original identity

724
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,160
Which is Liu Xialai

725
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,640
What's our dad's name?

726
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,880
It's

727
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,720
Dad Liu

728
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,880
Where's our mom?

729
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,240
Aunt Liu

730
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,120
Good little brother

731
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,280
Good little brother

732
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,000
What's your father's name?

733
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,720
Father Liu

734
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,440
What's your mother's name?

735
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,640
Mother Liu

736
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,880
You've grown taller

737
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,400
Of course

738
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,640
Very tall

739
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,760
Truly family

740
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,200
This tall

741
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,800
Look how thin you've become

742
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,560
You should eat more

743
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,520
Eat more

744
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,600
Brother

745
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,920
I'm a millionaire

746
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,720
You don't have to do this job anymore

747
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,560
No

748
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,480
Big bro has his own life

749
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,600
Understood

750
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,320
Now working in cleaning

751
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,200
Big bro quite likes it

752
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,920
Good

753
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,800
You take care of yourself

754
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,160
No problem

755
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,800
Thanks, big bro

756
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,160
Thank you

757
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,720
I never imagined

758
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,760
This reunion

759
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,000
So perfect

760
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,840
Alright

761
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,480
Just being alive is enough

762
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,360
Good, just being alive is enough

763
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:43,760
Big bro, you sit first

764
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,800
A tough man's tenderness

765
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,440
Really nice

766
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,600
Big bro

767
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,320
Maybe you should rest first

768
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,040
Right

769
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,480
Then big bro won't need to avenge you

770
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:51,760
Big bro

771
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,800
I think you're highly suspicious

772
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,120
Big bro

773
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,800
No

774
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,400
Brother, not at all

775
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:56,840
Let me tell you

776
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,560
This matter really has nothing to do with me

777
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,120
You do seem like an honest person

778
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,720
To be honest

779
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Because I've known for a long time

780
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,560
He's the one who "killed" my brother

781
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:02,920
"murderer"

782
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,400
If I wanted to "kill" him

783
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,120
I would have done it long ago

784
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,280
Why would I choose today to "kill" him

785
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,400
And in such a way

786
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,800
That all of you could catch me

787
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,680
Impossible

788
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,840
What do you mean by that?

789
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,800
That all of you could catch me

790
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,520
Or rather, let these Sherlock Holmeses

791
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,320
catch me

792
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,960
I should say

793
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,240
Alright then

794
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
Then there's nothing else

795
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,160
Anything else you want to ask?

796
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,960
Nothing else

797
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,280
Okay

798
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,920
If there's nothing else then

799
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,000
I'll go to work

800
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,320
Alright

801
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,600
Okay

802
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,160
Brother Hao

803
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,360
Brother Hao, go back now

804
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,960
Brother Hao, I'm sorry

805
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,120
Brother, I'll see you tonight

806
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,000
Little brother

807
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,840
When you leave later

808
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,760
No need to clean this up

809
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,120
I'll take care of it later

810
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,000
Sorry about earlier

811
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,840
My apologies

812
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,400
Okay

813
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,320
Thank you, Brother Hao

814
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,000
I also remember our parents' names

815
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,720
You should have said so earlier

816
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,520
Father Guo, Mother Guo

817
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,160
Our family is

818
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,360
This Hao the cleaner is quite touching

819
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,320
He took the cleaning job to find his brother

820
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,200
But I think

821
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,480
Although he's desperate to find his brother

822
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
However

823
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,880
Installing surveillance cameras

824
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,560
in other people's homes

825
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:57,960
without permission

826
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,000
to spy on their privacy

827
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
is really crossing the line

828
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,680
That's really unacceptable

829
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,080
Right

830
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,280
It violates people's privacy rights

831
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,600
And using such methods

832
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,720
could easily lead to criminal acts

833
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,360
Yes

834
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,240
And what he said about

835
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,280
waiting for the right opportunity

836
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,760
No matter what

837
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,160
this is essentially fighting fire with fire

838
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,960
Exactly

839
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,280
Such approaches shouldn't be encouraged

840
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,520
Agreed

841
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,280
Who should we question next?

842
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,920
Can we search Xiaomei?

843
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,600
Can we investigate her?

844
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,560
Can we search?

845
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,680
Yes, we can

846
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,360
We can search

847
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,960
No

848
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,560
I mean interrogate her

849
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,680
Question her

850
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,880
Right, I'll have her brought in

851
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,800
Good

852
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,400
Song Huo often enters Xiaomei's place

853
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,880
when she's not home to move things

854
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,280
because she gets many packages

855
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,240
And Xiaomei

856
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,320
specifically mentioned in her videos

857
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,800
that

858
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,560
this delivery guy is very kind

859
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,200
and very helpful

860
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,560
She trusts Song Huo completely

861
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,360
She allows him

862
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,400
to enter her home

863
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:47,920
when she's away

864
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,560
to deliver packages

865
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,120
But who can prove

866
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,960
that when she's not home

867
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,560
Song Huo didn't enter on his own?

868
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,720
Let's get back on track

869
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,160
I've already unboxed this one

870
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,360
Let me unbox it for everyone first

871
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,560
It looks absolutely beautiful

872
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,160
And this...

873
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,400
is also a gift I bought for myself

874
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,160
to celebrate that I've finally

875
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,480
earned my first 500,000

876
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,440
She said she earned her first pot of gold

877
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,840
her first 500,000

878
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,520
500,000

879
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,200
But this definitely shows that

880
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,760
it demonstrates

881
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,400
Xiaomei is quite vain

882
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,680
This video reveals too much

883
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,840
personal private information

884
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,320
Right

885
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
If people with ill intentions see it

886
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,160
they would exploit it

887
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,240
They absolutely would

888
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,480
And then immediately after

889
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,160
another photo was posted

890
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,600
Judging by appearance

891
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,760
this should be Song Huo

892
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,240
Yes

893
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,360
That's why Fang Xiaomei

894
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,600
drew that mark on the clothes

895
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,440
Because in this investigation report

896
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,000
it's clearly photographed

897
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,480
There are two stripes on that clothing

898
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,840
So Xiaomei also has a "murder" motive

899
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,280
Of course she does

900
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,160
Because she believes

901
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,920
Song Huo might have "killed"

902
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,080
her beloved big brother

903
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,200
"Killed" her beloved Moonlight

904
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,080
Right

905
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,960
Come

906
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,360
Xiaomei even brought a quilt

907
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,160
Myself

908
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,440
Did you come by e-bike?

909
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:08,760
Xiaomei

910
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,440
Right.

911
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,320
How could you...

912
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,080
I told you...

913
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,640
If you have any questions for me...

914
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,320
you'd better be quick.

915
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,400
Because I'm about to start...

916
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,280
my live streaming time.

917
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,520
I need to go live now.

918
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,880
We're already live streaming here.

919
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,400
Look at your audience.

920
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,720
Ask quickly.

921
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,760
Go ahead and ask.

922
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,560
Come on, ask away.

923
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:31,920
You all...

924
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,680
Main interrogator.

925
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,400
You searched her place.

926
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,840
No, you searched her room.

927
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,760
What should we say...

928
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,200
How could you still...

929
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,920
Didn't I just tell you...

930
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,520
not to touch anything in my room?

931
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,160
What's wrong with you?

932
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,720
Xiaomei, look at us.

933
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,240
Stop looking at the surveillance behind you.

934
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,840
Very professional.

935
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,280
Yes, very camera-savvy.

936
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,800
Sorry.

937
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,360
Occupational habit.

938
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,120
As you all know...

939
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,640
I'm quite famous in the streaming world.

940
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,920
Xiaomei, are you close with Song Huo?

941
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,360
You two are always at home...

942
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,640
laughing and joking around.

943
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,360
You're "sick."

944
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,480
What nonsense are you spouting?

945
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,480
The surveillance shows...

946
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,920
We all saw it.

947
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,800
Aren't you an internet streamer?

948
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,760
Don't you always do live sales?

949
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,480
I don't do live sales.

950
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,080
Those are all free.

951
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,840
They're all giveaways.

952
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,320
Right.

953
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,160
Exactly.

954
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,880
Why is this woman talking nonsense?

955
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,080
What's your relationship with Song Huo?

956
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,400
Yes, what's your relationship with Song Huo?

957
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,280
What kind of relationship?

958
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,480
No particular relationship.

959
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,080
He delivers goods.

960
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,400
He helps me pick up packages.

961
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:32,960
That's all.

962
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,840
Then why would you let him

963
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,880
when you're not home

964
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,640
enter your house?

965
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,000
Right.

966
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,280
Why did you give him your door code?

967
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:39,800
Exactly.

968
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,520
If I'm not home

969
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,000
and my package gets stolen at the door, what then?

970
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,320
Those are all things I bought

971
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,040
with my hard-earned money.

972
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,120
Isn't it safer to put them inside?

973
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,840
If you put them in your house

974
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,560
they'd be safe too.

975
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,760
You mentioned your hard-earned money -

976
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,880
how did you earn it?

977
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,480
Well,

978
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
Because we

979
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,560
do live streaming.

980
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,200
Yes.

981
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,360
Because I

982
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,120
No,

983
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,400
wait.

984
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,280
It's like this:

985
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,600
Part of my work

986
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,440
involves agricultural support livestreams,

987
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,160
but another part

988
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,880
includes taking some advertising jobs,

989
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,200
shooting some videos,

990
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,000
which brings in some income.

991
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,800
Your first

992
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,040
Your first 500,000 yuan -

993
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,200
how did you earn that?

994
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,800
Just by doing these things.

995
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,920
Exactly these things.

996
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,720
Yes.

997
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,080
The first time you

998
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,800
You should...

999
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,760
Let me change my tone.

1000
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,840
The first time you

1001
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,560
saw that hole on your door

1002
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,280
the hole in the wall

1003
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,760
how did you discover it?

1004
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,640
I just noticed it one day when I came home

1005
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,040
You didn't report it to the police after finding it?

1006
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,000
I thought such a small matter

1007
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,040
wasn't worth bothering the police with

1008
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,200
But weren't you scared at all?

1009
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,840
You two from Beijing Film Academy

1010
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,920
What's going on?

1011
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,920
What are you two doing?

1012
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,080
Having a "magic duel" here, huh?

1013
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,000
Because I was scared

1014
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,760
Scared?

1015
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,120
You were scared?

1016
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,080
I was scared

1017
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,600
So I called security

1018
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,760
They helped me block it off temporarily

1019
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,320
Told me to wait for materials

1020
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,240
They'll fix it properly when the materials arrive

1021
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,840
You didn't go in to check either?

1022
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,960
Who would go in to check?

1023
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
It's really strange

1024
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,840
It must be something...

1025
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,280
Who knows

1026
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,800
Something scary inside

1027
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,440
Who's "crazy" enough

1028
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,000
to go in and look?

1029
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,600
The six of us went in to check

1030
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,840
Wait, hold on

1031
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,960
Let me ask you first

1032
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,520
This is your diary

1033
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,560
Of course it was Bai Sanwan who found it

1034
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,760
Has nothing to do with us

1035
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,720
On Valentine's Day 2021

1036
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,880
You and Cao Yueguang fell in love, right?

1037
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,520
Right

1038
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,280
And you say it so confidently

1039
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,920
Then on February 14th the following year

1040
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,680
He wanted to meet you

1041
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,840
Why were you afraid to see him?

1042
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,240
Is there a problem?

1043
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,480
No problem.

1044
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,400
Suffered quite a lot.

1045
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,360
Is it because you hadn't had plastic surgery back then?

1046
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,440
I've never had plastic surgery.

1047
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,360
Can someone please control her?

1048
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,160
Alright

1049
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,680
I got work done

1050
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,200
How is it?

1051
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,640
I had procedures done

1052
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,680
I'm sorry

1053
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,960
You blame me for your procedures?

1054
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,880
Of course, we shouldn't mock

1055
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,800
These things are

1056
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,040
Everyone has the desire to look beautiful

1057
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,360
I think it's perfectly normal

1058
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,360
The previous issue was

1059
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,240
Why haven't you met him?

1060
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,560
First

1061
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,240
I think the time we've spent together

1062
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,320
Hasn't been long enough

1063
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,760
It's been a whole year

1064
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,840
We just talk on the phone every day

1065
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,480
I'm a conservative woman

1066
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,880
So you gave your door passcode

1067
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,680
To Song Huo?

1068
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,400
Second, because before

1069
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,800
Weren't there always those

1070
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,120
Very strong filters?

1071
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120
I didn't want him to discover

1072
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,240
What I really look like

1073
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,800
But actually I shouldn't have done that

1074
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,840
You should be more confident

1075
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,680
There's one question though

1076
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,000
Did you ever notice before

1077
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,160
Whether Song Huo wore a watch or not?

1078
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
I noticed something.

1079
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,280
Seriously, that was way too much.

1080
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
Let me tell you,

1081
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,000
my boyfriend

1082
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,640
previously mentioned

1083
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,920
he was going to give me a watch.

1084
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,920
He even sent me pictures of it,

1085
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,880
so I knew exactly

1086
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,520
what that watch looked like.

1087
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,200
This is strange,

1088
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,120
because just the other day I saw

1089
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,600
it on Song Huo's wrist.

1090
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,920
Moreover,

1091
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,960
later his father told me

1092
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,080
he had "died."

1093
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,600
I was devastated,

1094
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,080
so heartbroken

1095
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,920
that I spent a fortune

1096
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,040
hiring a private investigator

1097
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,240
to look into this matter.

1098
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,080
He said he investigated

1099
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,360
my boyfriend and Song Huo

1100
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,400
and found they had a physical altercation.

1101
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,880
Then I noticed

1102
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,880
that person was wearing

1103
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,120
that exact outfit.

1104
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,040
The next day,

1105
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,120
when Song Huo delivered a package to our place,

1106
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,720
I saw him in that same clothing

1107
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,320
and he was wearing that watch too.

1108
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,920
And we also discovered

1109
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,280
Look

1110
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,000
In your diary

1111
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,680
You also noticed

1112
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,480
Song Huo must be

1113
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,360
the one who "killed" Cao Yueguang

1114
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,400
But this watch

1115
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,240
why is it with you now?

1116
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,000
Because Song Huo "died"

1117
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,040
Song Huo "died"

1118
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,760
Then I picked it up

1119
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,400
Song Huo "died"

1120
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,760
He "died" in that hole in your room

1121
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,840
Seriously?

1122
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,719
So you discovered Song Huo

1123
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,400
wearing what appeared to be your boyfriend's

1124
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,000
watch that was meant for you

1125
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,560
So you...

1126
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,440
Not just appeared to be

1127
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,880
He was actually wearing that exact watch

1128
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,480
So you confirmed

1129
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,120
that was indeed your boyfriend's watch

1130
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,600
So your boyfriend "died" again

1131
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,000
So you kept relaxing him

1132
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,840
making him lower his guard

1133
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,520
letting him come and go freely in your room

1134
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,199
so you could find the right moment

1135
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:33,760
to "kill" him

1136
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,199
Right?

1137
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,000
That's not the case

1138
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,400
Before my boyfriend went missing

1139
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,639
he could freely come and go

1140
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,320
from my room

1141
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,920
She knew Song Huo first

1142
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,960
Because Song Huo always helped her with deliveries

1143
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,600
That's why Song Huo could enter her room

1144
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,639
and see her phone

1145
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:50,960
Right

1146
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,440
That's how he saw Yueguang had five million

1147
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:53,880
Exactly

1148
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,440
Then he could rob Yueguang

1149
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:55,679
Right?

1150
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,520
You discovered

1151
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,520
On the 15th

1152
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,440
Cao Yueguang

1153
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,440
was likely murdered

1154
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,360
and all his money was stolen

1155
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,840
And you found that his murderer

1156
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,200
was most likely Song Huo

1157
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,000
Yes

1158
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,160
So now you hate Song Huo

1159
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,440
Isn't that right?

1160
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,240
You hate him to death

1161
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,720
Since you hate him

1162
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,840
did you consider killing him?

1163
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,480
Of course, I wanted to kill him

1164
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,720
Then tell us specifically about your crime process

1165
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
How did you kill him?

1166
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,600
What do you mean?

1167
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,640
You hate him

1168
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,320
but you chose not to act

1169
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Yet he's around

1170
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,560
in your daily life

1171
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:36,920
Right

1172
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,600
You could easily have acted

1173
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,000
Revenge is a dish best served cold

1174
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,760
This is just the beginning

1175
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,960
This morning

1176
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,160
Between 10:30 and 11:00

1177
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,080
Where were you?

1178
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,800
After I finished my makeup this morning

1179
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,280
Around 10:30

1180
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,840
I was planning to go live

1181
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,560
But

1182
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,640
Around 11:00

1183
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,760
I noticed there was a sudden power outage

1184
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,440
Then I heard a cat meowing

1185
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,760
I’m terrified of cats

1186
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,520
So I ran outside

1187
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,760
And then I ran into you

1188
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,560
So you left your room at 11:00

1189
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,120
Right?

1190
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,600
Yes

1191
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,440
Xiaomei

1192
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,320
Do you know whose phone this is?

1193
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,080
It's mine.

1194
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,160
Can't you see my photo on the lockscreen?

1195
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,560
Why do you have so many...

1196
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,080
...home door passcodes?

1197
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,360
This is because...

1198
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,680
This belongs to Song Huo.

1199
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,880
After I found out,

1200
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,080
I thought he was suspicious,

1201
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,280
so I saved the pictures.

1202
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,400
Isn't this yours?

1203
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,200
It is mine.

1204
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,080
Why do you have two phones?

1205
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,160
Is it abnormal to have two phones?

1206
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,280
One is for livestreaming,

1207
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,600
the other is for daily use.

1208
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,560
Do you have any other questions for me?

1209
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,760
I need to go live now.

1210
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,360
Did you know

1211
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,080
that Moonlight has actually been protecting you all along?

1212
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,760
Moonlight "died."

1213
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,400
No,

1214
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,920
he didn't "die."

1215
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,680
He didn't.

1216
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,440
What do you mean?

1217
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,280
Look here.

1218
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,920
Hello.

1219
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,800
Do you know me?

1220
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,040
How would I know you?

1221
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,920
Didn't we just meet today?

1222
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,960
My name is Liu Xialai.

1223
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,120
I don't even know your names.

1224
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,920
Now,

1225
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,240
I sent you a WeChat message.

1226
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,720
To tell you

1227
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,440
that I changed from Cao Yueguang to Liu Xialai.

1228
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,560
I had plastic surgery.

1229
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,640
I'm coming to see you now.

1230
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,760
You're really strange.

1231
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,720
I had plastic surgery, and so did you?

1232
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,440
Are you "crazy"?

1233
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,680
You're crazily imitating me, aren't you?

1234
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,400
And what's really strange is

1235
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,000
why are you pretending to be my boyfriend?

1236
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,320
You're really such a weird person

1237
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,640
No,

1238
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,720
I previously transferred a lot of money to you

1239
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,240
Are you saying that

1240
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,600
we had some financial transaction?

1241
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,240
Let me tell you,

1242
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,360
I'm going to report this to the police now

1243
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,320
What do you mean?

1244
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:41,880
No,

1245
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,520
I have records

1246
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,200
Wait, let me explain for her

1247
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,040
It was Song Huo

1248
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,120
who made you think it was her

1249
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,640
but actually it wasn't her

1250
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,080
You've been communicating with Song Huo all along

1251
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,360
So all your money went to Song Huo

1252
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,240
That 120,000 is with Song Huo

1253
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,120
Song Huo was deceiving both sides

1254
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,760
Right

1255
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,320
I didn't know

1256
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,200
I genuinely didn't know

1257
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,240
I don't even understand what you're talking about

1258
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,720
I wouldn't ask you for money

1259
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,440
This is very strange

1260
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,200
Do you have anything to prove it's really you?

1261
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,520
There's one thing that can prove it

1262
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,080
This watch

1263
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,640
I was the one who bought this watch

1264
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,440
It's one of a unique pair

1265
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,280
Because this watch was custom-made

1266
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,320
and you can only customize one pair in a lifetime

1267
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,960
I was really looking forward

1268
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,280
to seeing this watch on your wrist

1269
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,840
I do know about the watch

1270
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,840
Isn't that right?

1271
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,800
I also know your favorite song

1272
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
called "A Beam of Light in the Darkness"

1273
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,280
Am I right?

1274
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,080
Wait a moment, stop singing for now.

1275
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,520
Turn it off first.

1276
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
The watch first, right?

1277
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,440
Yes.

1278
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,680
You don't want money, you want the watch.

1279
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,800
So do you believe I'm Cao Yueguang now?

1280
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,720
Put the watch on first.

1281
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,560
That's how it is.

1282
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,800
Let's sing now.

1283
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,120
That's right, it's me.

1284
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,880
Please sit down first.

1285
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,640
Alright, okay.

1286
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,840
Because he called me before.

1287
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,680
Heard this song.

1288
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,720
I thought the voices sounded somewhat similar.

1289
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,360
But I...

1290
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,240
I am...

1291
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,680
Mei Mei Planet.

1292
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,040
My WeChat name is Moonlight Treasure Box.

1293
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,160
So it really is you.

1294
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,840
Who else would it be?

1295
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,800
Well then.

1296
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,840
I believe you.

1297
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,560
Thank you.

1298
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,200
So you now have five million.

1299
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,480
That's correct, yes.

1300
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,840
Let's just take these five million.

1301
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,960
And live off it for life.

1302
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,080
Now I need to think about it.

1303
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,040
Wait a minute.

1304
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,440
You're saying...

1305
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,560
Now that this person is "dead".

1306
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,480
And then...

1307
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,560
The suspects could be you.

1308
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,160
Your girlfriend.

1309
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,720
Or your brother.

1310
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,440
Basically someone from your family.

1311
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,400
Just your family.

1312
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,560
So, one person from your family.

1313
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,800
Must be named as the "killer".

1314
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,280
For this case.

1315
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,880
This is how it ends, right?

1316
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,320
That's correct.

1317
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,360
Either sacrifice a family member for justice.

1318
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,840
Or sacrifice your "wife" for justice.

1319
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,320
Right, or sacrifice yourself.

1320
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,160
End it yourself.

1321
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,800
Xiao Mei.

1322
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,960
Did you know there's...

1323
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,160
Another girl in your family?

1324
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,960
Don't scare me.

1325
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,920
Our home is so small.

1326
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,040
How could another girl live there?

1327
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,320
It's just that after you leave.

1328
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,640
There's another girl present.

1329
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,520
Are there any of your colleagues

1330
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,480
or anyone else

1331
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,240
or perhaps your password

1332
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,640
other than Song Huo knowing it

1333
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,880
does anyone else know?

1334
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,720
I don't know

1335
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,480
Then who is that woman?

1336
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,360
I think we've asked enough questions.

1337
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,400
Let's go back, Xiaomei.

1338
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,520
You really scared everyone today.

1339
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,280
I'll head out first.

1340
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,880
Have a good livestream.

1341
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,600
Good luck.

1342
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,840
Remember to send me gifts.

1343
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,160
Bye.

1344
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,960
I thought you didn't want gifts?

1345
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,440
Everyone, this is Xiaomei.

1346
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,480
Actually, we later discovered...

1347
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,520
that a series of incidents...

1348
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,520
were all because of Song Huo.

1349
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,240
He saw...

1350
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,480
some of Xiaomei's private information.

1351
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:09,760
Right.

1352
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,080
Actually, Xiaomei didn't do a good job...

1353
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,560
protecting her own privacy.

1354
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,840
There are many new apps nowadays...

1355
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,960
that when you click on them...

1356
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,560
your personal information...

1357
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,000
might get violated.

1358
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,920
It gets leaked.

1359
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,240
That's right.

1360
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,400
Don't click on these apps.

1361
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:20,880
Yes.

1362
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,440
But there's another thing...

1363
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,240
The abandoned electrical room...

1364
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,160
First, it was definitely abandoned.

1365
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,640
First, it was definitely abandoned.

1366
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,240
Suddenly...

1367
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,720
Thank you.

1368
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,720
it was activated.

1369
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,760
Then we discovered...

1370
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,120
that abandoned electrical room...

1371
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,680
was deliberately set up.

1372
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,480
Because behind the door...

1373
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,520
we found a wire...

1374
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,760
that could connect to the doorknob.

1375
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,320
Right.

1376
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,840
So that "killer"...

1377
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,400
didn't need to be there at the time.

1378
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:49,600
Right.

1379
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,280
He just needed to set this up in advance...

1380
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,800
and that's it.

1381
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,960
When we were on the sixth floor...

1382
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,000
wasn't the hallway also locked?

1383
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,200
Don't be like this

1384
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,160
Bro

1385
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,800
The person who locked the stairwell

1386
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,400
and the one who turned on the abandoned power room's switch

1387
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,440
might be the same person

1388
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,280
The electrician said it like this

1389
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,080
He said the three circuits are independent

1390
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,680
But all three circuits

1391
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,320
can be controlled from the first floor

1392
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,080
The hallway lights

1393
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,960
Is it possible that earlier

1394
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,600
Is it possible that earlier

1395
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,120
were already turned off from the first floor

1396
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,200
When Song Huo touched the door handle

1397
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,600
it caused an electric short circuit

1398
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,320
Which then led to

1399
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,880
all the sixth floor lights turning off

1400
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,440
But when the old man went to fix it

1401
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,720
But when the old man went to fix it

1402
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,240
He clearly fixed everything

1403
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,400
but found the hallway lights were still off

1404
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,920
Then he learned that

1405
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,440
that circuit had been turned off on the first floor

1406
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,640
Right, we don't know who

1407
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,960
turned off the hallway lights

1408
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,440
or when they were turned off

1409
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,320
But ordinary people wouldn't go to

1410
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,880
the abandoned power distribution room

1411
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,600
So Song Huo must have been lured there

1412
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,120
Right

1413
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,760
So did you two arrange to meet at the power room?

1414
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
No, he didn't arrange to meet me

1415
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,240
Then who was Song Huo meeting?

1416
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,840
Let's go take another look, okay?

1417
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,560
Okay

1418
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:16,560
Come on

1419
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,320
Let's go, everyone

1420
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,880
Song Huo, how did you "die"?

1421
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,840
Search for evidence

1422
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,320
Where to?

1423
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,600
Sixth floor

1424
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,880
To Xiaomei's place

1425
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,720
Let's go

1426
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,320
There's another suspicious point

1427
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,480
One more doubt remains

1428
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,640
You're acting very strange today

1429
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,800
Do you have multiple personalities?

1430
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,320
Tell me

1431
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,440
Are you all crazy?

1432
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,200
You're saying the exact same things as Fang Xiaomei

1433
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,320
You two must be connected

1434
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,520
There's something going on between you

1435
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,240
You're "sick"

1436
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,800
What nonsense are you spouting?

1437
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,000
Fine

1438
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,520
We've come back to

1439
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,560
Fang Xiaomei's room

1440
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,760
This is a hidden camera

1441
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,480
See? Right here

1442
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,640
Yes, this is what captured it

1443
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,920
This is the camera Hao the cleaner placed

1444
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,880
Covered with this

1445
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,320
Right, only this was on the sofa at the time

1446
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:30,760
Look

1447
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,600
Check for any clues

1448
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,000
See how that person

1449
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,280
appeared in this room

1450
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:36,760
What's that sound?

1451
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,480
Out of power

1452
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,040
That's a phone dying sound

1453
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,920
Whose phone died?

1454
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,080
She has another phone

1455
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,960
She's got a second phone

1456
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:49,880
Ventilation duct

1457
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,080
Here

1458
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:51,520
Where?

1459
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,720
Bro, slow down

1460
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,360
I think

1461
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,120
It's inside here

1462
00:45:59,120 --> 00:45:59,920
It must be here

1463
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,120
There's a camera here

1464
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,840
Another camera

1465
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,000
Here's a camera

1466
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,000
There's a passage inside

1467
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,200
A very wide one

1468
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:17,960
Then how do we get up?

1469
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,000
We really can't climb this

1470
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,800
There's a pair of jeans

1471
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,600
Maybe we need to find the entrance

1472
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
There's definitely a door

1473
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,640
I think it's here

1474
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,680
Are you sure there's something there, right?

1475
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,720
Don't you...

1476
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,680
Don't come rushing down

1477
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:44,840
It definitely is

1478
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,360
Alright, I shouldn't look then

1479
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:47,840
I think...

1480
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,200
Okay

1481
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:48,880
I'm not worthy

1482
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,640
Good

1483
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,480
I don't deserve it

1484
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,800
Outside

1485
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,040
Check if there's anything in the hallway

1486
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,320
No, look for...

1487
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,960
Something like a vent opening

1488
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,120
Ventilation duct

1489
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,800
There's nothing back here

1490
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,760
The entrance to the ventilation duct

1491
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,520
It might be in the abandoned passageway

1492
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,400
The secret passage is inside. Let's go.

1493
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,720
How do you all get in like this?

1494
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,760
Because we're small enough.

1495
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,280
Ventilation duct

1496
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,120
I don't think it's here

1497
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,280
It might be over there

1498
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,080
Then it's here

1499
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:40,920
Where?

1500
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,400
Here

1501
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:41,800
Aim for that

1502
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,640
Poke it with a stick

1503
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,040
It can be opened

1504
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,600
We need to go up

1505
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,320
We'll need something to step on to get up

1506
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,840
Do we need a ladder?

1507
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,520
Yes

1508
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,920
Ask Xiao He if he has a ladder

1509
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,320
I'll contact Xiao He

1510
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,520
Sealed in February 2012

1511
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,880
You...

1512
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,360
Are you guys inside?

1513
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,960
Are you there?

1514
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,880
Here

1515
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,640
I've brought the ladder

1516
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,080
Thank you so much

1517
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:18,960
Here

1518
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,040
Come help us pass it

1519
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,680
It's big, be careful

1520
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,320
Okay

1521
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,080
Come on

1522
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:23,760
Be careful

1523
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,560
Watch your fingers

1524
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,240
It's fine

1525
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,240
Great

1526
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,360
And this ladder

1527
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,680
You need to fully extend it to be stable

1528
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,440
Okay

1529
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,520
Alright, be safe

1530
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,160
Okay

1531
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,120
So, who's going up?

1532
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:36,880
Me

1533
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,360
Going up

1534
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,800
Did you give him the flashlight?

1535
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,680
Yes.

1536
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,160
There's a light.

1537
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:01,880
We have a light.

1538
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,520
Is it big?

1539
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,320
Quite big.

1540
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,880
When this camera's battery is low,

1541
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,200
it will emit intermittent alert sounds.

1542
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,440
Please charge it promptly.

1543
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,760
Do you have a phone?

1544
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,640
Even recording a video would work.

1545
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,400
We'll give you all the clues

1546
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,480
we can find first.

1547
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,520
Look what this is.

1548
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,080
Steamed buns, shaomai.

1549
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,440
"I'm So Hungry" order.

1550
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,560
It's a food delivery order.

1551
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,320
What Mei?

1552
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,880
Ms. Something-Mei.

1553
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,520
Xiaomei.

1554
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,920
Apartment B120.

1555
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,680
Throw it! Let go!

1556
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,520
Clothes.

1557
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,760
Does this lead somewhere else?

1558
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,040
Yes.

1559
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,320
Where else does it lead to?

1560
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,400
It can go to other places.

1561
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,320
This looks like a bedroom

1562
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,040
Don't you think?

1563
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,320
Yeah, he sleeps here

1564
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,160
It really does look like a bedroom

1565
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,400
Check that piece of paper

1566
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,800
See if there's anything underneath

1567
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:47,920
Nothing there

1568
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,840
Nothing on the edges either

1569
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,720
Kinda gives off that "Parasite" vibe

1570
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,960
What's below this?

1571
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,720
It's directly

1572
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,040
the hallway

1573
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,680
stairwell

1574
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,680
Got it, this is the spot

1575
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,560
Where exactly are you?

1576
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,560
We're in the stairwell

1577
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,280
Right outside the door

1578
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:03,920
the hallway

1579
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,240
So he needs to keep

1580
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,280
the hallway lights off

1581
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,720
so he can escape through here

1582
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,080
and won't be caught on camera

1583
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,320
because the hallway lights are off

1584
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:10,800
Exactly

1585
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,360
Is this as far as you can go?

1586
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:13,760
This is the end

1587
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,520
Already at the end

1588
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,080
Alright, we can go down now

1589
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:16,520
Let's go

1590
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,600
You can close this door

1591
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,160
I can do it

1592
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,360
Don't close the door

1593
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,280
Keep it open

1594
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,280
We need to leave it open as a marker

1595
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,280
Leave it open

1596
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,720
Should we go down?

1597
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,120
Anything left up top?

1598
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,320
No, we checked

1599
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,760
Just confirming someone lives there

1600
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,560
There are laid-out boards up there

1601
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:38,840
Cardboard sheets

1602
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,800
It's like

1603
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,760
they're squatting here

1604
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,480
Like a temporary living space

1605
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,480
Actually, not temporary

1606
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,520
They might actually live there

1607
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,680
What was written on that paper just now?

1608
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,120
You mean the takeout order?

1609
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,680
One steamed bun and one shaomai

1610
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,560
Three yuan

1611
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,720
Deliver to

1612
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,880
B120

1613
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,680
Basement level 1

1614
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,520
Let's go to basement level 1

1615
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,480
Let's take a look at B120

1616
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,480
Then let's go out

1617
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,360
Is there nothing left in this area?

1618
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:13,840
Let's go

1619
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,040
Was there anything else suspicious earlier?

1620
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:17,680
Nothing

1621
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,160
Just that piece of clothing and the takeout order

1622
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,280
Did you take the takeout order?

1623
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:20,800
Took it

1624
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,360
Got it

1625
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,440
Whose clothes are these?

1626
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,720
Let's check if there's anything in the pockets

1627
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,280
I've already checked

1628
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:24,760
Nothing left

1629
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,360
Nothing at all

1630
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,960
We're collecting evidence very thoroughly now

1631
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,400
We've improved

1632
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,600
At least we're not like last time

1633
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,160
There is

1634
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:34,920
Keys

1635
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,600
There are keys

1636
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,080
I told you

1637
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,000
Good thing we took the clothes

1638
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,480
B120

1639
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,560
This is my first time here.

1640
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,840
A hub for trends.

1641
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,400
There's another section.

1642
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,680
My noodle shop will open soon.

1643
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,720
You should come when it opens.

1644
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,240
B120

1645
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:01,880
Does this move?

1646
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,040
I suspect it's a real person.

1647
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,000
I also think it looks like a real person.

1648
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,560
What are you doing?

1649
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,480
I knew it!

1650
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,520
Take this! (kicks)

1651
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,520
What's going on?

1652
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,280
Angry

1653
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:15,680
Thank you

1654
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,160
Scan the code to get a free power bank

1655
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,760
So you're just giving us power banks, right?

1656
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,400
You want to hug her, don't you?

1657
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,600
You want to hug Song Piaoliang

1658
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,680
Give her a hug

1659
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,040
Not you

1660
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:28,880
Not me

1661
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,040
You want to hug Bai Sanwan

1662
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,800
He wants to hug Bai Sanwan

1663
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,960
Come here

1664
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,800
You only hug Sanwan

1665
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,600
This means you two are suspects

1666
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,360
What are you talking about?

1667
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,640
Are you Miao Miao?

1668
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,800
You're Miao Miao's personification, right?

1669
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,280
Yes, he is Miao Miao

1670
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,200
Goodbye

1671
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:55,920
Bye bye kitty

1672
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,280
Goodbye

1673
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,240
Goodbye

1674
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,080
Love you

1675
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,560
He says he loves you all

1676
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,120
Love you

1677
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,720
Fragrant dried fruits

1678
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,320
Delicious and affordable

1679
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,200
Family tradition screen protectors

1680
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:04,920
Boss, apply one for me

1681
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,120
Here

1682
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,600
This way

1683
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,200
This is B120.

1684
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,200
But there's one problem.

1685
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,200
First, this lock

1686
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,120
is practically useless

1687
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,760
But the bottom part is broken, see?

1688
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,160
Yes, indeed

1689
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,000
What kind of place is this?

1690
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,240
I "killed" Zhou Keke by dropping him

1691
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,000
It's open

1692
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,360
Do not approach the abandoned power distribution room

1693
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,440
Disobedience will lead to "death"

1694
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,480
Disobedience will lead to "death"

1695
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,960
Song Huo has "died"

1696
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,960
One link leads to another

1697
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,960
Are you or aren't you Fang Xiaomei?

1698
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,240
I am Fang Xiaomei

1699
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,880
You look like that person

1700
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,760
She's a twin

1701
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,600
The real and fake Monkey King

1702
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,360
Quick, restrain her!

1703
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,120
There's something wrong with her

1704
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,640
The positions of the two rooms are

1705
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,800
Exactly the same

1706
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,720
This is incredible

1707
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,560
This too

1708
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,680
New place

1709
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,240
Come

1710
