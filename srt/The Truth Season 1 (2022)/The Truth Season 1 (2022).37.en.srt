1
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,840
I'm getting married.

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,920
You're getting married.

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,480
You're getting married.

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,360
But I'm not the groom.

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,400
Not me.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,360
I have a father.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,240
Called "Tuinengcha."

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,480
You're not "Tuinengcha."

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,720
Your dad is called Tuihui(cha).

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,640
My eyesight is very good.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,720
And I wear glasses.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,840
So is it good or not?

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,240
Don't people wear glasses because their eyesight is bad?

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,160
You owe me 128.

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,600
You owe that much?

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:41,960
What about you?

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
You owe 136.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,800
You owe even more.

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,400
Hey, you there.

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,760
Song Piaoliang, come pay for me.

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,640
Why should I?

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,160
Do I look like a sucker to you?

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,240
And then we...

24
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,800
If we do it ourselves, there's no charge.

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,160
Well, if that's the case...

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,040
Since that's how it is...

27
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
A noodle shop owner.

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,280
Garlic and cilantro are free, huh?

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,840
Bro, mix some cilantro with vinegar for me.

30
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,680
My breakfast costs twenty-eight.

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,120
Do I have to pay if I eat too?

32
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,960
Of course.

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,320
For someone like me who only cares about money...

34
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,240
I raised you through thick and thin.

35
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,000
When I sleep,

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,320
I like to listen to something.

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,800
I listen to Guo Qilin's crosstalk too.

38
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,400
Guo Qilin's crosstalk, right?

39
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,120
Then you have good taste.

40
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,040
When I want to listen to music,

41
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,760
it's Modern Brothers Liu Yuning and Zhou Shen.

42
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:19,800
Right.

43
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,760
When I want to watch dramas,

44
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,000
it's Bai Yu and Song Zuer.

45
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Haven't you seen my phone?

46
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,280
My favorite boy band

47
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,000
is INTO1.

48
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,160
Right.

49
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
INTO1's Zhou Keyu.

50
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,960
Right?

51
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,880
What a bunch of hypocrites.

52
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
I got married, bro

53
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
Congratulations

54
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,160
Really?

55
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,080
With that doll-like girl

56
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,400
She gave me a huge diamond ring

57
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,800
Pretty good, right?

58
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,120
Not bad

59
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,480
Wish you happiness

60
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,400
I definitely will be

61
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Everything happened in an instant

62
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,720
That was our moment

63
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,800
Not everyone's here yet, right?

64
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,040
Guo (Baoyou)

65
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,920
Gone "killing" again

66
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,640
And Liu (Xialai)

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,640
Yes, both of them

68
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,400
Committing crimes together

69
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,520
So beautiful

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,160
You're being so perfunctory

71
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,560
You didn't even see clearly

72
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,520
Really beautiful

73
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
He is

74
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,000
Truly handsome

75
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,520
I didn't

76
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
Judge by looks

77
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,760
You're being too casual

78
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,720
So handsome

79
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,080
Too perfunctory

80
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,160
Handsome

81
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,640
Really

82
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,360
Such youthful energy

83
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,120
One adjective for each person

84
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,960
The teahouse by the road

85
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,280
Figures coming and going

86
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,760
He understands

87
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,160
I can't afford to give

88
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,440
Hello, camera

89
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,960
This painting represents

90
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,480
our ideal dorm life together

91
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,640
just the two of us living together

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,720
and then

93
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,120
this is Brother Bear, and this is me

94
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,760
Actually,

95
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,200
I have another identity

96
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,960
which is

97
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,840
the founder of the "Tui Hui Cha" Detective Agency

98
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,720
"Tui Hui Cha"

99
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,560
's son

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:50,960
Tui

101
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,320
Hui

102
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,760
Cha

103
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,960
After checking the surveillance

104
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,760
I discovered that

105
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,600
last night, all of you

106
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,880
came here

107
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,680
Show me the evidence

108
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,960
I have the surveillance footage

109
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,360
Is it possible that someone else

110
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,480
was wearing one of our (masks)

111
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,720
Right

112
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,480
Isn't that so

113
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,800
My eyesight is very good

114
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,880
And I wear glasses

115
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,000
I can definitely see clearly

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,120
Every single one of your faces

117
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,960
Is it good or not?

118
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,360
Don't people wear glasses because of poor eyesight?

119
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,640
No, those "bodies"

120
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,160
Kept falling right beside you

121
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,560
How could you not see anything?

122
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,440
You "Tui Huicha"

123
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,480
Did someone fall?

124
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,320
Didn't see anything

125
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,960
What happened?

126
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,640
You're pretending not to see again

127
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,360
See what?

128
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,400
My eyesight is very good

129
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
I

130
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,240
Can't catch

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
I'm different from you

132
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm not an orphan

133
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,120
I have a father

134
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,160
Named "Tui Nengcha"

135
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,400
I also have another identity

136
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,720
That is "Tui Huicha"

137
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,560
's son

138
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:41,920
Tui

139
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,280
Neng

140
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,760
Cha

141
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,440
You're not "Tui Nengcha"

142
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,000
Your father is called Tui Hui(cha)

143
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,680
I have a father named "Tui Huicha"

144
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,920
Yes, I am "Tui Nengcha"

145
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,520
Come, follow me inside

146
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,440
This noon

147
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,680
Though Teng Zhongjie commissioned me

148
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,880
But no matter how I knocked, he didn't answer

149
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,400
Then you're also suspicious

150
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,120
You "killed" someone

151
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,560
Then deliberately

152
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:06,920
Isn't that right?

153
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,320
Yes

154
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,360
Yes

155
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,720
You're very suspicious

156
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,280
Okay

157
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,160
In that case

158
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,440
All six of you

159
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,040
are connected to this case

160
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,000
and are all suspects

161
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,800
I admit

162
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,560
I confess

163
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,000
I admit

164
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,000
It was all of us

165
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,920
who "killed" him together

166
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,800
Let's go to jail now

167
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,400
That way

168
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,560
we can keep each other company, right?

169
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,480
Fine

170
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,400
We'll confess together later

171
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,040
Don't rush

172
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,520
Let me prepare first

173
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,440
The amount of information

174
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,720
is a bit overwhelming

175
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
For my "investigative abilities"

176
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,600
it's too much

177
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Right

178
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,160
Are you a single-core processor?

179
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,240
Even single-core processors aren't this

180
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,600
So I hope you can

181
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,240
monitor each other

182
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,680
and help me investigate this case together

183
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,160
I refuse

184
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,640
We don't want to cooperate with other groups

185
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,280
The rest of you

186
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
don't you want to prove

187
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,040
your innocence?

188
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Not really

189
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,880
No need for that

190
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,720
No one suspects us except you

191
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,360
We could just eliminate you

192
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,440
Wouldn't that solve it?

193
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,120
Come on

194
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,680
Then you'll become

195
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,720
another "murder" case

196
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,840
Enough talk, I'm picking up my little hammer

197
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,760
Here, you guys watch him

198
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll go stack the cards, wait a moment

199
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,080
I've already

200
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,320
prepared the Zhenguoli推理包

201
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,200
for everyone

202
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,440
Please help yourselves to it

203
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,880
Where's the bag with the dog badge?

204
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,520
The one with the puppy

205
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:42,880
Who?

206
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,640
Are you the dog?

207
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,680
You are the dog

208
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,400
You're really the dog

209
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Three-Bowl Brother

210
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,280
Do you want to take a handheld camera too?

211
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,960
Why?

212
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,120
Okay, I'm starting

213
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,880
I'm the recorder

214
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,200
It's so dim over here

215
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,600
Now you find the angle with the camera

216
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,960
The push-in effect feels great

217
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,920
Cinematic feel

218
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,080
Breathing rhythm

219
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,680
Breathing sensation

220
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,320
Who has it?

221
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,000
No, this is a walkie-talkie

222
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No, this is a Polaroid camera

223
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,280
Yes, inside the bag

224
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,800
Look for it

225
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,120
Really

226
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,800
Endless

227
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,120
I'm not the one with the dog

228
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,480
I'm the one with the handheld camera

229
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,120
It's you again

230
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,120
Give me the walkie-talkie

231
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,840
The chosen one

232
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,720
Is this card full?

233
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,360
Done.

234
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
What does double-click do?

235
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,720
Double-click means...

236
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,360
No.

237
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,080
Center alignment.

238
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,600
Right.

239
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
Triple-click makes it reverse direction.

240
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,800
Okay.

241
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,280
When Brother Liu ran just now...

242
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,120
You know what it looked like?

243
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,640
Early humans trying to tame their legs.

244
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,240
Two legs.

245
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,080
Exactly like early humans learning to use their legs.

246
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,320
Did you see that post online?

247
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,120
They said Brother Liu and Ke Wuku's legs...

248
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,200
Would measure four meters combined.

249
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,720
When you need to go upstairs...

250
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,040
Just connect their legs and you can climb up.

251
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,920
Is that polite?

252
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,520
I'm getting married.

253
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,400
You're getting married.

254
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,800
Getting married.

255
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,000
You're getting married.

256
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,560
You're getting married.

257
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,640
But the groom isn't me.

258
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,480
Not me.

259
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,760
Such a hot song.

260
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,159
Our pop music.

261
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,600
This song sounds so good.

262
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,880
Sounds great.

263
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,440
If you're going to marry someone

264
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,560
Don't marry anyone else

265
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,880
Our pop music

266
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,120
You're so early today

267
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,720
Morning

268
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,080
Morning

269
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,360
Morning

270
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,400
What's for breakfast?

271
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,800
Morning

272
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,200
We have everything available for breakfast

273
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,320
Take a look

274
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,280
Breakfast is eighteen

275
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,560
But previously you

276
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,040
Had some credit with me

277
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,000
Your card has 100 yuan

278
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,200
After deducting

279
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,160
It might not be enough to cover

280
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,200
This time's bill

281
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,480
Let me check mine

282
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
I also have 100, right?

283
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,800
How much do we each owe?

284
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,560
You owe me 128

285
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,000
You owe that much?

286
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,360
And you?

287
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
You owe 136

288
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,200
Even more

289
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,080
Right

290
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,320
Also our restaurant has one rule

291
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,200
Which is

292
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
If you work here

293
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,560
You don't have to pay

294
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,120
Well in that case

295
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,040
Since that's the case, how about

296
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,080
A noodle shop owner

297
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,480
Should show his skills, right?

298
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,240
Isn't that so?

299
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,280
And noodles, you're really going to knead them?

300
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,400
I don't believe there's anyone under heaven besides me

301
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,160
who's this handsome and can also cook

302
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,760
You're actually the second one

303
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,400
That's right

304
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,120
It's me

305
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,000
Hello

306
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,240
Morning

307
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,200
You're here

308
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,040
Do you have money on your card?

309
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,760
I don't have a card

310
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
No card? What are you eating, "Miss Beauty"?

311
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,400
I can't eat today

312
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,160
How much?

313
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,200
For one breakfast

314
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Breakfast is eighteen

315
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,240
Let me check how much I have

316
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,560
Still quite wealthy

317
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,280
But you still owe us eighty

318
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,040
I owe eighty?

319
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,320
Yes

320
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,160
I owe eighty?

321
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,640
Yes

322
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,200
Because you never topped up your card

323
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,240
You've already owed eighty

324
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,040
Right

325
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,000
I can't stay in this apartment anymore

326
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,400
Bro

327
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
You're making noodles now

328
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,520
These gloves are a bit restrictive

329
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:46,960
A bit

330
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,480
Affecting my performance

331
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,560
They're affecting my performance, you know

332
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,320
Then what wouldn't affect your performance?

333
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,400
Just bare hands

334
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,160
Let you taste

335
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,200
The flavor of my hand sweat

336
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,640
You know what?

337
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,120
This is the soul of noodle-making

338
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,760
So we should call this bowl "Three Bowls of Sweat"

339
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,880
Bro

340
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,360
It's fine

341
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,600
Brother Liu, hold that corner of his clothes

342
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,720
Let's each hold one side

343
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
You really look like you know how to knead dough

344
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,720
You can actually cook

345
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,040
Of course I can, I run a restaurant

346
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,480
Right?

347
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,000
Kneading very...

348
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,640
...vigorously

349
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,320
Bro, are you hungry?

350
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,440
Maybe you should have some breakfast first

351
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,040
Then come back to knead

352
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,000
It's fine, if you're hungry you can eat first

353
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
I've already asked my restaurant

354
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,800
to prepare the sauce in advance

355
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,640
We'll have noodles with sauce

356
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,840
Tomato and egg

357
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,920
noodles with sauce

358
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,480
How about it?

359
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,280
What should I do?

360
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,800
I don't dare eat

361
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,520
Why?

362
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,640
My stomach feels terrible

363
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,600
I thought you suspected our canteen

364
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,760
had problems

365
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,520
Don't worry

366
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,760
I am...

367
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,320
...perfectly healthy

368
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
No, you're the healthy one.

369
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,960
But I don't trust my stomach.

370
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,080
We could try fighting poison with poison.

371
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,720
You guys keep searching for evidence later.

372
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,960
I'll be absent, constantly running to the bathroom.

373
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
I'll give you the walkie-talkie.

374
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,240
You can communicate with them this way.

375
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,880
You're not feeling well today.

376
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,760
That's why you felt bad when waking up this morning.

377
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,080
We have the honor.

378
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,000
to eat Bai Sanwan's noodles again.

379
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Today's the last episode (of recording), so...

380
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:14,800
No.

381
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,760
But shouldn't we be eating dumplings?

382
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,520
Long welcome, short farewell.

383
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:18,800
No.

384
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,000
Dumplings for departure, noodles for arrival.

385
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,960
We're about to finish.

386
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,800
We've arrived.

387
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,320
Right.

388
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,520
The dough is almost ready.

389
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,320
Now we'll turn it into noodles.

390
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,160
Okay.

391
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,400
Alright.

392
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,440
Good, what should we do now?

393
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,680
How do we transform this lump of dough.

394
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,880
into noodle strands?

395
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,000
This stretching...

396
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,800
Are we stretching the noodles?

397
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,240
You know, like this.

398
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,360
Alright, I'll do it like this

399
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,600
Okay, the noodles are ready

400
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,880
So fast you can barely see it

401
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,640
How about that?

402
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,080
This is

403
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,120
The self-cultivation of a noodle shop owner

404
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,680
They're already cooked

405
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,560
We can put the noodles in now

406
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,280
Here's the water, come on

407
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,360
This is water

408
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,000
Of course we know it's water

409
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,640
Right, we'll cook them fresh now

410
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,360
This looks so delicious

411
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,400
Can't eat this, right?

412
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,520
Just have a little, it's fine

413
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
It's okay, I want to eat it

414
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,680
Right, did you swipe your card?

415
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,200
No card

416
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,160
Didn't swipe

417
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,800
Then what will you eat?

418
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,920
Today we'll all have to share your bowl of noodles

419
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,680
I won't eat

420
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,320
I'll just chat with you from the side

421
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,720
This must be good

422
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,000
Brown sugar date cake

423
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,040
Pretty, why don't you try this?

424
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,680
Have some of this

425
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,160
I think this should be fine

426
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,000
I'd rather have some noodles later

427
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,400
Have some, really it's fine

428
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,680
No

429
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,080
I'm mainly afraid I won't be able to record later

430
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,720
Run out

431
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,680
If you run out, we'll wait for you

432
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,280
We'll all freeze frame like this waiting for you

433
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,960
Three two one, cut

434
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,960
We'll draw two footprint lines under your feet

435
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,160
Then when you come back and stand

436
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,560
For example

437
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,240
Like when you were arguing with Brother Cao earlier

438
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,600
Brother, like this

439
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,680
We could also film that bullet time effect

440
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,960
With bullets flying here

441
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,240
Yes, the bullet time sequence

442
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,400
There's also garlic, friends

443
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,480
Right, aren't you having some garlic?

444
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,280
This really won't do

445
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,960
What if I just eat garlic alone?

446
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,640
I mean

447
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,440
Would eating just garlic kill bacteria?

448
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,800
The problem is you don't seem to have bacteria issues

449
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,680
Didn't you say you had a cold

450
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,400
Or something like that?

451
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,400
Do garlic cost extra?

452
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,560
Garlic is free.

453
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,880
So garlic and cilantro are free, right?

454
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,720
Bro, mix some cilantro with vinegar for me.

455
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
I'll take four pounds of cilantro.

456
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,920
Yes, I want four pounds of cilantro.

457
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,120
In Northeast China, we have a dish called "Tiger Salad."

458
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,760
You know what?

459
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,360
What is it?

460
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
It's shredded onions and cilantro,

461
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,160
and shredded scallions,

462
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,800
mixed with garlic and soy sauce.

463
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,480
That's how it's made.

464
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,360
Actually, it's quite tasty.

465
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,880
I think this should be good.

466
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,400
No, I think this is pretty good.

467
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,400
You've been living in the apartment for so long,

468
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,520
Yes, so any special perks?

469
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,440
Let's sneak a little taste.

470
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,680
I won't tell the boss.

471
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,440
Thanks, Food Bro.

472
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:00,800
What's up?

473
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,200
Food Bro said,

474
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,360
we can sneak a little taste.

475
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,720
After all, we're long-term residents.

476
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,320
You're such a good person.

477
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,360
Add some more.

478
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,880
Okay

479
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,920
He really made it for us himself

480
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,800
As expected of Bai Sanwan

481
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,080
I'll make two bowls

482
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,040
How about it?

483
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,760
Amazing, perfect

484
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,560
Want to try some?

485
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,480
Yes, absolutely

486
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
Why is it that when we usually work cases

487
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,720
we can't bring family members?

488
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,200
Then you could bring Xiaomei

489
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,920
You could bring Zhenzhen

490
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,240
And I could bring my plush toy

491
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
You mainly want to bring the plush toy, right?

492
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,680
Then Guo Baoyou could bring...

493
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,920
Who would he bring? Xiaojing?

494
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,040
Just found out Xiaojing is still alive

495
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,360
Xiaojing still needs time to recover

496
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,120
No, he could bring

497
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,640
He could bring

498
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,320
his wife

499
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,440
Jiajia, right?

500
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,840
Right, for you two she's not...

501
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,760
See him on Monday

502
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,720
Your turn on Tuesday

503
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,440
Dating schedule

504
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,680
This is Bai Sanwan

505
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,320
What does this mean?

506
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,080
We're all good brothers

507
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,680
Right, all brothers

508
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,280
Aren't we all in the same group?

509
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,200
What's going on?

510
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,640
Anyway, let's treat it as "a pot of porridge"

511
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,120
Our relationship

512
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,200
is going to be as messy as "a pot of porridge"

513
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,560
Aren't they having breakfast?

514
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,040
Probably didn't wake up

515
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,160
They're probably still asleep

516
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,040
Let me tell you

517
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,720
If those two don't come

518
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,960
it would actually affect us

519
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:28,760
Why?

520
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,320
Why?

521
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,120
Because it's impossible to edit in

522
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,440
Then all I can do right now is stay in this spot

523
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,360
and do a somersault for everyone

524
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,160
to make sure this gets recorded

525
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,480
and ensure it's entertaining enough

526
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,560
You sing while I do somersaults

527
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,440
Come on

528
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,440
An episode lasts, say, three hours

529
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,960
If they're absent for half an hour

530
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,520
Tell me

531
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,160
can those thirty minutes

532
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,120
just focus on the three of us?

533
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,800
No

534
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,040
So what should we do then?

535
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,440
We'll pull out some special skills

536
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,119
Don't get diarrhea

537
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,400
Can't you treat me like a girl?

538
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,920
Morning

539
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,640
You're up

540
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,200
Hello

541
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,920
Come, hurry up and eat breakfast

542
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,400
Morning

543
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,640
Nono is here

544
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,200
Nono

545
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,440
Coco is here, sorry

546
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,880
I'm greeting it

547
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,360
You don't love me anymore

548
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,360
I'm greeting it, here

549
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,880
Coming

550
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,960
Hello

551
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,720
Hello

552
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,160
His clothes every day

553
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,560
have many little thoughtful details

554
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,720
Thoughtful touches

555
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,240
Clever details

556
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,800
Ice cream

557
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Ice cream that can't be taken out

558
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,880
Can't take it out, this is

559
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,120
Ice cream

560
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,680
Ice cream

561
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,280
Nephew

562
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,920
What's up

563
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,720
Uncle

564
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,000
We've been recording for so long

565
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,240
Finally making noodles for us

566
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,040
Today's breakfast cost at our restaurant

567
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,480
is eighteen

568
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,320
My breakfast cost is twenty-eight

569
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,760
Do I have to pay when I eat too?

570
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,600
Of course

571
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,960
For someone like me who only loves money

572
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,160
I raised you through "shit" and "piss"

573
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,920
Fed you to grow up

574
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,640
Pulled you up to grow

575
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,040
Pulling along

576
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,000
Indeed

577
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,960
Can tell you've grown up

578
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,160
Quite different from us now

579
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,080
Eat that date cake

580
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,400
That date cake is quite delicious

581
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,080
Okay

582
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,560
This is super tasty

583
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,280
Did you make it?

584
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,120
Of course

585
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,160
Of course that's impossible

586
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,480
These are all from the supermarket

587
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,840
Actually, if this variety show wasn't about solving cases

588
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,200
No

589
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,040
Not solving cases

590
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,480
No case-solving

591
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,760
We could just cook something every day

592
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,920
That could fill an episode

593
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,040
Could work

594
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,280
Next season we could rename it

595
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,720
Call it "Let's Start Making Porridge"

596
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,320
"Let's Start Making Porridge" would work

597
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,160
Porridge is easy

598
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,440
Morning

599
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,720
Morning, Ke Wuku

600
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,320
Morning

601
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,760
Morning

602
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,840
Why are you dressed like that today?

603
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,400
Wait, his top and my pants

604
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,280
Did we both wear

605
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,760
They match well

606
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,880
Wore the wrong things

607
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,720
What's wrong with you two?

608
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,480
You two seem off today.

609
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,480
You have 100 yuan left on your card.

610
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,680
But you've accumulated various debts with me.

611
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,800
Totaling 88 yuan.

612
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,720
What do you mean?

613
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,760
Wait, what does that mean?

614
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,560
You're in debt, no money for food.

615
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,440
After deducting the 88 yuan.

616
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,080
You'll only have 12 left.

617
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,680
Our breakfast costs 18.

618
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,200
Hey, you there.

619
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,480
Song Piaoliang, come pay for me.

620
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,720
Why should I?

621
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,280
Do I look like a sucker to you?

622
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,640
Then I...

623
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,320
Here's what we'll do.

624
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,640
I'll swipe for you, okay?

625
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,720
Good brother.

626
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:54,960
Come on.

627
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,600
Okay.

628
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,240
You only have 20 left now.

629
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,320
After you swiped for him.

630
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,400
I'll secretly eat.

631
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,840
Ke Wuku, why are you copying my outfit?

632
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,640
Yeah, I was just saying.

633
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,120
Why are you wearing a leather jacket today too?

634
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,640
Did you maybe...

635
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,560
Did I accidentally wear your pants?

636
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,840
And you're wearing my jacket by mistake.

637
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,200
Who else hasn't arrived?

638
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,920
Who else could it be?

639
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,960
Of course it's our

640
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,720
Guo Baoyou

641
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,680
Right, where's Guo Baoyou?

642
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,880
Why is he so late?

643
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,680
Got up late

644
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,360
Who was he stalking yesterday again?

645
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,040
So handsome

646
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,840
Today

647
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,760
What's up?

648
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,560
Today our Guo Baoyou

649
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,400
Knows it's the final episode

650
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,520
Is putting in a bit too much effort

651
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,920
Right

652
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,880
Dressed up a little

653
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,840
Do you have something special today?

654
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
You could walk the red carpet today

655
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,600
Isn't Brother Bai cooking for us today?

656
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,240
Come on, it's been so long

657
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,600
First time eating his cooking in ages

658
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,280
Remember that time we ate at his place?

659
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,360
I didn't eat

660
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,080
You guys ate

661
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,240
How's your Xiaojing doing?

662
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,960
Xiaojing

663
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,560
Still doesn't recognize me

664
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,960
That's normal, you might have lost weight recently

665
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,680
I used to be this chubby

666
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,680
But Xiaojing has really changed a lot

667
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,560
Because

668
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,280
Why?

669
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,960
Because she used to be my student

670
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,600
But I didn't recognize her

671
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,320
Even you didn't recognize her?

672
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,640
Yes, your student

673
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,480
I was stunned

674
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,600
When she was locked up inside

675
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,640
The torture had already

676
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,720
Completely disfigured her

677
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,320
Became unrecognizable

678
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,720
Totally changed appearance

679
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,240
I honestly can't quite remember

680
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,720
When I saw that photo, it looked familiar

681
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,800
I know this actress

682
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,400
We shot an entire drama together last time

683
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
Really?

684
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,000
Is that so?

685
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,680
Really

686
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,640
When she saw me before, it was like this

687
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,880
Master

688
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,280
I said

689
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,480
What was that about?

690
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,160
Yes, Master

691
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,920
We were filming together every day

692
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
So you really know her

693
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,600
I really do know her

694
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,560
Did you recognize her from the photo?

695
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,960
I didn't recognize her, but she looked so familiar

696
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,440
I really

697
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,120
I was completely stunned when I saw her

698
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,520
Then later they told me

699
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,440
She was your student

700
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,600
I said

701
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,160
Right, I truly didn't recognize her at all

702
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,200
I was completely dumbfounded

703
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,400
This is so delicious

704
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,320
No more

705
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,360
I ate something today

706
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,880
What?

707
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,320
Never mind, don't worry

708
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,720
Here, let me serve everyone some noodles.

709
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,920
No, we still need the sauce.

710
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,440
The sauce hasn't been added yet.

711
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,400
You can add the sauce into this.

712
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,120
Add the sauce, right?

713
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,840
This is the sauce, correct?

714
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,360
Yes.

715
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,800
Okay.

716
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,600
Mouth is watering.

717
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,920
Tomato egg noodles.

718
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,560
Here, try this.

719
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,720
Alright, I'll take it over first.

720
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,400
Sorry, Brother Bai.

721
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,120
Let me taste your cooking.

722
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,880
But your sauce is a bit lacking.

723
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,560
Can't be helped.

724
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,320
Okay, just a little.

725
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,160
At this point...

726
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,560
At this point... what?

727
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,200
At this point...

728
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,720
Can't blame you.

729
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,640
Here, Uncle.

730
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,840
Thanks, nephew.

731
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,240
No leaving until we finish eating today.

732
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,640
Thank you.

733
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,680
Please eat, everyone.

734
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,880
This garlic is really good.

735
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,640
To be honest...

736
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Truly.

737
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,840
And the garlic is free too.

738
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,080
Wait, I want to ask...

739
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,040
If we eat garlic...

740
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,160
will it affect our communication?

741
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,560
Probably.

742
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,760
Then let's not communicate.

743
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,280
No more talking.

744
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,040
Talk to Mai yourself.

745
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,520
No, you'll only affect Ku.

746
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,040
Because we can't smell it.

747
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,400
Because the smell rises upward.

748
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,600
The smell rises up, right?

749
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,840
I could say it downward like this.

750
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,160
Unless you're Xu Zhongjie.

751
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,800
No.

752
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,440
Why is he still exhaling?

753
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,960
If anyone needs more braising sauce, there's some left

754
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,520
And here we have chili peppers

755
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,720
garlic and other condiments

756
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,840
You can add more if you'd like

757
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,240
Look how much braising sauce is still in the pot

758
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,640
Yours is the deluxe version

759
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,440
His bowl has more sauce than noodles

760
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,800
Try some of this

761
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,640
This is quite tasty

762
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,680
I can't eat anymore, bro

763
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,560
I don't have much appetite this morning

764
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,960
Have some sausage to try

765
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,440
But you said you had no appetite?

766
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,920
Sausage makes it appear

767
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,160
Three bowls - he won't eat your noodles

768
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,480
It's fine, doesn't matter

769
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,000
Are you just eating sausage?

770
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,040
Could you share some noodles with me?

771
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,280
Just give me half

772
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:26,720
Yes

773
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,120
I just took a bite.

774
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,640
Alright, give it to me.

775
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,680
That's too much, bro.

776
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,840
No, you can't do this.

777
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,880
Just like this—one drumstick.

778
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,320
You...

779
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,680
Forcing it apart.

780
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,520
Thanks.

781
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,880
Can I just take a bite to try?

782
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
This is so delicious

783
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,360
Really? Did you put your heart into it?

784
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,560
Have you eaten yet?

785
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,120
Was my acting just now not good?

786
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,520
No, it wasn't

787
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,360
No, it's like... let me tell you

788
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,360
Your shop hasn't even finished renovations

789
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,440
You might as well just

790
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,040
Stop the renovations

791
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,480
It's really unnecessary

792
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,000
It's not a noodle shop opening next month, right?

793
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,400
What competitive pressure is there?

794
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,320
It's really not worth it

795
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,360
Just sell it off quickly

796
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,440
Sell it off as soon as possible

797
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:25,960
Alright?

798
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,200
Fine, I'll think about it

799
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,920
Delicious

800
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,960
Not bad

801
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,240
Okay

802
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,960
When I wake up in the morning, I don't even want to sit down

803
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,960
Why?

804
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,120
The buttons might pop open

805
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,400
Don't mention it

806
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,720
I want to eat garlic

807
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,600
Actually, I want some too

808
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
But

809
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,720
Forget it

810
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,600
If both of us eat garlic

811
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,000
You'll suffer

812
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,400
It's fine

813
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:04,920
What's there to fear?

814
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,080
If you're eating garlic, then I won't hold back either

815
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,560
If you're really saying that, then...

816
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,440
No problem

817
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,240
As long as you talk to me

818
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,080
I'll respond like this

819
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,640
Like this

820
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,640
Yes

821
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,480
I'll eat one

822
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,200
Really?

823
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Really

824
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,400
Then let's eat

825
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:20,840
Okay

826
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,160
Are we really eating raw garlic?

827
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,840
Then I'm sorry

828
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,200
Eating some garlic would be great

829
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,000
With noodles

830
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:32,800
Perfect

831
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,760
Teacher Guo

832
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,680
Yes, teacher?

833
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,840
Do you have any gum at home?

834
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,240
Maybe you should go home and get some gum

835
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,440
They don't like the smell in your mouth

836
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,720
No, it's me

837
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,840
I haven't eaten garlic yet

838
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,680
I was just about to say

839
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,000
She ate it

840
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,400
Okay, thanks

841
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,040
Thank you

842
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,080
Now it's completely lopsided

843
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,480
Whose phone is that?

844
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:19,880
Who does that belong to?

845
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,360
I don't know

846
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,000
It's mine

847
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,560
I actually brought my phone today

848
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,600
Didn't you guys bring yours?

849
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,760
Why would we need to?

850
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,720
Want to take a look?

851
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,680
Come on

852
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,160
Look

853
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,080
Seriously, look

854
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,800
Come here

855
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,320
Really look

856
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,720
Come on

857
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,000
What?

858
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,960
You think we're messing with you?

859
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,400
And you're trying psychological tactics on me?

860
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,600
We're not that gullible

861
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,400
Honestly

862
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,360
Who could stand this?

863
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,760
Daily average

864
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,560
What's wrong with you?

865
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,680
You don't sleep all day

866
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,280
Wait a minute

867
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,080
There's actually something

868
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,560
What's going on with you?

869
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,120
Your daily average is 21 hours

870
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,880
spent on your phone

871
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,560
21 hours and 32 minutes

872
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,320
No

873
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,040
When I sleep

874
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,440
I like to listen to something

875
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,080
And I listen to Guo Qilin's crosstalk too

876
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,680
Guo Qilin's crosstalk, right?

877
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,440
Then you have good taste

878
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,640
You do have taste

879
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,600
I

880
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,200
You

881
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,840
Me, an excellent crosstalk performer

882
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,920
You really understand crosstalk

883
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,680
No, wait a second

884
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,200
You only listen to Guo Qilin's crosstalk?

885
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,040
Don't you listen to Zhou Shen

886
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,320
and Modern Brothers Liu Yuning's songs?

887
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,360
Yes, I was just about to say

888
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,280
When I want to listen to music

889
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,000
it's Modern Brothers Liu Yuning and Zhou Shen

890
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,000
Right

891
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,960
When I want to watch a drama

892
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,200
it's Bai Yu and Song Zuer

893
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,600
Big bro, I was wrong

894
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
I won't do it again

895
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,400
Please don't be mad, okay?

896
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,160
Let go of me

897
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
Haven't you seen my phone?

898
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,520
My favorite boy band

899
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,240
is INTO1

900
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,520
Yeah

901
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,800
INTO1's Zhou Keyu

902
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,840
Right?

903
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,720
Okay

904
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,320
Okay

905
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,840
What a bunch of hypocrites

906
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,160
Take a walk after eating

907
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,440
to digest

908
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,000
Take a walk

909
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,840
What are you doing?

910
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,480
Exercising.

911
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,800
Old man taking a stroll, huh?

912
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,320
And it has to be like this.

913
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,400
You absolutely have to hit the tree.

914
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,520
Hit the tree.

915
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:30,920
Hit the tree.

916
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,880
Hit the tree.

917
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,480
Now we're suddenly at Apartment 11.

918
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,840
It's a group of people in rehab.

919
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,760
Patting backs

920
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,320
Taking turns to pat backs

921
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,080
Come on, turn around

922
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,440
Come

923
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,520
Yes

924
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,800
What? You people...

925
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,000
I really can't...

926
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,640
