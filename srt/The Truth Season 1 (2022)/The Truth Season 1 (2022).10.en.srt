1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,440
You can always hear a woman crying in Apartment 11

2
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,880
Help!

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,840
There are surveillance cameras

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,960
Song Huo is "dead"

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,200
Cao Yueguang is "dead"

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm being hunted down

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,920
To conceal my identity

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,520
I completely reinvented myself

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,080
And returned to my original name: Liu Xialai

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,760
The one who jumped to his death last week

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,400
Jiajia also said these words

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,120
I never expected

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,560
That you, who once meant so much to me

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,320
Would end your life by jumping off a building

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,440
This symbol

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,000
The one that's threatening us

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,960
Everyone who comes here

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,560
Probably has some connection to this person

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,440
This season will unfold over eleven weeks of episodes

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,480
telling the stories that occur in Apartment No. 11 of Tui City

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,400
Six players will move in as new residents

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,520
and take up residence in Apartment No. 11

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,200
They will be drawn into a series of bizarre cases

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,040
By forming the "Apartment Detective Team"

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,120
they'll visit different floors

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,960
befriend various long-term residents

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,840
unravel their own mysterious backgrounds

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,920
and uncover the secrets behind each case

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,800
The first six cases

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,640
will unlock one new resident's story each week

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,480
The intricate relationships between new and old residents

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,040
will gradually come to light

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,520
Starting with the seventh case

34
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
all storylines will intertwine

35
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,880
As the truth is revealed layer by layer

36
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,800
every choice made by the new residents

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,280
will influence the direction of the story

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,600
and the ultimate ending

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,640
In each case,

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,560
the deduction team must at the crime scene

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,080
identify the "victim,"

42
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,400
and based on clues,

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,040
pinpoint relevant suspects.

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,600
Note:

45
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,120
Suspects are not limited to

46
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,040
Apartment No. 11 residents and visitors.

47
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,400
Within the deduction team,

48
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,560
there may also be suspects.

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,120
After gathering suspects,

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,920
the team will question them

51
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,520
and re-deduce based on testimonies.

52
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,040
Finally, vote to identify the "real culprit."

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,400
Only the "real culprit" can lie.

54
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,200
Only by finding the true "murderer"

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,880
will players achieve victory.

56
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,920
Players who vote correctly

57
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,840
receive a golden key.

58
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,280
If a player is the "murderer"

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,520
and escapes successfully, they get a golden key.

60
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,560
Hey everyone,

61
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,200
Life is just like a novel,

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,120
I found my father in our apartment

63
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,200
whom I haven't seen for eighteen years.

64
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,760
How ridiculously dramatic is that?

65
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,120
Just a few days ago,

66
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,000
Xiao He approached me

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,480
asking me to be our representative

68
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,000
(though I didn't consult you all first)

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,480
to take a group photo with them.

70
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,080
This is the photo.

71
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,600
When I was looking at it,

72
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,640
I noticed something suspicious.

73
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,240
See this man next to me?

74
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,280
Look at the pendant he's wearing -

75
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,720
it's identical to one only my father has.

76
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,600
I'm certain it's my dad's

77
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,880
because I have the matching half.

78
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,360
This family reunion drama

79
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,400
needs an audience!

80
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,040
Anyway, I've checked everything -

81
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,440
he lives right upstairs from us.

82
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,400
Come with me tomorrow

83
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Now get your beauty sleep.

84
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,080
I'm exhausted.

85
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,200
Friends

86
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,920
Are you all here?

87
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,800
My dad prepared a feast today

88
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,520
just to officially acknowledge me as his son

89
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,120
Let me take you to the banquet

90
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,800
Guo Baoyou

91
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,520
Keke

92
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:33,960
Hello

93
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,080
I've brought some gifts for uncle

94
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,920
We've brought

95
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,640
authentic tea with real fruit

96
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,760
Real Fruit Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring Tea

97
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,360
Thank you

98
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,440
It has a light tea fragrance

99
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,680
With chewable real fruit pieces

100
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,120
And it's paired with premium fresh milk

101
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,720
Take a sip of this delicious Real Fruit drink

102
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,920
For smoother reasoning

103
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,160
And I must wish you success in your family reunion

104
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,960
Thank you

105
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,360
Like this

106
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,000
When you see my dad

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Tell him again

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,440
Okay, I'll say it again

109
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,280
Authentic tea with real fruit

110
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,880
Because what you said

111
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,080
I really didn't memorize it, you know

112
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,160
Okay, great

113
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,600
Good

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,920
Thanks, I'll thank you on behalf of my dad first

115
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,280
Have a seat

116
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,280
You said we should dress formally

117
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,760
This makes me feel

118
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,120
quite excited

119
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,080
Isn't this what you requested?

120
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,640
Yes, I did request it

121
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,360
Then why are we meeting parents

122
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,520
without dressing a bit more formally?

123
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,960
Am I meeting parents today?

124
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,960
Hello everyone

125
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,720
Hello

126
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,520
Teacher Song

127
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,240
This is Monroe

128
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,280
Take a look at this

129
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,480
Dressed up for the occasion?

130
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,960
Is it okay?

131
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,920
Absolutely okay

132
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,160
You're not dressed up either

133
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,720
I'm quite dressed up

134
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
This is the rest of my outfit

135
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,800
Alright

136
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,560
We're all here now

137
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,320
Everyone's present

138
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,840
Shouldn't you first explain to us

139
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,560
why you invited us here today?

140
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,120
Yes, that's right

141
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,600
Well...

142
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,440
Just thinking about this makes me (sad)

143
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,400
I...

144
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,720
When I was very young

145
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,800
I got separated from my father

146
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,040
I was just a few years old, do you remember?

147
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,120
I was eight

148
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,840
So where did you grow up then?

149
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,760
An orphanage

150
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,600
Before I was eight

151
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,920
I still had the warmth of a family

152
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,040
But then...

153
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,120
My father disappeared

154
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
I'm twenty-six now

155
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,320
Every year on my birthday

156
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,760
My father would write me a birthday card

157
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,880
Your father still writes you cards?

158
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,520
How do you receive them?

159
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,600
Actually, I think it's like this

160
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,960
His father has been watching over him silently

161
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,520
Right

162
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,640
Silently watching over him

163
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,960
So you know nothing about it?

164
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,600
You were eight

165
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,960
Then got left at an orphanage

166
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,040
Never saw your father again

167
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,000
Haven't seen him to this day

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,840
Never seen him

169
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,960
Only seen a photo

170
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,800
Okay

171
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,120
Let me introduce everyone

172
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,840
When I saw the photo, it felt very familiar

173
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,520
Just can't explain why it's so familiar

174
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,280
Soon we'll see just how familiar it is

175
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,240
Let's go

176
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,920
Welcome

177
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,760
Welcome everyone

178
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,160
I'm the butler of this household

179
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,720
You can call me Butler Ying

180
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,600
I remember our boss mentioned

181
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,640
Eighteen years ago

182
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
He lost contact

183
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,920
with his child

184
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,320
I thought there was only one

185
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,480
Never expected there'd be six

186
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,160
That's quite productive

187
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,520
Very productive indeed

188
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,440
Right, we've got another guy hiding

189
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,920
You just can't see him

190
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,760
Actually seven in total

191
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,000
The Ju family

192
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,520
To welcome all of you

193
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,600
Has been preparing carefully

194
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,800
All morning

195
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,960
Haven't even stepped out

196
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,920
Let me remind Youyou

197
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,560
Don't panic

198
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,720
Stay calm

199
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,480
Cooperate more

200
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,680
Already starting to panic

201
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,480
Come

202
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,400
Everyone

203
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,840
You need to film them for recognition

204
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
Hurry up

205
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,920
What's wrong with you?

206
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,720
You secretly wore my dress at midnight

207
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,480
I wore your dress

208
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,560
Why would I

209
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,440
Why would I

210
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,280
Why would your dress

211
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,360
have been worn three times already

212
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,160
and still need to be worn again?

213
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,640
I wore your dress, why would I

214
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,520
Why would I

215
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,360
Why would your dress

216
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,400
have been worn three times already

217
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,200
and still need to be worn again?

218
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,880
I'm saying you're a successful

219
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,680
career person

220
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,600
Yet you never go out

221
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,880
Every day you just do laundry and cook at home

222
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,280
knit sweaters

223
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,440
Can't you be more ambitious?

224
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,760
I want to make you

225
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,760
the world's most elegant

226
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,360
madam

227
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,000
It's just that

228
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,080
in my heart

229
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,200
I really can't take it anymore

230
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,440
Every day you treat me like this

231
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,320
This is how you're good to me?

232
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,159
Who could live

233
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,679
this kind of life?

234
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,440
I don't want you to look at me again

235
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,039
I feel I'm not worthy enough

236
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,880
to appear before you

237
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,840
Then let's not continue

238
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,799
Don't

239
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,080
I can leave for you

240
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,920
Don't

241
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,040
Then just leave

242
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,680
Leave? Fine, leave then

243
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,720
If you want to leave, then leave

244
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,040
Sorry, that's my phone.

245
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,680
Turn it off.

246
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
This is Pin.

247
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,760
Hello.

248
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,280
We just noticed it.

249
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,960
I'm so surprised.

250
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,600
Why are there so many people suddenly?

251
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,480
But if I'm not mistaken,

252
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,760
you must be

253
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,400
Youyou, right?

254
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,840
I really wish you were wrong

255
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,160
but you weren't

256
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,160
Dad

257
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,040
You can call me that

258
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
It makes me very happy

259
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,520
You may

260
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,120
Say it again

261
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,640
Say it once more

262
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,000
Quick, say it in front of all the cameras

263
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,520
Dad

264
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,560
Good son

265
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,240
Damn you

266
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,840
Damn you

267
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,240
It's me again

268
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,320
Smash that phone for me

269
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,120
That's enough

270
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,960
Affecting my mood

271
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,920
Me too

272
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,560
My mood is almost...

273
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,800
Come

274
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,480
Everyone

275
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,440
Come inside

276
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,320
Before everyone's eyes

277
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,440
Let's witness

278
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,440
This sacred moment today

279
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,560
Youyou, wearing this?

280
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:47,880
Wearing it

281
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,400
Youyou

282
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,040
Come, Youyou

283
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,200
One two

284
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,520
Go

285
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,600
It really is my Youyou

286
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,240
I'm your father

287
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
Gu Success

288
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,040
Just now

289
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,880
Your mother and I

290
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,560
Mrs. Gu

291
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,920
Had a little argument

292
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Had a small fight

293
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,160
Can you help your dad

294
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,520
Go comfort your mother

295
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,960
Oh my

296
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,600
Son

297
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,000
Are you really my son?

298
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,160
Am I?

299
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,720
Is it true?

300
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,240
I am your son

301
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,880
Are you truly my son?

302
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,120
I really am your son

303
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,640
Without a doubt

304
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,080
My long-lost biological son?

305
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,000
I absolutely am

306
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,080
Your long-lost son

307
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Mom missed you

308
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,400
I missed you too, Mom

309
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,240
Why do I feel like

310
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,360
These parents seem happy to have lost their child

311
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,920
They're happy to have found him

312
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,280
Can't you understand mother-son affection?

313
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,720
Right

314
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,360
Mom is so harsh with you

315
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,240
Why?

316
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,760
This mom is really targeting me

317
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,360
Where did this pretty little girl come from?

318
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,320
Showing so little respect to your mother

319
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,840
Mom

320
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,760
What's going on?

321
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,440
Is this you?

322
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,880
Is this your daughter-in-law?

323
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,120
Don't...

324
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,760
Not yet

325
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,520
Don't call her that randomly

326
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,080
It's fine, I don't even have...

327
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,400
Aren't we here for a family reunion today?

328
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,760
So I'm here for a family reunion?

329
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,320
Son

330
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,840
Mom

331
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,920
Do you know what this is?

332
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,120
This is a flat peach

333
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,560
Flat peach

334
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,240
You need to rub it

335
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,200
I thought so

336
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,600
Here, take this

337
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,160
Rub it again

338
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,760
Take the peach

339
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,280
Here

340
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,000
Rub this one

341
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,760
Rub it

342
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,000
Okay

343
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,960
Are there any more?

344
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,560
That young man over there

345
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,600
This young man

346
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,720
Quite handsome

347
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,400
He's alright

348
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,080
Better than your dad

349
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,520
Wait a minute

350
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,480
My dad is right here

351
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,800
It's fine, he doesn't mind

352
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,640
Yes, you take one too

353
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,080
Dad's getting old

354
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,160
Thank you

355
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,040
This

356
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,400
Our family's peaches

357
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,760
They're good for beauty and skin

358
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,840
Your skin will be great after eating them

359
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,160
Really?

360
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,920
Yes, just show everyone

361
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,400
Show off these peaches more

362
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,000
Show them off more

363
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
Yes, let everyone take a look

364
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,080
He's already eating one

365
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,440
Right

366
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,200
Can you focus on the main subject?

367
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,920
Surprise

368
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,320
Let me introduce you

369
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,600
This is your sister

370
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,080
This is my sister

371
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,760
Ju Xingyun (Lucky)

372
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,400
This is my son

373
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,320
Lucky

374
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,960
Little Ju

375
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,160
This is a lucky peach

376
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,480
I'll give you this lucky peach

377
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,360
I have one too

378
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,280
Then why are you taking someone else's peach?

379
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,480
That's mom's peach

380
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,440
You can't take mom's peach either

381
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,040
You can only take one peach from me

382
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,040
This is your grandfather

383
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,880
This is the real grandson

384
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,560
Those were all fake grandsons, right?

385
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,720
Quick, say it

386
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,400
We haven't seen each other for so many years

387
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,360
Grandpa

388
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
It was worth it

389
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,320
And me too

390
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,600
This is your uncle

391
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,200
Uncle

392
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,280
All these years

393
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,240
you've gotten so thin outside

394
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,480
you've even stopped growing

395
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,600
Today,

396
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,200
we've specially arranged this grand banquet

397
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,800
Wonderful!

398
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,000
to make up for the paternal love you've missed

399
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,040
to let everyone have a good time

400
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,520
and witness our happiness

401
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,480
Did you bring any gifts?

402
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,640
Yes, we brought genuine tea with real fruit

403
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,800
Here's our Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring Tea with real fruit pieces

404
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,520
Yes

405
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,800
Which village is this from?

406
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,120
Genuine tea with real fruit

407
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,280
Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring Tea with real fruit pieces

408
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,200
This person is so eloquent!

409
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,520
Come on, let's eat

410
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,280
Today's dishes

411
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,960
Look at this peach cake

412
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,280
Peach juice with kidney

413
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,360
"Hard-to-escape peach" (wordplay)

414
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,440
This is "Peach of the Kidney"

415
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,320
It's actually kidney slices

416
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,400
All carefully prepared for everyone

417
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,400
Let's congratulate our Guo Baoyou

418
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,840
Alright then

419
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,640
Okay, congratulations to Guo Baoyou on the successful family reunion

420
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,200
Mutual congratulations

421
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Thank you

422
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,480
Uncle, it's been so long since you last saw him.

423
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,680
Uncle, after he went missing,

424
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,000
didn't you try to look for him?

425
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,440
We did.

426
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,720
We put up missing person notices.

427
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,400
To whom it may concern,

428
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,240
Loyalty disregards personal safety,

429
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,080
Filial piety disregards shame,

430
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Loyalty means giving one's all,

431
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,040
Filial piety requires utmost effort.

432
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,920
Crows feed their parents in return,

433
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,840
Lambs kneel to suckle milk.

434
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,800
Even animals remember their parents,

435
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,080
You were looking for a father,

436
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,280
that was searching for a dad.

437
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,160
Lost one expectant father.

438
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,880
That's impossible to find.

439
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,480
Didn't he say every year

440
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,800
he would send greeting cards?

441
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,120
Didn't he say he'd send cards every year?

442
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,400
Here's what we'll do.

443
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,680
Let's give everyone some dessert.

444
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,960
Here.

445
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,080
Thanks, Dad.

446
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,560
Here you go.

447
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,120
Don't mind that

448
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,000
it's from your future father-in-law.

449
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,040
Okay.

450
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,680
What do you mean "future father-in-law"?

451
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,720
I haven't agreed yet.

452
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,640
That's your brother.

453
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,520
Come here, butler.

454
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,480
Come over.

455
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,840
Thank you, sir.

456
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,160
Go.

457
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,720
Go eat.

458
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,880
Uncle, what business are you in?

459
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,400
He's a successful person.

460
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,800
His name is Gu Success.

461
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,000
I've always been really curious

462
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
It's just that

463
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,720
Dad, please wait a moment

464
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,680
My surname is Guo

465
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,400
Why is your surname Ju then?

466
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,760
Right

467
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,840
A child without a mother

468
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,680
It's a long story

469
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,160
Here we go again

470
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,880
To make it short

471
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,520
Because originally

472
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,200
Do you know what your surname is?

473
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,800
Guo, I've always been Guo

474
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,160
I didn't even know your surname

475
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,040
Right

476
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,640
My surname is Guo

477
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,200
This was when you were born

478
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,240
Who told you that?

479
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,800
I've been called that since childhood

480
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,000
Youyou

481
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,760
That's right

482
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,120
You only know yourself as Youyou

483
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,920
My name is Youyou

484
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,240
Sir

485
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,040
It's almost 1 o'clock

486
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,680
Five minutes left

487
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,880
It's almost time for your rest

488
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,960
That startled me

489
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,680
I understand

490
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,200
Alright

491
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,120
You may leave

492
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,240
Have you eaten?

493
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,920
Yes, I have

494
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,400
I just ate

495
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,800
Very good

496
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,280
Thank you, sir

497
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,200
Alright, you may go now

498
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,520
Okay, everyone please enjoy your meal

499
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Don't interrupt our conversation

500
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,560
Okay

501
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,319
That was rather abrupt

502
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Seems like the most reliable one in their family

503
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,880
Is this butler

504
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,079
Where were we?

505
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,280
Right, we were talking about this peach

506
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,560
What?

507
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,640
Wait a moment

508
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,520
We were talking about Youyou

509
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,560
Why do you have the surname Ju?

510
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,880
This is called taking the father's surname.

511
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,000
Passed down from Gao ancestors.

512
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,640
That can't be right.

513
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,520
Passed down from Gao ancestors.

514
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,680
You should be surnamed Gao.

515
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,720
Passed down from Gao ancestors.

516
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,080
How could I be surnamed Gao?

517
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,720
Then you...

518
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,360
Are surnamed Liu.

519
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,040
Go over there.

520
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,840
This "Ju" is capitalized

521
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,160
Meaning both surnames Ju and Beng

522
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
They mean the same thing, right?

523
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,280
This word "Beng"

524
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,240
What does it mean?

525
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,200
Because in our Beijing...

526
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,440
What was that sound?

527
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,720
What was that sound just now?

528
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,560
What? Your surname is Guo?

529
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,520
Hurry up and go

530
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,960
Stop arguing about surnames

531
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,720
Let's just

532
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,320
do it this way

533
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,040
I think we should go take a look

534
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
Let's go check

535
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,680
Butler

536
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,200
Butler

537
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,400
Butler

538
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,360
The sound came from this direction

539
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,520
We're in the middle of eating

540
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,640
It's locked.

541
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,600
Is it locked or just jammed?

542
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,200
People usually lock it when using the toilet.

543
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,080
It's common to lock it.

544
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,960
Only the butler has this key.

545
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,080
All the keys are with the butler.

546
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,880
Someone kick the door.

547
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,520
Just kick it open.

548
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,800
Can we kick it?

549
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,320
Kick it.

550
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,240
Go ahead and kick it.

551
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,680
Big brother.

552
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,360
Wait a moment

553
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:01,960
What's wrong?

554
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,320
Why was he strangling his neck?

555
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,880
Butler

556
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,200
"Died"

557
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,800
Butler

558
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,280
Butler

559
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,120
Nobody move

560
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,840
Hey

561
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,360
What's wrong?

562
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,760
Hey, Xiao He?

563
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,640
It's me

564
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,160
What's the matter?

565
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,400
We have an

566
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,520
emergency situation

567
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,760
What kind of emergency now?

568
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,880
Take a guess

569
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,920
Did something happen to someone?

570
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:42,920
Yes

571
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,440
When we were in the banquet hall

572
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,040
we suddenly heard from the restroom

573
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,320
a loud noise

574
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,880
We found the butler in the restroom

575
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,760
He wasn't breathing

576
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,240
This position

577
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,080
Don't touch anything, nobody move

578
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,120
Why is he in this position?

579
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,840
Preserve the scene

580
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,160
Someone might have

581
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,440
either breathing issues

582
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:58,960
or poisoning, probably

583
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,760
Breathing problems

584
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,600
Breathing

585
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,080
I have the Zhenguoli investigation kit

586
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,560
I'll come find you right away, okay?

587
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,440
Then come quickly

588
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:04,960
Hurry up

589
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,880
Okay

590
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,840
I'm coming right now

591
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,320
Here's what we'll do

592
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,600
To protect the scene

593
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,360
Let's all go out

594
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,040
Wait for the investigator

595
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,520
Alright?

596
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,920
Let's go

597
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,320
Let's go out first

598
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,720
Okay

599
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Is someone knocking at the door?

600
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,560
I'm coming.

601
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,800
Hurry up.

602
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,360
I just heard the detective team was here,

603
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:34,840
so I brought

604
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,880
this Zhenguoli detective kit

605
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,000
for everyone.

606
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,040
Thanks.

607
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,400
Let's share it.

608
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,080
Okay, thank you.

609
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,400
It's the one with real tea and fruit pieces,

610
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,480
Zhenguoli Ruby Grapefruit Four Seasons Spring.

611
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,120
Here.

612
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,600
Can someone briefly explain to me

613
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,680
what exactly happened?

614
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,240
We were having dinner here,

615
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,040
and the butler left first, right?

616
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,560
Yes.

617
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:50,920
Then he...

618
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,080
Then we were chatting,

619
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,640
when suddenly we heard a "bang."

620
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,240
Not sure what kind of sound it was.

621
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,560
Right.

622
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
We found the butler's

623
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,000
"body" in the bathroom.

624
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,560
Since the butler is involved,

625
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,840
and it happened in the Ju family house,

626
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
I think everyone in the Ju family

627
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,320
might be somewhat suspicious.

628
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,160
You should speak with evidence.

629
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,600
The top priority right now

630
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,040
isn't it

631
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,560
that we should probably investigate

632
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,120
this butler

633
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,000
to find out exactly what happened to him

634
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,520
Alright

635
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,240
From what I understand

636
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,040
our house is quite large

637
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,960
with part of the seventh floor

638
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,680
and then

639
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,360
there seem to be three more rooms on the ninth floor

640
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,280
How about we six members of the detective team

641
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,480
split into two groups

642
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,920
Yes, and as for the members of the Ju family

643
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,000
perhaps we should

644
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,040
avoid any conflict of interest

645
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,080
Okay, let's do this

646
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,240
We'll entrust the detective team

647
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,680
to search for clues

648
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,640
Goodbye

649
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,160
Are there lights on the stairs?

650
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,040
The three of us

651
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,920
are all quite afraid of the dark

652
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,040
You're looking into this, aren't you?

653
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,960
Indeed

654
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,080
there is something

655
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,840
strange

656
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,360
Found it

657
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,640
Is this "poison"?

658
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
This must be some kind of potion or something

659
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,400
Why don't you try drinking it?

660
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,640
I'll drink it

661
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,840
Thank you very much

662
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,560
"Make you furious"

663
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,800
Gaseous "poison"

664
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Colorless and odorless

665
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,920
After being inhaled when vaporized

666
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,440
Can immediately cause "death"

667
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,520
But not this one

668
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,280
This one has color

669
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,040
Could he have another bottle of "poison"?

670
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,560
"Poison gas"

671
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,440
Five seconds

672
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,960
Then it will dissipate

673
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,760
So what?

674
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,440
He wouldn't be able to detect it

675
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,080
How he "died"

676
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,120
The butler was

677
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,400
"Poisoned" by their family

678
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,680
Strong demagnetizing card

679
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,720
Demagnetize

680
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,920
Demagnetization

681
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,640
What needs demagnetizing?

682
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,480
Keycard

683
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,360
Room

684
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,080
No, there's so much stuff in the drain

685
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,480
Their family is way too suspicious

686
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,880
Let's go

687
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,560
Take a look

688
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,280
We're on the 9th floor

689
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,560
Here

690
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,360
This door's open

691
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,280
Which one can be opened?

692
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,800
Your grandpa

693
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,480
My grandpa

694
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,880
So many liquor bottles

695
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,360
Healthy living

696
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,320
This clearly shows it's real

697
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,200
This is my biological grandfather

698
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,840
At first glance

699
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,680
Shares your hobby

700
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,480
Look for anything suspicious.

701
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,800
Look

702
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,080
He runs a live streaming room

703
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,160
at Juhao Family

704
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,040
Someone's coming

705
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,200
My uncle

706
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,880
Busy

707
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,160
The adults are asleep

708
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,880
Why did you come to grandpa's room?

709
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,640
No

710
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,400
He's thirsty

711
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,560
came looking for something to drink

712
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:51,960
Right

713
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,400
Yes

714
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,920
I don't have any water here either

715
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,560
There are liquor bottles here

716
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,920
These are all for your grandfather's health regimen

717
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,360
These are all

718
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,560
How do you use this?

719
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,160
Cupping?

720
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,640
Take this.

721
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,640
My grandpa is about to be "released" now.

722
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,760
The suction is too precise, this is a bit...

723
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,360
Precisely suctioning every acupoint.

724
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,840
This.

725
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,640
Youyou.

726
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
I have something.

727
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,840
I want to tell you.

728
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,480
Go ahead, grandpa (uncle).

729
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,560
Can we listen too?

730
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,400
You can listen.

731
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,240
Please have a seat, both of you.

732
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,960
Okay, come on.

733
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,880
Please sit.

734
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,480
Youyou, stop being mischievous.

735
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,000
Alright?

736
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,440
Listen to what Uncle has to say

737
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:23,960
Okay

738
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,160
Earlier in this banquet hall

739
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,600
I wanted to tell you

740
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,520
Although you've been acknowledged

741
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,280
it doesn't necessarily mean you're qualified to

742
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,440
Look at our two friends here

743
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,000
Come, friends

744
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,520
You two should treat my uncle with respect

745
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,000
You two

746
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,120
Where were we?

747
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,880
Did you hear that?

748
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,920
You say

749
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,560
Although we acknowledged him today

750
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,320
Right, but you might not be qualified

751
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,360
to enter our family

752
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,120
Why?

753
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,160
Because our family

754
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,680
has a fine tradition

755
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,320
of poetry dueling

756
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,000
Poetry dueling

757
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,640
Right

758
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,440
Fine

759
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,400
If I win against you

760
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:57,800
then you

761
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,760
can enter the Ju family

762
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,920
Yes, can enter the Ju family

763
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,880
If you can't beat me, you leave

764
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,720
You go back

765
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,280
Return to where you came from

766
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,280
Well

767
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,800
You two be the judges

768
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,840
This is classical poetry

769
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,400
You two can give any topic

770
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,680
You say the first line

771
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,480
We'll respond with

772
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,560
the following line

773
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,600
Then we'll both answer quickly

774
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,400
Grape wine in luminous cups

775
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,320
About to drink when pipa urges haste

776
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,000
Right?

777
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,880
This is correct

778
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Don't hesitate

779
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,760
See? You hesitated

780
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,880
This counts as your loss

781
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,800
Why?

782
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,360
You didn't even speak

783
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,400
No, you hesitated

784
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,560
Hesitation isn't allowed

785
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,320
Full of literary talent

786
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,240
Rolls off the tongue

787
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,560
Off the tongue

788
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,320
Yours didn't come out

789
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,000
Change to another one

790
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,520
Fine

791
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
A few plum branches by the wall

792
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,040
Red palms parting clear waves

793
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,640
How could those be the same?

794
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,120
None of your business

795
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,280
Anyway I was faster

796
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,360
As long as it's spoken out

797
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,320
Right, I won't hesitate

798
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,120
Wasn't accuracy the competition?

799
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,240
No need

800
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,880
Just asking if you're fast

801
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,480
It's fine

802
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,080
One two three four five

803
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,960
Red palms stir clear waves

804
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,360
All he says is "red palms stir clear waves"

805
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,920
Say "red palms stir clear waves"

806
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,480
Lush grass on the plains

807
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,880
Red palms stir clear waves

808
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,720
I can enter our home now

809
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,720
Hoeing millet under midday sun

810
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,040
Red palms stir clear waves

811
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,480
Elementary students shouldn't learn this

812
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,800
Red palms stir clear waves

813
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
What is all this?

814
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,440
It's "madness"

815
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,160
You're quite interesting

816
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,920
Quite interesting

817
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,480
Alright

818
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:18,960
Isn't that so?

819
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,400
Almost evenly matched, somewhat

820
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,040
Let me think

821
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,640
What approach should I use?

822
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,040
Let me challenge you again

823
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,960
You're doing okay

824
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,120
Why are you now...

825
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,960
Go look quickly

826
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,760
Make it really hard for him

827
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,000
Why did you come to grandpa's room?

828
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,320
I was just...

829
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,840
I'm closest with grandpa

830
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,080
Because grandparents dote on grandchildren

831
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,960
Generation after generation of closeness

832
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,400
Don't be fooled by appearances

833
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,920
Your grandpa served time in prison

834
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,880
He's really not a good person

835
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,760
The butler's "death" this time

836
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,480
might be related to him

837
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,400
Think it over carefully

838
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,000
To tell you the truth,

839
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,880
When he mentioned going to jail,

840
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,880
Take a look at this first.

841
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,680
What is this?

842
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,000
This is a wardrobe.

843
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,680
There's something here.

844
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,160
What did he say?

845
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,640
He said my grandfather was in jail.

846
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,720
Do you think it could be the one?

847
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,000
It's lit

848
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,200
What does that mean?

849
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,720
It really seems to be a secret passage

850
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,320
Why did it go dark again?

851
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,120
Can this be opened?

852
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,520
I see someone there

853
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,040
Come out

854
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,960
I can see your smile

855
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,560
You come out right now

856
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
I can see your teeth

857
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,840
The door gap is too big

858
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,200
Grandpa can't hide at all

859
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,800
Isn't this my grandson?

860
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,400
Come here

861
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,480
You're holding the wrong one

862
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,000
Your grandson is here

863
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,360
There's another one here

864
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,040
Don't be so formal

865
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,000
These three grandsons of mine like signal...

866
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,760
Third grandson

867
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
Hello grandpa

868
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,240
I'm your grandson

869
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,000
This is your great-grandson

870
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,360
Why were you hiding here...

871
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,800
Well...

872
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,520
What's up?

873
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Have a seat

874
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,240
Come

875
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,960
How did grandpa come out from there?

876
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,200
I just missed my eldest grandson

877
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,680
I was afraid he'd be scared seeing me

878
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,240
So I hid inside for a while

879
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,800
Grandpa, take it slow.

880
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,280
That cabinet has a peephole.

881
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,920
It's specifically...

882
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,640
has a hole.

883
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,320
There's a hole.

884
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,760
Do you usually live inside it?

885
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,240
I just...

886
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,960
What do you want to do with this peephole?

887
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,800
Happy.

888
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,400
I've been waiting for you three.

889
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,120
I'm a health preservation expert.

890
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,560
A bunch of medicines, right?

891
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,520
Yes, look.

892
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,600
Dan...

893
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,160
This is called danshen powder.

894
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,920
If you're single...

895
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,000
how did you get my dad?

896
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,040
I'm a fan of danshen.

897
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,160
So I'm not single.

898
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,640
So cold.

899
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,600
I'm different from you.

900
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,160
As for you...

901
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,480
I'm a Zhou Shen fan.

902
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,800
I'm a fan of Zhou Shen.

903
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,920
Right?

904
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,040
Grandpa...

905
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,800
Let me ask you...

906
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,480
This uncle of mine...

907
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,000
When was he born to you?

908
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,880
He's my second son.

909
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,840
Second son.

910
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,760
Uncle Wenyi already said...

911
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,840
that you've been in prison.

912
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,160
Yes, you've been inside.

913
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,880
Nonsense.

914
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,160
He must...

915
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,880
have eaten too much ginseng.

916
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,680
That's ridiculous.

917
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,440
Here.

918
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,760
How could I have been in prison?

919
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,680
Does Grandpa look like someone who's been in prison?

920
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Kinda does.

921
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,280
Do you think you look like a righteous character?

922
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,240
Think about it carefully.

923
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,600
Show me a heroic pose then.

924
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,360
Alright.

925
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Then why would he spread rumors about you like this?

926
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,440
He just wanted to take that room from me.

927
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,720
That room was originally assigned to me.

928
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,440
But he insisted on living there.

929
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,560
So it's about fighting over a room?

930
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,240
Yes.

931
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,040
Disrespectful.

932
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,520
Grandpa, I have a question.

933
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,320
Does anyone in this family have a grudge against the butler?

934
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,280
In our household.

935
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,240
No.

936
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,600
After the butler arrived,

937
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,000
he's been quite good to me.

938
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,480
He's been good to everyone else too.

939
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,640
So why did he "die" today?

940
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,840
Then we won't disturb you further.

941
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,040
Bye.

942
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,680
Grandpa, we won't bother you anymore.

943
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,400
Bye.

944
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,480
Goodbye.

945
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,200
Let's go.

946
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,680
This one should open too.

947
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,400
Every one can be opened.

948
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,280
Universal.

949
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,520
Not that singing.

950
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,880
Red carp, green carp, and donkey.

951
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,040
It's poetry matching.

952
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
We can enter every room.

953
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,280
With this.

954
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,000
Let's check this first.

955
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,680
Look at my uncle.

956
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,200
So beautiful.

957
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,680
Uncle.

958
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,960
His room is so beautiful.

959
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,400
I want it.

960
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,840
A person who loves literature.

961
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,920
"Remarks on Lyrics in the Human World."

962
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,120
What's he writing here?

963
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,920
I'm at.

964
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,200
Waiting for you in the Super Good Family livestream.

965
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,760
Very artistic.

966
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,360
They're all doing livestreams.

967
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,320
Right.

968
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,520
Making a million a month isn't a dream.

969
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,880
I can be number one in sales.

970
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,520
Actually, he's a money lover.

971
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,400
He's trying to pretend to be very.

972
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,120
Right.

973
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,000
Very into literature.

974
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,760
Look at this setup.

975
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,360
See.

976
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,320
All these books placed here.

977
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,160
Stacked so neatly.

978
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,600
Actually, he's just using books as wallpaper.

979
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:48,880
Because look.

980
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,440
What's visible on camera.

981
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,880
Shows him reading properly.

982
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,840
But behind the scenes, it's all.

983
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,600
Completely different.

984
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,120
All about his money-making dreams.

985
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,720
Come on, let's search.

986
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,440
There should be nothing here.

987
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:03,880
Won't open.

988
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,000
No.

989
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,400
This.

990
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,200
The handle's like this.

991
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,280
Scary

992
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,680
Calligraphy brush

993
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,120
Calligraphy brush

994
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,920
Glitter ink

995
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,160
You can write some strange characters

996
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,560
If we write on it

997
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,320
Will it show?

998
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,800
Keep it for now

999
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,240
Set it aside for now

1000
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,200
We'll try them one by one later

1001
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,760
How do I

1002
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,480
The three of us, really

1003
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,280
acting like thieves

1004
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,400
Isn't this my home?

1005
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,720
Speaking of

1006
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,320
Isn't this

1007
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,080
Should we bring this pen?

1008
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,680
Just bring one is enough

1009
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,600
Bring them all

1010
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,120
Let's try each one

1011
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay

1012
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The package won't fit

1013
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,560
Then let's do this

1014
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,600
What is this thing?

1015
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,120
Calendar

1016
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,960
Rolled-up calendar

1017
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,800
Should we bring this?

1018
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
No, we really are like thieves

1019
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,280
Let's take all of this

1020
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,120
Here

1021
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,600
Here

1022
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,760
There's a phone

1023
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,320
Found another phone

1024
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:03,840
Right

1025
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,040
Today

1026
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,840
Let me introduce to everyone

1027
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,920
Golden Shiny

1028
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,640
Super Sparkly

1029
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,320
Glitter Ink

1030
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,560
He sells this ink

1031
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,360
Did you see it?

1032
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,280
Let me show everyone

1033
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,320
Take a closer look

1034
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:14,800
Okay?

1035
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,880
Sorry, everyone

1036
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,440
I need to handle something

1037
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,160
Girlfriend

1038
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,200
I'm sorry, let's break up.

1039
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,240
I'm going to pursue my dreams.

1040
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
Now I see who you really are.

1041
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,080
Consider my youth wasted on you.

1042
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,360
I hope you find someone better.

1043
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,240
Already blocked.

1044
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,800
There's more.

1045
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,200
And also...

1046
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,880
Dad

1047
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,800
You disgrace!

1048
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
You actually called someone else

1049
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,600
"dad" during your livestream?

1050
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,360
Deceiving your audience,

1051
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,600
Are we, your ordinary parents,

1052
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,480
not good enough for you now?

1053
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,160
From now on, we'll act as if

1054
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,120
we never had a son like you.

1055
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,760
Couldn't send it either.

1056
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,720
This means I'm blocked.

1057
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,800
None of them went through.

1058
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,400
So this person...

1059
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,600
If this is his father,

1060
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,680
Then that's not... that's the wellness...

1061
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,640
And there's also this...

1062
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,240
Recording.

1063
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,560
So many...

1064
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,280
I've already forged

1065
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,680
documents for Ju Wenyi to study abroad,

1066
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,280
hoping he'd leave gracefully.

1067
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,880
But he stubbornly refuses to go,

1068
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,600
and wants to take me down with him.

1069
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,840
He won't use my secrets against me.

1070
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,800
After Guo Baoyou acknowledges their kinship,

1071
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,160
help me deal with him.

1072
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,040
Who am I?

1073
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,960
Who is this man?

1074
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,440
Isn't this the butler?

1075
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,640
Seems like it.

1076
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,360
Because only he talks like this.

1077
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,800
He is.

1078
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,520
Everyone else has that

1079
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,200
crosstalk-like tone.

1080
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,680
That's true.

1081
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,080
Clearly never done crosstalk.

1082
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,680
So it's the butler.

1083
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,520
Fabricate evidence of Ju Wenyi going abroad,

1084
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,560
then eliminate him.

1085
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,480
We need to eliminate Ju Wenyi.

1086
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,320
This proves one thing:

1087
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,000
The people in this household

1088
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,640
currently

1089
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,360
this Ju Wenyi

1090
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,760
has a motive to "kill" the butler.

1091
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,200
Let's go to Ju Lucky.

1092
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,960
Look at my sister

1093
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,320
So pink

1094
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,320
She's a young girl

1095
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,760
What else?

1096
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,199
Your sister is a tomboy

1097
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,840
That's obvious

1098
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,600
But her dream is also to strike it rich

1099
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,080
See?

1100
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,800
Only sudden wealth can solve worries

1101
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,040
All lottery tickets

1102
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,080
Just wants to make money

1103
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,280
She's also a streamer

1104
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,080
Annual lucky charm, fortunate streamer

1105
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,040
Annual lucky charm, fortunate streamer

1106
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,280
All from the "Great Family" livestream

1107
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,480
Is it okay to rummage through a girl's stuff?

1108
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,000
This thing

1109
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,440
Do you still care about that now?

1110
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,960
The people we're searching

1111
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,679
We already seem like thieves

1112
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,400
This

1113
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,719
Should be able to open this thing

1114
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,560
Kinda looks like a Rubik's cube

1115
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,320
Can this be opened?

1116
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,120
You'll pay for this

1117
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,280
And here's a mirror

1118
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,400
Nocturnal Praise

1119
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,000
The three of us really

1120
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,800
Act like thieves every day

1121
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,560
We three are such cowards

1122
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,200
Scared me to "death"

1123
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,040
Why would there be someone's photo?

1124
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,120
Isn't this me?

1125
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,080
Wait a minute

1126
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,680
Look at this

1127
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,560
It's you again

1128
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,560
No

1129
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,840
What does this "Autumn in My Heart" mean?

1130
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,080
Wait a minute

1131
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,520
Eun-sae

1132
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,080
If we weren't siblings

1133
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,280
Would I still have had the chance to meet you?

1134
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,080
She loves you

1135
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,680
I'm telling you, your sister definitely has feelings for you

1136
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,960
I'm having an "Autumn in My Heart" moment now

1137
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,160
This is her live stream setup

1138
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,160
Then what's in her phone?

1139
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,720
Let's take a look

1140
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,080
It needs a password

1141
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,400
Try entering your name

1142
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:33,960
Guo Baoyou

1143
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,240
Try "Guo Baoyou"

1144
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:36,960
Seriously?

1145
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,600
Such ordinary confidence

1146
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,160
I've noticed

1147
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,640
Why does it have to be me?

1148
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,520
Look at this

1149
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,960
Guo Baoyou

1150
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,560
Hello everyone

1151
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,240
I'm your koi girl

1152
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,960
Ju Lucky

1153
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,080
About luck

1154
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,560
It definitely doesn't come just by waiting

1155
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,120
For example, in my room

1156
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,320
There are many things

1157
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,880
That are very particular

1158
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,160
First

1159
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,040
Like my lucky rug

1160
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,640
Just spin five times on one foot on it

1161
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,520
Is this one foot?

1162
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,080
These are two feet

1163
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,120
You're right

1164
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,160
Spin five times on one foot

1165
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,760
And you'll receive good luck

1166
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,400
Everything she does is for luck

1167
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,880
Notice that?

1168
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,120
Let me take a sip first

1169
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,080
Zhenguoli Red Pomelo Four Seasons Tea slowly

1170
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,040
This is our real tea with real fruit

1171
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,840
Zhenguoli Red Pomelo Four Seasons Tea

1172
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
She loves this too

1173
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,680
Zhenguoli Red Pomelo Four Seasons Tea

1174
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,600
She even gave some to my dad

1175
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,120
And then

1176
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,560
It's my lucky blanket

1177
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,800
Just lie down on it

1178
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,960
Then roll around a bit

1179
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,440
Roll once

1180
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,640
Roll once and flip over

1181
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,160
Do a somersault

1182
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,960
You can also attract good luck

1183
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,160
The last one

1184
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,320
Is my lucky lamp

1185
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,600
This one

1186
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,800
Pat it three times

1187
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,240
And you'll receive good luck

1188
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,600
Pat it three times

1189
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,440
Okay

1190
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,160
Today I'm counting on all you lucky ones

1191
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,480
Give me some extra support

1192
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,000
Help me reach higher sales targets

1193
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,480
Alright?

1194
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,080
Thank you all my lucky ones

1195
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,760
Guardian of Lucky

1196
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,560
Unconditionally supporting Lucky Girl

1197
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,480
Thank you, Guardian of Lucky

1198
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,360
Her birthday

1199
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,920
Ordered fifty sets with one click

1200
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Thank you so much

1201
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,760
You're always here when I go live

1202
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,080
Top-ranked big brother

1203
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,560
Number one supporter

1204
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,880
You've always been our

1205
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,040
top-ranked supporter

1206
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,160
Always been number one on her sales chart

1207
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,520
Don't worry

1208
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,120
Daughter

1209
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,360
Big brother has money

1210
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,000
Big brother, what did you say?

1211
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,840
She looks very nervous.

1212
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:24,880
Private message.

1213
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,600
And screenshots.

1214
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,200
I'm Father Jiang.

1215
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,000
Jiang.

1216
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,600
I don't believe it.

1217
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,440
Then what was my deceased mother's name?

1218
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,120
Mother Jiang.

1219
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,720
Her maiden name was Jiang.

1220
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,880
Try her lucky magic.

1221
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,240
"Death" notice

1222
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,000
Father Jiang

1223
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,640
"Died" on June 14th

1224
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,440
That was just a few days ago

1225
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,080
A few days ago

1226
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,040
After 48 consecutive hours of unloading cargo

1227
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,400
Overworked

1228
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,320
Drove while fatigued

1229
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,240
Causing a car accident

1230
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,400
Resulting in severe traumatic brain injury

1231
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,840
But actually, speaking of her father

1232
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,480
It seems

1233
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,600
He worked quite hard

1234
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,880
And as a loader

1235
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,320
Her father probably wanted to earn more money

1236
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,040
Right

1237
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,200
To support her

1238
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,720
To buy gifts for his daughter

1239
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,240
How strange

1240
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,240
Why would she abandon her own father?

1241
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,320
He is my second son.

1242
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,560
From now on,

1243
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,760
we'll act like we never had a son like you.

1244
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,200
Don't worry.

1245
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,720
Daughter,

1246
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,200
your eldest brother has money.

1247
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,440
This feels like that movie "Shoplifters."

1248
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,080
You know what?

1249
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,720
I get it now.

1250
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,120
These people might have been pieced together,

1251
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,360
a bunch of strangers.

1252
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,600
A perfect family.

1253
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,680
They gathered them together,

1254
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,520
made them do live-streaming sales,

1255
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,760
told them how much money they could make,

1256
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,440
and tricked them into coming.

1257
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,880
They lured them with money,

1258
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,760
and then they came.

1259
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,000
And at this point,

1260
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,480
maybe

1261
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,760
each of them has a different background.

1262
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,720
Then her father, to support his daughter,

1263
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,520
just

1264
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,760
gave her gifts,

1265
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,280
boosted her popularity.

1266
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,960
"Worked to death."

1267
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,760
But what's going on between you two?

1268
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,280
She loves you.

1269
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,760
Is it possible

1270
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,600
she just wants your popularity,

1271
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,480
to help her with sales?

1272
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,560
Is she just riding on your fame?

1273
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,080
I don't want you to say that.

1274
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,320
Can we still believe in love?

1275
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:09,680
Seriously.

1276
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,240
But she loves you to the bone

1277
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,600
Yes

1278
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,800
Look, your face is everywhere

1279
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,040
She really loves me so blatantly

1280
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,280
She literally loves your face

1281
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,880
So cold

1282
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
Put on more clothes

1283
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,560
Come here, Shen Shen

1284
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,680
Let me put this scarf on you

1285
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,360
No

1286
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,440
Let's take a look in his parents' room

1287
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,200
Ju Success

1288
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,640
Opulent and dazzling

1289
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,080
So ostentatious

1290
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,520
Best Couple

1291
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
They're live streamers

1292
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,040
These two

1293
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,680
What does this mean?

1294
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,840
Waiting for you in the Great Family livestream

1295
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,240
The secret to being an extremely happy woman

1296
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,120
Is to spend his money

1297
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,720
Spend his money

1298
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,160
Self-made

1299
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,200
First check the bed

1300
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,040
There's a combination lock here

1301
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,560
Heart shape

1302
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,760
It's in English code

1303
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,040
Let's search around first

1304
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,680
There's something in this bag

1305
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,240
I think...

1306
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,280
Look what we found

1307
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,040
A computer

1308
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,000
Let's open it

1309
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,480
Ju Success

1310
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,800
I built myself from nothing

1311
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,600
Created astonishing wealth

1312
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,520
Own a seaside villa

1313
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,640
With a beautiful wife

1314
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,200
Want to be as successful as me?

1315
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,000
Step one:

1316
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,760
Shout it out loud

1317
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,120

1318
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,800
Shout loud for a surprise!

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,560

00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,440
Buy your lifetime success order

1321
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,920
Livestream video

1322
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,280
They're streamers

1323
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,400
Shout loud

1324
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,120
Shout loud to get it

1325
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,000
What to shout? Young man, what do you want?

1326
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,880
Password

1327
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,320
Shout loud

1328
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,480
Here we go again

1329
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,440
Who is the "killer"?

1330
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,760
"Killer", please come out

1331
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,680
What is this?

1332
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,800
Unbelievable

1333
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:43,680
What

1334
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,760
120 decibels

1335
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,720
A phone call

1336
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,200
Come

1337
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,240
Who's this?

1338
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,320
Butler

1339
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,720
Success

1340
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,720
I'm your childhood friend

1341
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,320
Li, your childhood friend

1342
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,480
I saw how successful you've become online

1343
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,840
I was hesitant to reach out

1344
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,560
Your courses are great

1345
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,280
Want to be as successful as me?

1346
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,160
From the $9.90 trial course

1347
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,680
To the $99,999

1348
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,120
Ultimate success package

1349
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,680
I bought them all

1350
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,400
But I was too foolish

1351
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,080
Spent all my $200,000 savings

1352
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:16,640
Everything's gone

1353
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,600
Now my mother is sick

1354
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,560
I wonder

1355
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,720
If I could borrow $100,000 for emergency

1356
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,120
His father told the butler

1357
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,880
I urgently need $100,000

1358
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,080
To help his childhood friend

1359
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,160
I must help him

1360
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,480
The butler said

1361
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,360
I know about your friend's situation

1362
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,480
But what's that got to do with me?

1363
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,800
You must give me $100,000 now

1364
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,480
This is what I deserve

1365
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,760
None of us are good people

1366
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,480
At worst, it's mutual destruction

1367
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,360
This father

1368
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,800
Wouldn't ask a butler for money

1369
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,320
Isn't he very wealthy?

1370
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,720
That person definitely isn't just a butler

1371
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:53,800
The butler said

1372
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,240
I advise you

1373
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,080
To properly prepare for the family reunion

1374
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,080
Unless I "die"

1375
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,200
Right

1376
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,920
Yes, very likely

1377
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,480
Case solved

1378
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,680
It's murder for money

1379
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,720
There's a phone here

1380
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,840
It's his mom's phone

1381
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,560
Isn't this the video?

1382
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,200
Look

1383
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,920
My sisters always ask me

1384
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,120
why your husband

1385
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,320
can be so successful

1386
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,000
Let me share a secret with you

1387
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,920
The trick is spending his money

1388
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,560
Spend his money

1389
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,440
If you don't understand

1390
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,320
Think about it

1391
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,800
If you don't spend his money

1392
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,080
how can you stay beautiful

1393
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,080
and maintain family harmony?

1394
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,920
If you don't spend his money

1395
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,840
how can you outshine all your sisters

1396
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,880
and flaunt your happiness?

1397
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,800
Hmm

1398
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,080
Now let me show you

1399
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,800
what new gifts I've received

1400
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,000
recently

1401
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,320
First is this

1402
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,040
luxury face cream everyone's using

1403
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,760
She sells products

1404
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,320
He sells success philosophy

1405
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,240
Come to my livestream

1406
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,520
to place orders

1407
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,840
High quality at low prices

1408
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,520
Absolutely great deals

1409
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,720
This bag is so expensive

1410
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,080
9,999 yuan

1411
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,200
Let me share another

1412
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,000
secret to eternal youth

1413
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,360
That is eating a bowl of

1414
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,680
Sanwan Noodle House's noodles daily

1415
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,360
Why did she go eat your noodles?

1416
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,520
How should I know?

1417
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,240
Who knows where she popped out from?

1418
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,240
Song, hurry!

1419
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,040
Die-hard fan

1420
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,120
You scammer!

1421
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:18,880
The products you recommended

1422
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,360
I bought them

1423
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,480
I did everything you said

1424
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,600
My husband Li Faxiao

1425
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,680
Not only didn't succeed

1426
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,320
but died suddenly from stress

1427
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,280
This die-hard fan

1428
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,280
was just now

1429
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,200
Only 9.9 yuan

1430
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,560
High quality at low price

1431
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,600
Absolutely great deal

1432
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,680
She's Li Faxiao's wife

1433
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,720
Just scamming people for money

1434
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,440
You two are just

1435
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,640
I checked those products you sell

1436
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,480
They're worthless

1437
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,200
I'm going to report you

1438
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,600
Are you free tonight?

1439
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,400
You can come to my place

1440
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,240
If you're in any trouble

1441
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,200
I'll help you

1442
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:49,720
The door's unlocked

1443
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,280
I'm coming in

1444
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,120
Waiting in the living room

1445
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,760
This die-hard fan has been to this house

1446
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,440
And this living room too

1447
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:54,880
And then

1448
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,760
How is this me?

1449
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,400
She went to eat noodles at your place

1450
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,880
Please call me Mrs. Bai

1451
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,040
She might just be

1452
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,600
She might be my die-hard fan

1453
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,240
So seductive, bro

1454
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:17,600
Why?

1455
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,840
You're always with someone else's wife

1456
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,760
hanging out together

1457
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,400
She was clearly spying

1458
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,360
I know

1459
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,800
Could it be Mrs. Bai then?

1460
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,040
Meaning

1461
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,880
Yes, Mrs. Ju has a crush on you

1462
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,320
What does that have to do with me?

1463
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:31,920
It's open

1464
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,600
Opened by Mrs. Bai (BTT)

1465
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,200
You're actually Guo Baoyou's father

1466
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,360
Dad

1467
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,760
What's this?

1468
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,200
Isn't this that symbol?

1469
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,360
You all

1470
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,520
will all

1471
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,000
"die"

1472
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,200
Look at this symbol

1473
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,840
The paperclip logo

1474
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,760
Right

1475
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,200
It's what we saw earlier at the beginning

1476
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,160
So what's this for then?

1477
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:04,840
There's nothing here

1478
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,360
Is it that "poison"?

1479
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:07,800
The gas spray

1480
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,520
Gas "poison"

1481
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,520
Impossible

1482
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,760
If it's triggered this way

1483
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,440
This show is a bit

1484
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,680
a bit exaggerated, right?

1485
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,760
Murder weapon

1486
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,120
Alright

1487
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:22,560
Case solved

1488
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,600
It's this lady

1489
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,120
This is

1490
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,200
Who is this?

1491
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,760
Is this Guo Baoyou?

1492
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,560
Can't tell who it is

1493
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,600
There's a pull tab here

1494
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,600
This is his mother's live stream

1495
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,160
What kind of family tree is this?

1496
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,240
Status: Daughter

1497
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,520
Ju Xingyun (Lucky Ju)

1498
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,240
Status: Father

1499
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:48,920
Ju Chenggong (Successful Ju)

1500
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,440
I think what she's doing is

1501
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,960
she needs to label all these people here

1502
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,840
for her live stream to work properly

1503
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,920
Right

1504
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,520
Acting as a couple

1505
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:01,960
Probably

1506
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,560
The crime scene is important

1507
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,960
What music is playing

1508
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:23,680
Their house

1509
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,160
Go to the bathroom

1510
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,240
And still have music playing

1511
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,120
What's this remote control for?

1512
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:33,720
I don't know.

1513
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,000
There's something that can turn on.

1514
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,720
Probably.

1515
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,200
Any changes?

1516
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,240
What turns on?

1517
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,560
Do you see that cap over there?

1518
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:48,760
Yes.

1519
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,400
There's a cap.

1520
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,680
There's a bottle inside here.

1521
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:54,720
Empty.

1522
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,760
Plant nutrient solution.

1523
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,440
Plant nutrient solution.

1524
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,080
It should be placed like this.

1525
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:01,760
Right.

1526
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,520
It's all on top.

1527
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,240
Yeah, this much on top.

1528
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,440
How did it fall down?

1529
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,320
I think we should go up and take a look.

1530
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:09,960
There's a stool over there.

1531
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,520
Yes, tall enough without a stool

1532
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,120
All plant nutrient solutions

1533
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,120
Colorless and odorless

1534
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,000
But not this one

1535
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,680
This one has color

1536
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,080
Plant nutrient solution

1537
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:27,680
Empty

1538
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,240
It is

1539
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,560
It must be the "culprit"

1540
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,320
This

1541
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:33,920
Drink it

1542
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,040
Drink it

1543
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,640
No

1544
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,600
The "culprit" put the plant nutrient label

1545
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,280
On the "Kill You" bottle

1546
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,480
And placed it here

1547
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,920
Replacing a nutrient bottle

1548
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,040
And this cap

1549
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,400
Was it at the bottom earlier?

1550
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,680
That cap is different from this one

1551
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,160
This kind

1552
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,440
Even if you drop it

1553
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:47,840
Or spill it

1554
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,600
It won't come off

1555
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,360
That cap would fall off immediately when tilted

1556
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,480
Meaning this bottle had to be tipped over

1557
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,400
To release the contents, right?

1558
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,120
And look at his other

1559
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,000
Plant nutrient solutions weren't placed inside

1560
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,200
But that bottle of plant nutrient

1561
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:58,840
Was inside

1562
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,080
Meaning he intended for that flowerpot

1563
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,840
To fall

1564
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,120
It must have been a mechanism

1565
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,960
But there's one question

1566
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,560
Why is this cover open?

1567
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:07,760
This drain cover

1568
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,400
This sewer

1569
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,840
This drain cover is metal

1570
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:11,960
Hook it inward

1571
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,720
Check inside the sewer

1572
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,360
Is there anything?

1573
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,520
Nothing

1574
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,040
No, wait

1575
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,000
Wait a minute

1576
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,600
Foot-activated flush sensor

1577
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,520
Because his foot would pass by

1578
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,440
Triggering the toilet flush

1579
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,600
Then activating some mechanism

1580
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,040
The person fell backward like this

1581
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,400
Wait

1582
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,560
This metal (drain cover) was sticking out

1583
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,120
Why is this cover open?

1584
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,880
Where does it need demagnetizing?

1585
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,440
It needs a magnet.

1586
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,040
Is it here?

1587
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,240
Attach it.

1588
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:48,760
Seems like it.

1589
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,680
Put it on him.

1590
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,040
Does his shoe have eyelets?

1591
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,360
When he flushed the water,

1592
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,800
he must have gotten close to the drain cover.

1593
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,000
So this demagnetizing piece

1594
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,760
must have already been

1595
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,440
stuck to the sole of his shoe.

1596
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,600
Exactly.

1597
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,240
So when he flushed,

1598
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,640
it triggered some mechanism,

1599
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,080
and then

1600
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,200
released that "poison gas,"

1601
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:04,920
which "killed" him.

1602
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,240
And he wasn't strangling himself.

1603
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,120
Cool.

1604
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,720
Great, we've successfully deduced it again.

1605
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,040
Alright.

1606
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,440
You can graduate smoothly now.

1607
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,120
Graduate.

1608
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,000
Thank you.

1609
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,520
Okay?

1610
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,400
But it shouldn't be like this.

1611
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:16,840
Because

1612
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,880
if he stepped on this and "died,"

1613
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,760
when we came in,

1614
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,360
this thing should have been here.

1615
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:22,600
But

1616
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,920
we found it in the outside drain,

1617
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,840
so before we entered,

1618
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,800
someone took this thing

1619
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,360
and threw it

1620
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,120
into the pool.

1621
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:34,760
Let's go.

1622
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,440
Go.

1623
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,280
Is there anything on the "corpse"?

1624
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,440
Should we search it?

1625
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:43,960
Check behind it.

1626
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,040
He was lying down

1627
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:45,520
on the ground.

1628
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,080
Three

1629
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:46,880
Two, one

1630
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,240
Go!

1631
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:48,640
A phone.

1632
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,280
Just as expected.

1633
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:51,960
This is the butler.

1634
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,000
This Guo Baoyou...

1635
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,080
A photo.

1636
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:55,560
Male,

1637
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,160
26 years old,

1638
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:56,760
Mystery novelist.

1639
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,680
He highlighted some key points.

1640
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,120
Top of the popularity charts.

1641
00:51:59,120 --> 00:51:59,920
A-list writer.

1642
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,280
Clearly,

1643
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,720
riding the hype.

1644
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,080
Right.

1645
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,000
He was targeted, huh?

1646
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,640
And then...

1647
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,200
A renovation site acceptance form.

1648
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,720
Butler Ying.

1649
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,080
The butler paid for this.

1650
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,360
Paid by the butler.

1651
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,240
This is...

1652
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,520
the place we're dining at today.

1653
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,840
was freshly renovated.

1654
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,400
The goal was to make Guo Baoyou believe

1655
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,800
he was this family's son.

1656
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,160
Poor Guo Baoyou.

1657
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:20,760
Yeah.

1658
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,560
He's being manipulated.

1659
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,640
And his mother is my fan.

1660
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:24,880
His mother loves you.

1661
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,920
His mother isn't your fan.

1662
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,520
His mother loves you.

1663
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,360
She's Mrs. Bai.

1664
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,280
Then Zhenzhen Jiajia...

1665
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,280
what should we do?

1666
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,840
Bro, how do you have so many admirers?

1667
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,280
I'll make noodles for you for a lifetime

1668
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,280
My sister fell for you too

1669
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,840
Eating noodles from Three Bowls Noodle Shop every day

1670
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,800
Is opening a noodle shop really that attractive?

1671
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,480
There's no other way

1672
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,360
You fell for me just because of a bowl of noodles?

1673
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,240
Alright

1674
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:49,560
Between us

1675
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,200
there's nothing left to discuss, right?

1676
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,760
Only this phone is useful

1677
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,120
Here

1678
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:53,760
The "deceased's" phone

1679
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,360
Let's take a look

1680
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,400
Examine it carefully

1681
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,120
This is

1682
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,000
Who is this?

1683
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,440
Guo Baoyou?

1684
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:03,920
That's not him

1685
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,600
It is him

1686
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,080
But he appeared in

1687
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,040
this renovated setting

1688
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:10,760
So Guo Baoyou

1689
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,120
is also working with them

1690
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,120
No

1691
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,480
He's not with them

1692
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,160
Guo Baoyou must have found out

1693
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:18,360
Right

1694
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,560
We can search Guo Baoyou's place

1695
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:19,920
Yes

1696
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,440
How do we get in?

1697
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,640
Then we'll trick our way in

1698
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,440
Never would have thought

1699
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
You may know a person's face

1700
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,400
But not their heart

1701
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,080
Let's go ask him for the key

1702
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,800
Let's go

1703
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,600
Cheng

1704
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,640
Why did you come here?

1705
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,680
Yeah, what's up with you guys?

1706
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,880
We want to check out your place

1707
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,120
Just give us your keys

1708
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,160
Come check out my place

1709
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,560
You're the person involved in this case

1710
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,760
We should go there

1711
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,520
Need to take a look

1712
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:45,920
Seriously

1713
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,920
You can't avoid this

1714
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,040
Hand them over

1715
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,960
Then I should go with you, right?

1716
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,720
No need

1717
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,360
You can't come

1718
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,240
I can't go?

1719
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,360
Of course you can't go

1720
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,160
We're going to search your place

1721
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,600
What if you hide evidence?

1722
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,680
You're actually telling people to their face

1723
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,680
"We're going to search your place"

1724
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,240
He's suspicious

1725
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:00,920
You two be careful

1726
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,840
Pack our bags

1727
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,280
Let's go

1728
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,600
Got it

1729
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,520
Here

1730
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,120
So much stuff

1731
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,680
This place...

1732
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,640
His childhood toys

1733
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,320
Lots of letters

1734
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,200
Birthday cards his dad wrote him every year

1735
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:20,640
Right?

1736
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,040
Started writing them since 2004

1737
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,640
2005

1738
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,160
2006

1739
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:24,880
2007

1740
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,160
"Today is your 26th birthday"

1741
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,840
"And the 19th year since I left you"

1742
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,120
"Happy birthday"

1743
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:32,760
"Dad will always love you"

1744
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,480
"Don't look for Dad"

1745
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,800
"Don't look for Dad"

1746
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,920
"Don't look for Dad"

1747
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,080
"Don't look for Dad"

1748
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,680
His dad would count the years every time

1749
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,520
How old he was

1750
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,760
And which year it was since he left

1751
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,000
And always ended with

1752
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,720
"Don't look for Dad"

1753
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,080
What is this

1754
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,160
So childish

1755
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:52,920
Guo Baoyou

1756
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,240
It shows Guo Baoyou's inner self

1757
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,320
Lacks paternal love deeply

1758
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,000
Right

1759
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
A love-deprived youth

1760
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:01,800
What

1761
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:03,560
No

1762
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,720
It just (moves)

1763
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,320
You really

1764
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,560
I already

1765
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,600
I already opened it earlier, okay

1766
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:25,840
Another phone

1767
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,240
Let me check

1768
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,040
He is

1769
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,160
The one just now

1770
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,360
You mentioned the renovation site

1771
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,600
The one who looked like him

1772
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,240
But he went there secretly

1773
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,280
Went secretly

1774
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,680
He

1775
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,560
June 14th

1776
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,440
Today is the 17th

1777
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:46,920
He probably just wanted to see

1778
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,760
what they were doing

1779
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,240
Let's listen

1780
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,480
to the recording

1781
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,160
He can't threaten me with my secrets

1782
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,720
After Guo Baoyou acknowledges their relationship

1783
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,080
help me deal with him

1784
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,440
Anyway, he has more secrets

1785
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:58,840
in my possession

1786
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,560
I'm not afraid of his resistance

1787
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:00,920
The butler

1788
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,840
So the butler wants to "kill" someone

1789
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,800
This is the bathroom music

1790
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,440
It's before he entered the bathroom, right?

1791
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,120
Yes

1792
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:12,880
He doesn't trust

1793
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,960
this so-called father who acknowledges him

1794
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,680
So he investigated

1795
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,360
That's why he secretly

1796
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,080
wore a mask

1797
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,760
and sneaked into the renovation site

1798
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,360
then recorded these people

1799
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,080
Unexpectedly

1800
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,080
he heard

1801
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,680
"After Guo Baoyou acknowledges their relationship"

1802
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,240
"help me deal with him"

1803
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,400
Settle it after the acknowledgment

1804
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,640
It probably means eliminate

1805
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,160
Ju Chenggong

1806
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:30,680
Is that so?

1807
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,280
Yes

1808
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,600
Then why after nineteen years

1809
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,640
would his father suddenly want

1810
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,480
to acknowledge this son?

1811
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:39,840
If every year

1812
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,840
he knew where he was

1813
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,840
why

1814
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,880
Why so many whys

1815
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,320
Do you have any secrets you haven't told us?

1816
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,640
I don't have any secrets.

1817
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,440
Even though your bangs are flat now,

1818
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,640
but I can go.

1819
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,840
Can we really trust you?

1820
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,960
No, because I really...

1821
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,000
I came here with you guys too...

1822
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,880
That thing we...

1823
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,840
We all came together.

1824
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:02,520
No, I mean...

1825
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,120
How about we go to my grandpa's room first?

1826
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,080
The computer in my grandpa's room...

1827
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:05,800
Maybe we should check it?

1828
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,200
Let's take a look.

1829
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:06,800
Okay.

1830
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,400
My grandpa probably isn't there, right?

1831
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,680
No one

1832
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,560
Quick

1833
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,840
Hello everyone

1834
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,680
I have an incredibly powerful

1835
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,400
health preservation secret

1836
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,560
This is it

1837
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:32,960
Take a look

1838
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,320
Health-preserving pills

1839
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,800
Let me tell you

1840
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,320
After taking these

1841
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,280
you can climb five flights of stairs without stopping

1842
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,440
Look at his current condition

1843
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,200
See what he looks like now

1844
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:42,880
Look at his current state

1845
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,000
If you don't believe me, I'll show you

1846
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,240
Look

1847
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,680
After taking them, he's covered in wrinkles

1848
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:46,840
How impressive

1849
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,000
He's going upstairs

1850
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,520
Yellow-colored

1851
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,320
What did he see?

1852
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,360
Why is there someone lying here?

1853
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,520
Everyone look

1854
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:56,960
Who is this?

1855
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,400
You scared me to "death"

1856
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,760
A girl

1857
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:03,840
There's a woman lying here

1858
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,000
A female student is lying here

1859
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,440
This is a "dead person"

1860
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,160
A girl has "died"

1861
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:09,960
Long hair

1862
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,160
Who is this?

1863
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:15,760
There's a painting here.

1864
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,200
See?

1865
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,120
There's a painting on this wall.

1866
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,080
Right.

1867
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:18,960
That's the one.

1868
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,080
This is the "corpse."

1869
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,640
I can't say anymore.

1870
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,400
Someone's coming, I think.

1871
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,880
While he was climbing the stairs,

1872
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,720
a girl "died" in the stairwell.

1873
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,200
A woman "died."

1874
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,760
This was before that incident.

1875
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,600
He recorded this before it happened.

1876
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,760
Before this incident.

1877
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,600
This might be the butler's secret.

1878
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,760
He can forget about using my secret to threaten me.

1879
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,000
How can your place be such a mess?

1880
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,840
Should we go to the crime scene?

1881
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,360
Take a look?

1882
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,760
Right on the stairs.

1883
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,040
That girl "died" in the stairwell.

1884
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,520
But are you sure it's this one?

1885
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,040
This is it.

1886
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:52,880
Yes.

1887
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,720
That painting is there.

1888
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,280
Here.

1889
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,440
Feels like this is the spot.

1890
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,520
He came up from below.

1891
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,440
And then the person "died" here.

1892
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,480
"Bloodstains."

1893
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:04,520
Right.

1894
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,120
Drip, drip.

1895
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,640
Look at these "bloodstains."

1896
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,640
Where did he drag it to?

1897
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,000
To here.

1898
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,960
Yes, there's more here.

1899
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,960
And more.

1900
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,200
There's some here too.

1901
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:14,760
This is it, right?

1902
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:15,880
Yes, this is it.

1903
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,200
It's gone.

1904
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:24,960
Is this...

1905
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,360
This is...

1906
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,160
How did it get to the restaurant?

1907
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:28,920
He must have hidden the "body"

1908
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,440
here, right?

1909
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,360
Let's see where the "bloodstains" lead.

1910
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:32,800
This...

1911
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,600
This drop is here.

1912
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,320
Where's the next drop?

1913
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,160
Where's the next drop?

1914
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,240
There's such a big piece here

1915
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:02,720
Here's

1916
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,520
Right

1917
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,160
Hidden under the dining table

1918
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:10,720
Under the dining table

1919
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:16,800
Wait a moment

1920
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:17,880
Hold on

1921
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,240
The shoe is here.

1922
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:25,680
Right.

1923
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,040
You can take that shoe out and have a look.

1924
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:27,880
Is it the one we saw?

1925
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,160
Foot.

1926
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,680
That shoe is it.

1927
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,800
It's that lady's small leather shoe.

1928
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,200
So he buried that person here.

1929
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,520
Buried in the dining table

1930
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,040
We were just eating on this

1931
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,400
This family is really "sick"

1932
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,320
This is a "dead" person

1933
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,520
I can't say anymore

1934
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,320
Your grandfather served time in prison

1935
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,600
Your sister loves you

1936
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,160
The acting couple might be

1937
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,840
They're all doing live streams

1938
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,640
Specially arranged this grand dinner

1939
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,280
We were just eating on this earlier

1940
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,400
Don't panic no matter what

1941
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,520
Stay calm

1942
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,520
Cooperate more

1943
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,080
This family is truly "twisted"

1944
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,680
We found his "corpse"

1945
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,280
Someone keeps warning us

1946
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,560
Another doll

1947
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,200
He's predicting "death"

1948
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,480
Someone has been trying to help us

1949
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:34,640
Footprints

1950
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,720
This is where the elevator is

1951
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,320
He deliberately avoided us

1952
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,880
The evidence is irrefutable now

1953
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,360
Wait a minute

1954
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:44,680
No

1955
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,040
You just said my husband "killed" him

1956
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,040
How much money do you think I have

1957
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:47,560
to satisfy you?

1958
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,560
I want to take a chance

1959
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,760
I received it this morning

1960
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,600
A "death" notice

1961
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,800
I have some connection

1962
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,520
with that Gu Xiangying

1963
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,400
Gu what?

1964
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,480
Who is Gu Xiangying?

1965
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,160
And who is Gu Xiangying again?

1966
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,240
What secrets are you keeping from us?

1967
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,040
Listen to it speak

1968
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,040
Don't attend the family reunion banquet

1969
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,560
Because of love

1970
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,520
we don't easily feel sorrow

1971
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,640
so we remain

1972
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,200
the picture of happiness

1973
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,800
Because of love

1974
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,200
grows so simply
