Dad.

It was a younger sister.

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,860
What brings you here at this hour?

10
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,560
- Tell me.
- You're sweating so much.

11
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,560
Tell me

12
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,600
what the important thing
I don't know is.

13
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,460
Are you trembling?

14
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,700
What makes you…

15
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,800
Just tell me

16
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,130
what the important thing
I don't know is.

17
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,400
What's the point of asking me
when you already know everything?

18
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,130
That's right.

19
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,060
Yoo Jin-kang.

20
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,700
The person you searched
so hard for…

21
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,260
Your real sibling.

22
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:56,360
Your real sister.

23
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,300
You just left the medicine.
Where did you go?

24
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,260
If you keep doing this,
I'll get used to waiting for you.

25
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,400
Hurry home.

26
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,400
Are you really okay with who I am?

27
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,130
Of course.

28
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,930
I want to be born again.

29
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,230
Where did you go?

30
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,560
I asked where you went.

31
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,000
You have a key, right?

32
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,960
Key?

33
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,659
Oh, you lost yours?

34
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,700
We're done.

35
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,630
Let's stop here.

36
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,900
What?

37
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,330
Are you breaking up with me?

38
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,600
Kim Moo-young.

39
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,600
Kim Moo-young.

40
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,160
Just leave.

41
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,400
What are you talking about?

42
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,300
Just barely 12 hours ago,
we went to the amusement park together.

43
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,700
Then we went back home,
ate together,

44
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,060
slept together,

45
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,659
and you went out
to get some medicine for me.

46
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,900
That was just 4 hours ago.

47
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,630
Tell me.

48
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,400
What happened to you
within those 4 hours?

49
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
You don't get it?

50
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,530
I dumped you.

51
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,660
No.

52
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,800
Tell me the real reason.

53
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,230
What reason do I need
for my feelings to change?

54
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,600
I've seen that look on you a lot.

55
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,800
When you whine,
when you're being stubborn,

56
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,830
when you say something
you don't mean,

57
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,559
and when you get hurt.

58
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,799
So tell me,

59
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,400
what really happened to you

60
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,030
and who really hurt you.

61
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,900
Woah.

62
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,900
Yoo Jin-kang. You really think
highly of yourself.

63
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,530
I said I dumped you.

64
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,100
What?

65
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,430
You think you're special?

66
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,330
Don't you remember Seung-ah?

67
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,100
You're just like her to me.

68
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,230
I'm talking about you.

69
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,830
You can't even tell me
what really happened to you.

70
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,030
How dare you bring up her name?

71
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,000
We're done.

72
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,960
Let's stop here.

73
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,560
So tell me,

74
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,930
what really happened to you.

75
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,460
I said I dumped you.

76
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,760
What?

77
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,360
You think you're special?

78
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,760
I know you're lying.

79
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,100
You begged me not to leave.

80
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,400
You told me not to leave
even if you tell me to.

81
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,800
If you don't say you hate me,
I won't go anywhere.

82
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,330
Don't go even if I say I hate you.

83
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,060
You'll say that?

84
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,400
I mean, don't leave
no matter what.

85
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,900
Even if I say I hate you,
it's 100% a lie.

86
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,330
Why would you lie then?

87
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,430
I won't.

88
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,160
Don't do it.

89
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,360
I won't.

90
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,300
I said don't.

91
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,500
I won't. Definitely not.

92
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,960
Aren't you going to work?

93
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,860
Do you want to get fired
on top of this?

94
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,800
Tell me why you're doing this.

95
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,430
So if what you're saying is true,
explain it to me

96
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,660
so I can understand!

97
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,530
Angel's Tear.
Does the offer still stand?

98
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,960
Fortunately, yes.

99
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,130
That's great. I'm in.

100
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,160
Do you really need a job

101
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,859
or are you playing a game with me?

102
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,829
Who's going to inform me
of its progress?

103
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,060
I'd like to get started
right away.

104
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,400
- Bring in the head of the strategic team.
- Yes, ma'am.

105
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,960
Anyway, welcome aboard.

106
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,930
Please feel free to use

107
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,960
everything the company
provides you with.

108
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,660
Of course.

109
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,460
We're planning to start a

110
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,930
buy 1 get 1 free promotion.

111
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,030
Since the store is located
near industrial offices,

112
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,200
working employees
in their 20s and 30s will…

113
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,900
Aren't you curious?

114
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,260
Why Kim Moo-young

115
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,860
suddenly came to me?

116
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,330
I'm curious.

117
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,760
I found a key.

118
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,930
The key to move Kim Moo-young.

119
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,400
Tell me the reason

120
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,560
why you're doing this.

121
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,760
Just once.

122
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,530
Can't you reconsider?

123
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,000
All the times we spent together

124
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,330
and what we went through

125
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,960
while we were in love.

126
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,260
Can't you just reconsider?

127
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,000
Kim Moo-young.

128
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,130
Kim Moo-young.

129
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,200
Kim Moo-young.

130
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,800
Kim Moo-young.

131
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,360
Kim Moo-young.

132
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,160
Kim Moo-young.

133
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,530
Kim Moo-young.

134
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,330
Open the door!

135
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,400
Kim Moo-young.

136
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,830
Open up, please!

137
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,900
Kim Moo-young. Kim Moo-young.

138
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,960
Kim Moo-young. Kim Moo-young.

139
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,460
Kim Moo-young.

140
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,000
Kim Moo-young, open up.

141
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,300
Kim Moo-young.

142
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,400
Could you please come
get your sister?

143
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,930
Kim Moo-young.

144
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,800
Kim Moo-young…

145
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,060
Kim Moo-young.

146
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,060
Yoo Jin-kang.

147
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,800
Jin-kook.

148
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,860
Get up.

149
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,560
Jin-kook, he's acting strange.

150
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,260
Get up.

151
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,060
Let's go.

152
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Fever reducer and vitamins,

153
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,000
$112 in total.

154
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,200
Colds these days are too strong.

155
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,100
- Thanks.
- Have a good day.

156
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,200
Kim Moo-young.

157
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,030
Well done.

158
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,130
Well done breaking up
with my sister.

159
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,760
It wasn't for you.

160
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,630
I got sick of her.

161
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,130
Whatever.

162
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,660
Keep a better eye on her.

163
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,330
So she won't come and annoy me.

164
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,500
This is Kim Moo-young's letter of
appointment as Angel's Tear's CEO.

165
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,360
(Letter of Appointment
Angel's Tear CEO Kim Moo-young)

166
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,030
Ask me

167
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,430
what the key is.

168
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,900
What is the key you found?

169
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,260
(Registered Certificate)

170
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,560
This is Kang Soon-gu's family
register I gave to you.

171
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,130
(Lee Mi-young Deceased)

172
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,130
Well,
(Lee Mi-young Deceased)

173
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,260
I didn't really find one.
I made one up.

174
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,000
What do you mean?

175
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,530
He seems to think that

176
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,860
Yoo Jin-kang is his sister.

177
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,860
His real younger sister.

178
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,430
What?

179
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,330
Tell me

180
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,200
what the important thing
I don't know is.

181
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,560
I wasn't sure but I
went along with him just in case.

182
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,060
What's the point of asking me
when you already know everything?

183
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,000
That's right.

184
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,630
Yoo Jin-kang.

185
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,560
The person you searched
so hard for…

186
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,330
Your real sibling.

187
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,930
Your real sister.

188
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,000
Those arrogant eyes of his

189
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,500
turned so miserable.

190
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,200
So I knew…

191
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,430
That was real.

192
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,030
Gosh, I'm so thrilled.

193
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,360
What should I do?
This is so thrilling!

194
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,400
Oh no, Jin-kang.

195
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,300
Oh dear.

196
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,960
Your fever went down.

197
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,460
Let's eat some porridge.
So you can take your medicine.

198
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,330
Stay here. I'll get it for you.

199
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,600
Jin-kook.

200
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,260
Let's get going.

201
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,830
This is Room 2.

202
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,400
It'll be pretty light in here.

203
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,000
But Room 3 will be
a little darker.

204
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,530
Do you like it?

205
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
I picked it out myself for you.

206
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,100
A lot.

207
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,300
Why are you working so hard?

208
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,160
They told me you're
pretty much living here.

209
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,060
I should. We're opening soon.

210
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,960
Let me know if you need anything.

211
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,500
What about your house?

212
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,560
You look stylish and
your car fits you.

213
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,800
But your house?

214
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,660
Are you going to stay here?

215
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,730
I should at least sleep
at a real place.

216
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,400
What about the rest?

217
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,760
It sounds like you're
saying the rest is fake.

218
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,700
Don't you ever feel this way?

219
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,030
When you're desperate
for fake things.

220
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,360
Put on your scarf properly.

221
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,730
Okay.

222
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,060
You know colds always go away.

223
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,630
No matter how strong they are,

224
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,730
they eventually go away.

225
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,730
Right.

226
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,400
What do you want for dinner?

227
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,100
Codfish stew. You said you wanted it.

228
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,699
Sure.

229
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,659
I won't finish late today,

230
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,630
so I'll go grocery shopping.

231
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:16,130
Okay, codfish stew for dinner!

232
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,699
Have a good day.

233
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,600
- You too.
- Alright.

234
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,730
- See you later.
- Yes.

235
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,460
- Good morning.
- Manager!

236
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,130
Are you okay?
Are you feeling better now?

237
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,659
I'm sorry. I'm sure there was
a lot to do on your own.

238
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,630
No, that was okay.

239
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:50,699
But something unbelievable
happened while you were gone.

240
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,929
What is it?

241
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,230
Remember what I told you?

242
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,030
I said Kim Moo-young would
take over Angel's Tear.

243
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,060
- Uh?
- It's been confirmed.

244
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,660
It's going to open soon,

245
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,230
so he's busy preparing for it.

246
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,800
President Hwang must be upset

247
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,630
but what can she do?
It's all over now.

248
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,900
Remember what I told you?

249
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,730
I said Kim Moo-young would
take over Angel's Tear.

250
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,700
What do you want to eat?

251
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,460
I hate you

252
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,360
but I'll let it slide
because you're sick.

253
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,430
Uh? It's my chance!

254
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,000
I must think of
something delicious.

255
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,760
- What?
- What should we eat?

256
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,060
- No, no.
- What should we eat?

257
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,500
Think about it.

258
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,860
Why are you in a daze?

259
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,200
What? You want a ride?

260
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,260
Tell me if you want one.

261
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,400
Somedays,

262
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,160
I really want to believe
that everything is over.

263
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,200
That he was always a bastard

264
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,730
and that I had been fooled.

265
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,730
So I try to remember
his most evil face.

266
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,430
The face of the worst
in the world.

267
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,230
But I can't in the end.

268
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,430
Because other faces

269
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,030
will show up.

270
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,800
I'm sorry for showing up
so suddenly like this.

271
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,130
It's okay. I was happy
to get your call.

272
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,000
I wanted to meet you.

273
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,430
Thank you for visiting me.

274
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,900
Doctor.

275
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,160
What kind of person
is Kim Moo-young?

276
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,960
I don't know.

277
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,330
How could I know
everything about him?

278
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,600
But you've been watching him
ever since he was young.

279
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,760
I don't know everything but

280
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,730
I know one thing for sure.

281
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,560
When he was young,

282
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,800
he looked at the world

283
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,730
with a surprisingly
perceptive eye.

284
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,930
Think about it.

285
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,560
What would this world be like
when someone as clever

286
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,200
and emotional like Moo-young
looks at it?

287
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,760
Probably full of strange things.

288
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,330
And I was part of them.

289
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,400
One day, I was fishing and I saw

290
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,430
a boy sitting and watching me.

291
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,430
It was Moo-young.

292
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,400
You are…

293
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,030
Hello.

294
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,830
What are you doing here?

295
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,000
Why are you letting them go?

296
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,630
So they can go home.

297
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,260
So they can quickly go home
and eat dinner.

298
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,800
Hello.

299
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,700
You want a drink?

300
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,500
From then on, he came every day
and watched me.

301
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,860
He didn't answer
even though I talked to him.

302
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,630
Goodbye, see you tomorrow.

303
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,600
So I always greeted him,
that was it.

304
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,200
After about a week,

305
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,530
he didn't come to
watch me that day.

306
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,230
I was packing up,

307
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,130
when he finally came by.

308
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,460
I finally realized that

309
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:46,300
he was criticizing me.

310
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:50,730
You pretend to be a good person

311
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,860
and let the fish go
as if you're doing a good thing

312
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,730
when in fact, the fish die
because of you.

313
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,700
And that was true.

314
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,330
I thought I was giving
the fish freedom

315
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,430
when I released them.

316
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,100
Without realizing that
I was hurting them.

317
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,230
So I quit fishing from
that day on.

318
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,960
I heard from the nun

319
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,030
that you went to Haesan
with Moo-young.

320
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,360
That day, she asked him
who you were.

321
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,700
Who is she?

322
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,460
Then he said…

323
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,900
A girl I'd like to look good for.

324
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,560
A girl I'd like to look good for.

325
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,700
If ever,

326
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,100
Moo-young who couldn't
open his heart to this world,

327
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,230
finally starts to open up
to this place,

328
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,830
it must be because of you.

329
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,160
That's what the nun
and I both thought.

330
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,000
Yoo Jin-kang?

331
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,230
You're here to see Kim Moo-young.

332
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,160
Let's get inside.

333
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,600
Do you want a drink?

334
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,530
Or water?

335
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,500
No, I'm good.

336
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,800
You must be having a hard time.

337
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,260
I heard when you break up,

338
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,500
it's always harder for the
person who got dumped.

339
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,660
When is Kim Moo-young coming?

340
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,930
Ask me if you have questions.

341
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,830
I know more about you two

342
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,430
than you think.

343
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,200
If you listen to my story,

344
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,100
I'm sure you'd be able
to give up on him too.

345
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,130
If you don't want to find out
from me,

346
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,460
ask your brother Jin-kook.

347
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,260
About what happened

348
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,230
between your brother
and Kim Moo-young

349
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,530
25 years ago.

350
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,230
- 25 years ago?
- That's right.

351
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,130
You're deeply involved
in this issue as well.

352
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,560
Hey, you're here.

353
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,500
What brings you here?

354
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,260
- Let's talk.
- Say it here.

355
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,800
What? I thought you
wanted to talk.

356
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,060
You can stay.

357
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,130
She knows about our relationship.

358
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,630
So say it here if there's anything
you want to tell me.

359
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,030
You're such an idiot.

360
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:00,900
You look like
you want to go after her.

361
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,930
What did you two talk about?

362
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,630
If you don't want to find out
from me,

363
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,900
ask your brother Jin-kook.

364
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,760
About what happened

365
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:17,660
between your brother
and Kim Moo-young

366
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,800
25 years ago.

367
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,800
You're deeply involved
in this issue as well.

368
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,200
25 years ago?

369
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,700
Yes.

370
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,460
What happened

371
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:52,130
between them 25 years ago?

372
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,600
Come on.

373
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,400
Nothing happened between
themthat long ago.

374
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,100
I heard I'm related to it as well.

375
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,660
Who the hell said that to you?

376
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,460
Tak.

377
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,830
I'm not a kid anymore.

378
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,560
I need to know too.

379
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,230
Uhm…

380
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,630
Jin-kang, I…

381
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,300
Tak.

382
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,960
I know I'm not his real sister.

383
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,660
What?

384
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,130
Jin-kang.

385
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:38,160
When…

386
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,100
When did you find out?

387
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,860
When I was in junior high.

388
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,300
But… Still…

389
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,300
He's still my brother.

390
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,760
So I must know

391
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,960
what happened to them.

392
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,800
The reason he hated
Moo-young so much

393
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,030
is related to the incident, right?

394
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,200
The incident that
happened 25 years ago.

395
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,260
It's not true.

396
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,530
He didn't hate him.

397
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:16,360
He felt sorry for him
and he was afraid.

398
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,630
Why would he be?

399
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,560
Fine, I'll tell you.

400
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,660
But let's be clear
about one thing.

401
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,260
I don't know who told you what but

402
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:38,100
this is between
Jin-kook and Moo-young.

403
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,730
It doesn't have anything to do
with you. Okay?

404
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:44,300
Okay.

405
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,530
Kim Moo-young's father…

406
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,600
He was a criminal.

407
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,400
I know. I heard.

408
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,060
So you knew?

409
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,660
It was your brother who first
arrived at the crime scene.

410
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,400
The world thinks Kim Moo-young's
father jumped off the cliff

411
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,330
to kill himself after the murder.

412
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,660
When in fact,

413
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,660
your brother killed him.

414
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,530
Jin-kook…

415
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,930
killed him?

416
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,100
But that was self-defense.

417
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,330
He was holding a weapon

418
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,000
and he tried to
attack Jin-kook first.

419
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,260
So Jin-kook had
to pull the trigger…

420
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,830
You must've been really curious.

421
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,130
You even drove me home.

422
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,730
Yes.

423
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,830
I'm much more of a jealous person

424
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,030
than you may think.

425
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,460
And yet,

426
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,500
you said yes.

427
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,460
Want to come upstairs?

428
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,760
If you come upstairs now,

429
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:53,060
I might tell you
what I told your sister.

430
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,830
Okay.

431
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:09,600
She looked like she was in agony.

432
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,760
So I threw her a bone.

433
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:17,730
What did you tell her?

434
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,500
I told her

435
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,330
to ask her brother

436
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,260
about what happened
between you and Jin-kook

437
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:26,230
25 years ago.

438
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,730
And that it probably has a lot

439
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,500
to do with her.

440
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,260
You're upset.

441
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,160
You're always so calm and collected
but you lose it

442
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:47,530
when something related to
Yoo Jin-kang comes up.

443
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,530
What?

444
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,500
Are you really mad?

445
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,500
Because of what?

446
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,160
You have no intention of stopping.

447
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,100
No matter what I say.

448
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,000
Why would I quit this game
when it's so fun?

449
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,130
It's not a game.

450
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,600
Then what is this?

451
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,130
What are you doing
with that serious face?

452
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,130
I'm regretting this.

453
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,060
What?

454
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,060
I know people like you very well.

455
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,430
Because of my own idiotic anger,

456
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,030
I came to you with
my own two feet.

457
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,060
What's up?

458
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,730
I have a favor.

459
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,030
I need a gun.

460
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,100
- Can you get it for me?
- A gun?

461
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,560
I dragged you into this.

462
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,600
Are you writing a confessional?

463
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,700
I thought I'd be the only one

464
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,000
left broken by this.

465
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,160
It's my fault.

466
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,600
I beg you.

467
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,400
Please leave those people alone.

468
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:44,860
Stop right there.

469
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:48,830
The moment you open that door,
I'll call your sister.

470
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,430
The younger sister of yours
you love so much.

471
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,800
What?

472
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,030
You really loved her?

473
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,430
I guess you did.

474
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,630
You're pissing me off.

475
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,800
What should I tell her first?

476
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:48,030
Don't worry, kid.

477
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,700
Kim Moo-young loves you.

478
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,800
He'll love you until he dies.

479
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,430
But why did he leave you
when he loves you so much?

480
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:00,330
Because he's your brother.

481
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:05,430
Oh my, you really didn't
know a thing?

482
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,400
Without knowing that,

483
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,330
did you two sleep together?

484
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,100
Oh no.

485
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,060
Seriously?

486
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,960
Sir, news…

487
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,160
Did you see the breaking news?

488
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,800
(NJ Group Director
Jang Se-ran Deceased)

489
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,160
(NJ Group's Eldest Daughter
Was Shot In Her House)

490
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:35,300
(The Eldest Daughter Dies
After The Eldest Son)

491
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,400
- Hey.
- Manager, did you see the news?

492
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,600
- What news?
- I guess you didn't.

493
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,630
It's crazy now.

494
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,030
What is it?

495
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,560
What's going on?

496
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:06,660
Director Jang Se-ran,
the eldest daughter of NJ Group

497
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:08,230
was found dead in her
Samsung-dong house

498
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,260
at 8:10PM tonight.

499
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:13,630
What's more surprising
about this case is that

500
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,830
she was shot to death

501
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,600
which rarely happens in Korea.

502
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,900
After checking her home

503
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,960
CCTV footage,

504
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:24,800
and other evidence,

505
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,860
- Manager?
- the police have specified the prime suspect

506
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:30,130
- as her business partner, Mr. Kim
- Manager!

507
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,330
and are tracking him down.

508
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,100
After the crime, Mr. Kim ran away

509
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,930
in the victim's car.

510
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,060
At 9:50PM,

511
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,160
the police found the victim's car

512
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,160
abandoned near Joongnae River,

513
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,330
but they failed to arrest
the suspect.

514
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,730
They secured the CCTV footage
from nearby roads…

515
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,660
In the meantime,
the police assume that

516
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:48,900
the suspect, Mr. Kim, ran away

517
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,930
with the weapon he used

518
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,530
and they warned civilians
to stay alert

519
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,360
as he poses a dangerous threat.

520
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,200
This gunshot case has brought up

521
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,260
criticism against Korea's

522
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:01,460
lax gun control laws.

523
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:04,060
The police said this gunshot case…

524
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,800
- It's okay, Jin-kang.
- Jin-kook!

525
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,660
No, he wouldn't do that!

526
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:11,930
- Okay, I get it.
- Jin-kook!

527
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,230
He can't kill people, come on!

528
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,000
He couldn't even bear watching

529
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,830
- fish die.
- Calm down, Jin-kang.

530
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,400
He didn't do it!
What's wrong with you?

531
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,730
He didn't do it!

532
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,530
He didn't kill her!

533
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,900
- Jin-kook, I must go to him.
- Okay.

534
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,830
Let me go!

535
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,830
Jin-kook, he didn't do it.

536
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,700
- I know him.
- Jin-kang, calm down.

537
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,900
Calm down.

538
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,230
- Hey.
- What happened?

539
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,300
Did you look into it?

540
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,530
It's the gun

541
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,530
he brought to your house,
isn't it?

542
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,260
He still has it.

543
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,530
Shouldn't you request
extra protection for you?

544
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,560
That's not necessary.

545
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:05,130
- It's not like that.
- Yes, it is!

546
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,800
He even killed her
because of his grudge.

547
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,660
An unpredictable guy has a gun.

548
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,260
He even killed a person.

549
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:12,700
Who knows
what he's going to do next?

550
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,900
Yeah, I get it.

551
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,030
But it's not going to happen,
so calm down, Tak.

552
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,660
If something seems strange,
request for protection right away.

553
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,460
Okay.

554
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,100
- Hey, Sergeant Yoo.
- Yeah?

555
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,760
I know I'm not his real sister.

556
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,060
Nevermind.

557
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,660
Call me if you need my help.

558
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,360
Okay. You should go now.

559
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,430
- You hear me?
- Okay. Go now.

560
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,260
- Call me.
- I will.

561
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,200
Hello?

562
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,600
Kim Moo-young.

563
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,200
Taxi! Taxi!

564
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,300
Kim Moo-young.

565
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,830
(A remake of the Japanese series A Hundred
Million Stars Falling From The Sky)

566
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,800
(Thank you to Actor Yoo Jae-myung
for guest starring)

567
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,660
(Hundred Million Stars From The Sky)

568
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,500
Are you sure he killed her?

569
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,160
- I don't think so.
- I think he killed her.

570
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:22,560
When he puts his
mind to something,

571
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:24,100
he's capable of even worse.

572
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,660
Kim Moo-young went to your house.

573
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:28,260
Twice.
And he even carried a gun with him.

574
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,030
- A gun?
- You know everything.

575
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,500
What did you tell him?

576
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,860
Where is he now?

577
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:35,200
Kang Sun-ho, turn yourself in.
