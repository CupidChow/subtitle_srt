That's why you toy with people

Haven't you ever missed me?

- No.
- Haven't you ever been happy

No.

59
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,230
I have no heart?

No.

Easy, man.

63
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,600
You're just doing this for money.

Hello?

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560

Kim Moo-young!

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,430
Stop hitting him!
What are you guys?

81
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,400
Why are you hitting him?

82
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,800
Let's go.

83
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,460
Kim Moo-young!

84
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,530
Kim Moo-young!

85
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,300
Kim Moo-young! Wake up!

86
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,960
Kim Moo-young!

87
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,430
Kim Moo-young!

88
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,830
You said there were 4 of them?

89
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,260
That's right.

90
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,300
One of them was
in their mid or late 30s.

91
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,600
- 30s…
- The rest of them…

92
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,830
I couldn't see because
it was dark.

93
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,659
And it obviously looked
like a one-sided assault?

94
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,660
Yes, completely.

95
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,130
What was the reason?

96
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,730
You have no idea?

97
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,730
No.

98
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,730
Try to calm down first.

99
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,030
We'll figure out the rest
when the victim wakes up.

100
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,560
Tell him to come to the station
tomorrow if he's okay.

101
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,400
He needs to write his statement

102
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,360
and officially file a suit.

103
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,660
- Okay.
- Alright.

104
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,060
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

105
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,260
Thanks.

(Jin-kook)

107
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,130
Yes, Jin-kook.

108
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,300
You should've told me
if you had to work late.

109
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,860
I'm sorry, I fell asleep.

110
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,900
Were you waiting up for me?

111
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,330
Go to sleep first.

112
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,300
Yeah.

113
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,000
I will.

114
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,100
You get some sleep too.

115
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,200
Have a seat.

116
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,130
It looks delicious.

117
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
What are you?

118
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,600
What the hell is wrong with you?

119
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,700
The doctor advised you to stay.

120
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,130
Why did you leave?

121
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,500
Sit.

122
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,460
Don't get mad. I'm already hurt.

123
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,030
Who are those people?

124
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,330
Why did you come?

125
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,300
I'm more curious about that.

126
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,560
Does that even matter right now?

127
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,130
Who are they?

128
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,700
What the hell do you do
to get involved

129
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,430
with those thugs?

130
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,230
So you're here to pick a fight?

131
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,160
It's not what you think.

132
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,230
Go to the police station tomorrow.

133
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,460
Write your statement
and file a case.

134
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,760
For what?

135
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,400
Did you say 'for what'?

136
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,830
Why would I do that to
those hard-working men?

137
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,060
They don't even know
why they had to beat me up.

138
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,530
If I'm filing a case
or fighting back,

139
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,460
I should do it the right way.

140
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,000
Against the real bad guy
who's behind all this.

141
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,300
Aren't I right?

142
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,130
Right.

143
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't care what you do.

144
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,700
Eat some cake before you go.

145
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,900
Hey, Cho-rong.

146
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,400
Have you seen Sergeant Yoo?

147
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,600
He's in the office.
You'll find him there.

148
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,600
I mean…

149
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,500
Didn't he tell you anything?

150
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
About what?

151
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,000
You know, right?

152
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,560
You know why he's being like that.

153
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,230
Me?

154
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,160
Come on, how the heck
would I know?

155
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,430
No one knows if you don't.

156
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,100
Hey.

157
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,900
Why are you doing this to me?

158
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,900
How would I know everything
about him?

159
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,830
I really don't.

160
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,930
I'm too busy for all this.

161
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,260
Hi, you came.

162
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,860
Hello.

163
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,260
You came alone?

164
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,960
What about the victim?

165
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,860
Didn't he stop by?

166
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,260
I'm asking you because he didn't.

167
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,830
Can I report as a witness
instead of him?

168
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,030
Well, you can

169
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,800
but you already did.

170
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,630
What you did yesterday
was the report

171
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,460
and the victim should

172
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,960
file the case himself.

173
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,400
I see.

174
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,500
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

175
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,400
Kang?

176
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,760
What brings you here
without notice?

177
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,960
Isn't it obvious?

178
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,000
I knew you'd be stuck
in the house,

179
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,300
so I came.

180
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,400
What's all this?

181
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,060
Cook braised chicken for me.

182
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,400
I'd love to have some.
I heard you make delicious chicken.

183
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:30,000
I always carried you home at night
when you were drunk.

184
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,460
It feels different to visit
during the day.

185
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,060
It's Saturday.
Where did Jin-kang go?

186
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,400
She's on a date. Seems like
things are going well with Cho-rong.

187
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,100
What, seriously?

188
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,830
Gosh, that's so nice.

189
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,230
(Bike Rental)

190
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,060
It looks similar to mine.

191
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,860
Yeah, it's pretty.

192
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,500
(Hwang Geon)

193
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Uh?
(Hwang Geon)

194
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,200
- One second please.
- Sure.

195
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,530
- Yes, Geon.
- Where the hell are you?

196
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,330
It's my day off…

197
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,500
Day off today.

198
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
Are you serious?

199
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,360
Captain.

200
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,360
I think Eom Cho-rong
has gone crazy.

201
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,430
Why? Did he sleep in?

202
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,160
Well, he's enjoying

203
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,600
his day off.

204
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,960
This newbie must think
work is a joke.

205
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,630
Isn't he a dork?
Didn't you train him?

206
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,030
Finally, I've done one.

207
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,130
There's a list of 100 things

208
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,960
I'd like to do together with you,

209
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,700
and this was one of it.

210
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,500
Number 1 was riding
a bike with me?

211
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,730
Not just any bike. A tandem bike.

212
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,360
It's not number 1, but
it's on the priority list.

213
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,430
A high priority.

214
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,160
What's next?

215
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,730
It won't be fun if I told you.

216
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,760
Wait for it.

217
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,630
Shall we go?

218
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,900
What do you want to eat?

219
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,630
Something delicious.

220
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,960
Something super delicious.

221
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:51,230
This looks amazing!

222
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,760
But you look fine.

223
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,000
What do you mean?

224
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,000
You were all worried about

225
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,600
Kim Moo-young and his burn scar.

226
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
But, you look better
than I thought.

227
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,730
Of course I do.

228
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,600
It was only a delusion!

229
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,730
A complete delusion
just like you said.

230
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,030
That's it!

231
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,430
Here.

232
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,600
Wait, let me try.

233
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,130
- How is it?
- Gosh, it's perfect.

234
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,630
- You're quite good!
- And our soju.

235
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,800
- Bring some soju.
- Okay, sir.

236
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,760
- We can't leave soju out.
- Sure thing.

237
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,060
Oh, thanks.

238
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,400
Wait.

239
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,000
You know you're making
Cho-rong's blood boil, right?

240
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,630
I understand
the Kim Moo-young part,

241
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,000
but why won't you tell him
about Lim Yoo-ri?

242
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,060
If we take your word,

243
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,460
it's highly likely
she's the culprit.

244
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,060
We don't know

245
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,700
who killed her yet.

246
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,860
I know, but you can tell him.

247
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,130
It'll be much better
if you at least tell him that.

248
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,030
Why won't you catch Lim Yoo-ri?

249
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,830
I just have hope.

250
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,030
What kind of hope?

251
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,660
I'm hoping she'll turn herself in.

252
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,630
Turn herself in?

253
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Let me laugh for just a second.

254
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,430
You mean that super rude
brat Lim Yoo-ri?

255
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,660
It can't be helped if she doesn't.

256
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,760
There'll be no choice then.

257
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,060
I'll need to arrest her.

258
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,560
For real?

259
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,960
For real.

260
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,630
What is it?

261
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Nothing.

262
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,900
Why are you giving me that look?

263
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,100
Hey, do you like her?

264
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,230
Who?

265
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,700
Her?

266
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,200
Come on.

267
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,700
You're talking crazy.

268
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,460
She's younger than Jin-kang!

269
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,960
So what?

270
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,630
She's still an adult.

271
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,000
And I know men are like that,
the older you get,

272
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,400
the younger you like your girls.

273
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,530
What? That's ridiculous.

274
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,100
Don't you think so?

275
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,600
You fell with her,
even risking your life.

276
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,560
You don't arrest her,
but you wait for her to turn herself in.

277
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,400
See?

278
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,630
Everything makes sense now.

279
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,960
Now the pieces fit!

280
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,930
Right?

281
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,300
Let me laugh for just a second.

282
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,230
- Seriously.
- Why are you laughing? It's annoying.

283
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,730
- Is it?
- It is.

284
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,860
I'm annoyed too.

285
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,960
Stop making me laugh.

286
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,500
Goodness.

287
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,130
Why are you making me

288
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,030
laugh so hard?

289
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,760
With that pretty face.

290
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,760
Hey!

291
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,700
I'm telling the truth!

292
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,600
You're the pretty one,

293
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,730
not her.

294
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,360
Gosh, it's so salty!

295
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,960
- Is it?
- I can't eat anymore because it's too salty.

296
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,730
Hey, Tak!

297
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,900
Tak! Where are you going?
You should finish this!

298
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,030
No, I won't.

299
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,830
How come it tastes worse

300
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,300
- the more I eat it?
- Wait! Tak!

301
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,960
Is this salty?

302
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,330
It's rather bland, seriously.

303
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,500

308
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,930
Where do you want to go,
Moo-young?

309
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,730
- Well…
- I like somewhere warm.

310
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,730
What about Greece?

311
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,230
Um, Greece…

312
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,600
I won't bring anything

313
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,530
when I leave

314
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,300
except for a backpack.

315
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,730
- Shall we go?
- Yeah.

316
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,860
Wait where?

317
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,300
Home.

318
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,100
I need to work on my resume.

319
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,230
- What?
- I told you, I need to look for a job.

320
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,600
Moo-young…

321
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,760
We're at the end already.

322
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,360
- What?
- We have nowhere else to go.

323
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,160
But we love each other.

324
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,360
I never did.

325
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,530
Then why have you been seeing me?

326
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,930
($2M cashier's check)

327
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,060
The place of knowledge
moving towards the world.

328
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,400
It's the Wonju campus
of Yeongang University.

329
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,860
Hey, Hee-joon.

330
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,200
Seung-ah did?

331
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,400
What else could I do?

332
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,600
She already knew everything.

333
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,100
Should I have just insisted
you were a college student?

334
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,260
You did a good job.

335
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,060
Did I?

336
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,300
Yeah, don't worry too much.

337
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,330
Let's meet up. It won't take long.

338
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,530
How do you like this place?

339
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,160
I'd like to end where we began.

340
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,700
It's nice.

341
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,160
What's this?

342
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,930
How do you feel
after seeing this?

343
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,630
It's $2M.

344
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,900
Tell me it was for the money.

345
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,730
Then I might even give it to you.

346
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,100
Yes, it was because of the money.

347
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,260
Thanks.

348
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,860
What's wrong with your face?

349
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,530
It was Woo-sang, right?

350
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,700
It's $2M.

351
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,500
What could be more
important than this?

352
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,900
But, why did you lie to me?

353
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,130
You said you don't know any
police officers in Haesan.

354
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,130
What?

355
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,860
But you're from Haesan.

356
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,200
Are you sure there isn't a single cop
you know in Haesan?

357
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,630
(Seung-ah)

358
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,630
Here, sir.

359
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,830
This is the agenda for the Arts
collaboration after 2 days.

360
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,200
And this is a draft of your
opening speech.

361
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,860
I'll never forgive you.

362
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:20,500
I'm going to kill you
if you hurt him ever again.

363
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,230
Did you take care of him?

364
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,130
Yes, he's not going to

365
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,360
bother you anymore.

366
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,700
I think he has a girlfriend.

367
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,230
A girlfriend?

368
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,730
She's Yoo Jin-kang,
a friend of Baek Seung-ah.

369
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,830
He's seeing her?

370
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,260
Yes.

371
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,860
What are you doing alone?

372
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,730
What's wrong with your face?
Did you get in a fight?

373
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,260
I can drink this, right?

374
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,930
I was beat up. It wasn't a fight.

375
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,930
It was pretty much
a one-sided beating.

376
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,730
Why are you so serious?

377
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,830
What, are you going to
arrest them for me?

378
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,630
Do you want me to show you
something funny?

379
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,030
($2M cashier's check)

380
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,000
What would you do if you had this?

381
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,930
What have you been doing?

382
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,230
Bad things.

383
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,060
I want to do bad things
when I see you.

384
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,760
I'll get going.

385
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,830
Kim Moo-young.

386
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,100
Nothing's free in this world.

387
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,060
Nothing is just good luck.

388
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,800
That sounds reasonable.

389
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,200
I hate getting something for free.

390
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,430
An eye for an eye, a tooth for
a tooth, that's my type.

391
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,060
Did you have a restful day off?

392
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,060
So did you like it?

393
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,830
Get out.

394
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,300
I don't need someone
who works that way.

395
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,430
I won't do it again, sir.

396
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,860
Didn't you hear me?

397
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,230
Get the hell out, jerk!

398
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,460
- Sergeant Yoo.
- Good morning.

399
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,860
You lazy punk.

400
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,530
You should be sitting at your
desk once you're in the office!

401
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,130
The youngest shouldn't
fool around.

402
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,760
I should be the only one
half-assing things around here.

403
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,730
You know that?

404
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,630
Right, Captain Lee?

405
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,630
I won't do it again, sir.

406
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,500
Yoo-ri.

407
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,460
People can always start over.

408
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:30,000
It might sound cliche,
but it's true.

409
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,730
Tell me when you're ready.

410
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,199
I can give you a few days.

411
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,929
Thanks.

412
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,060
- Alright.
- Thanks.

413
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,460
Right, this salad is good.

414
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,130
- Oh, really?
- Tak.

415
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,160
- Mm, it's really good.
- Tak!

416
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
Hey, you pig!

417
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,760
Mm, it's so delicious!
It really is!

418
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,130
Tak!

419
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,430
Tak!

420
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,900
Hey, Sergeant Yoo.

421
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,830
You're ignoring me too?

422
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,100
What? Ignoring you? I didn't.

423
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,830
You ignored me in the cafeteria.

424
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,760
Were you in the cafeteria?

425
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,500
I didn't even know you were there.

426
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,860
Seriously?

427
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,960
I'm serious. I didn't know.

428
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,230
I should go.

429
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,100
Why is she dressed so nice today?

430
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,330
What happened to your face?

431
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,130
It's pretty bad, right?

432
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,400
Damn, this lasts for a long time.

433
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,300
It's been a while.

434
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,400
You're so mean.

435
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,900
This place is nothing.

436
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,500
I haven't been up here because
I was scared you'd get mad.

437
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,160
Hey.

438
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,730
Why were you nice to me?

439
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,900
Because you're pretty.

440
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,430
Don't be ridiculous.

441
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,600
Why?

442
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,900
Because I never lie?

443
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,230
I heard you said that.

444
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,330
That I don't lie.

445
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,900
You never genuinely liked me,
did you?

446
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,930
Of course, I do.

447
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,630
Isn't this pretty?

448
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,830
It's my first time
taking care of a cat,

449
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,500
but I like it.

450
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,300
I feed her and I even
clean up her crap.

451
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,230
Sometimes it's annoying,

452
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,300
but it's still fun.

453
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,700
Maybe she knows that. She doesn't
go when I leave the door open.

454
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,260
I know.

455
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,760
I'm just like that cat to you.

456
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,560
Yoo-ri.

457
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,660
Don't trust people.

458
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,030
People are nothing.

459
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,800
What about her?

460
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,300
Would you say the same to her?

461
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,000
Would you tell her not to believe
you because people are nothing?

462
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,860
Can I really tell everything?

463
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,900
What?

464
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,160
Tell that cop everything.

465
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,700
What?

466
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,860
How can I help you?

467
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,330
Uh? What brings you here?

468
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,230
This early?

469
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,630
I came to get my driver's license.

470
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,230
I just wanted to say hi.

471
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,430
- Driver's license?
- Yeah, I renewed it.

472
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,860
I start working today.

473
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,330
- You want some vending machine coffee?
- No thanks.

474
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,600
It sucks.

475
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,460
I'll just go.

476
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,660
You'll just go?

477
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,030
I just came by to say hi.

478
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,460
Now that I see you,
you look okay.

479
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,730
- Who is he?
- Gosh!

480
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,860
He looks familiar.

481
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,600
Where did I see him?

482
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,660
Kim Moo-young.

483
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,400
Kim Moo-young?

484
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,500
You mean that Kim Moo-young?

485
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,230
(Invitation)

486
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,800
Moo-young, you're here.

487
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,330
Hey, hi.

488
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,500
Are you feeling better now?

489
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,660
I'm sorry I'm here so late.

490
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,660
It's okay. You can make up for it
from now on.

491
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,700
You already saw that?

492
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,160
Come with us later.

493
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:15,800
Are you uncomfortable attending
Arts Brewery's event?

494
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,930
Not at all.

495
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,360
Perfect.

496
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,330
Who made this?

497
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,260
Who made this perfect poster?

498
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,200
- It's so pretty.
- It turned out so well.

499
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,060
- President Hwang, hi.
- Hello.

500
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,800
How have you been?

501
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,030
Damn, why have you been
following me all day?

502
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,400
I wasn't really following you.

503
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,360
It looks like you and
Kim Moo-young are close

504
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,960
but in reality, you're not.

505
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,000
I understand you're just waiting

506
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,760
because you can't find evidence.

507
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,460
Then?

508
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,400
Why does he look so
familiar to me?

509
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,830
Where did I see him?

510
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,460
What the hell?

511
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,630
Why is he asking me?

512
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,560
Ah, thanks.

513
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,300
Come in.

514
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,730
See you around. Thanks.

515
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,030
Hey, it's been a while.

516
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,630
- It's been too long.
- What do you say? You like it?

517
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,030
It's amazing.

518
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,130
- Go in and take your seat.
- Thanks.

519
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,430
Hello.

520
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:52,700
Welcome to the launching night

521
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,330
of NJ Group's low sodium,

522
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,230
premium bacon and

523
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,200
Arts Be Free IPA.

524
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,030
Ms. Baek.

525
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,300
There's a delivery for you.

526
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,460
- A delivery?
- That's right.

527
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,100
($2M cashier's check)

528
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:57,300
I'm not sure
whether it's love or not,

529
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,300
but let's try anyway.

530
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,430
Hello. I'm Jang Woo-sang,
the Director of NJ Food.

531
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
For the last 40 years,

532
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,030
we've strived to develop

533
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,060
high-quality processed food.

534
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,760
Being trendy
while keeping traditions.

535
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,730
I'm confident to tell you

536
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,200
we've been working hard
to become a trendy company

537
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,330
that's always passionate
and brave.

538
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,400
And this collaboration
with Arts Brewery,

539
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,300
the youngest craft beer
brewery in Korea

540
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,660
is a part of our efforts.

541
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,400
Starting with this collaboration,

542
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,700
NJ Food and Arts Brewery will work together
using open-minded

543
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,500
communication for a
quickly-growing domestic market…

544
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,030
- Mmm, it's so good.
- It's good.

545
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,730
Don't you feel like the taste has changed
because the logo changed?

546
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,160
Yeah? You're right.

547
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,930
Cheers!

548
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,560
Hello, Director Jang.

549
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,960
- It's been a while.
- Long time no see.

550
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,460
- You look good.
- It's Jang Woo-sang!

551
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,800
Can we do something about him?

552
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,530
Why don't you step
forward this time

553
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,160
and get a deal with NJ Food?

554
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,560
No way.

555
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,160
Come on.

556
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,360
I'm sorry. Are you alright?

557
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,200
I'm fine.

558
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,130
How did you come up with this?

559
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,460
It's incredible.

560
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,000
Alright.

561
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,960
- Yeah?
- Thank you so much.

562
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:03,000
I learn so much from you

563
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,960
everytime I see you.

564
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,900
Why?

565
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,230
Frankly, when I heard
you were taking over Arts Brewery,

566
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,760
I wasn't sure it would succeed.

567
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:15,160
I thought it was just
a hobby for you.

568
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:18,200
It's true that I love beer.

569
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,400
Please share some investment tips
with me when you get a chance.

570
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,300
Of course.

571
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,560
Excuse me.

572
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,430
What do you want?

573
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,030
I'm asking you to play with me.

574
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,930
Stop acting up.

575
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,630
Keep it short.

576
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,060
Keep it short? Okay.

577
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,300
Here.

578
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,130
Here.

579
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,430
It hurt when I got beat up.

580
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,730
I do understand.
With the Seung-ah thing and all.

581
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,100
It must've hurt you here too.

582
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:11,100
I heard you broke up with her.

583
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,260
So did you get anything
out of her?

584
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:15,400
$2M?

585
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,800
Well, it's not too bad for
2-months worth of work.

586
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,560
Such a piece of trash.

587
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:25,430
What, you want some?

588
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,460
You actually helped a lot.

589
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,800
Sure, why not?

590
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,630
I'll be generous. 50/50.
How's $1M?

591
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,400
I said stop acting up.

592
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,760
Hear me out.

593
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,900
I went to work at the
pottery exhibition afterparty.

594
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,460
Everyone was talking about Seung-ah.

595
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:52,000
She's rich, pretty,

596
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,400
and has a rich boyfriend.

597
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:57,730
I didn't really pay attention.

598
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,300
Because she was out of my league.

599
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,260
Nothing would've happened
if I only saw Seung-ah.

600
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,360
But you were there.

601
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:09,760
As soon as I saw you, I knew.

602
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:14,100
Damn, it was going to be easy.

603
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,160
This is all thanks to you.

604
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:20,200
Thanks to you,

605
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,500
Seung-ah fell so easily for me.

606
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,500
(Seung-ah)
Seung-ah fell so easily for me.

607
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,800
Hey, Seung-ah.

608
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:28,160
I'm at the Bizhill
in Samsung-dong.

609
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:29,930
Yeah.

610
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:32,760
Okay.

611
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,430
So take your $1M and screw off.

612
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,260
Because I have to keep
seeing Seung-ah.

613
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:47,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

614
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,130
What a group of swindlers.

615
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,830
I heard that's your girlfriend.

616
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,830
Yoo Jin-kang.

617
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,930
What a perfect match.

618
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,500
I knew it ever since
she was clingy with Seung-ah

619
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,100
to get a job,

620
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,830
but she's better than I expected.

621
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,100
She even got her boyfriend
to rip off money from Seung-ah.

622
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,860
Director Jang.

623
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,930
What is it?

624
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,960
Why don't you just beg for money?

625
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,430
Who knows?

626
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,630
If you beg like a dog,

627
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,160
I might hand you some pennies.

628
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,200
I lost our last round
of golf.

629
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,030
No way…

630
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,560
- Let's play together next time.
- Of course.

631
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,200
When you're free.

632
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,200
Of course.

633
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,960
I won't ask you to understand me.

634
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,660
You would ask me
what's so special about him

635
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:03,160
for me to give up everything.

636
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,000
But, I'm not giving anything up.

637
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,530
Rather, I've finally found it.

638
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,760
The real me,

639
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:17,400
love, and freedom

640
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,230
that I want.

641
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,060
Bye. I'm sorry, mom.

642
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,360
It's Jang Woo-sang.

643
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:30,560
The guy who beat you up.

644
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,430
What did you two talk about?

645
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,660
Are you worrying about me?

646
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,830
I was just going to
tease him a little,

647
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,900
but he totally got me.

648
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,600
What the hell are you thinking?

649
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,060
- Yes.
- Hey, where are you? Aren't you coming?

650
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:01,600
I'm here…

651
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,600
- Here at the terrace.
- Okay.

652
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,460
- I'll be there soon.
- Okay.

653
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,860
Just go.

654
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,930
I'm at a disadvantage
if you're with me.

655
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,000
What are you thinking to do

656
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,930
against someone like him?

657
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,660
I'm not thinking about anything.

658
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:24,030
That's how I win.

659
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,600
Moo-young, how have you been?

660
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,860
Can't be better.

661
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:31,130
- Let's go.
- Alright.

662
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,200
I'll escort you to your place,
sir.

663
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,460
You should be ashamed.

664
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,260
Ashamed?

665
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,330
How can you be this foolish?

666
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,930
He ripped you off, he used you.

667
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,730
How could you even come here
to see him after all that?

668
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,830
Watch your mouth.

669
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:50,500
Do you know what
that bastard said?

670
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,530
You were so easy.

671
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,700
He earned quite a lot
for 2-months worth of work.

672
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,300
Seung-ah already knows

673
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,660
I'm a piece of trash.

674
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:06,400
She knows as well.

675
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,360
It's not like that.

676
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,960
That's not true.

677
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:16,900
Shall we go?

678
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,530
If you leave now,

679
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,130
I won't hold back anymore.

680
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,730
Let go.

681
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,660
Hi.

682
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,600
Manager.

683
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,860
Hey, aren't you getting in?

684
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,830
I should go first.

685
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,530
Where?

686
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:29,330
Jin-kang!

687
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,430
So you've come.

688
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,530
Don't get caught.

689
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,530
Kim Moo-young!

690
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:04,600
(A remake of the Japanese series A Hundred
Million Stars Falling From The Sky)

691
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:28,800
(Hundred Million Stars From The Sky)

692
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,000
Are you sure Kim Moo-young
was in Seung-ah's car?

693
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,330
Jin-kook, something's weird.

694
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,660
Kim Moo-young is gone.

695
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:36,100
What do you mean he's gone?

696
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,100
It's clear he's controlling
the accident itself.

697
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,160
Even the media.

698
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:40,630
Do I just need to stamp here?

699
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,800
This incident was a crime
of passion.

700
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:43,900
A crime of passion?

701
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,800
Where is he?

702
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,060
You know Kim Moo-young, right?

703
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:50,000
Is he even alive?

704
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,900
Can't you just tell me
where he is?

705
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,360
Should I report him missing?

706
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:54,400
Why do you care?

707
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,500
Why would you do that?
