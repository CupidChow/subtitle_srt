Don't lie!

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,730
I have an umbrella.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,030
See you at the station.

13
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,760

17
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,430
When will the doctor come?

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,430
When the results are out.

19
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,900
Oh no…

20
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,360
Why?

21
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,330
Nah, it's nothing.

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
How do you know her?

23
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,130
I just ran into her a few times.

24
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,700
You should feed her well.

25
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,600
It's nothing serious.
She's just a little malnourished.

26
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,360
- Should I prescribe some supplements?
- Yes, please.

27
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,800
So there isn't any other issue?

28
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,500
We did find some sleeping pill
ingredients in her blood.

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,960
Around 6 pills at most.

30
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,700
It doesn't seem like she tried
to kill herself with it.

31
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,960
You two are the ones
who need to get treated.

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,300
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm good… Wait.

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,430
What's wrong?

34
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,460
It's throbbing.

35
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,500
It hurts!

36
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,700
- When did it happen?
- Ouch…

37
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,860
You're so foolish.

38
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,900
You didn't even realize
you pulled a ligament.

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,300
Many people come in only after
it's all swollen up.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,960
What do we do now?

41
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,329
- Do we wait until she wakes up?
- Ouch!

42
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,230
Please do it gently.

43
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,860
Do you have
Kim Moo-young's number?

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,430
Why are you asking
about Kim Moo-young?

45
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,300
You have it? Why do you have it?

46
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,730
Why can't I have it?

47
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,060
Anyways, why are you asking
for his number?

48
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,860
He's her friend.

49
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,730
I'm wondering if he knows
any of her relatives.

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,100
Ouch!

51
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,260
Make it hurt even more.

52
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,700
Like terribly!

53
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,660
Yes.

54
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,900
- Hey.
- You're still up.

55
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,159
Great.

56
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,860
Yeah, what's up?

57
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,400
You know Lim Yoo-ri, right?

58
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,760
Yoo-ri?

59
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,860
Why are you here?

60
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,100
You said you could
reach her family.

61
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,659
Is everything alright?

62
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah, she's just asleep.

63
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,400
They found some
sleeping pill ingredients in her blood

64
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,830
but they assumed
they're just her sleeping aids.

65
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,830
I meant if your arm is alright.

66
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,530
Ah…

67
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,860
I just pulled a ligament.

68
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,960
They told me to wear a cast.

69
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,430
- Looks good on you.
- Yeah?

70
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,630
Blue looks good on me.

71
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,000
Ah, now I remember.

72
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,230
Isn't she the girl
who went to the movie theater

73
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,430
with you?

74
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,760
- Jin-kook.
- Yeah.

75
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,400
She went to see a movie
with him before.

76
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,300
Really?

77
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,360
You must be surprised.

78
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,460
Can we talk for a bit?

79
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,500
I checked the dash cam
in her car.

80
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,730
It was definitely intentional.

81
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,830
She was watching Jin-kang

82
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,600
for 2 hours in front
of our house.

83
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:48,530
Thank goodness I saw it.

84
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,960
If I hadn't been there…

85
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,200
Jin-kang would already…

86
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,760
What do you think it's about?

87
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,800
Why did this happen?

88
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,930
Did you ask her to do it?

89
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,260
How could you think that way?

90
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,600
I'm sure

91
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,700
it has something to do with you.

92
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,230
What makes you think that?

93
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,100
I told Lim Yoo-ri a few days ago

94
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,760
that I'm suspecting you

95
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,300
for Jung Mi-yeon's case.

96
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,200
I warned her
that she could get

97
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,700
in trouble if she
tries to protect you.

98
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,560
Jeez…

99
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,000
You've just been spreading rumors
here and there.

100
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,800
Even though you didn't
ask her to do it,

101
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,230
she could've done it

102
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,860
because she thought of me as
a threat to you.

103
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,260
No way.

104
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,930
You should leave now.

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,100
I'll stay here.

106
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,400
Kim Moo-young.

107
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,260
Believe it or not,
I'm really curious, too,

108
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,300
about why she did that

109
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,330
as much as you are.

110
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,400
When did you two become so close?

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,860
What?

112
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,860
You looked close
with Kim Moo-young.

113
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,130
You guys talked like friends.

114
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,000
We're not close at all.

115
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,600
Jin-kook, was that a sudden
unintended acceleration?

116
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,460
No, it wasn't.

117
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,700
No?

118
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,300
It tried to hit me so suddenly,

119
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,500
that's why I thought
it could have been a SUA.

120
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,800
Then what was it?

121
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,160
Like you heard,
she took sleeping pills.

122
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,700
It seems like
she dozed off at the wheel.

123
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,930
Don't worry too much about it.

124
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,730
She dozed off?

125
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,200
I was damn scared!

126
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,230
If you got injured,

127
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,600
you would have whined
so much about it, right?

128
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,160
Jin-kook, it hurts here.

129
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,360
Jin-kook, it's painful and so on.

130
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,760
Aren't you embarrassed of
how you reacted earlier?

131
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,360
It was just a simple scratch.

132
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,860
Ouch, it hurts. Please be gentle.

133
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,630
- It's a severe injury!
- It hurts.

134
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,560
When did I do that?
Jin-kook, it hurts.

135
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,860
- When?
- You always said that.

136
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,530
You ugly little brat…

137
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,130
- Welcome.
- Salute!

138
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,860
Gosh, it's gotten cold.

139
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,160
- Hey, eat up. We don't have much time.
- Yes, sir.

140
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,800
Since I'm here to see you
this early in the morning,

141
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,360
it feels like we're under
a secret operation.

142
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,530
What happened to your arm?

143
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,560
It's so good.

144
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,860
This one?

145
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,400
I fell off my bike.

146
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,860
You're not a kid.

147
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,800
- Should have been more careful.
- A kid…

148
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,400
Hurry, eat up!
We don't have much time!

149
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,460
Put the rice into the soup!

150
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,330
Moo-young.

151
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,030
Are you alright?

152
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,600
What is this?

153
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,730
Why am I here?

154
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,600
Let's get out first.

155
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,430
I'll start your discharge process.

156
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,500
You'll figure it out
once you watch your dash cam.

157
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,530
- You're leaving like this?
- I'll call you soon.

158
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,830
Tell me what the hell happened!

159
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,500
I don't remember at all!

160
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,530
Why did you bring me here?

161
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,560
I didn't bring you here.

162
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,800
The police did.

163
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,260
The police?

164
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,000
So Kim Moo-young has this

165
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,230
photographic memory,

166
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,330
he's close to Lim Yoo-ri,

167
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,200
and you saw the umbrella
with the company's logo

168
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,830
where Kim Moo-young works
from the CCTV of the case?

169
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,330
Yes, here.

170
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,160
Jung Mi-yeon's party picture
at the back.

171
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,430
Look at the beer glass.

172
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,600
- It's the same.
- You're right.

173
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,600
Oh Ba-reun got his bike stolen
the day Jung Mi-yeon was killed

174
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,600
on 37-4 street.

175
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,460
It's only 400m away
from Hewitt Vill.

176
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,830
And…

177
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,560
Kim Moo-yung is left handed

178
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,760
when he insists he's both-handed.

179
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,860
Then, it's sure.

180
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,930
- Let's go now.
- Go where?

181
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,330
We should catch him.

182
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,500
We need to beat him up
to get him to confess.

183
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
You think we're in 1988?

184
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,130
Sit down.

185
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,500
He wouldn't talk
even if you interrogated him.

186
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,330
We need certain evidence.

187
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,900
Certain evidence?

188
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,160
If…

189
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,160
Kim Moo-young is the real culprit…

190
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,100
What would you think
is strange?

191
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,200
If Kim Moo-young
is the real culprit?

192
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,760
- CCTV.
- CCTV?

193
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,600
If Kim Moo-young
is the real culprit,

194
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,230
he wouldn't have neglected
the CCTV from Mi-yeon's villa

195
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,430
when he is very meticulous.

196
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,460
He already knew

197
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,760
that the CCTV was fake.

198
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,760
Uh…

199
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,100
Right.

200
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,200
There's no way he couldn't
have thought of CCTVs

201
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,060
that were installed
one after the other

202
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,700
when he was as careful as
to clean up the crime scene.

203
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,860
You investigate around Lim Yoo-ri first.

204
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,430
Ah, Lim Yoo-ri?

205
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,260
Her surroundings!

206
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,130
Don't get in touch with
her directly. You know.

207
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,460
Start with the ones who know her

208
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,730
among Jung Mi-yeon's
case testifiers.

209
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,460
How would Kim Moo-young
have found out

210
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,730
that the CCTV was fake?

211
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,300
Lim Yoo-ri or Jung Mi-yeon.

212
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,300
There's a high possibility that
it was through either of the two.

213
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,430
What about you?

214
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,160
I'll have to

215
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,060
go to the control center.

216
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,530
Fortunately, we still have
public CCTV footages.

217
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,500
We must find the umbrella first.

218
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,960
That umbrella must have
come out of Hewitt Villa.

219
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,830
I'm not going into the office,

220
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,560
so tell the captain
that I'll work outside.

221
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,960
Tell him it's for the
stolen bike case.

222
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,400
I'm sorry, President.

223
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,300
Yes.

224
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,860
It's alright. I'll be fine
after some sleep.

225
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,460
If I feel better, I'll be there
later in the afternoon

226
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,500
Okay.

227
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,660
- Will you be alright?
- Yeah.

228
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,430
I'm just feeling a bit cold.

229
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,230
- Uh?
- Is this yours?

230
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,000
No, Jin-kook's.

231
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,560
Thanks.

232
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,600
Drive safely.

233
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,760
I didn't bring you here.
The police did.

234
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,530
The police?

235
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,900
That police officer knew
who you were.

236
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,530
You almost killed his sister.

237
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
(For CCTV)

238
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,000
What's been bugging you?

239
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,060
Uh?

240
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,360
No, nothing.

241
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,200
Get back to work.

242
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,300
It's nothing.

243
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,100
You must use this place
for yourself.

244
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,800
That's right.

245
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,230
You recently remodeled it.

246
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,700
And it's in a nice location.

247
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,530
Are you sure you're going to
sell it at this price?

248
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,830
Yes, how long do you think
it'll take?

249
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,200
With this condition,

250
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,430
it'll be sold very soon.

251
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,830
They'll buy it as soon
as it's listed.

252
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,200
Sounds good.

253
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,500
Please proceed with it.

254
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,630
It's me, Moo-young.

255
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,030
I'm sorry for making you wait
for so long.

256
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,530
We can meet up now.

257
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,100
Call me as soon as possible.

258
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,060
(Seung-ah)

259
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,100
Moo-young?

260
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,360
How's it going?

261
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,430
Director Jang's wedding recipe.

262
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,660
- You want to take a look?
- Sure.

263
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,400
Take care of the rest for me.

264
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,130
Doesn't he have any pride?

265
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,700
Why would he make it for him?

266
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,130
(For CCTV)

267
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,360
- What are you looking so intently at?
- Gosh!

268
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,160
Jeez.

269
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,560
You surprised me.

270
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,860
So,

271
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,400
did you catch Kim Moo-young?

272
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,600
Eom Cho-rong that bastard…

273
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,960
You know,

274
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,500
he has a big mouth.

275
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,500
- That's why I like him.
- I know.

276
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,460
So did you get him or not?

277
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,530
That umbrella should
show up by now,

278
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,360
but it doesn't.

279
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,600
Damn it!

280
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,560
What's this?

281
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,130
Otherwise, I might go rampant
like a lunatic.

282
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,660
Why go rampant like a lunatic?

283
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,760
I might do something
to someone's precious daughter.

284
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,730
What, you sound scary.

285
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,600
Are you mad?

286
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,630
I'm telling you the truth.

287
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,260
You know I quit taking pills

288
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,560
after I met you.

289
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,630
I took them just once last night

290
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,760
because I couldn't fall asleep.

291
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,230
I know.

292
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,700
Didn't he come to see you?
The police officer.

293
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,200
No, he didn't.

294
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,530
By the way, why did you do that?

295
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,700
Honestly?

296
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,530
You promised

297
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,930
you won't get mad.

298
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,230
You know I never make promises.

299
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,660
I won't get mad, so tell me.

300
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,260
Were you trying to teach him
a lesson?

301
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,600
To not bother me?

302
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,200
No, I'm not insane.
Why would I bother a police officer?

303
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,830
I'm already bothered enough.

304
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,830
And I didn't know
she was his sister.

305
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,960
Oh, so you were following her.

306
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,860
Now I see.

307
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,160
Why?

308
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,460
What do you mean why?
Why do you need a reason?

309
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,660
You must lock her up now!

310
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,330
Lock her up, then what?

311
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,130
What do I do after that?

312
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,660
You're right.

313
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,630
You can't do anything if she insists

314
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,030
that she just fell asleep in
a car parked in front of your house.

315
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,400
It might not even warrant
filing any paperwork.

316
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,630
That's why I need to
at least be able to guess

317
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,400
- what her motive was.
- Yeah.

318
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,530
But the more I think about it,
the stranger it seems.

319
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,960
At first I thought she did it

320
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,960
just to scare me

321
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,600
- not to mess with Kim Moo-young.
- Right.

322
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,300
But it doesn't seem right.

323
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,500
If I was her target
from the beginning,

324
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,530
she would have waited
near the police station.

325
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,460
I get off as soon as it's time.

326
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,630
- Yeah, right.
- But why in front of my house?

327
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,830
Why in front of my place
at that hour?

328
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,960
Why Jin-kang, not me?

329
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,730
Ah…

330
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,200
This is so strange.

331
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,300
Or…

332
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,460
Was Jin-kang the target
from the very beginning?

333
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,830
No way.

334
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,260
She doesn't have any reason
to do that.

335
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,560
That's what I'm saying.

336
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,900
Kim Moo-young. Kim Moo-young.

337
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,330
Hey.

338
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
Is it because she's an orphan?

339
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,200
Because you're an orphan
and so is she?

340
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,830
If not, what's the reason?

341
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,130
She's not even pretty.
But why only to her?

342
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,060
What did I only do to her?

343
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,400
You like her.

344
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,130
- What?
- You like her.

345
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,860
- Me?
- Yes.

346
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,960
You like her.

347
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,730
You don't even know that?
Even I know that.

348
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,060
I'm not sure.

349
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,260
I'll think about that.

350
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,930
Hey.

351
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,200
Don't go.

352
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,660
If you go now,
I'll tell everything.

353
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,330
I'll tell everything
to the police.

354
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,730
I remember everything now.

355
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,260
Remember what?

356
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,130
What happened in Mi-yeon's place
that night.

357
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,000
I'll tell them everything.

358
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,700
I remember it all now.

359
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,530
Whatever.

360
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,800
Hey, Kim Moo-young!

361
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,030
You promised you wouldn't get mad.

362
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,230
You came home.

363
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,630
You should eat a proper meal.

364
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,760
That tastes bad if it's cold.

365
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,430
Potatoes taste best

366
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,230
when they're cold.

367
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,230
You should have called me
if you didn't feel well.

368
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,960
Was this all you had to eat today?

369
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,700
(With Trauma)

370
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,830
I slept for 12 hours
without waking up once.

371
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,160
Good for you.

372
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,130
Where did you get it?
I thought I lost it.

373
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,630
You left it at the hospital.

374
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,800
Kim Moo-young gave it to me.

375
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,930
What?
You couldn't even go to work,

376
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,460
but you met up with him?

377
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,200
I ran into him at the bus stop
this morning.

378
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,230
He drove me home.

379
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,530
I told you not to get involved
with him.

380
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,200
You don't listen to me.

381
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,000
You remind me of Eun-seon's mom.

382
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,100
What?

383
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,460
She told Eun-seon

384
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,160
not to play with me,

385
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,800
so you were furious.

386
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,700
Don't you remember?

387
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,560
You sound exactly like her.

388
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,330
It's different.

389
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,130
I wouldn't have been that mad

390
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,230
if she said that

391
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,800
after meeting you even once.

392
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,660
But she just made assumptions!

393
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,830
How could you compare me
to that hag?

394
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,730
I've been meaning to ask you,

395
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,130
why do you hate him so much?

396
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,430
Well…

397
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,830
That's…

398
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,500
I have a bad feeling about him.

399
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,030
He's got a bad vibe.

400
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,530
Right. Right.

401
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,330
How have you been, Eun-seon's mom?

402
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,800
- How's it going?
- Stop it.

403
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,930
Cold potatoes are the best,
Eun-seon's mom.

404
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,460
I said stop it already.

405
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,230
Jin-kook.

406
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,830
Telling someone not to hang out
with a person because she's an orphan

407
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,560
or because you have a bad feeling…

408
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,430
Both are just assumptions.

409
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,660
I'm going to get even closer
to him from now on.

410
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,530
Yoo Jin-kang. Yoo Jin-kang.

411
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,860
I'm not joking.

412
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,030
Jin-kook.

413
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,730
Don't be too harsh on him.

414
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,130
He's also…

415
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,560
I don't know.
I've never had a mom.

416
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,130
He's also what?

417
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,260
Tell me.

418
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,960
He's from Haesan too.

419
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,530
Let's not be mean
to someone from our hometown.

420
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,160
You like her.

421
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,200
Me?

422
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
- Get in.
- Get in here?

423
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,230
- Fasten your seatbelt.
- Okay.

424
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,900
What's this?

425
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,500
- Where is your office?
- Sinsa-dong.

426
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,060
Will you drive me to my office?

427
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,660
Really? Awesome.

428
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,560
Well, that'd be really nice.

429
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,300
What? Why are you acting so nice?

430
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,800
You seem better today.

431
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,530
What, you want me to get off
if I'm feeling better?

432
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,660
No, I'm not feeling any better.

433
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,100
So take me all the way to work.

434
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,100
You like her.

435
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,300
You don't even know that?
Even I know that.

436
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,600
How is Yoo-ri?

437
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,330
- She's good.
- How do you two know each other?

438
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:39,260
I don't see her as a woman. Okay?

439
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,500
I didn't say anything.

440
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,360
I was just asking
how you two got close.

441
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,730
It's here.

442
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,200
Drop me off
near the traffic lights.

443
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,760
Come out 30 minutes earlier tomorrow.

444
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,930
Our date seems too short.

445
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,100
Thanks for today.

446
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,130
5 minutes is all I need with you.

447
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,830
So I was getting quite anxious
after 5 minutes.

448
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,030
Be my girlfriend.

449
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,060
I like you.

450
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,800
What a lunatic.

451
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,500
See? You're making me swear again.

452
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,200
I said I like you.

453
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,230
You're crazy.

454
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,360
Right?

455
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,830
But I need to confirm something.

456
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,560
I think I like you,
I also think I don't like you.

457
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,260
I should see you more
to find out, right?

458
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,630
I don't care if you go crazy
by yourself,

459
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,930
but I feel so frustrated

460
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,130
when I think of Seung-ah.

461
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,000
Mind your manners.

462
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,930
Don't be late tomorrow.

463
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,530
If you don't want to lose
that cop,

464
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,060
you can date us both.

465
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,330
I don't mind at all!

466
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,730
Gosh…

467
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,160
Don't you think it wasn't right?

468
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,200
Didn't you hear?
That I saved your life?

469
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,060
I even took you to the hospital.

470
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,100
What are you saying?

471
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,230
Fine.

472
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,430
Let me get to the point.

473
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,600
I have one question
and one favor to ask you.

474
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,760
You must listen to both, okay?

475
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,430
One.

476
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,860
Why did you do that to my sister?

477
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,500
Because I was annoyed.

478
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,860
What?

479
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:20,100
Why were you so annoyed?

480
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,500
Because of me? Or…

481
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,900
No way…

482
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,700
With my sister?

483
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,060
I was annoyed by your sister.

484
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,300
Is this enough?

485
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,760
You…

486
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,530
Hey.

487
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,460
You mean…

488
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,860
You tried to kill my sister
on purpose?

489
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,130
I might have.

490
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,500
You might have?

491
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,200
I almost hit her
with my car, right?

492
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,200
You…

493
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,460
Fine.

494
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,800
Then,

495
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,230
why?

496
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,530
At least tell me the reason.

497
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,400
I don't want to say it.

498
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,560
You don't want to say it?

499
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,030
Hey.

500
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,030
You tried to kill my sister

501
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,460
and now you don't want to say why?

502
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,330
Your sister is an orphan, right?

503
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,460
What, orphan?

504
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,060
Who said that?

505
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,330
She has me.
How come she's an orphan?

506
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,600
Where did you hear that?

507
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,460
I overheard what the two said.

508
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,860
Two? Who?

509
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,330
Kim Moo-young and your sister.

510
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,130
They found out
they're both orphans.

511
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,660
Ever since then,
they've fallen in love!

512
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,530
Then,

513
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,960
was that why you did that?

514
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,660
You misunderstood
my sister and Moo-young's relationship?

515
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,600
- It's not a misunderstanding.
- Yes, it is!

516
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,159
I don't know
what made you think that,

517
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,900
but he has a girlfriend.

518
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,699
It's not my sister.

519
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,429
That doesn't matter.

520
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,199
Kim Moo-young likes your sister.

521
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,060
What?

522
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,130
I said

523
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,000
Kim Moo-young likes your sister.

524
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,630
Alright.

525
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,900
Anyways,

526
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,159
you got it wrong, okay?

527
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,530
You were mistaken.

528
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,060
Second.

529
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,159
Promise me one thing.

530
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,199
This is not a favor,
it's a warning.

531
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,100
Don't ever

532
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,860
mess with my sister again.

533
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,160
I can't do that.

534
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,030
What?

535
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,130
I can't make any promises.

536
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,860
How dare you!

537
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,130
Hey, people like you

538
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,830
should learn a lesson
by getting locked up in jail!

539
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,500
- Stay still!
- It hurts!

540
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,960
Does it hurt? This hurts?

541
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,500
Lim Yoo-ri.

542
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,930
You're under arrest
for attempted murder.

543
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You have the right
to remain silent.

544
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,830
You have the right
to have an attorney.

545
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,830
Anything you say can be used

546
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,330
against you in a court of law.

547
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,700
Sergeant Yoo!

548
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:07,400
We're having noodles for lunch.

549
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,430
Get off.

550
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,960
Who is she?

551
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,560
- She's an attempted murderer. Lock her up.
- Yes, sir.

552
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,100
What's going on?

553
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,200
What did you arrest her for?

554
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,660
Sergeant Yoo, you must hear this!

555
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,360
- Lim Yoo-ri is...
- Not now.

556
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,200
Sorry?

557
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,200
Where are you going?

558
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,200
What's wrong with him?
Did something happen?

559
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,800
Let's eat lunch.

560
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,000
What?

561
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,530
So you mean Lim Yoo-ri

562
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,660
tried to kill Jin-kang?

563
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,400
Yes.

564
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,400
That's why Jin-kook's
lost his mind.

565
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,730
Ah…

566
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,400
What do I do?

567
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,400
Hey.

568
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,330
Sit down.

569
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,530
Sit.

570
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,830
I knew you would do this.

571
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,530
What would you tell her?

572
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,430
Will you tell her that
someone tried to kill her?

573
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,700
Just don't tell her anything.

574
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
It'll only make her anxious.

575
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,060
Don't.

576
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,360
Don't, okay?

577
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,130
Okay.

578
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,430
- Hee-joon, hurry.
- Okay, sir.

579
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,130
- You got it?
- Yes.

580
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,960
Here you are.

581
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:15,100
Is the day after tomorrow
alright with you?

582
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,000
Okay.

583
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,430
Director Jang.

584
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,330
Since you're here,

585
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,300
check out the wedding recipe.

586
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,460
Give me a second.

587
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,960
It's the best of the best.

588
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,330
Kim Moo-young's recipe is

589
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,060
very unique this time.

590
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,530
What's wrong?

591
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,130
You tasted it the other day.
You liked it,

592
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,130
right?

593
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,000
What is Kim Moo-young like?

594
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,330
Do you really need him here?

595
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,560
Pardon me?

596
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,500
What the hell?

597
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,060
He appointed him

598
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,060
to make his wedding beer.

599
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,900
I think their marriage
got called off.

600
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,760
What, seriously?

601
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,930
A tabloid called it.

602
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,030
What does that have to do
with Moo-young?

603
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,860
Why does he suddenly
want to lay him off?

604
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,160
I get that
he's the largest shareholder.

605
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,930
But he has no right to tell me
to fire him.

606
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,060
It makes me angry
the more I think about it.

607
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,900
Jin-kang, hold on.

608
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,400
- Hey!
- How are you?

609
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,360
- It's been a while.
- I know right.

610
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,530
I almost forgot your face.

611
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,500
Gosh, what happened to your arm?

612
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,030
- I fell off.
- You should've been careful.

613
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,030
What's all this?
Are you moving out of your studio?

614
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,430
No, not exactly.

615
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,230
Then what?

616
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,600
Jin-kang.

617
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,900
I'm going to run away
with Moo-young.

618
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,030
Run away?

619
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,830
$2.3M?

620
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,030
Yeah.

621
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,630
Hey, how could you…

622
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,800
Can you really do that
without your parents knowing?

623
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,760
They bought this for me anyway.

624
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,260
Still, that's not right.

625
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,030
What about that punk?

626
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,000
I mean, your boyfriend.

627
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,430
Did he say yes?

628
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,660
I'm going to tell him tomorrow.

629
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,760
I'm sure he'll like it.

630
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,730
It's been hard for him
because of me.

631
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,800
If you leave?

632
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,600
Where would you go?

633
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,500
Um…

634
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,530
A place where nobody can find us.

635
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,030
There's no such place
in the world anymore.

636
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,660
Why not?

637
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,500
Greece or Morocco.

638
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,960
We can build a house by a shore

639
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,730
and live there in secret.

640
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,500
Or in Haesan?

641
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,200
He's from Haesan actually.

642
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,130
As long as he's fine,

643
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,030
I'm okay with that place, too.

644
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,930
Seung-ah…

645
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,600
Jin-kang, Moo-young's family
is really interesting.

646
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,360
His family?

647
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,660
He seems to have lived with
a large family when he was young.

648
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,330
He used to live with aunts,

649
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,260
his mom and aunts only
wore the same clothes.

650
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:46,160
Seriously.
Same clothes all year around.

651
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,800
- Isn't it funny?
- Yeah.

652
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,000
He told you that?

653
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,730
Yeah.

654
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,160
Hey, Cho-rong.

655
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,160
It's me, sir.

656
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,730
What are you going to do
with Lim Yoo-ri?

657
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,760
Obviously,
I'm going to indict her.

658
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,200
So how?

659
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,200
We need something certain
to lock her up behind bars.

660
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,730
Did you find anything?

661
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,500
- Yeah.
- You did?

662
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,460
It's over now.

663
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,160
Sergeant Yoo,
she's a total psycho.

664
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,730
- Really?
- Yeah.

665
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,700
All of the testifiers I met
said the same thing.

666
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,830
And she's been seeing a psychiatrist
ever since she was young.

667
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,030
She was even on
a best-selling book…

668
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,900
Its title was…

669
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,260
(With Trauma)
Its title was…

670
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:18,330
(With Trauma)

671
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,530
Yang Kyung-mo's With Trauma'?
(With Trauma)

672
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,930
Yang Kyung-mo's With Trauma'?

673
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,830
Uh? How do you know that?

674
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,530
- You sure?
- Yes.

675
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,930
I heard it directly from the testifier
I met earlier.

676
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,930
Jung Mi-yeon said
Lim Yoo-ri is on the book.

677
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,630
- You sure?
- Yeah.

678
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,760
Right. And the surprising thing is

679
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,100
she's unexpectedly

680
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,730
from a very wealthy family.

681
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,700
You know Hajin Ob-Gyn?

682
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,900
It has several branches in
Gangnam, Ilsan, Bundang…

683
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,660
Whatever,
she's the youngest daughter

684
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,530
of the family.

685
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,260
She has 1 older sister
and 1 older brother.

686
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,400
Both are super elite.

687
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:56,460
(A Girl Who Is Invisible)
Both are super elite.

688
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:56,530
(A Girl Who Is Invisible)

689
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:57,660
Soo-jung first tried to
commit suicide…
(A Girl Who Is Invisible)

690
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:57,730
Soo-jung first tried to
commit suicide…

691
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,400
(The ugly duckling
in a wealthy family)
Soo-jung first tried to
commit suicide…

692
00:44:59,400 --> 00:44:59,960
(The ugly duckling
in a wealthy family)

693
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,160
the spring she turned 9 years old.

694
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,160
Lim Yoo-ri? Lim Yoo-ri?

695
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,960
It was the housekeeper

696
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:15,660
who found the kid
unconscious after taking

697
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,000
a whole bottle of painkillers
in the study.

698
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,600
Yoo-ri! Yoo-ri!

699
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:24,100
For 2 months
since counseling began,

700
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,330
she hasn't talked.

701
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,100
When I picked up a comb

702
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,900
or a doll dress she dropped

703
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,630
while playing with a doll,

704
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,630
she accepted it.

705
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,500
But she still acted like
she was all alone.

706
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,530
Yoo-ri, how did you feel today?

707
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,500
At our 8th meeting,

708
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,230
I was finally

709
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,430
able to hear her voice.

710
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,630
The first thing Soo-jung
asked me was…

711
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,900
- If she was...
- Doctor, can you see me?

712
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,900
visible to me.

713
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,030
I am

714
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,260
invisible to mom.

715
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,430
She said she was invisble
to her mom.

716
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,630
I told you to come out
30 minutes earlier.

717
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,560
I'm late because
you came out late.

718
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,100
(Kim Moo-young)

719
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,730
Do you even have any idea

720
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,560
what Seung-ah is
thinking right now?

721
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,660
Get lost.

722
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,430
Hey, where are you going?

723
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,600
You need to go to prison.

724
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,660
Hey, where are you going?

725
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,600
Why…

726
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,460
Why is she leaving?

727
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:08,230
Sergeant Yoo told me to release her

728
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,700
- due to insufficient evidence.
- Insufficient evidence…

729
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,000
Seriously?

730
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,060
This is insane!

731
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:20,130
- Damn it!
- What are you doing here?

732
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,030
I should've put her in jail!

733
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,700
Sergeant Yoo just let her go.

734
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,030
- Why?
- Insufficient evidence.

735
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,360
He said he found some evidence.

736
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:30,360
We could find evidence
after we lock her up!

737
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:31,730
This is so upsetting!

738
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,430
Damn it!

739
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,660
Should I go and arrest her again?

740
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,360
Seriously…

741
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:40,930
What, isn't he Oh Ba-reun?

742
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,760
Oh Ba-reun?

743
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,000
Hello?

744
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,360
Hello, what brings you here?

745
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:48,760
The youngest?
It's none of your business.

746
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,560
I'm still a detective,
the youngest detective!

747
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,100
I mean…

748
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,700
How about you work at
Eagle Brewery for some time?

749
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,030
If you're fine with it,

750
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,160
I can put in a good word for you.

751
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:07,460
Don't ask me why.

752
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,660
Just for some time, uh?

753
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,530
(For CCTV)

754
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,560
Why did you let Lim Yoo-ri go?

755
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,960
I didn't let her go.

756
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,330
I don't have evidence
to lock her up.

757
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:33,860
Gosh, it's a dude.

758
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,060
It's all dude

759
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,760
I knew it'd be a dud.

760
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:44,460
Guess what I brought here.

761
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,500
What did you bring here?

762
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,930
Ah, should I hand it over to you
or not?

763
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,500
- This.
- You little punk…

764
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,230
- How dare you jerk me around?
- KICS.

765
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,660
Korea Information System
of Criminal Justice Services.

766
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,430
I was able to access the case folder

767
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,530
of the Wonyoung-dong
College Female Student's

768
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,760
murder case!

769
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,500
Really? How?

770
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,700
- Oh Ba-reun.
- Oh Ba-reun?

771
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,200
Goodness, let me through!

772
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,400
Where the hell is he?

773
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,760
Why don't you get my bike back?

774
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,630
Do you know how much I spent
on the settlement?

775
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,400
- Get out!
- Gosh, calm down!

776
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,330
Hey!

777
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,660
Do you really want to
get your bike back?

778
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,260
- Yes.
- And then that cute bastard was…

779
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:34,500
- Goddamn it! Let me go!
- Hey, jerk!

780
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,500
You think a thief
isn't even a human?

781
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,300
A thief doesn't even have
any human rights?

782
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,500
Where is that guy?
Where the hell is he?

783
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,360
Goodness, we can't find it!

784
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:45,760
Sergeant Yoo has been stuck
in the control center

785
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:48,500
and searching for days,

786
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,960
he's got nothing!

787
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:53,200
He can't find anything

788
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:56,600
with that public CCTV screen.

789
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,160
Find my bike now!

790
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,130
Do something about him.

791
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,430
What do you want me to do?

792
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,200
Hey, hey!

793
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,460
Shh!

794
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,760
Do you want me to go through
Jung Mi-yeon's folder?

795
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,700
Then what?

796
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,430
I got everything.

797
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,600
I got all the footages
of private CCTVs

798
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,100
and even dash cams
from cars parked nearby

799
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,500
within a kilometer
of the incident.

800
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:22,360
Eom Cho-rong, you sweetie!

801
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,900
It hurts!

802
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,860
- I'm sorry.
- Continue your works.

803
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,130
Hee-joon.

804
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,230
Hee-joon.

805
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,530
What do you need?

806
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,060
He got fired?

807
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:13,100
Yes, because of you.

808
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,000
Don't you think this is too much?

809
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,000
Love is love, work is work.

810
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,700
How could he fire him
because he got mad?

811
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,030
I guess rich people think
they can do that.

812
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:25,160
Hey, Hee-joon.

813
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,560
I'm sorry but could you please

814
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:30,530
call Moo-young for me?

815
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,630
What happened?

816
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,560
You didn't even pick up my calls.

817
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,230
I'm sorry.

818
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,730
I was worried.
I thought you were sick.

819
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,260
Were you?

820
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,560
I'm sorry for making you worry.

821
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:00,460
No, it's alright.

822
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:03,660
Hee-joon told me everything.

823
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:06,330
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

824
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,630
You don't have to.
I can get another job.

825
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,930
No.

826
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,330
It's not necessary.

827
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,500
Moo-young,

828
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,030
you don't need to get another job.

829
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,600
You needed to quit anyways.

830
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,760
I told you…

831
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,100
I'm going to be smarter.

832
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,060
Everything's ready now.

833
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,630
Let's run away.

834
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,260
Hey, Seung-ah.

835
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,100
Seung-ah.

836
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,860
Jin-kang.

837
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:13,060
What's going on? What happened?

838
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,530
It's all my fault.

839
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,030
What do you mean?

840
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,060
We're really rich, aren't we?

841
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,160
Yeah, we are.

842
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,900
Where do you want to go,
Moo-young?

843
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,060
Well…

844
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,430
I like somewhere warm.

845
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,860
What about Greece?

846
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Uhm, Greece.

847
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,730
I won't take anything

848
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,760
when I leave

849
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:58,430
except for a backpack.

850
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,060
- Shall we go?
- Yeah.

851
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,930
But where?

852
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,160
Home.

853
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,400
I need to work on my resume.

854
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,830
- What?
- I told you, I need to look for a job.

855
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,260
Moo-young…

856
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,760
I hurt his pride.

857
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:21,830
He's really a prideful person.

858
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,230
I talked about money to him…

859
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,860
I feel like I'm such an idiot.

860
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,800
Seung-ah…

861
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,900
I hate Woo-sang so much…

862
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,000
Seung-ah.

863
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,830
Are you really going to
leave with him?

864
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,030
Even if you like him so much,

865
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,400
how can you…

866
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,330
How can you do that?

867
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,060
Why not?

868
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:50,500
I can't do anything here.

869
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,760
You know about

870
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:54,300
my mom

871
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,700
and Woo-sang…

872
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,760
Take it slow.

873
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:01,660
You need to find out
what he's really like.

874
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,060
What?

875
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,860
What do you mean

876
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:07,700
I need to find out
what he's really like?

877
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,160
Of course you should find out

878
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:13,000
if he's really the one for you.

879
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,200
It hasn't even been 2 months
since you've met.

880
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,560
You must get to know
if he's the right one.

881
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:19,600
Alright.

882
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:24,300
I get what you're saying.

883
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,560
I know you're saying this for me.

884
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,160
But you don't know him.

885
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:31,330
That's why you're saying this.

886
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,560
What? You kept blowing me off.

887
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,830
You've been waiting for me
since this morning?

888
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,900
Yeah.

889
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,960
What is this about?

890
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:14,700
What are you going to do
about Seung-ah?

891
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,760
Do what?

892
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:19,400
Do you even love her?

893
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,860
No.

894
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,460
What?

895
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:24,900
I didn't think she got the hint

896
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,460
even though I ignored her calls
that much.

897
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,730
So I explained everything to her.

898
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,760
What did you tell her?

899
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,060
I mean she's attractive.

900
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:41,000
But it's too much. I can't just put
eveything behind me and leave.

901
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,500
So I told her,

902
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,330
there's no love in this world.

903
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,530
So, I haven't loved you.

904
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,800
When you said there's no love
in this world,

905
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,100
why did you toy with her?

906
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,430
Just to be sure.

907
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,330
It's like going to church.

908
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,100
You want to go to church

909
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,830
if the church is beautiful

910
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,530
even if you know there's no god.

911
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,000
But there isn't a god.

912
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,460
So…

913
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,360
You can come

914
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:12,260
and go as you please?

915
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:14,900
Because it's your will?

916
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,630
Right.

917
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,530
So you don't care about

918
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,960
the other's feelings at all?

919
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,930
Because it's their feelings?

920
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,260
Something like that.

921
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:32,630
Have you ever

922
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,700
liked someone with all your heart?

923
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,330
Yes, you.

924
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,330
You really don't care

925
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,700
about how other people
feel at all.

926
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,230
What's with that look?

927
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:01,200
I pity you.

928
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:17,230
Hey.

929
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,800
You're here.

930
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,100
Why are you out here?
Is someone inside?

931
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,030
No, everyone's off duty.
No one's inside.

932
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,460
Then why are you out here?
Let's get inside.

933
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:52,860
I mean, it's…

934
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:55,000
My mom boiled beef
bone soup again.

935
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,860
She's already at the terminal.

936
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,030
You should go then.

937
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,030
Why are moms like that?

938
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,460
No, not all moms are like that.

939
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,830
- Hurry, she might be waiting for you.
- Alright.

940
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,300
Sir.

941
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,700
Did you find anything?

942
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,330
This is the beginning.
You want to take a look?

943
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,960
Yeah.

944
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,800
Look.

945
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,860
This is Hewitt Vill.

946
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,630
This is the only place
the umbrella was caught.

947
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,930
Look carefully.

948
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,300
It's a long way,

949
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:36,200
but there is a path where
he could've avoided the cameras.

950
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:39,130
- Like this.
- Yeah, it's true.

951
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,760
This is the key point.

952
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:43,730
The first side street from
the back entrance of Hewitt Vill.

953
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,160
Fortunately, there were many cars
that passed by here around then.

969
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,030
I guess I should go
to Kim Moo-young

970
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,300
and ask him.

971
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,000
Do you still believe
that I killed her?

972
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,560
Even if he pretended
that he was firm,

973
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:23,260
I clearly felt that

974
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:24,500
he was anxious.

975
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,930
There's not a lot to see.

976
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,530
This isn't your first time
seeing a burn scar.

977
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,000
- Haesan.
- You look okay

978
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:31,730
while you made it impossible
for me to do anything all day.

979
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,660
What are you doing?

980
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:34,230
I was just watching to make
sure he wouldn't kiss you.

981
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,700
What? Are you disappointed?

982
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,100
Do you like Jin-kang?

983
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,360
- I do.
- Seung-ah.

984
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:40,560
What about you?

985
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:42,460
Do you like him too?
