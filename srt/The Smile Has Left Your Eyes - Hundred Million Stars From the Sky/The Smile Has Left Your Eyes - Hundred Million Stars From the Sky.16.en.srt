6
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,400
Stop right there.

7
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,960
The moment you open that door,
I'll call your sister.

8
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,260
The younger sister of yours
you love so much.

9
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,430
What?

10
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,830
You really loved her?

11
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,259
I guess you did.

12
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,460
You're pissing me off.

13
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,830
What should I tell her first?

14
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,660
Don't worry, kid.

15
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,400
Kim Moo-young loves you.

16
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,759
He'll love you until he dies.

17
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,330
But why did he leave you
when he loves you so much?

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,730
Because he's your brother.

19
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,060
Oh my, you really didn't
know a thing?

20
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,160
Without knowing that,

21
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,630
did you two sleep together?

22
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,760
Oh no.

23
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,700
Seriously?

24
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,829
(Final Episode)

25
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,530
Kim Moo-young…

26
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,400
Did you really…

27
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,360
kill her?

28
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,600
Why?

29
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:48,800
Why the hell did you…

30
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,560
I'm not here to talk about that.

31
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,360
Then what?

32
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,960
Jin-kang…

33
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,660
Can she continue living
like she is now?

34
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,200
Jin-kang?

35
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,960
Yes.

36
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,560
Just like now.

37
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,130
Even in the future.

38
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,700
What do you mean?

39
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,900
Does what happened today
also involve her?

40
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,660
No, it's not like that.

41
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,830
Thank you.

42
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,360
I came here
because I wanted to thank you.

43
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,300
Why are you thanking me?

44
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,000
Thank you for protecting

45
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,730
my sister, Yoon.

46
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,200
Your sister Yoon?

47
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,030
Yoon…

48
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,030
Jung-yoon?

49
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,660
Do you think Jin-kang
is your sister?

50
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,160
No, no!

51
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,130
Who the hell told you that?

52
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,530
Why do you think
she's your sister?

53
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,460
Jin-kang isn't!

54
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,530
You don't have any siblings.
Kang Soon-gu only had one child, you.

55
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,330
Who the heck told you that?

56
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,100
So she lied to me…

57
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,560
What's the point of asking me
when you already know everything?

58
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,500
That's right.

59
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,130
Yoo Jin-kang.

60
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,360
The person you searched
so hard for…

61
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,960
Your real sibling.

62
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,560
Your real sister.

63
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,560
What's your name?

64
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,100
Yoo Jin-kang.

65
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,130
What's your registration number?

66
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,659
900407-2819518.

67
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:46,460
How are you related
to Kim Moo-young?

68
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,659
I used to be his girlfriend.

69
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
No, I'm still his girlfriend.

70
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,000
Sergeant Yoo.

71
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,900
- You're going to pick Jin-kang up?
- Yeah.

72
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,330
Well, I thought I should tell you.

73
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,500
What?

74
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,600
Jin-kang…

75
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,700
knows she's not your real sister.

76
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,200
What?

77
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,299
She's known ever since
junior high.

78
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,400
When did you find out
Kim Moo-young killed Jang Se-ran?

79
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,260
Are you sure he killed her?

80
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,060
So you think he didn't?

81
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,560
No.

82
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,600
I don't think so.

83
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,500
Wake up, Ms. Yoo.

84
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,330
Do you still believe
he's just a suspect

85
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,500
because that's what they're
calling him on the news?

86
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,760
He's already the culprit here.

87
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,930
We already decided to disclose
his personal info to the public.

88
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,160
Jin-kang.

89
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,060
I told you,
you didn't have to come.

90
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,530
- Get in.
- Thanks.

91
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,760
Did they treat you right?

92
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,460
Yeah, I just told them
what I know.

93
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,900
Jin-kang already knows
she's not your real sister.

94
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,760
She's known ever since
junior high.

95
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,930
What am I supposed to say
if you say that?

96
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,630
What can I say when
I feel so bad?

97
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,930
My puberty…

98
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,030
What was I like in my teens?

99
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,860
I was so sorry

100
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,830
even just looking at your face

101
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,530
and at your back!

102
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,960
I couldn't even breathe
when I was a teen!

103
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Jin-kook.

104
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,260
Yes.

105
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,730
If everyone says it's true,
then it should be, right?

106
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,460
About what?

107
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,160
Kim Moo-young.

108
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,760
Everyone believes that
Kim Moo-young murdered her.

109
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,060
Jin-kang also knows

110
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,930
what happened between
you and Kim Moo-young's father.

111
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,300
Jin-kang knows about Kang Soon-gu?

112
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,200
I'm sorry. I told her.

113
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,100
But I had no choice.

114
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,330
Someone had already told
her almost everything.

115
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,930
Jin-kang.

116
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,900
Your name is…

117
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,530
Jung-yoon.

118
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,500
Han Jung-yoon.

119
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
I'm sorry

120
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,200
for not telling you earlier.

121
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,830
Let's find Moo-young first.

122
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,060
And I'll tell you everything

123
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,430
you need to know.

124
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,200
Okay.

125
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,860
Wake up, Ms. Yoo.

126
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,630
Do you still believe
he's just a suspect

127
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,930
because that's what they're
calling him on the news?

128
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,260
He's already the culprit here.

129
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,460
Why don't you ask
your brother Jin-kook?

130
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,330
About what happened between
your brother and Kim Moo-young

131
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,700
25 years ago.

132
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,230
He didn't hate him.

133
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,200
He felt sorry for him
and he was afraid.

134
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,060
When in fact,

135
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,060
your brother killed him.

136
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,360
Who is Jin-kang?

137
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,530
if she's not my sister

138
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,300
Why is Jin-kang in my memory

139
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,230
and even in my family drawing?

140
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,730
Because you adored her.

141
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,330
You adored and loved her
more than her own family did.

142
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,960
- I did?
- That’s right.

143
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,960
Jin-kang's real name is
Han Jung-yoon.

144
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,130
Even though she had a name,

145
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,900
her birth wasn't registered

146
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,000
until she was 4.

147
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,200
Because her parents were
too obsessed with the cult.

148
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,130
They dragged your mother
into the cult.

149
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,400
Your mother secretly took you
and the house deposit

150
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,600
without your father knowing.

151
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,830
That's why

152
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
dad killed mom…

153
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,230
Right.

154
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,700
And Jin-kang's parents too.

155
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,160
Jin-kang is…

156
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,460
the daughter of Han Jong-soo
and Park Jung-hye,

157
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,900
victims your father killed.

158
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,130
Jin-kang doesn't have to know
any of this, does she?

159
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,700
Any part of the past.

160
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,960
Promise me,

161
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,730
she can continue living
without knowing anything.

162
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,830
Good.

163
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,600
I should go.

164
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,130
Turn yourself in.

165
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,960
Please, turn yourself in.

166
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,060
That's the only way.

167
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,960
I'm so mad.

168
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,160
Something

169
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,430
has fooled me for a long time,

170
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,160
so I can't stand it,
I'm just so upset.

171
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,730
I need time to think.

172
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,630
Moo-young.

173
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,460
Jin-kook, it's not your fault.

174
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,700
It's neither your fault

175
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,630
nor the Doctor's fault.

176
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,030
You can't beat me.

177
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,530
You could never beat me
because you were sorry to me.

178
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,760
Just give me 3 days.

179
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,060
I'll call you

180
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,030
after 3 days.

181
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:14,300
(Will)

182
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,930
No, Moo-young! No!

183
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,430
Jin-kang.

184
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,930
What are you doing there?

185
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,360
Jin-kook,
why did you do that to him?

186
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,960
Uh?

187
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,060
Why did you stab him?

188
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,330
What?

189
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,830
If you didn't hate him,
but rather, you felt sorry to him,

190
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,500
you should've apologized.

191
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,860
If you were afraid,
you should've asked him for forgiveness.

192
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,700
How could you…

193
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,500
stab him with a knife?

194
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,100
Yeah…

195
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,460
Right, it's my fault.

196
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,100
It's your fault.

197
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,330
Right.

198
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,960
Jin-kook, he's not the same
guy you knew from before.

199
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,930
He told me he wants to be reborn.

200
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,960
There's no way he killed her.

201
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,060
I don't believe it.

202
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,460
I'm not going to believe it

203
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,400
until he tells me in person.

204
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,600
Jin-kook,

205
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,560
he isn't like a cold for me.

206
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,030
It won't go away
after time passes.

207
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,060
I don't think…

208
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,960
I can live without him.

209
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,100
I feel like I'm going
to die without him.

210
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,300
Don't worry.

211
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,330
I'm going to…

212
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,430
find Kim Moo-young.
I must find him.

213
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,800
Don't worry.

214
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,730
Everything's going to be alright.
Don't worry.

215
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,100
I should've stopped him from
leaving by any means possible.

216
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I felt how his wrath and disappointment

217
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,330
turned into self-hatred

218
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,330
when he found out
his father was a murderer.

219
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,260
If Moo-young really
committed murder,

220
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,860
he won't be able to
live with himself.

221
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,730
That's why we must find him.

222
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
I'm going to find him.

223
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,730
Right.

224
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,630
I'll go check places

225
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,760
Moo-young might possibly be.

226
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,160
Thanks, Doctor.

227
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,330
Chairman Jang Il-geon

228
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,100
who has lost both his children,

229
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,400
Jang Woo-sang and Jang Se-ran,

230
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,500
couldn't hide his deep sadness.

231
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,860
He left the airport

232
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,900
without answering
reporters' questions.

233
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,360
Jin-kang.

234
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,630
Jin-kook's not here.

235
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,160
I know. I came to see you.

236
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,560
- I was wondering how you're doing.
- I'm fine.

237
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,060
Jin-kang, did you…

238
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,130
change your door passcode?

239
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,960
- No.
- Then let's change it now.

240
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,230
The passcode?

241
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,130
I was so frustrated
Jin-kook didn't change it

242
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,560
when he said he would.

243
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,700
Now I'm finally relieved.

244
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,130
You done?

245
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,600
Is the new passcode related to
your birthday or personal info?

246
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,130
Tak.

247
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,960
Is this because of Kim Moo-young?

248
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,900
What?

249
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,800
Actually…

250
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,330
Kim Moo-young came to your house.

251
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,160
House? Our place here?

252
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:14,100
Twice, secretly.

253
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,230
And he even brought
a gun with him.

254
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,360
A gun?

255
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,930
Nothing's going to happen,

256
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,230
but just in case.

257
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,360
No way…

258
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,260
Was it because Jin-kook
killed his father?

259
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,660
When?

260
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,500
The day you asked me to

261
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,860
come home and eat with Jin-kook
because you were working late.

262
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,500
(I'm going to work late tonight.
Can you have dinner)
come home and eat with Jin-kook
because you were working late.

263
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
(I'm going to work late tonight.
Can you have dinner)

264
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,660
(with my brother?)

265
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,160
(So-jung)

266
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,200
(Kim Moo-young)

267
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,900
What time do you get
off work today?
(Kim Moo-young)

268
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,830
Around 10PM at the earliest.

269
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,560
Police officers work in 4 shifts,
right?

270
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,530
Yes, weekly rotations.

271
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,030
Most officers are busy even
on their days off and holidays,

272
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,730
except for my brother.

273
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,430
- He always takes those days off.
- When?

274
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,030
This month, 4th, 8th, 12th…

275
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,530
Multiples of 4.

276
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,730
So he must be
on his day shift today.

277
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,330
You must've come here
because of Moo-young.

278
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,230
I understand.

279
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,360
I was shocked too
when I saw the news.

280
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,460
Yoo-ri,

281
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,900
do you think
he really killed Jang Se-ran?

282
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,430
What do you think?

283
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,430
I can't believe it.

284
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,360
I think he killed her.

285
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,200
Moo-young can do whatever

286
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,000
he puts his mind to.

287
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,130
When he puts his mind to something,
he's capable of even worse.

288
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,230
What's so important about rice?

289
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,260
You said you want
to be born again.

290
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,960
So then?

291
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,630
You must live in a warm house.

292
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
A warm house smells

293
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,560
like warm rice.

294
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,960
Thanks for the meal!

295
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,400
They're having difficulty
investigating the case.

296
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,200
You think he's no longer
Kim Moo-young

297
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,960
if he killed someone?

298
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,130
He at least never

299
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,030
messes with anyone
who doesn't bother him.

300
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,800
I'm sorry, can you go to
Dowon Police Station, please?

301
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,230
They announced they'll strengthen

302
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,330
the search and seizure investigation
into the NJ Group Secretary Team.

303
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,800
- There he comes.
- He's coming out!

304
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,960
Please tell us what happened!

305
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,800
Please say something!

306
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,800
Manager Choi, it's Yoo Jin-kang!

307
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,330
Hey, what did you tell him?

308
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,460
Manager Choi!
I know you know everything.

309
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,630
Manager Choi,
what did you tell him?

310
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,330
Where is he now?

311
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
Manager Choi

312
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,930
Manager!

313
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,000
Manager Choi!

314
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,660
(Chairman Jang)

315
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,230
Yes, Chairman.

316
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,500
You guys were abandoned.

317
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,100
Your parents were obsessed
with the cult.

318
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,000
You were the one

319
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,160
who took care of Jin-kang.

320
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,260
You probably meant everything
to Jin-kang.

321
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,400
That's why Jin-kang stopped
talking after you disappeared.

322
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,630
For more than 3 months

323
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,100
after I took her in,

324
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,200
she waited all day
staring at the door.

325
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,260
She cried and cried
when the sun went down.

326
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,030
Even after she started
opening up to me,

327
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,930
she'd follow boys about your age
whenever she saw them.

328
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,600
What's wrong? It's okay.

329
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,260
It's okay.

330
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,030
It was you.

331
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,330
You planted love
in Jin-kang's heart.

332
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,230
I hope that's true.

333
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,460
I can't believe it though.

334
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,730
The burn on your right shoulder

335
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,430
is proof of that.

336
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,300
When I shot your father
and he fell down,

337
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,860
Jin-kang came in,

338
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,230
maybe because of
the gunshot sound.

339
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,630
Jin-kang ran inside

340
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,900
and bumped into the heater.

341
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,430
And the boiling kettle
fell off the heater.

342
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,300
You protected her

343
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,360
from the boiling water

344
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,230
by throwing your little body

345
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,630
over Jin-kang.

346
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,860
That's why your burn scar

347
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,730
is bigger than hers.

348
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,060
I'm proud of

349
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,060
my ugly burn scar.

350
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,460
I'm sorry

351
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,360
for treating you so harshly
after all you did for her…

352
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,460
Why are you crying?

353
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,130
Is it because you're sad or happy?

354
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,330
Because I'm happy.

355
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,900
About what?

356
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,000
The sky.

357
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,730
The sky?

358
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,900
Yeah.

359
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,960
It's so beautiful.

360
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,700
Why haven't I noticed it?

361
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,930
There are so many beautiful things

362
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,930
in this world.

363
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,130
Right.

364
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,960
There are.

365
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,460
We used to be here

366
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,330
a long time ago.

367
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,960
Really?

368
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:34,030
I was really good to you then.

369
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,630
Really?

370
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,060
Yeah.

371
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,530
If I tell you everything,
you'll want to repay me.

372
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,560
Repay you?

373
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,100
Sure, why not?

374
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,600
That's why…

375
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,800
Let's live happily together
for a long time.

376
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,030
Kim Moo-young.

377
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,600
I went home.

378
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,560
You went home?

379
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,660
The house where you used
to live with your family?

380
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,860
- Yes.
- Where? How did you find it?

381
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,500
Just on my way,

382
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,360
passing by.

383
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,300
In the woods.

384
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,000
In the woods?

385
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,160
Yes, a house like a picture.

386
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,200
Like a picture…

387
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,900
(Mortar of Mountain Geumah)

388
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,960
No, that's a lie.

389
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,660
I just thought
there might be a house

390
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,630
when I passed by.

391
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,000
What the heck?

392
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,060
I was happy because
I thought you really found it.

393
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,030
Would I be happy
if I really found it?

394
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,160
He actually found his home.

395
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,600
(Depart from Seoul)

(Furious with his wife
who was into a pseudo-religion)

399
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,400
(Murdered 3 people, his wife and
followers, then committed suicide)

400
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,530
The Mountain Geumah Murder Case
happened on November 1st, 1993.

401
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,460
Culprit Kang Soon-gu.

402
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,830
Victims Lee Mi-young,
Han Jong-soo, Park Jung-hye.

403
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,360
His wife was into the cult
and ran away with his son.

404
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,900
The culprit held grudges

405
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,560
and went to the refuge,

406
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,900
killed his wife and the couple.

407
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,630
Officer Yoo Jin-kook from
Haesan Police Station

408
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,100
shot the culprit, Kang Soon-gu,
and killed him.

409
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,700
Kang Soon-gu's son, Kang Sun-ho

410
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,630

to Haesan Hospital.

(8:36 KTX)

417
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,860
(Mortar of Mountain Geumah)

418
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,260
The person you are calling
cannot be reached…

419
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,130
Hello?

420
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,100
Is this Detective Yoo Jin-kook?

421
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,560
Yes, who's this?

422
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,760
Hi, I'm Moo-young's friend.

423
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,030
Yes, please speak.

424
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,860
He told me to call you
3 hours later,

425
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,600
but I have this bad feeling…

426
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,930
He asked you to come to the place
where you first met Kang Sun-ho.

427
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,930
He said you'll know
what that means.

428
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,430
If I want to tell you something,

429
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,600
I must finish the story
I need to tell you first.

430
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,900
I don't think the things you said
about me were wrong.

431
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,730
If being evil means
someone who doesn't have feelings,

432
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,130
I really was evil.

433
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,100
I don't know why.

434
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,930
I always thought
people were strange.

435
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
They're happy because
of strange things,

436
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,260
they're sad because
of strange things,

437
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,960
and they get angry
because of strange things.

438
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,060
You know what this means, right?
Mr. Kim Moo-young.

439
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,100
Sometimes, I hated people.

440
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,830
Sometimes, it was fun.

441
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,730
I messed with things
I wanted to mess with

442
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,930
and I watched things
I wanted to watch.

443
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,160
If someone started a fight,
I fought.

444
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,230
In those moments,

445
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,160
I wasn't interested in
Yoo-ri or Seung-ah at all.

446
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:55,960
Don't get caught.

447
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,500
I knew I was going to win
in the end.

448
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,560
Jin-kang told me to become
a good man.

449
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,860
Promise me you'll
become a good man.

450
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,860
Then teach me.

451
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,200
I wanted to become a good man,

452
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,760
(Wanted)
I wanted to become a good man,

453
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:32,830
(Wanted)

454
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,160
but I became a murderer instead.
(Wanted)

455
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,000
I'm sure no one will understand me,

456
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,960
but I want to say one thing.

457
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,460
I'm regretting this.

458
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,700
What?

459
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,860
Are you writing a confessional?

460
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,930
I thought I'd be the only one

461
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,400
left broken by this.

462
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,460
It's my fault.

463
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,730
I beg you.

464
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,330
Please leave those people alone.

465
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,330
I…

466
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,930
felt like I was a real
human that day.

467
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,200
I felt more human than ever…

468
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,560
I killed a person,

469
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:32,100
and then I realized my life ended
because of that as well.

470
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,560
Yoon.

471
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,630
Yoon.

472
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,200
I'm hungry.

473
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,900
Are you hungry?

474
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,760
Wait here.

475
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,860
Please let us get out of here.

476
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,130
We all together shall…

477
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,230
Yoon, how many peanuts
do you want to eat?

478
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:38,700
I'm impressed.
You came all the way here.

479
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,430
I have a question.

480
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,730
You needed a gun
because of my brother?

481
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,400
Yes.

482
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,360
To kill him?

483
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,260
Yes.

484
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,560
You brought it all the way
to our house, right?

485
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,600
Yes.

486
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,800
You asked me if I was working late

487
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,930
and when his shifts were

488
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,560
all because of this, right?

489
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,430
Yes.

490
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,560
Did you really try to kill him?

491
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,430
Yes.

492
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,800
But I couldn't
because someone came in.

493
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,500
This is why you broke
up with me, right?

494
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,960
Because my brother

495
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,000
killed your father.

496
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,900
Yes.

497
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,930
Is there anything else?

498
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,630
What other lies

499
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,330
did you prepare?

500
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,060
With that wicked look
and by saying…

501
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:09,100
Yes, yes.

502
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,630
What are you really hiding?

503
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,700
I'm not hiding anything.

504
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,130
What are you doing?

505
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,030
I'll die if I do this, right?

506
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,560
That's not a toy.

507
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,400
Exactly.

508
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:50,130
Stop annoying me.
Give it to me now.

509
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,430
I'm so sorry to you.

510
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,700
Because my brother killed
your father,

511
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,300
that's why I feel so bad.

512
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,800
So I'll die instead.

513
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:08,830
Give it to me.

514
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,800
Tell me you won't die.

515
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,330
Give it to me.

516
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,100
This is going to be the last.

517
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:21,830
Promise me
you're not going to die.

518
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,160
Yoo Jin-kang!

519
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,300
Are you out of your mind?

520
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,130
Do you really want to die?

521
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,760
No.

522
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,700
I want to live.

523
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,560
I want to live with you!

524
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,500
Kim Moo-young.

525
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,030
Just go.

526
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,700
I'm not going anywhere alone.

527
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,100
Your father killed my parents,
right?

528
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,100
I was scared when I heard that.

529
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,830
That my parents had passed away

530
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,230
and that your father
had killed them.

531
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,330
That's when I realized.

532
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,960
You must've felt the same

533
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,260
when you found out

534
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,630
Jin-kook killed your father.

535
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,160
That's why you told me...

536
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,800
You are just you.

537
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,960
What?

538
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,830
No matter what happens,

539
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,760
you are just you

540
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,400
to me.

541
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,500
You are just you, to me.

542
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,830
I killed a person.

543
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,400
You can turn yourself in.

544
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,730
Receive your punishment
and start over.

545
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,900
It's too late.

546
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,460
I can't go back and change it.

547
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,530
I just…

548
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,130
want to die as myself.

549
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,200
You are so bad.

550
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,900
You're terrible.

551
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,100
Then what about me?

552
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:06,030
How am I going to live?

553
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,430
Go back.

554
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,930
To where?

555
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,130
To the time before you met me.

556
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,160
But we were together
from the beginning.

557
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,000
This is me.

558
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,800
If you die, I'll die too.

559
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,900
I'm here because of you.

560
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,260
I don't even know
if I can go anywhere without you.

561
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,900
Do you still want to die

562
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,560
despite me saying this?

563
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:36,230
No.

564
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,030
I want to live.

565
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,960
Jin-kang.

566
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,060
Jin-kang!

567
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,430
I love you.

568
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,600
I love you too…

569
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,500
Jin-kang…

570
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,530
No, no…

571
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:38,430
Hi, Jin-kook.

572
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:41,760
Please don't be sorry
to me any longer.

573
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:43,660
25 years is more than enough.

574
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:49,130
(To Mr. Yoo Jin-kook)

575
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:57,160
November 22nd, 2018.

576
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:08,560
Kang Sun-ho.

577
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,230
P.S.

578
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,230
One day, in the afternoon,

579
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,030
I missed something so
I started my journey.

580
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,300
I walked, walked, and walked again.

581
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:38,600
I bumped, bumped, and bumped again.

582
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,230
I'm sorry. Are you alright?

583
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,830
Then I finally reached Jin-kang.

584
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,630
I'm sorry.

585
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,530
Well, no wonder.

586
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,500
What do you mean?

587
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,760
No wonder,
you don't look that pretty.

588
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,430
Hey, look. Do you know me?

589
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,460
And…

590
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:57,200
No, not at all.

591
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,200
I began to feel alive again.

592
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,600
You're here.

593
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,630
Yes, I'm here.
