you played a game.

Nothing in this world
matters to you.

43
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,100
You even bet your own life
in your game.

00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,330
Mr. Kim Moo-young.

45
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,630
Let's go.

46
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,030
Why are you not sad?

47
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,230
Why are you fine?

48
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,660
How could you not care about your
own life? The life I was worried

49
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,300
sick about without even knowing
that my friend was dying?

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,760
I don't know.

51
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,930
I really wanted to die.

(Tak So-jung)

53
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,530
Hey.

54
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,200
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

55
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,260
I was working.

56
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:29,829
I also sent you a text message.

57
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,700
What kind of work?

58
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,700
Why didn't you check
your messages?

59
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,800
Eom Cho-rong went
to arrest Kim Moo-young.

60
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,960
Oh my god.

61
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,960
They're here.

62
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,800
They're here!

63
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,829
Why did you kill her?

64
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,960
Please say something!

What the hell is this?

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,660
Hey, I found it!

68
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,330
Okay.

69
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,300
You know this thing, right?

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,730
- Yes.
- So you must know where we found it.

71
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
Did you hide it?

72
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,160
Yes.

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,700
Where did you get this?

74
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,100
You said you brought it home.

75
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,930
So where did you get it?

76
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,500
From her house.

77
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,460
Jung Mi-yeon's?

78
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,300
- That's right.
- At least he admits it.

79
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,260
That's undeniable evidence.
What else can he do?

80
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,360
I can finally rest at ease.

81
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,600
Sir.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,160
Can we have a talk?

83
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,630
Jung Mi-yeon.

84
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,760
Did you kill her yourself?

85
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,900
Yes.

86
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,460
Why did you kill her?

87
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,730
For money?

88
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,700
He's lying.

89
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,800
He's not the culprit.

90
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,830
What are you talking about?

91
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,400
The real culprit is outside
here right now.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,200
She turned herself in
this afternoon

93
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,130
and I already recorded
her first testimony.

94
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,400
Her testimony?

95
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,630
Sergeant Yoo.

96
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,000
You know Sergeant Yoo
cares for you a lot.

97
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,100
You might

98
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,860
put him in a tough position.

99
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,960
So please be brave and
tell the truth.

100
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,230
Okay?

101
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,130
You got it?

102
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,900
Are you the one who turned in?

103
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,230
- No.
- Come in.

104
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,960
During junior high
in the States,

105
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,960
she filmed this video
with her boyfriend for fun.

106
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,630
This video somehow ended up in
Jung Mi-yeon's hands,

107
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,300
and ever since then,

108
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,000
she's been receiving financial threats
for over a year.

109
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,360
At first, Jung Mi-yeon asked for

110
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,430
purses or accessories.

111
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,000
But when Jung Mi-yeon's father's
company went bankrupt last June,

112
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,930
her demands increased in scale.

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,060
She asked for $100K.

114
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,000
So you're saying she killed her?

115
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,300
Both Lim Yoo-ri and Kim Moo-young
are saying they're the culprits.

116
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,930
Who the hell is the real one?

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
How are we going to handle
the reporters?

118
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,760
We'll find the truth
as quickly as possible.

119
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,700
I'll make sure none of this leaks.

120
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,900
I sold my car and my bag.

121
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,400
I sold everything I could.

122
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,200
I gave her around $20K
and begged her not to tell anyone,

123
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,000
but she just called me a whore.

124
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,760
She said words wouldn't
work on me.

125
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,630
She told me to check
the hospital's online bulletin board.

126
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,830
Was she refering to Hajin Ob-Gyn?

127
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,700
Your mother's hospital?

128
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,360
That's right.

129
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,800
She said she would first upload

130
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,430
it to the bulletin board,
next in our group chat,

131
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,930
then on any random site.

132
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,330
I really wanted to die.

133
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,060
I couldn't sleep that night.

134
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,400
I took some pills and slept.

135
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,800
I took a lot of pills actually.

136
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,330
When I woke up that night,
the police were there.

137
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,230
They asked me about Sang-hoon

138
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,260
because Mi-yeon had been killed.

139
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,500
They said her boyfriend,
Choi Sang-hoon, killed her.

140
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,900
But, you know what?

141
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,930
When I heard she died,

142
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,800
I was so happy.

143
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,360
She finally died.

144
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,400
I really didn't know I killed her.

145
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,130
It sure is nice to
see a familiar face.

146
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,700
What took you so long?

147
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,330
How do you feel sitting there
as a suspect?

148
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,760
Of course it's awful.

149
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,530
I know you didn't kill her.

150
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,800
What?

151
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,660
You said you'd believe
that I killed her no matter what.

152
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,900
You bothered me nonstop about it.

153
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,700
You said it's awful to be sitting here.
So why did you lie?

154
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,030
Why did you say you killed her
even though you didn't?

155
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,260
Did you want to leave evidence
of you protecting Lim Yoo-ri?

156
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,330
No way.

157
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,530
I just wanted things
to end quickly.

158
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,600
Haven't you ever felt like this?

159
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,500
Like you have so many thoughts

160
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,330
it feels like they'll burst
out of your head?

161
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,300
So?

162
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,130
Did you find an answer
out of all those thoughts?

163
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,460
I can't figure it out.

164
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,230
I don't know.

165
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,630
I was such an idiot.

166
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,300
I should've said no.

167
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,560
Lim Yoo-ri turned herself in.

168
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,400
There's nothing else you can do.

169
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,160
You knew Yoo-ri was being

170
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,800
financially threatened
by Jung Mi-yeon, right?

171
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,400
More or less.

172
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,830
On the night of August 26th,

173
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,060
you took a drunk
Jung Mi-yeon home.

174
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,930
That was 2 weeks
before the incident.

175
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,900
To be precise, it was the 27th

176
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,560
because it was past 12AM.

177
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,400
Did you ever meet her
after that night?

178
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,000
- No.
- Great.

179
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,960
According to Lim Yoo-ri,

180
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,030
she couldn't reach you
at all on the day of the incident.

181
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,760
I was busy preparing

182
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,560
for the event the next day.

183
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,300
I called her after work,

184
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,600
but she didn't answer.

185
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,560
I called her again
when I got home.

186
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,630
Hello?

187
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,800
- Moo-young.
- She sounded like she was high.

188
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,160
Well, that wasn't unusual,
but the thing was…

189
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,360
Where are you?

190
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,060
Mi-yeon is here…

191
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,000
You witnessed Jung Mi-yeon
falling down?

192
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,600
I didn't see it. I heard it.

193
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,630
The sound.

194
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,060
That can't be true.

195
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,060
The time doesn't add up.

196
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,960
2:34AM.

197
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,760
That's when you were on the back road
of Hewitt Village.

198
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,400
Jung Mi-yeon fell exactly at 3:04AM.

199
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,400
It takes less than 3 minutes to get to
Hewitt Village from there.

200
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,930
So there's a 27-minute gap.

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,960
Exactly.

202
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,330
Which means, you were already
inside Jung Mi-yeon's house then.

203
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,530
What did you do?

204
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,460
Were you just waiting
for everything to end?

205
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,660
There's no way Lim Yoo-ri,
who was high, can remember

206
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,360
when exactly you
entered the house.

207
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,730
The fact whether you were there or not

208
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,560
at the time of
Jung Mi-yeon's death

209
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,830
will determine
if you'll be charged for murder.

210
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,200
What time is it?

211
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,900
You can't investigate a suspect
without his consent after 10PM, right?

212
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,260
- Sit.
- I don't consent.

213
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,530
(Wonyoung-dong
Murder Suspect Arrested)

214
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,730
The police arrested Mr. Kim,
(Wonyoung-dong
Murder Suspect Arrested)

215
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,600
a man in his 30s, at 6:40PM yesterday

216
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,330
as the prime suspect

217
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,230
in the Wonyoung-dong murder case.

218
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,800
They found the murder weapon
at his home

219
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,130
and it is now being investigated
by National Forensics.

220
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,960
Mr. Kim already testified that

221
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,030
he killed her for money.

222
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,730
As soon as the
investigation is over,

223
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,660
they will request
for an arrest warrant

224
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,900
by tomorrow morning
at the earliest

225
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,060
for the charge of murder.

226
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,960
It was the role of dash
cam footages this time

227
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,760
that helped solve this case.

228
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,930
They were able to specify Mr. Kim
as the suspect

229
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,530
by analyzing footages
from nearby CCTVs

230
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,660
and dash cams

231
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,630
and urgently arrested

232
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,230
him last night,

233
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,300
speeding up the investigation.

234
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,760
Oh, you were watching the news.

235
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,000
You must be so proud.

236
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,860
Your boyfriend is a detective
in the police station…

237
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,360
Damn, what's going on
with her again?

238
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,360
Although there are gaps
in Lim Yoo-ri's memory,

239
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,430
her testimony has been consistent.

240
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,560
Both Kim Moo-young
and Lim Yoo-ri's statements

241
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,730
correspond with each others.

242
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
We found the same video
on Jung Mi-yeon's cell phone

243
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,000
and it is true that Jung Mi-yeon

244
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,200
sent the video
to Lim Yoo-ri several times.

245
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,330
According to the footage
we've just secured,

246
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,600
it is highly likely

247
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,130
that Kim Moo-young
arrived at the site

248
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,430
after 3AM just like he said.

249
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,060
And right before he arrived,

250
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,800
he used his credit
card to pay $1.50

251
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,860
in a nearby convenience
store at 2:39AM.

252
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,430
$1.50?

253
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,760
Yes.

254
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,660
He charged his phone
and got a yakult.

255
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,430
A yakult?

256
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,330
Yes, but we haven't confirmed
whether he stayed in the store

257
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,830
while his phone was being charged.

258
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,260
Under these circumstances,

259
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,760
it seems like Lim Yoo-ri,
who was high,

260
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,260
hid in Jung Mi-yeon's
house and killed her,

261
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,960
while Kim Moo-young arrived after

262
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,860
and cleaned up the site.

263
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,200
What about the possibility
of an accomplice?

264
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,260
What do I have to say?

265
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,700
We're still investigating on
the possibility of an accomplice?

266
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,530
If it turns out that
Kim Moo-young simply got rid of evidence,

267
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,530
it means we all got it
totally wrong.

268
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,200
What's their relationship?

269
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,560
- Did they date?
- No.

270
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,930
It doesn't seem like it.

271
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,530
They both denied that.

272
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,660
By looking at their call records,

273
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,530
we didn't find any trace of them
conspiring to

Oh, you saw the news?

That's right. He's Kim Moo-young.

290
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,800

that he killed her?

Yes.

00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,330
(Jin-kang)

331
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,400
Damn, this is driving me crazy.

332
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,830
It's Jang Se-ran!

333
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,800
Since Director Jang died,

334
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,060
his shares must've
gone over to her.

335
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,900
She's his older sister.

336
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,700
- She was older than him.
- Is that so?

337
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,330
Jang Se-ran is older
than Jang Woo-sang.

338
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,560
- Ah.
- She came back to Korea after her divorce,

339
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,730
and they were fighting over
management rights

340
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,230
and she won this way in the end.

341
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,900
Would she consider this a win

342
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,330
even though her brother's dead?

343
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,530
Who knows? She's totally
different from us.

344
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Yeah, you're right.

345
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,560
The bank made a call
about the check.

346
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,860
The check?

347
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,560
Yes, about the check
we gave Kim Moo-young.

348
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,200
Why? Is there a problem?

349
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,900
No, ma'am.

350
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,060
I think he anonymously
sent the money

351
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,530
to an orphanage.

352
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
The amount was too large,
so the orphanage

353
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,900
- requested it through the bank.
- He gave $1M

354
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,960
- to an orphanage?
- That's right.

355
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
It's Jamyung Orphanage located
in Haesan.

356
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,360
He grew up there until he was 15.

357
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,700
Really?

358
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
What is he doing these days?

359
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,500
(Kim Moo-young's Call History
Frequent Contacts List)

360
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,030
You know this number, right?

361
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,400
We met before

362
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,260
in front of Jin-kang's place.

363
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,930
- I should go.
- Alright.

364
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,260
Excuse me.
I have to pull out my car.

365
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,330
Now I know why Jin-kang was…

367
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,900
so embarrassed back then.

368
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,500
I see Kim Moo-young as

369
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,700
someone who embarrasses Jin-kang…

370
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
What? So you mean Lim Yoo-ri

371
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,930
tried to kill Jin-kang?

372
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,900
Puts her in danger,

373
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,160
makes her cry,

374
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,300
or

375
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,660
makes her become a testifier
in a murder case.

376
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,600
You don't deserve her.

377
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,000
If you have a bit
of sincerity left for her,

378
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,530
don't contact Jin-kang anymore.

379
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,700
When we were at Arts,

380
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,900
did you hear that Jang Se-ran
is opening a pub in Sungsoo-dong?

381
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,660
- Yes, Angel's Tear.
- Yes, Angel's Tear.

382
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,630
Yes, Angel's Tear.

383
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,400
It's going to be the biggest
pub and brewery in Korea.

384
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,030
What do you think we should do?

385
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,530
- Way to go!
- We must get a deal!

386
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,060
Yes, I love it.

387
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,200
- Thanks!
- Come on.

388
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,360
Ma'am. Jin-kang is going to drink
herself to death today!

389
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,800
- Really?
- Let's go.

390
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,530
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

391
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,400
It must be because
of her boyfriend.

392
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,660
- My boyfriend?
- It's alright.

393
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,800
Frankly speaking, when my boyfriend
gives me a headache,

394
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,130
I can't help but drink.

395
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,030
It's not because of my boyfriend.

396
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,260
Why? Is your twinkling Cho-rong

397
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,100
being sensitive

398
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,530
because his work isn't going well?

399
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,330
That's not true!
I won't tell you guys.

400
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,000
What? It's okay for it to be true.

401
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,660
It's not fun

402
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,400
when a man is too easy-going.

403
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,700
Girls like her tend to get married
to the most easy-going guy.

404
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,360
What kind of man is
an easy-going guy?

405
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,030
Well, that's my expertise.

406
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,900
Listen up.

407
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,760
An easy-going,
secure man is someone

408
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,600
who earns money diligently,

409
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,860
doesn't live up to his looks,

410
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,800
and is as dull as
you want him to be.

411
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,300
- Dull guy.
- What?

412
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,300
You mean an ugly guy!

413
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,300
Handsome guys know
they're handsome.

414
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,160
It's better to be ugly.

415
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,260
So the worst guy is

416
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,960
someone who's
penniless, good-looking

417
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,330
and complicated?

418
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,000
There's someone like him
in my family.

419
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,400
If you ever meet a guy like that,

420
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,660
I'm telling you, you must run.

421
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,730
Come on!

422
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,130
You married him
because you loved him!

423
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,800
That's why I'm
qualified to tell you.

424
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,330
Do you think people take
the wrong path

425
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,200
because they don't
know it's wrong?

426
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,130
No, it's just that they
can't return

427
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,400
once it's too late.

428
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,960
There's a time for everything.

429
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,000
Run back when

430
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,830
you still can

431
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,000
come back, and you'll survive.

432
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,230
Wow, I'm confident!

433
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,400
I'm a fast runner!

434
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,800
Gosh, just drink.

435
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,760
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

436
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,000
It's so sweet.

437
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,930
- Bottoms up.
- Why are you home so late?

438
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,360
My brother!

439
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,100
- My dear brother!
- Gosh, smell!

440
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,100
- How much did you drink?
- You drink more than me.

441
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,360
What?

442
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,830
What did you just say?
Hey, no way!

443
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,160
Jin-kang! Jin-kang! Stand up!

444
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,960
- Do fall!
- Don't fall!

445
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,760
What did you eat? You're so heavy!

446
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,200
- Hey, legs!
- I'm alive!

447
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,960
Don't fall!

448
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,330
- Jin-kook.
- What?

449
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,860
You know I always got first place
in sporting events, right?

450
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,000
Whenever I entered races,

451
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,460
I'd get a first place stamp
on my arm, yeah?

452
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,260
Is that the only thing
you're proud of?

453
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,800
That was when you were
in grade school!

454
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,100
Go to bed now.

455
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,100
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

456
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,030
Let me sleep, please…

457
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,530
Jin-kang…

458
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,000
Do you think people take
the wrong path

459
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,860
because they don't
know it's wrong?

460
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,360
There's a time for everything.

(Wonyoung Police Station)
While you still can,

463
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,200
you must run hard

464
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,800
and come back to survive.

465
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,930

Tell me.

469
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,760
Do you really think

470
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,600
I have no heart?

471
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,430

You're riding a bike?

Yes.

477
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,660
I'm coming back from a sauna.

478
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,730
- I see.
- Should I call Sergeant Yoo for you?

479

No, that's okay.

480
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,500
I was just exercising.
Because it's Saturday and all.

Oh yeah.

482

Did you enjoy your
dinner that night?

00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,600
I'm sorry I couldn't join you.

That's totally fine.

00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,730
You said you have a list
of 100 things you want to do.

493
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,430
Let's do the best one

494
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,160
on your list.

495
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,300
Then, shall we go to the beach?

496
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,560
Yes, I love the beach.

497
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,760
Hi.

498
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,330
Sergeant Yoo.

499
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,060
Would you like to attend
the interrogation for Yoo-ri's warrant?

500
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,260
Yeah, sure.

501
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,800
Where are you going?
She's in the car.

502
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,330
What about Kim Moo-young?

503
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,700
The warrant for him
has been dismissed.

504
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,400
- Dismissed?
- Yes.

505
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,730
We don't know about the murder,

506
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,160
but it's obvious he got rid of
evidence and hid the suspect.

507
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,230
Without any interrogation?

508
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,330
I don't know,
the prosecutor let him go.

509
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,300
You know what they always say.

510
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,330
Investigations should be conducted
without detaining the suspect.

511
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,230
So?

512
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,460
So, he's out.

513
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,330
Let's get going.

514
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,260
Jeez…

515
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,700
Why are you here?

516
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,260
Hey.

517
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,260
Haven't you seen my cat?

518
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,300
I wasn't home for 2 days,
and I can't find the cat.

519
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,430
She must've run away.

520
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,500
Why are you looking
for your cat here?

521
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,630
You're so cold.

522
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,760
Try search the playground.

523
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,460
There should be many cats there.

524
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,030
Didn't you get a call?

525
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,730
From the police?

526
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,760
Why would I?

527
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,830
Nevermind.

528
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,360
I was arrested by the police.

529
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,400
I know.

530
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,800
They let me go but
there'll be more interviews.

531
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,230
I must attend the trial too.

532
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,000
I didn't kill her.

533
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,000
I know. I saw the news.

534
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,460
Can I go now?

535
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,460
I'm hungry.

536
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,460
Are you scared of me?

537
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,330
Yes.

538
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,460
You're scared

539
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,600
of me?

540
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,400
I am.

541
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,699
I'm scared of you.

542
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,929
Because I was arrested?

543
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,659
Right.

544
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,900
And because I don't know you.

545
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,199
You can ask me.

546
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,429
Whatever you

547
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,900
want to know.

548
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,800
I don't want to know.

549
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,699
I don't believe you.

550
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,500
So Moo-young was released?

551
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,930
Yeah.

552
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,460
But that doesn't change anything.

553
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,030
Even if he's not locked up,
he must still get interviewed.

554
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,630
I know he's been kind to you.

555
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,030
That's why you don't want to say

556
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,430
anything that would
negatively affect him.

557
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,830
But you still must.

558
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,400
Whether he told you the passcode

559
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,300
to Jung Mi-yeon's house,

560
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,300
or something like that.

561
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,860
In exchange,

562
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,460
I have a favor.

563
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,660
Kim Moo-young.

564
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,530
Kim Moo-young.

565
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,000
He was sitting there for 20 mins
until it was all charged.

566
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,560
The part-timer that day
clearly remembers it.

567
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
- Hey.
- When he asked her to charge his phone…

568
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,360
- He was all wet.
- Ah, thanks.

569
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,960
So she brought him a towel.

570
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,700
He's looked through
the window for 20 minutes.

571
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,360
She was wondering if he was
waiting for someone.

572
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,600
It's me.

573
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,860
Why did you call me here?

574
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,130
I don't know if I should call this banal
or refreshing.

575
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,930
It's for you.

576
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,030
It's banal.

577
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,160
I've been thinking about

578
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,200
what you could've been thinking
about sitting here

579
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,200
while getting your phone charged
for 20 minutes.

580
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,000
And then?

581
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,030
It was terrifying.

582
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,600
I don't think I thought
about much.

583
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,430
If charging your phone
was your sole reason,

584
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,600
5 minutes would've been enough

585
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,530
or you could've borrowed
the part-timer's phone.

586
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,460
Oh, yeah.

587
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,030
You could deceive the judges

588
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,930
by telling them you couldn't report
Yoo-ri because you pity her,

589
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,960
so you risked yourself

590
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,930
to help her.

591
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,700
But you know very well

592
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,300
why you did that.

593
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,160
Jin-kook.

594
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,700
Do you always know the reason why

595
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,060
you do something when you do it?

596
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,360
For me, I don't. Not always.

597
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,460
3 times 5 is?

598
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,830
15.

599
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,360
3515.

600
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:05,100
At least I know the reason
why when I do something special.

601
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,660
Like when you tell

602
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,760
Jung Mi-yeon's house passcode

603
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,600
to Lim Yoo-ri who
tends to cause trouble

604
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,300
when she's high.

605
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,100
3 times 5 is?

606
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,200
15.

607
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,100
Your friend Mi-yeon is funny.

608
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,130
Her house passcode is
3 times 5, 15.

609
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,800
3515.

610
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,100
You were the devil

611
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,260
at least for those 20 minutes

612
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,960
you were sitting down here.

613
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,730
Why did you stop walking

614
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,400
and decide to watch

615
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,900
what happened to Jung Mi-yeon?

616
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,030
What a tramp.

617
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,660
You think I'm a beggar?

618
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,460
Give it to her.
You shouldn't come.

619
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,330
Ah, that's a fake.

620
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:05,230
She's pretty.

621
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,160
Did you say she's pretty?

622
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,960
That tramp?

623
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,360
You know her?

624
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,130
Well.

625
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,560
She's my punching bag.

626
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,400
When did this happen to you?

627
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,160
This must've hurt.

628
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,930
What are you doing?

629
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,260
I should leave
since I'm done watching it.

630
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,030
Hey!

631
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,960
Hey, where are you going?

632
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,060
I'm Jang Se-ran.

633
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,700
Woo-sang's sister.

634
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,130
You shouldn't come here
as you please.

635
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,960
I lost my only brother

636
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,360
because of you.

637
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,600
If you're sorry, come look for me.

638
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,930
There's something
I'd like to discuss.

639
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,730
I heard from Jin-kook.

640
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,600
But why did you ask to see me?

641
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,830
Jin-kook said

642
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:18,430
People…

643
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,800
can always start over.

644
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,200
It might sound cliche,
but it's true.

645
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,360
I want to apologize
before I go to jail.

646
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,660
Apologize?

647
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,460
To me?

648
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,100
I tried to hit you

649
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,030
with my car.

650
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,860
Ah, it's okay.

651
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:48,060
You didn't do it on purpose.

652
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,300
I did it on purpose.

653
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,030
I'm sorry?

654
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,960
I was high

655
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:59,100
but it's the same.
I did it on purpose.

656
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:02,800
Why?

657
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,630
I was so jealous.

658
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,800
I don't know.
I've never had a mom.

659
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,500
What about a dad?

660
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,760
I don't have one.

661
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:18,800
Then, who raised you?

662
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,430
The orphanage.

663
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,500
He never told me.

664
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,360
Because he never talks
about himself.

665
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:32,200
Especially about

666
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,130
his childhood.

667
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,130
I'm back.

668
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,030
Big news!

669
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,330
You know Angel's Tear,
Jang Se-ran's pub in Sungsoo-dong?

670
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,730
Kim Moo-young will be running it!

671
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,330
Angel's Tear?

672
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,900
Well, it's just a rumor
at the moment.

673
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,360
No, it's almost a fact
at this point!

674
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:58,260
I talked to Yoo-jin on the phone
for the sample

675
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:00,760
and she heard

676
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:04,030
Jang Se-ran talking to
President Jung about Kim Moo-young.

677
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,000
Isn't it awesome?

678
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,860
It really is.

679
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,800
Yeah, it's insane.

680
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,630
Honey,

681
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,230
It's not time for you
to zone out.

682
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,230
- Pardon me?
- You said you'd get the deal

683
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,160
no matter what!

684
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,460
This is totally great news for us!

685
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,860
You and Moo-young are close!

686
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:35,060
Right,
you live in the same neighborhood!

687
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,000
Gosh, look at me.

688
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,900
I left my phone!

689
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,760
- What's this?
- Oh my gosh!

690
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,730
You said you had
a lot of work left!

691
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,700
Was this it?

696
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,400
People might think
I'm an evil boss.

697
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,600
- Alright.
- Let's go.

698
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:19,460
Do you have a cat?

699
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,530
No, I just drew it for fun.

700
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,000
- I'll get these.
- Okay.

701
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,060
This too.

702
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,200
What do you want to eat later?

703
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,030
We're going to the ocean…

704
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,300
Do you like gizzard shad?

705
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,100
Yes!

If you look from here,
the kitchen will be on the left.

710
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,230
And this will be red.

I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

I was trying to get a hot
and freshly-cooked…

Shall we go to the beach
another time?

716
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,700
I'll call you.

717
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,560
I'm sorry.

718
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,060
I really didn't…

719
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,100
want to hear that.

720
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,260
I'm sorry, Cho-rong.

721
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,900
I know

722
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:02,030
I've done you wrong.

723
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:09,160
I'm so sorry.

724
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,000
Jin-kang.

725
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,260
You don't have to date me.

726
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,100
Jin-kang.
You don't need to date me,

727
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,700
but you can't date him either.

728
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:32,430
You said you're silly.

729
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,600
You cry when people cry

730
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,200
and you smile when others smile.

731
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,460
Someone like you

732
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,330
shouldn't meet someone like him.

733
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,630
You mustn't see him…

734
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,330
because it's you.

735

What's with the long face?

737
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,560
What about my face?

738
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,660
Why did you go through
my trash can?

739
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,660
What is this?

740
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,560
And what's with your face?

741
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:55,200
It's just a scribble.

742
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,330
Why is his face on your scribble?
Why?

743
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,130
Jin-kook,
I'll take care of my stuff.

744

No, you don't.

745
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,030
Jin-kook.

746
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,530
Is this how you take care
of your stuff?

747

It's listed by the order of people
who contacted him most frequently.

750
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:28,560
Cho-rong dealt with it beforehand.

751
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,900
Otherwise,
you would've been called

752
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,860
to the station as a testifier!

753
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:39,430
- So?
- So?

754
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,160
What's wrong with
being a testifier?

755
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,360
I just need to go and
say what I know.

756
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:45,500
We're talking about a murder case.

757
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,500
You don't even have an idea
of what we're dealing with here.

758
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,000
He didn't do it.

759
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,060
Does that solve everything?

760
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:53,560
Yeah?

761
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,030
If it hadn't been him,

762
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,660
you wouldn't have known
any of this from the first!

763
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:59,560
This is something different
from the world you live in!

764
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:01,800
What do you mean
a different world?

765
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,160
Was he born in another world

766
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,060
different from me?

767
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:06,630
Yes!

768
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,000
That's absurd!

769
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,160
You said
people can start over again.

770
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:13,160
You said it might sound cliche,
but it's true.

771
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:15,730
You said that to Yoo-ri!

772
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:18,060
Other people can start over again,

773
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,660
- Why can't he?
- No.

774
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:22,030
- He can't.
- Why not?

775
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,030
Why can't he?

776
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,230
Because he's not a human.

777
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,030
He can't be punished with
anything in the world.

778
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,630
If you're a human, you should be
sorry when you do wrong, you should

779
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,660
be afraid of death,
and you should feel pain when you get hit!

780
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,730
He also feels pain if he gets hurt.

781
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,760
He must be enjoying the pain.

782
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,130
He'll remember that

783
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,360
and he'll be excited to repay
for it twice or thrice!

784
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,030
He is…

785
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,000
the devil!

786
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:55,200
Jin-kook!

787
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,900
Jin-kang.

788
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:01,200
Think about Seung-ah.

789
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,730
Look what happened to Seung-ah
after she got involved with him.

790
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,130
Gosh, Jin-kook.
Please don't say that.

791
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:44,560
So you're not asking
me till the end?

792
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,760
Why me?

793
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:52,030
Why me?

794
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:58,230
At least you showed some respect.

795
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,030
You asked even though
you weren't curious.

796
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:06,330
You don't have a reason anyway.

797
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,860
It's up to you.

798
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:10,330
Right.

799
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,530
It's up to me.

800
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,730
I decide everything

801
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,130
and everything will turn out
as I plan.

802
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,060
So think carefully about my offer.

803
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,000
You're such a jerk, aren't you?

804
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,100
Right?

805
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,600
Everyone says you're a jerk.

806
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,730
Everyone else can change

807
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,530
but not you.

808
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,200
They say bad things will happen
if I stay with you.

809
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,130
So they say I shouldn't
get involved with you.

810
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,200
But… why?

811
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:32,130
But why do I keep?

812
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,360
Why?

813
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,860
Are you really that
kind of person?

814
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,600
I don't like you being a jerk.

815
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:56,160
I'm scared because it seems
like you're going the wrong way.

816
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,400
Are you going to take the job?

817
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,800
I won't do it
if you tell me not to.

818
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,830
Then don't.

819
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,860
Promise me you'll
become a good man.

820
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,800
Then teach me.

(Hundred Million Stars From The Sky)

823
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,630
- Who is it?
- A girl I'd like to look good for.

824
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,760
What is being a nice person?

825
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:11,330
What kind of person
is a good person?

826
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,400
Did you say
you wouldn't take the job?

827
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,130
- What do you think I did?
- You turned her down.

828
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,860
Why do you hate it so much
that I work there?

829
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:18,560
They're people who can do
whatever they want.

830
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:20,130
You said a detective

831
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,230
once came to look for a boy
who looks similar to me?

832
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,960
I thought he was my father.

833
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:27,030
If Kim Moo-young is really the kid

834
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,230
you're looking for,

835
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,230
he shouldn't be seeing Jin-kang.

836
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,630
Don't meet my sister.

837
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,630
I'm not asking you for a favor.
This is a warning.
