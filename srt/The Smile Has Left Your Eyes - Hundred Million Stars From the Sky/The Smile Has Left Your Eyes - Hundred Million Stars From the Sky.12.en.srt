Give it back!

8
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,900
Right now!

Excuse me,

13
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,900
did a guy come here
to buy a corkscrew?

14
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,400
Oh, that young man

15
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,760
left right after
I said we didn't have any.

16
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,930
Did a guy come here
to buy a corkscrew?

17
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,529
He bought it and left earlier.

18
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,700
When? How long has it been?

19
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,300
It's been around 50 minutes.

20
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,100
Excuse me?

21
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,560
Excuse me.

22
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,300
Hey, are you alright?

23
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,330
Hey, oh my god.

24
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,760
Hello? Hey.

25
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,900
Hey…

26
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,830
- You're…
- Long time no see.

27
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,230
Moo-young.

28
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,860
Moo-young, wake up.

29
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,030
Oh no, Moo-young. Moo-young.

30
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,030
Hey, Moo-young. Hold on.

31
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,830
You're…

32
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,460
Moo-young, hold on a second.
Just hang on.

33
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,730
Moo-young.

34
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,800
- Yes, this is 911.
- Hello, 911?

35
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,400
- Hey.
- Please speak, sir.

36
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,000
Hello, please speak, sir.

37
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,030
Moo-young.

38
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,760
Miss, I think you should

39
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,630
go home first and wait.

40
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,630
So far, we didn't have a

among today's registered reports.

43
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,900
But I clearly heard a siren

44
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,600
near Wonyoung 1-dong.

45
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:48,700
Oh, that one?

46
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,659
It was a bit noisy earlier

47
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,030
because a drunk man assaulted

48
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,400
a taxi driver.

49
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,630
I see.

(Resignation Letter)

57
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,800
What the hell is this
so early in the morning?

58
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,700
What happened at Wonyoung
intersection last night,

59
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,760
I'm the one who did it.

60
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,730
The Wonyoung intersection case?

61
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,130
We already caught the culprit.

62
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,360
They arrested the culprit
on the scene.

63
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,260
I don't know

64
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,860
why people pick on
taxi drivers so much.

65
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,930
It's a different case.

66
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,830
Wonyoung intersection crossroad
at 9:30PM.

67
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,860
I stabbed a person with a knife.

68
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,930
A person?

69
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,900
Go over all the reports
we got yesterday.

70
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,360
There shouldn’t be anything.
I checked the daily report

71
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,500
when I got in,
but I found nothing peculiar.

72
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,460
I'll go check again, sir.

73
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,830
He stabbed a person?

74
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,030
Yes, I don't know
what the hell's going on.

75
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,130
Jae-min looked into it already

76
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,060
but there wasn't a report.

77
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,600
Where is Sergeant Yoo?

78
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,600
I don't know.
He's not in the office.

79
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,330
Should I go look into it?

80
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,060
No, let's hear what
Sergeant Yoo has to say first.

81
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,560
Okay.

82
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,030
What the hell is this about?

83
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,130
You stabbed a person?

84
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,530
Is that true?

85
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,100
Yes.

86
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,000
I stabbed him with a knife.

87
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,700
Sergeant Yoo!

88
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,200
Are you insane?

89
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,760
You're a police officer!
How could you…

90
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,200
How could you stab someone?

91
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,330
This was the only way.

92
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,930
What do you mean
that was the only way?

93
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,030
How is that even a solution?

94
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,600
Jesus Christ…

95
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,130
Seriously, how could you…

96
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
Do you even realize you're
not in your right mind?

97
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,930
Are you feeling sick?

98
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,500
I'm okay.

99
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,100
You keep sweating.

100
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,100
- Good morning!
- Ma'am.

101
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,660
- President.
- Yes, what is it?

102
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,060
I'm sorry but can I use
my half day today?

103
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,860
- Half-day off?
- She doesn't seem to be feeling well.

104
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,200
Is that so?

105
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,230
You should've stayed home.

106
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,930
We're done with urgent
matters already.

107
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,760
Go home and rest.

108
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,860
I'm sorry.

109
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,960
He's absent today and
didn’t give us any notice.

110
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,200
If he calls you, could you please tell
him to call us right away?

111
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,830
- I will.
- Thanks.

112
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,200
Tak, it's me, Jin-kang.

113
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,700
Hi, Jin-kang.

114
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,100
Kim Moo-young's disappeared.

115
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,830
Kim Moo-young?

116
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,260
He suddenly disappeared
last night.

117
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,360
I don't know what to do.

118
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,200
Goodbye, Ji-eun.
See you next week.

119
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,000
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

120
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,800
Goodbye, ma'am.

121
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,630
Thanks, Doctor.

122
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,530
(What happened?)

123
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,500
(Call me if you see this)

124
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,560
You must've been surprised.

125
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,360
But I haven't heard about

126
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,730
any particular cases yet.

127
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,100
I'll try looking into it.
Don't worry too much.

128
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,400
Are you okay?

129
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,730
Yes.

130
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,160
You scared the hell out of me.

131
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,060
Doctor, what time is it?

132
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,130
It's 10.

133
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,460
What the hell happened last night?

134
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,500
Is it PM?

135
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,830
Ah, 10PM…

136
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Hello?

137
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,630
Hey, it's me.

138
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,760
Hello?

139
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,560
What's wrong with you?

140
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,860
I'm sorry.
Were you worried about me?

141
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,460
I'm sorry.
I'm at a friend's place.

142
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,030
It's been so long since I saw him.

143
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,500
A friend's place?

144
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
You want me to believe that?

145
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,830
You even left your phone because
you stepped out for a corkscrew!

146
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,100
I know it sounds strange.

147
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,600
But it's really nothing.

148
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,060
I'll tell you everything later.

149
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,000
Tell me now.

150
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,930
What happened?

151
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,000
Did you get hurt again?

152
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,100
No, it's not like that.

153
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,330
I called you because I knew
you were going to be worrying.

154
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,800
Nothing dangerous happened,

155
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,900
so don't worry about it.

156
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,260
Why are you doing this?

157
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,760
What's going on with you?

158
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,630
Can't you tell me?

159
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,960
I know it's hard to understand.

160
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,000
But really, nothing happened.

161
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,860
I couldn't just say goodbye

162
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,060
because I ran into him
after such a long time.

163
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,300
This is too hard for me.

164
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,430
This is too much for me.

165
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,400
Jin-kang.

166
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
Yoo Jin-kang.

167
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Your clothes haven’t dried yet.
Lie back down.

168
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,800
It's been 20 years
since I last stitched someone.

169
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,400
A seam might open up
if you move like that. Lie down.

170
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,330
Now that you're at my place,
you must stay until I say so.

171
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,300
Otherwise, I'll have to call 911.

172
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,930
I know you're involved
in a criminal case.

173
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,560
If not for that,
I would've taken you to the hospital

174
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,500
no matter what you said.

175
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,330
All done.

176
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,630
You got stabbed with a knife.

177
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,230
Does this have something to do
with that case?

178
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,500
Yoo-ri and you. That case.

179
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,630
No, it's not like that.

180
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,400
Then?

181
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,400
I came here because
I didn't want to talk about it.

182
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,000
How did you hear about that case?

183
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,829
I met the detective in charge
when I went to visit Yoo-ri.

184
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,829
How did you two meet?

185
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,230
Well, it's all…

186
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,400
Thanks to you.

187
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,100
Which detective in charge?

188
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,800
Detective Yoo Jin-kook.

189
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,730
Ah…

190
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,300
What is it?
Anything to do with him?

191
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,030
Well, it's kind of…

192
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,700
It's kind of funny.

193
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,660
Do you personally know him?

194
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,360
A little?

195
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,760
He and I are…

196
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,600
We're neither enemies nor friends.

197
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,830
You're home.

198
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,660
Did he call?

199
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,330
Did he call you?

200
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,460
You know something?

201
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,930
Sit down.

202
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,830
You know something, don't you?

203
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,960
You know what happened to him.

204
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,530
He called me up

205
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,700
but wouldn't tell me
what happened.

206
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,200
I…

207
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,830
stabbed him with a knife.

208
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,930
What?

209
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,660
I stabbed him with a knife.

210
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,860
Jin-kook!

211
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,430
I don't regret it.

212
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,600
That was the only way.

213
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,260
You're insane!

214
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,700
How could you stab someone
with a knife?

215
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,830
I can stab him

216
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,230
or do worse,
so I'm telling you now…

217
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,200
Stop seeing him.

218
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,730
You're insane!

219
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,760
You're crazy!

220
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,860
You're my first priority.

221
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,660
Please don't say this was for me.

222
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,030
He got hurt by people like you!

223
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,830
Those kinds of people

224
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,000
who only think about their child

225
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,960
and don't care
about other children!

226
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,700
You know what it's like.

227
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,200
You can't do that.

228
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,000
Because you're my brother.

229
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,160
Jin-kook, I don't care about
other people

230
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,830
but you shouldn't have done it
because you're my brother!

231
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,860
Jin-kook, he's just a poor boy.

232
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,230
He had a tougher life than I did.

233
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,760
Even without you hurting him,
he's already full of scars.

234
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,760
Take a shower and go to bed.

235
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,460
(Tak So-jung)

236
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:35,500
(Tak So-jung)

237
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
I'm at Manna Food Cart.
(Tak So-jung)

238
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:37,560
(Tak So-jung)

239
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,060
I'll go to your house
if you don't show up.
(Tak So-jung)

240
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,660
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.

241
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,530
Jin-kang called me this afternoon.

242
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,330
I just couldn't tell her…

243
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,330
I stuttered a lot and pretended
I didn't know anything.

244
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,060
Did you look into
what happened to him after?

245
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,930
He took a cab.

246
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,300
Are you even curious?
Are you even worried about him?

247
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,660
No.

248
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,130
It doesn't make sense if I am
after all that I did.

249
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,560
This isn't like you.

250
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,200
I went to the control room

251
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,200
and watched the footage.

252
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,200
You can't even see a
knife or anything.

253
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,800
He just looked drunk
and collapsed on the road.

254
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,100
After a while, he took a cab.

255
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,800
I didn't check
where he headed for.

256
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,000
Do you want me to check?

257
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,230
He already called Jin-kang.

258
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,460
What did he tell her?

259
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,330
I didn't ask.

260
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,660
I just heard he called her.

261
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,660
No way…

262
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,300
You didn't tell Jin-kang, did you?

263
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,800
You told her?

264
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,360
That you stabbed him with a knife?

265
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,130
Yes.

266
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,560
Oh no…

267
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,330
Hey, Sergeant Yoo!

268
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,860
You're…

269
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,800
You're really…

270
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,900
Tell me now. What happened?

271
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,200
Did you get hurt again?

272
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,230
No, it's not that.

273
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,600
I…

274
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,760
stabbed him with a knife.

275
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,660
Nothing dangerous happened,

276
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,600
so don't worry about it.

277
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,000
He and I are…

278
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,630
Neither enemies nor friends.

279
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:25,800
(Haesan Hospital)

280
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,630
I didn't know
(Haesan Hospital)

281
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,860
you also knew
he grew up in Haesan…

282
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,600
No, I just happened to

283
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,730
find out that
his hometown is Haesan.

284
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,560
Yoo Jin-kook. Yoo Jin-kook.

285
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,530
Hello?

286
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,500
Hello?

287
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:13,230
I'm sorry for calling you
this late.

288
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,030
I got a call
from this number earlier.

289
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,100
- Is there...
- Are you looking for Moo-young?

290
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,630
Ah, that's right.

291
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,200
He's sleeping now.

292
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,830
Is this a hospital?

293
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,900
It's not a standard hospital,
but I am a doctor.

294
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,900
I see.

295
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,760
I'm Yoo Jin-kang,
a friend of Moo-young's.

296
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,630
I heard he got badly hurt,

297
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,660
so I'm worried if he's alright.

298
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,160
Yes, he got hurt but
he's not in critical condition.

299
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,600
We must keep an eye on him
until it heals

300
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,200
but it's not serious.
So don't be too worried.

301
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,900
I see.

302
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,730
Thanks. Thank you so much.

303
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,330
I'll tell Moo-young to call you

304
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,500
when he wakes up tomorrow morning.

305
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,360
Your name is Yoo Jin…

306
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,630
No, nevermind.

307
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,900
I'm sorry

308
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,130
but please don't tell
him I called.

309
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,730
Alright, I won't.

310
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,960
Thanks. Good night.

311
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,700
Yoo Jin-kang.

312
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,500
Yoo Jin-kook.

313
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,230
I've been thinking about it a lot.

314
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,860
You should make up your mind
between the two.

315
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,830
What?

316
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,860
You said

317
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,660
ever since you met him,

318
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,230
you felt like something has
been choking you.

319
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,160
Right, you've become strange
ever since he showed up.

320
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,960
I was so worried
something might happen

321
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,330
and look what finally happened.

322
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,560
A detective stabbing a person?

323
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,600
This can't get any worse.

324
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,460
Go confirm if Kim Moo-young

325
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,200
is the kid you're looking for

326
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,700
or just forget it if you can't.

327
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,800
You need to make a decision.

328
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,530
How can I just forget it?

329
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,200
How?

330
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,200
You said Kim Moo-young is the boy
in chapter 2?

331
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,060
(Together With Trauma)
You said Kim Moo-young is the boy
in chapter 2?

332
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,730
Do you know what the title
of chapter 2 is?

333
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,260
(Chapter 2
A Boy Who Lost His Memories)
Do you know what the title

(Chapter 2
A Boy Who Lost His Memories)

336
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,730
A boy who lost his memories?

337
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
That's right.

338
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,830
This means Kim Moo-young can't
remember his childhood.

339
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,200
At some point,
you started believing that

340
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,930
Kim Moo-young is the kid
you were looking for, right?

341
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,860
But nothing's been confirmed.

342
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,500
It's all circumstantial.

343
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,930
And even if
Kim Moo-young is the boy,

344
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,160
he can't remember anything.

345
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,830
You just need to forget
and put this behind you.

346
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm sure Jin-kang won't be able to meet
Kim Moo-young anymore.

347
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,200
Everything's fine, then.

348

It's just you who needs
to move on.

349

00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,630
Moo-young?

355
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,460
Moo-young.

356
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,630
What were you dreaming about?

357
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,700
Your clothes are there.

358
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,300
I'll be back after an hour.

359

Doctor.

360
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,530
Do you know anyone
at Haesan Hospital?

361
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,130
Haesan Hospital?

362
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,860
Yes, Myungsung University
Haesan Hospital.

363
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,060
Since you were
at Myungsung University before,

364
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,600
I bet you would
know someone there.

365
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,800
I'm sure there would be.
But why?

366
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,460
I think I was there.

367
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,960
Is that so?

368
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,260
Do you remember something?

369
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,830
I don't know.

370
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,300
Someone stopped me
in front of the hospital.

371
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,700
I'll look into if any of my colleagues
are in Haesan.

372
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,760
Are you really quitting?

373
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,930
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

374
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:00,700
You haven't changed at all.

375
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,400
There was no such report.

376
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,130
Fine.

377
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,000
Let's say you went on a rampage

378
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,460
and stabbed someone.

379
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,200
That's why

380
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,800
you're quitting
because you feel guilty.

381
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,700
That's your business.

382

You know things are
tense right now

384
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,060
because of Jung Mi-yeon's case
and disciplinary actions.

385
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,230
What do you think you're doing?

386
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,500
Frankly speaking,

387
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,700
you should be apologetic to me

388
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,230
about what happened before.

389
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,460

- If you're sorry,

390
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,830
keep quiet and do nothing.

Do you think

392
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:00,460
I'm stopping you
because I like you?

393
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,400
If you want to quit,

394
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,760
do it after you transfer
to another team!

395
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,360
Stop causing trouble for me!

396
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,330
You got that?

397
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,700
I can stab him

398
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,100
or do worse,
so I'm telling you now…

399
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,100
Stop seeing him.

400
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,330
Where's the picture?

401
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,430
Where's the picture?

402
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,030
Did you put it away because
you don't like Jin-kook?

403
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,000
I put it away because of you.

404
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,960
I put it here.

405
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,860
Well done.

406
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,460

Whether it was luck or not,
you lost your memory

and I was aware of that.

I released the fish I caught
and turned around

to meet the kid
who was looking at me.

Meet was the perfect word
to describe it.

I recognized you right away
even though it had been 3 years.

439

Because it was hard for me
to forget your eyes.

Right, I couldn't
believe it really was you

442

No. 3 weeks after
your first treatment,

I saw you walking
out of the hospital

449
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,660
when your burn wasn't
fully healed.

stop a kid who lost his memories

Have you been well?

499
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,000
Kitty!

500
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,700
Kitty…

501
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,430
Kitty!

502
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,360
I got you!

503
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,100
Where have you been?

504
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,200
Your brother was worried sick
about you.

505
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,530
So it really is the kitty.

506
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,460
Where did you go?

507
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,860
Did you have fun outside?

508
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,260
It's okay.

509
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:18,260
You can leave whenever you want.

510
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,400
And you can come back whenever.

511
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,760
All done.

512
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,630
You can go now.

513
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,400
Where?

514
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,600
Where should I go?

515
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,560
You promised you'd stop me.

516
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,300
You promised you'd stop me
if I tried to leave again.

517
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,260
I'm not going anywhere.

518
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,000
I can't.

519
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,130
It's useless even if I leave.

520
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,460
Because I'll come back anyway.

521
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,330
I thought you'd break up with me.

522
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,930
I told Jin-kook
I'd break up with you.

523
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,330
That I wouldn't see you anymore.

524
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,160
I lied to him.

525
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,100
If I could do that,

526
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,960
I would've broken up
with you for real…

527
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,630
But that's useless.

528
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,500
If you don't say you hate me,
I won't go anywhere.

529
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,030
Don't go even if I say I hate you.

530
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:31,030
Will you say that?

531
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,260
I mean don't leave no matter what.

532
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,760
Even if I say I hate you,
it's 100% a lie.

533
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,400
Why would you lie then?

534
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,330
I won't.

535
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,060
Don't do it.

536
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,100
I won't.

537
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,100
I said don't.

538
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,360
I won't. Definitely not.

539
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,730
But…

540
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,760
We really should meet secretly
from now on.

541
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,200
I can't watch Jin-kook
fall apart anymore.

542
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,660
I'm really confident.

543
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,000
At secretly dating you.

544
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,760
Me too!

545
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,030
(Looking for a missing kid)

546
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,530
This is…
(Looking for a missing kid)

547
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,400
I'm looking for that kid.

548
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,230
Yoo Jin-kook.

549
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,400
(Police officer Yoo Jin-kook)
Yoo Jin-kook.

550
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,460
I knew your name sounded familiar.

551
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:00,000
You're the police officer
from back then.

552
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,760
Pardon me?

553
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:22,800
Have you seen a boy
about this tall

554
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,800
with a burn scar
on his right shoulder?

555
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,860
No.

556
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,460
Autumn of 1993,

557
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,830
I was at Haesan Hospital too.

558
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,960
I was a first year intern in the ER.

559
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,630
Are you going to take me home?

560
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,730
You said you were confident at
secretly dating me.

561
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,230
Ah, right.

562
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,030
I'll text you.

563
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,700
Okay.

564
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,700
I'm going to take a break
from work for a while.

565
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,730
Are you quitting?

566
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,060
Yes.

567
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,700
I still have a few more interviews

568
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,060
and there's something
I want to look into.

569
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,930
I think the doctor knows
about me.

570
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,230
About you?

571
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,460
About my past.

572
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,530
But he wouldn't tell me.

573
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,160
Why not?

574
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,060
I don't know.

575
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,530
I guess…

576
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,000
My past isn't that amazing.

577
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,730
What do you mean by…

578
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,530
What if…

579
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:49,330
it's so bad

580
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,600
it's better for me not to know?

581
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,760
So bad

582
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:00,660
it's better

583
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,100
if you don't know…

584
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,730
No, don't think about it.

585
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,430
Don't worry. Don't worry.

586
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,460
This is my business.

587
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,530
You shouldn't worry.

588
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,430
If it's so bad

589
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,900
it's better if you
don’t know,

590
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,360
I don't want you to know about it.

591
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:47,160
Do as you please.

592
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,530
There may be a part of me
that I don't even know.

593
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,560
That's okay.

594
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:59,900
Because I'll keep a tight
hold of your heart.

595
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,200
But promise me,

596
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,400
you'll never disappear
without telling me,

597
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,630
you'll always have your cell phone,

598
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,860
and you'll never get hurt.

599
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,730
I promise you.

600
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,000
I'm late.

601
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,500
I should get home before Jin-kook!

602
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,860
Bye!

603
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:33,530
Hey. You're late.

604
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,830
What are you doing
in the middle of the night?

605
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,930
I'm cleaning the house
nice and tidy.

606
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,500
Have some bread if you're hungry.

607
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,960
Thanks.

608
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,960
I can't stand it. I'm so curious.

609
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,160
What is that incredible past

610
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:46,060
of mine you know?

611
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:49,100
Shall we have a cup of tea first?

612
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,900
My father was killed, wasn't he?

613
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,560
- Killed?
- That's right.

614
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,800
- With a gun.
- A gun?

615
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,900
It's nothing like that.
Life's not a movie.

616
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,800
I've been dreaming the same dream

617
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,730
from some point.

618
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:08,430
A dream of my father
getting killed by a gun.

619
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,460
I thought it was my past.

620
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:17,700
Thanks to you, I'm ready.

621
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,360
So you can tell me now.

622
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,960
My dad was murdered, right?

623
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,930
No, your father…

624
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,800
killed himself.

625
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:38,430
Killed himself?

626
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,960
To be precise,
he fell and died in the mountains

627
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,930
but people said it was suicide.

628
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,500
Why did he commit suicide?

629
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:54,030
I don't know.

630
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,160
Do you think you can stop here
if you were me?

631
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,500
I don't do things halfway.

632
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:13,300
Suicide…

633
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,900
All I know is…

634
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,800
There was no gun related
to the case.

635
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,000
I don't know the details.

636
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,300
I just heard what
the nurses whispered.

637
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,300
That you were the son of
a man who committed suicide

638
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:33,130
in Mortar of Mountain Geumah.

639
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,830
(Mortar of Mountain Geumah)

640
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:55,430
You woke up? Are you going to hand
in your resignation letter today?

641
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:59,600
(Yoo Jin-kang)

642
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,960
Yeah, I'm on my way home
after seeing the doctor.

643
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:21,030
I have to return some
things to the company.

644
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,300
Already?

645
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,800
- Yeah.
- I'm heading out first!

646
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,230
I can't drive you today
because there's traffic.

647
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,300
It's okay. I can go in late today.

648
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,230
- Have a good day.
- You too.

649
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,800
Alright.

650
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,430
(You went to see him already?
What did he say?)

651
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,760
You went to see him already?

652
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:59,930
What did he say?

653
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,360
I don't really know yet.
I'll tell you later.

654
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,630
But, do you know what
my real name is?

655
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,930
Your name?

656
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:15,160
Yeah, my real name.

657
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:21,130
Gosh, I'm nervous.

658
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,400
What's your real name?

659
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,300
Sun-ho.

660
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,960
(Sun-ho)

661
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,400
Is Moo-young…

662
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,100
Sun-ho?

663
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,760
Yes.

664
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,230
Sun-ho. My name is…

665
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,330
Kang Sun-ho.

666
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,700
Kang Sun-ho...

667
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
Kang Sun-ho.

668
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,930
Moo-young is…

669
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,460
Kang Sun-ho.

670
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,660
(A remake of the Japanese series A Hundred
Million Stars Falling From The Sky)

671
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,460
(Thank you to Actor Yoo Jae-myung
for guest starring)

672
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,400
(Hundred Million Stars From The Sky)

673
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,630
Do you think you can stop here
if you were me?

674
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,230
I don't do things halfway.

675
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,130
What do you think is left?

676
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,900
- A gun.
- A gun?

677
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,300
It's your father's case.

678
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,360
It has nothing
to do with you.

679
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:13,100
If it has nothing to do with me,

680
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,230
why does it feel like
it describes me so well?

681
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,860
Someone told me that

682
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:19,260
I'm not even a human.

683
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:19,700
That I'm a devil.

684
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,400
(Kang Soon-gu
Lee Mi-young)
That I'm a devil.

685
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:20,460
(Kang Soon-gu
Lee Mi-young)

686
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:20,860
Are you really okay with who I am?
(Kang Soon-gu
Lee Mi-young)

687
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,560
Are you really okay with who I am?

688
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:24,460
Of course.

689
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,730
I want to be born again.
