00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,160
I don't like you being a jerk.

7
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,759
I'm scared because it seems
like you're going the wrong way.

8
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,759
Are you going to take the job?

9
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,260
I won't do it
if you tell me not to.

10
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,100
Then don't.

11
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,330
Promise me you'll
become a good man.

12
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,530
Then teach me.

(Episode 10)

14
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,700
Hop in.

15
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Damn, aircon!

16
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,160
No wonder it was too cold.

17
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,730
Aircon?

18
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,100
You didn't even notice
that the aircon was turned on.

19
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,960
Yours is turned on too.

20
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,160
No, mines is turned off…

21
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,230
Uh? It's turned on.

22
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,100
What's gotten into you?
Driving me to work?

23
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,600
So you like it or not?

24
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,730
I love it!

25
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,160
I would've just left
if you were even a minute late.

26
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,200
Yoo Jin-kang, you're lucky today.

27
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,100
Lucky day!

28
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
So what will we do about
next Thursday?

29
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,700
I almost forgot.

30
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,400
Next week is already November.

31
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,300
I didn't even notice
it was autumn already.

32
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,659
It's okay. I don't even remember
what year we're in now.

33
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,430
Should we make some gimbap?

34
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,630
Is that too much?

35
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,260
Why not? Let's bring some gimbap!

36
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,630
It'll feel like we're
going on a picnic.

37
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,600
Yeah?

38
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,060
And Jin-kook,
please buy some new sneakers.

39
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,060
Yours are too old.

40
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,100
- Have a good day!
- You too.

41
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,900
Hey, ugly.

42
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,200
I was a bit harsh last night.

43
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,130
I know you're all grown-up.

44
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,830
So, I trust

45
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,600
you'll deal with your own stuff.

46
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,800
I won't bring it up anymore. Okay?

47
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,830
Okay.

48
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,560
(Jang Se-ran)

49
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:13,830
Yes or no?
(Jang Se-ran)

50
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,800
Yes or no?

51
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,000
Have you decided?

52
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,100
(Delete)

53
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,430
- Let me make my own.
- I already made you one.

54
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,700
- Really?
- Here you go.

55
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,360
Thank you.

56
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,260
Uhm, what's this?

57
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,330
- It tastes creamy.
- Right?

58
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,460
It's not sweet at all. I like it.

59
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,160
- Uh? President.
- Thanks.

60
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,300
Jang Se-ran majored in the Arts.

61
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,230
Right, I searched for
her interviews and

62
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,060
she seems quite interested
in installation art.

63
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,730
She even personally owns
Yayoi Kusama's piece.

64
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,900
So I think it would better to go
for a dimensional graphic

65
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,300
than a plane plot.

66
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,500
What about Kim Moo-young's taste?

67
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,760
Jang Se-ran's taste is important

68
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,200
but Kim Moo-young is
the actual person who will run it.

69
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,560
We must consider his
preference as well.

70
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,330
I don't think he will.

71
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,900
- Uh?
- What do you mean?

72
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,560
I mean…

73
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,760
I ran into him yesterday
in my neighborhood.

74
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,460
At the mart.
You know, he's my neighbor.

75
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,300
So I asked him

76
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,700
but he said he won't do it.

77
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,100
He said he won't do it?

78
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,230
You should've asked him clearly.

79
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,630
Is he still thinking

80
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,200
or has he decided
not to take the job already?

81
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,260
So what is it?

82
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,660
I think…

83
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,600
He made up his mind already.

84
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,600
No, he has.

85
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,630
He has made up his mind

86
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,730
to not take the job.

87
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,230
Did you just smile?

88
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,930
While delievering this bad news?

89
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,230
Did I?

90
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,900
No, I didn't.

91
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,000
I must've done it
because I was too shocked…

92
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,260
As I told you,

93
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,500
Jin-kang is acting
very weird today.

94
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,860
I know, right.

95
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,900
She's been humming for 2 hours!

96
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,159
Humming? Was I?

97
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,700
Yeah, you're looking great.

98
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,860
No.

99
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,130
What do you think, Mr. Choi?

100
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,460
To be honest,

101
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,260
I think he's being rude.

102
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,930
Right?

103
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,830
Maybe I treated him too well.

104
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,100
There's been an order to transfer Lim Yoo-ri

105
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,560
to prosecution by tomorrow for murder

106
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,130
and to investigate Kim Moo-young
for another week.

107
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,130
Why separate the case instead
of taking them together?

108
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,860
They said our evidence is insufficient
to ascertain a motive.

109
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,000
- Lee Kyung-chul.
- Yes, sir.

110
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,830
Do you know that
Sergeant Yoo requested

111
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,960
to transfer to a patrol
team next term?

112
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,800
Did he?

113
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,660
Yoo Jin-kook.

114
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,860
You must know
why I called both of you in.

115
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,760
Yes, I'm good with

116
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,560
wherever I'll be disposed to.

117
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,960
There are only 2 months left
until the next personnel shift.

118
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,860
Be thankful that
they let it slide this time

119
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,230
and don't cause any trouble.

120
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,460
I'll be furious

121
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,530
if they take disciplinary action.

122
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,330
Frankly speaking,

123
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,830
Sergeant Yoo deserves it,
doesn't he?

124
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,530
If he let us know right away

125
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,260
when Lim Yoo-ri turned herself in,

126
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,860
we wouldn't have announced

127
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,160
Kim Moo-young as the culprit
to the media.

128
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,260
With that,

129
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,060
I was impetuous.

130
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,430
Sergeant Yoo didn't expect us

131
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,530
- to arrest him that soon...
- What?

132
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,300
Hey, leave him alone.

133
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,560
Eom Cho-rong has a special
relationship with Sergeant Yoo.

134
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,130
Didn't you know that his girlfriend
is Sergeant Yoo's sister?

135
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,900
Seriously?

136
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,660
- Unbelievable. How's it going?
- Yes, sir.

137
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,530
Regardless of how much you like her,
pick the right side.

138
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,000
- Alright.
- Get yourself together.

139
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,160
Damn, nobody got suspended.

140
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,060
- They let it slide this time.
- What a relief!

141
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,300
I'll keep it short.

142
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,630
Let's be like how we were
before this incident.

143
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,530
I don't know why
you were so obsessed with

144
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,800
Jung Mi-yeon's case,

145
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,160
but we were okay before then.

146
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,530
Act as if you aren't even here.

147
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,900
Uh?

148
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,430
Let's not trouble ourselves.

149
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,860
Sergeant Yoo.

150
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,060
It's tea.

151
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,800
Would you like some?

153

Thanks.
(Kim Moo-young's Call History
Frequent Contacts List)

154
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,430
I know you wouldn't have done it
if it wasn't her.

155
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,530
I don't regret it.

156
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,500
I did it even though
I knew I shouldn't have.

157
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,660
I'm sorry for not letting you know

158
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,000
about Kim Moo-young
and Lim Yoo-ri beforehand.

159
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,230
Right, that was your fault.

160
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,200
I know.

161
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,400
That's fine with me now but…

162
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,200
But?

163
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,500
Nevermind.

164
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,230
Anyway, I'm so glad
we didn't get punished.

165

- Yes?

What's this?

167
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,130
My old boss back in Haesan
gave it to me

168
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,430
telling me to buy some snacks
for Jin-kang.

169
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,900
You buy it for her.

170
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,430
Buy something delicious for her.

171
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,060
You can go.
I'll get inside a bit later.

172
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,160
Okay.

173
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,560
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,930
I really didn’t…

175
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,730
want to hear that.

176
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,900
I'm sorry, Cho-rong.

177
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,300
Hey, Sergeant Yoo.

178
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,230
It didn't go well with Jin-kang.

179
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,560
I thought I should tell you.

180
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,560
I don't want to have any regrets
left either.

181
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,100
You introduced her to me but…

182
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,660
I'm sorry things didn't work out.

183
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,730
Eom Cho-rong.

184
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,860
Shall we go for a drink?

185
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,800
No, next time.

186
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,230
Next time.

187
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,030
Let's take the bus.

188
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,330
- Let's go.
- Sure.

189
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm going to Hongdae today.
I'll drop you off nearby.

190
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,030
No thanks, I'll take the bus.

191
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,100
You don't need to take the long way
around with all this traffic.

192
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,830
Thanks to the bus-only-lane,
buses are pretty fast.

193
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,460
I'll take the bus.

194
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,660
Let's use public transportation.

195
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,260
Fine.

196
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,600
Then can you drop me off
by the subway station?

197
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,060
No, I said I'm going to Hongdae.

198
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,600
It's the opposite direction!

199
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,630
You walk.

200
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,900
- Go.
- Goodbye.

201
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,060
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye, bye!

202
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,700
This is such a hassle.

203
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,430
I'll take the bus too.

204
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,260
Will you?

205
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,230
She's taking the bus too.

206
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,200
Nevermind.

207
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,560
There'll be too much traffic.

208
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,800
I'll just take the subway.

209
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,800
- Okay.
- See you tomorrow, Manager!

210
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,900
She's taking the subway.

211
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
She's taking the bus.

212
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,330
What does 'she's taking
the bus' mean?

213
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,630
She's taking the subway.

214
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,900
It's so nice to walk like this.

215
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,660
This is my favorite season.

216
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,000
The weather feels like
it's allowing me

217
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,560
to be lonely, right?

218
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,829
Right?

219
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,560
What? What did you say?

220
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,260
Why?

221
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,730
Are you nervous
because November is coming?

222
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,230
Nervous?

223
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,200
It always comes.

224
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,200
Then what are you thinking?

225
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,200
I mean…

226
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,230
Jin-kang broke up

227
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,960
with Cho-rong.

228
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,830
Are you serious?

229
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,630
Yeah.

230
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,760
Cho-rong said earlier that

231
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,000
it didn't work out with Jin-kang.

232
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,300
That's too bad.

233
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,060
Cho-rong is the best man ever.

234
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,760
I know.

235
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,430
I shouldn't have said that
if I knew it earlier.

236
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,630
What did you say?

237
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,960
I told Jin-kang that

238
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,930
I'm going to trust her
and I won't nag her anymore.

239
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,860
Well done.

240
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,600
Too bad they didn't work out
but what else can we do?

241
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,560
They aren't for each other.

242
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,900
Right?

243
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,730
Hey, don't be all talk.

244
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,030
Wait in a relaxed manner.

245
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,460
Just chill out.

246
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,330
Why did they break up anyway?

247
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,300
I don't know.

248
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,760
But I think it has something
to do with him.

249
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,030
Ah…

250
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,760
Kim Moo-young?

251
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,430
What? You know something?

252
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,800
Not exactly.

253
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,900
Oh, right. The pub in Sungsoo-dong.

254
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,230
Did you say
you won't take the job?

255
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,130
You didn't?

256
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,830
What do you think I did?

257
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,900
You turned her down.

258
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,360
Actually, my boss really wanted

259
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,560
you to take the job.

260
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,630
She thought we could get
a bid from you.

261
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,730
If I took the job,

262
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,000
I would've definitely
picked your company.

263
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,930
I feel so guilty.

264
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,860
But why would you hate it that
much if I worked there?

265
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,830
It's much cooler

266
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,600
and pays better than now.

267
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,930
- You don't like money?
- I don't?

268
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,100
No way.

269
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,760
Everyone loves money.

270
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,860
You must earn a lot!

271
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,360
Fine.

272
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,330
I love money,

273
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,330
it's just that I don't want you to
be around those people.

274
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,730
They're people who can do
whatever they want.

275
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,600
You must keep your word that

276
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,900
I can ask you whatever I want.

277
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,400
Because I'm really going
to ask you everything.

278
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,300
There's a lot of stuff
I'd like to ask you

279
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,360
and I need to ask you,

280
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,600
but not now.

281
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,860
I was always so upset
every time I met you.

282
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,800
I was either upset, crying, or worried

283
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
and told myself that
I wouldn't see you anymore.

284
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,700
I never smiled.

285
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,860
So I want to smile
before doing anything else.

286
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,800
Don't smile.

287
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,860
Why not?

288
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,660
You look scary when you smile.

289
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,830
Eat up.

290
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,830
Okay.

291
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,360
Can we go that way?

292
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,960
Let's try going that way.

293
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,200
So you know why.

294
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,900
Of course.

295
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,560
I don't want to upset Jin-kook
if possible.

296
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,430
You know he doesn't
like you much, right?

297
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,200
I know.

298
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,460
I like him though.

299
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,160
No.

300
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,130
I'm not sure if I like him,

301
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,900
but he's funny.

302
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,700
I feel like I want to tease him

303
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,030
or mess with him.

304
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,930
Whatever.

305
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,630
I act up whenever I'm with him.

306
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,230
Isn't he so funny?

307
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,660
You smiled before.

308
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,100
What?

309
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,260
I think I'm going to continue
hating you.

310
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,430
How's the cat doing?

311
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,500
What's its name?

312
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,230
Last name is Jin, first name is Kang.

313
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,960
Jin Kang.

314
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,700
I'm the idiot for asking.

315
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,600
I think I'm going to continue
hating you.

316
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,500
Good luck with that.

317
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,700
You smiled exactly 3 seconds
after saying that.

318
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,060
How do you remember that?

319
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,500
Oh, right.

320
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,800
What about cat?

321
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,560
Did you try looking for it?

322
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,330
I did

323
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,730
but I couldn't find it.

324
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,700
But I got a text yesterday.

325
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,030
He's busy with his girlfriend.

326
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,360
He told me not to wait
for him anymore.

327
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,930
I think I'm going to continue
hating you.

328
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,760
Good luck with that.

329
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,600
It's a flower shop!

330
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,460
When did it open?

331
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,230
Let's check it out.

332
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,900
Good evening!

333
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Welcome.

334
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,760
- You ready?
- Yeah.

335
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,630
Autumn is the season
for chrysanthemums. Looks good.

336
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,000
- Aren't these pretty?
- They are.

337
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
I bought them on the way here.

338
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,930
- A flower shop opened up front.
- Really?

339
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,830
Are you going to drive me today?

340
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,300
- Yeah.
- Hooray!

341
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,800
After you, Your Highness.

342
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,030
Oh, Jin-kook.

343
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
I'm working late today,
so don't wait for me.

344
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,900
You'll have to buy the
gimbap ingredients alone.

345
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,400
Bring some gimbap to
Cho-rong tomorrow…

346
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,960
I wonder if he's gone to work.

347
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,260
Why are you working late so often?

348
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,230
I must work a lot beforehand
so I can go on a picnic with you.

349
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,100
Let's go!

350
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,030
Please say something!

351
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,560
Why did you find out just now?

352
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,900
Please give us a comment!

353
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,760
Sergeant Yoo.

354
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,960
Could you please check the rest

355
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,330
before you get off?

356
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,630
- What?
- About Kim Moo-young.

357
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,130
We're supposed to
interrogate him tomorrow,

358
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,700
but he's not picking up his phone.

359
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,900
It'll be very bad
if he disappears or something.

360
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,730
2PM tomorrow.

361
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,560
Okay, 2PM.

362
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,930
Yeah.

363
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,530
I don't have battery.
I should go.

364
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,560
I'm going to work late today.

365
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,000
- Don't come by my office.
- I won't.

366
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,800
If you drop by my house,

367
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,300
check under

368
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,960
the chrysanthemum pot.

369
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,130
Okay.

370
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,100
Why did you turn down my offer?

371
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,230
I've decided to
learn something new,

372
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,630
and I thought accepting your offer
would disturb it.

373
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,330
What are you learning?

374
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,360
How to be a good man.

375
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,500
What?

376
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,600
It doesn't suit you at all.

377
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,460
That's why it's a challenge.

378
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,600
I think

379
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,760
I've explained enough to you.

380
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,330
I recognized you right away.

381
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,360
I don't think you have yet.

382
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,860
We're the same kind.

383
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,730
We can't be good people.

384
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,630
Boredom is what got me
to where I am now.

385
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,660
When I was born,
I was already here.

386
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,700
Nothing's fun

387
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,730
and nothing attracts me.

388
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,700
Sometimes I see something that glitters
and chase it like crazy,

389
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,360
only to realize that
I'd been fooled in the end.

390
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,000
Everything's boring.

391
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,360
But I've lost nothing.

392
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,230
Because time has passed.

393
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,130
And right now,

394
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,800
you look like the shiniest
thing to me.

395
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,630
What would you do if you were me?

396
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,400
You would check it out, right?

397
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,560
You'll end up seeking me out.

398
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,100
I can bet on that.

399
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,300
This tastes bad.

400
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,900
When will he be transferred
over to prosecution?

401
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,830
The number you've dialed
is unavailable…

402
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,930
Aren't these pretty?
I bought them on the way.

403
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,430
I'm working late today,
so don't wait for me.

404
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,760
The number you've dialed
is unavailable…

405
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,500
What? You know something?

406
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,400
Not exactly…

407
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,900
When Kim Moo-young was arrested
for murder,

408
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,760
Jin-kang called me

409
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,200
and asked if it really was
Kim Moo-young on the news.

410
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,100
But…

411
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,400
She sounded too…

412
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,830
If Kim Moo-young really is

413
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,500
the kid you're looking for,

414
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,160
he shouldn't be seeing Jin-kang.

415
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,600
Hello?

416
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,000
- Hello?
- Jin-kook?

417
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,730
Yeah, it's me.

418
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,530
Why didn't you say anything?
I thought you dialed the wrong number.

419
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,400
Where are you?
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

420
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,860
Did you call me a lot?
My phone was on vibrate.

421
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,660
Where are you now?

422
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,400
I'm at work.

423
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,130
I told you I had to work late.

424
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,230
Late?

425
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,500
Manager Yoo, I don't think
it was uploaded.

426
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,230
What? I'm sure I uploaded
it into the log folder.

427
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,600
Wait, I'll go and check.

428
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,460
Jin-kook, I'm in the middle of…

429
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,600
Okay, go work.
I'll hang up. Bye.

430
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,460
Bye.

431
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,430
Are you going to my place?

432
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,900
Yes.

433
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,930
Didn't you get instructions
when you were released?

434
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,700
Ah…

435
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,860
Pick up calls from the police

436
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,200
If you missed it, call right back.

437
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,730
Report beforehand if you'll
leave town.

438
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,730
If I'm out of reach for too long,

439
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,200
I'll be placed on the
wanted list. Right?

440
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,900
You know very well,
so why didn't you pick up your phone?

441
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,630
My phone was dead.

442
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,560
I was going to call back
after I charged it.

443
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,800
Why? Something wrong?

444
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,300
2PM tomorrow.

445
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,960
Interrogation.

446
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,660
Okay.

447
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,730
Are you…

448
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,660
dating my sister?

449
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,300
Don't date my sister.

450
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,660
Why?

451
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,000
Because I don't deserve her?

452
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,660
No.

453
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,560
You can't because it's you.
I'm opposed to you.

454
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,100
Don't ever meet her again.

455
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,160
I'm not asking you for a favor.
This is a warning.

456
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,830
Sir, please stop up there.

457
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,760
If you drop by my house,

458
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,230
check under

459
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,200
the chrysanthemum pot.

460
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,930
Kim Moo-young. Kim Moo-young.

461
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,000
Kim Moo-young.

462
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,060
Where are your cups?

463
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,199
There are none.
Just give it to me.

464
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,360
You don’t have any cups?

465
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,330
No.

466
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,060
What did you dream about?

467
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,130
Was it a nightmare?

468
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,100
My dad died.

469
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,699
Your dad died in your dream?

470
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,600
Yeah.

471
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,500
He was shot.

472
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,630
This was the 5th time
I had the same dream.

473
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,200
Do you keep having the same dream?

474
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,100
The story is always the same

475
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,200
but it gets clearer

476
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,400
as if my memory
is getting clearer.

477
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,500
What kind of dream was it?

478
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,630
The beginning is nice.

479
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,330
I'm really happy.

480
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,460
I'm like 4 or 5 in my dream.

481
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,000
I play with toys in the woods.

482
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,730
It's like I'm playing
with my brother.

483
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,760
When I go home…

484
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,130
Dad…

485
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,560
I like him so much,
so I try and go to him.

486
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,300
But, the sound of a kettle.

487
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,930
The water is boiling.

488
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,700
And a gun.

489
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,260
I can see a gun
beyond the steam.

490
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,500
A gun?

491
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,700
Yes, someone is
trying to kill him.

492
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,700
It becomes a nightmare from then.

493
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,560
I'm so scared.

494
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,900
I can't see the shooter's face

495
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,230
but I can clearly see a gun.

496
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,360
It feels like he's about to
pull the trigger.

497
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,660
I'm about to call my dad, but…

498
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,000
he falls down after getting shot.

499
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,930
That's where my dream ends.

500
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,800
I can't wake up

501
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,400
as if it's sleep paralysis.

502
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,260
And I hear your voice.

503
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,460
My voice?

504
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,660
Yes, Kim Moo-young.

505
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,800
You call my name
just like you did earlier.

506
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,600
Really?

507
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,460
Yes, so I thought

508
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,260
I was still dreaming earlier

509
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,430
because I saw you
when I opened my eyes.

510
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,630
When did you first have
this dream?

511
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,800
When I was in the Yangso accident.

512
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,000
I heard your voice then too.

513
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,200
Kim Moo-young.

514
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,600
How do you know it's my voice?

515
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,500
I'm sure it's you.

516
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,300
That's strange.

517
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,730
It might not be…

518
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,430
a dream.

519
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,930
Then what is it?

520
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,700
My lost memory.

521
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,630
I don't have any memories
until the age of 5.

522
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,830
Nothing?

523
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,260
No, nothing.

524
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm not even sure until 5.

525
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,060
I don't even know
when I was really born.

526
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,860
What is your first memory then?

527
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,630
Walking.

528
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,260
I was walking somewhere endlessly.

529
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,630
I was so tired and hungry,

530
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,360
but I kept walking because
I didn't know where I was.

531
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,730
I think I was worried
about someone.

532
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,260
I couldn't stop walking because
I thought someone was waiting for me.

533
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,900
Who?

534
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,160
Mom?

535
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,600
Dad, mom, me and my brother.

536
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,000
He looks mischievous,
doesn't he?

537
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,860
He really does.

538
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,460
This is my only lead.

539
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,400
I got lost and a grandma took
me in and raised me.

540
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,730
She died even less than a year
after she took me in.

541
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,760
So the head of my town

542
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,460
took me to an orphanage

543
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,630
and I had this drawing
in my pocket then.

544
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,430
How do they look?

545
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,360
They look so happy.
They're all smiling.

546
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,830
Look, there's an angel too.

547
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,730
Doesn't he look like a policeman?

548
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,000
A policeman?

549
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,560
But his hat is purple.

550
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,800
Then maybe he's not?

551
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,360
I always thought my dad
was a policeman.

552
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,830
My father in my imagination

553
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,860
is still looking for me…

554
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,930
Somewhere…

555
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,530
Desperately…

556
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,230
For his lost son... me.

557
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,530
So…

558
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,230
I wasn't abandoned.

559
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,230
I was lost.

560
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,100
I know it sounds childish.

561
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,100
Not at all.

562
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,200
How many times have
you had these kinds of thoughts?

563
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,560
Countless times.

564
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,160
What?

565
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,330
How do you know this feeling?

566
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,530
I feel it too.

567
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,830
How?

568
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,300
I just do.

569
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,730
I just…

570
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,930
Look.

571
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,160
Your family looks so happy here.

572
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,060
I would've thought the same
if I were you.

573
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,160
Is that so?

574
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,800
Did you try looking
for your family?

575
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,630
Yeah once when I was 8

576
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,500
and once when I was 20.

577
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,600
I didn't find anything.

578
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,660
Should we look for them again?

579
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,500
You're scared.

580
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,660
That your dream might be real,
right?

581
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,030
You're home?

582
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,330
You still came early.

583
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,500
- Ah, gimbap.
- Right.

584
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,060
Try it. Ah.

585
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,300
When I made gimbap in the past,

586
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,100
you liked eating
the ends the most.

587
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,830
You sat right next to
the chopping board

588
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,660
and wanted to eat
like a baby bird.

589
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,800
I still love the ends the most!

590
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,330
- Here are your ends.
- Thanks!

591
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,030
Get some sleep.
We can just leave late.

592
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,130
Why? Do you want to eat
before you sleep?

593
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,260
You must be hungry. Just wait.

594
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,530
Gosh, my back.

595
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,830
Jin-kook…

596
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,230
I don't think I can go to
the temple with you.

597
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,330
Really? Why?

598
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,260
Do you have a lot of work?

599
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm busy with work.

600
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,900
And I also have to prepare for
the competition next week.

601
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,000
It's pretty important.

602
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,300
I told the president

603
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,330
I couldn't go today

604
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,560
but I still think I should work.

605
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,830
I lie so easily now.

606
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,930
I must've been influenced by you.

607
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:59,430
I was just joking. Eat up.

608
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,630
Let's not lie from now on, okay?

609
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,260
You're just messing with me.

610
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,560
Isn't it delicious?

611
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,630
It's so delicious.

612
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,430
He's good enough to
open a gimbap shop.

613
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,360
He never once missed

614
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,260
my school trip or sports day.

615
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,800
He always made gimbap for me.

616
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,660
- But why today?
- What?

617
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,300
Why do you go to a temple
every November 1st?

618
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,600
I don't know.

619
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:49,160
Why today?

620
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,260
We did it ever
since we lived in Haesan,

621
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:56,530
- so I haven't really thought about it.
- Are you alright?

622
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,730
Thank you. Are you alright?

623
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,760
- Thank you, Mister.
- But I guess I just liked it.

624
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,860
- Yeah.
- Like an annual event for just me and Jin-kook.

625
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,900
I waited for November 1st

626
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,060
more than my school trips
when I was young.

627
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,800
(New Haesan Station)

628
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,100
Tak, did you arrive?

629
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,800
Thank you so much.

630
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,400
Yes.

631
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,000
Please hang out with my brother
instead of me today.

632
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,500
Alright.

633
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,600
So this is what Haesan Station
looks like.

634
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,500
I thought I'd remember
but I can't remember at all.

635
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,630
New Haesan Station.

636
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,000
(New Haesan Station)

637
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,300
Ah…

638
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,560
The old Haesan station
used to be in the city.

639
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,360
It's gone now.

640
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,330
It's my first time in Haesan.

641
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,830
I never came back after
I moved to Seoul.

642
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,600
I didn't think much of it
because my brother said

643
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,160
he was transferred to Seoul.

644
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,860
But think about it.

645
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,160
How could he be transferred
from Haesan to Seoul?

646
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,360
I'd have understood if it was
Seoul to Haesan.

647
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:23,660
He requested a transfer for me.

648
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,860
Was he a police officer
in Haesan too?

649
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,560
Yes, he's been a police officer
since he was 22,

650
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,830
so of course he was
one in Haesan.

651
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:39,000
But you're from Haesan.

652
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,230
Are you sure there isn't a single cop
you know in Haesan?

653
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,860
No.

654
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,660
What is it?

655
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,560
No, it's nothing.

656
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,560
Let's wrap it up and go home.

657
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,730
Why? We should interrogate
Kim Moo-young at 2PM.

658
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,000
It's been put off until tomorrow.

659
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,260
He's out of town.

660
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:11,300
Gosh, I'm so jealous. Where?

661
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,360
Haesan. Nothing I can do about
it when he's already there.

662
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,130
I can't go catch him.

663
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,930
Hey, where's Sergeant Yoo?

664
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,830
He said he had some business
to take care of.

665
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,100
Some business?

666
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,860
Oh right.

667
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:24,560
He never shows up
on his days off.

668
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:27,600
He requested a transfer?

669
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,860
He should've done it sooner.

670
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,330
It'll finally be peaceful now.

671
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,800
What really happened between
captain and Sergeant Yoo?

672
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,960
And why was the old team disbanded

673
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,930
because of Sergeant Yoo?

674
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,700
A suspect died

675
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,760
while they were chasing him.

676
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:43,530
Died?

677
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,960
He was a violent criminal.

678
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,330
When Sergeant Yoo
went after him,

679
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,000
the suspect fell off
a cliff and died.

680
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,600
Fell off?

681
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,130
So he fell to his death?
Or suicide?

682
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,700
Whether the suspect
tripped and fell

683
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,730
or he committed suicide

684
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,230
because there was
no other way out,

685
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,500
if Sergeant Yoo can't chase
criminals because he's scared,

686
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,930
how can he catch them?

687
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,760
So he was disciplined?

688
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:07,960
Not at all.

689
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:09,760
There were a lot of violent crimes

690
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:12,300
and the public was okay with him,
so he wasn't in trouble.

691
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,860
Then why?

692
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:16,400
That's why our captain
thinks he's pathetic.

693
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,460
You know those people

694
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:20,100
who feel guilty for nothing.

695
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,660
I guess he made a fuss
about dying or whatever.

696
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:24,430
So the team got disbanded

697
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,560
and the members scattered.

698
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:29,560
But still, he saw someone
die right in front of him.

699
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,530
I understand
why he was traumatized.

700
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,960
Come on, it was a time when
even the death penalty was given.

701
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,760
If he didn't fall off and die,

702
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,800
he would've received
the death sentence.

703
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,200
He was going to die anyway.

704
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,560
It's so delicious!

705
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,360
It's been 17 years since
I had your gimbap.

706
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:41,900
17 years?

707
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,500
Don't you remember?

708
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,830
When you were working
in Hyeongbok Police Station,

709
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,800
I went to Jin-kang's sports day
in your stead.

710
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,500
Right, when Jin-kang
was in 5th grade.

711
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,160
- You remember?
- Yeah.

712
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,460
That elementary schooler's
all grown-up now

713
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,230
and she even thinks of

714
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,530
finding her brother's date.
Goodness!

715
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,430
- Eat up.
- Thanks for the meal!

716
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,560
But Jin-kang doesn't know

717
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,830
why you bring her here every year,
does she?

718
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,300
She doesn't, and…

719
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,030
she shouldn’t know.

720
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,800
But they're really blessed.

721
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:29,960
Thanks to you,
they were able to see

722
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,630
how their daughter
grew up every year.

723
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,660
It's good
if they think of it that way.

724
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,330
But I come here for no reason.

725
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,300
Just to get some fresh air

726
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,160
with Jin-kang once a year.

727
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:48,260
It makes me calm when I'm here.

728
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,800
Shall we go?

729
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:44,800
Love is always patient.

730
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:53,760
Love is always mild.

731
00:52:54,260 --> 00:53:03,030
Among faith, hope and love,

732
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:11,960
love is the best.

733
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:25,330
Love is the best.

734
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,760
Here.

735
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:00,560
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

736
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:08,500
Who is she?

737
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,230
A girl I'd like to look good for.

738
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,960
Hearing that is reassuring.

739
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:21,830
What is being a nice person?

740
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,560
What kind of person
is a good person?

741
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,030
A person with a lot of love.

742
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,530
A person with a lot of love.

743
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:36,030
That's definitely not me.

744
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,130
You're right.

745
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,100
What? Do you want me to deny it?

746
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,300
Wow.

747
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,500
I didn't think
you'd make me laugh.

748
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:53,130
Why did you just leave that day?

749
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,430
At Sister Theresa's funeral.

750
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,630
Even Doctor Yang was…

751
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,560
I'm here to ask you a question.

752
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,330
You said…

753
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,160
before I came here,

754
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,800
a detective from
Haesan police station

755
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:10,200
once came looking for a boy
who looks similar to me?

756
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,260
But Moo-young, that boy is…

757
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:17,560
I know.

758
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,800
(Looking for a missing child)

759
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,960
It was a year before I came here
(Looking for a missing child)

760
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:21,660
when he came looking for a boy

761
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,460
(Disappeared on Tuesday,
November 9, 1993)
when he came looking for a boy

762
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:22,530
(Disappeared on Tuesday,
November 9, 1993)

763
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:23,700
with a burn scar on his shoulder.
(Disappeared on Tuesday,
November 9, 1993)

764
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,930
with a burn scar on his shoulder.

765
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,700
And you even checked
with the police

766
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,000
when you saw my right arm

767
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,130
after I first got here.

768
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,830
And he had already…

769
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,600
found the boy when you called.

770
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:45,860
So I wasn't the boy

771
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,800
he was looking for then.

772
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,130
But I still went by
the police station.

773
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,960
I guess I wanted to make sure.

774
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,900
When?

775
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,730
When I was 8.

776
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,500
I thought

777
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,130
he was my father.

778
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,930
But as I expected,

779
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,700
nothing was there.

780
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,930
But why again?

781
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:31,000
I still think I need to start
from here.

782
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,760
And here I am

783
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,800
again.

784
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:45,000
There's a lake
behind the orphanage.

785
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,360
The rock in the middle of the lane
across the lake was my seat.

786
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:51,830
What did you do there?

787
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,230
Nothing.

788
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,300
I just sat there.

789
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,200
What did you do
while you were just sitting there?

790
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:03,030
Just watched this and that.

791
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,160
Men who were fishing,

792
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,200
people on dates.

793
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:18,730
What are you looking at?

794
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,300
I was looking at you.

795
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:32,760
Even when you were little,
you looked like a troublemaker.

796
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:37,930
Did you find anything?

797
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,100
Nothing much.

798
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,330
I thought about orphanages
a lot when I was little.

799
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,760
I always wondered how it'd feel
to live in an orphanage.

800
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:57,530
Because you might've been sent
to an orphanage if it

801
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,660
hadn't been for Jin-kook?

802
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:01,160
Yeah.

803
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:03,460
I found out
when I was in middle school.

804
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,630
You know there's a time

805
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,700
when mysteries
you don't understand

806
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,030
perfectly come together
like a puzzle.

807
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,130
And then

808
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,730
you realize…

809
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,830
Oh, that was why.

810
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,160
For example, why don't I have
any baby pictures?

811
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,830
How could I be born in 1990

812
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:33,160
if my dad died in 1988?

813
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,830
I told you before,

814
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,130
my sister immigrated
to the States.

815
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,760
I wondered

816
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,930
what she meant when she

817
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,800
told Jin-kook something
before she left.

818
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,300
What did she say?

819
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,800
Your sister is me, not her.

820
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,600
I'm not his real sister.

821
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:08,330
It doesn't feel weird
telling you that.

822
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,330
I thought I wouldn't tell anybody
until I died.

823
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,030
I already feel so sorry to him

824
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,500
for just thinking of it.

825
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,630
You must've had
a lot of questions.

826
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,160
You couldn't ask him anything because
you were sorry to him?

827
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,530
Yeah.

828
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,260
So I thought about it a lot too.

829
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:35,060
An abandoned child.

830
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,760
A lost child.

831
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,800
But I always thought

832
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:42,130
I was abandoned.

833
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,900
What kind of people
were my parents?

834
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,860
Why did they abandon me?

835
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,060
Why did Jin-kook have
to take me in

836
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:56,230
when he was younger
than I am now?

837
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,430
The saddest thing is that

838
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:09,100
I can't tell him thank you.

839
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:18,560
Or thank him for raising me
when I was nothing.

840
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,330
Even if I want to tell him…

841
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:45,000
I want him to be happy.

842
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,100
He really is a great man.

843
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,230
I want to give Jin-kook the world.

844
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:13,900
Why does makgeolli taste so much better
in the mountains?

845
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,500
Hold on.

846
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,830
I wonder if she's skipping dinner.

847
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,460
I'm sorry I'm here with you

848
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:23,360
instead of Jin-kang. I'm so sorry!

849
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,100
It's strange.

850
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,600
You're pretty when you're angry.

851
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,760
Cut the crap.

852
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,930
Are you even worried about me?

853
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,230
Worried about you? Why would I be?

854
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,200
Forget it.

855
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,830
Pretty, my ass.

856
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,430
I knew it.

857
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,260
What are you talking about?

858
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,230
I don't quite follow
what you're trying to say.

859
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,600
Listen.

860
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,930
You're worried about
everyone in the world

861
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,630
except for me.

862
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,530
When I see you, I realize

863
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,530
love is all about worryings

864
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:03,030
What?

865
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,060
This is why you're never

866
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:06,360
worried about me, ever!

867
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:09,000
Tak, you're a brave woman.

868
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,700
Okay, fine.

869
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,560
I don't expect anything from you.

870
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,230
But remember one thing.

871
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,060
Think about
who's worried about you

872
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:21,300
the most in this world.

873
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:23,100
You know who that is?

874
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,530
Tak!

875
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,200
- What did you do? Are you insane?
- Tak, did I get it right?

876
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,060
Seriously…

877
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,900
I wish there was a time machine.

878
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,860
What would you do with it?

879
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,260
I want to go back in time
and hug you.

880
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,060
Little boy Kim Moo-young.

881
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:50,700
It's not too late yet.

882
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,960
I want to sleep with you.

883
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,700
Me too.

884
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:20,530
We have work tomorrow again.
Let's drink!

885
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,900
We have work?

886
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,200
If not, we can skip it!

887
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,530
Right.

888
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,930
That's it!

889
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
You should smile!

890
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,760
It's good to see you smile!
You look like a fool.

891
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:36,830
- A fool?
- Yeah, you're a fool.

892
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,230
I highly, highly admire you.

893
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,300
Even if everyone says it's not
your fault, you still

894
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,530
feel sorry for a long time.
That's why I like you so much.

895
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:53,700
But I still hope

896
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,430
one day you'll forget
about coming here

897
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,530
and say 'I must've gone crazy'.

898
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,900
I really want that day to come.

899
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,430
It won't ever happen.

900
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,730
Gosh…

901
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,730
I don't know.

902
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,700
Maybe when I get old

903
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:16,260
and get dementia or whatever.

904
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:19,430
Otherwise, I shouldn't forget.

905
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,860
Do you know why
I wanted Lim Yoo-ri

906
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:27,230
to turn herself in so much?

907
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,200
I didn't want her
to become like me.

908
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:35,460
What do you mean?

909
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:36,960
A person died because of me.

910
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:39,760
I didn't know what to do.

911
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:42,000
I was thinking of
committing suicide.

912
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:44,100
But I couldn't.

913
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:48,700
My dad had passed away,

914
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,660
Jin-yi was still in high school,

915
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:54,900
and mom was so…

916
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,700
So I had to keep living.

917
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,160
I had so many days left to live.

918
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,530
I had so many days left to live.

919
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,330
I wouldn't have known
time passess this quickly back then

920
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,260
because I was only 24.

921
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,160
Do you know
what the worst thing was?

922
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,400
That I didn't go to jail.

923
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:31,930
That I didn't pay the least
for what I did.

924
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,630
That tortured me a lot.

925
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,030
Jeez…

926
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,400
Why would you go to jail?

927
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:40,200
I agree with Lee Kyung-chul.

928
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:41,930
It's not your fault.

929
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,160
Whether it was suicide
or he missed his footing,

930
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:48,100
you did your best
to catch a culprit.

931
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,260
He didn't commit suicide.

932
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,230
Or miss his footing…

933
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,060
Nor did he fall off the cliff.

934
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:37,800
He didn't even try to

935
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,460
run away…

936
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,530
I shot him with a gun.

937
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,130
(A remake of the Japanese series A Hundred
Million Stars Falling From The Sky)

938
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:43,899
(Hundred Million Stars From The Sky)

939
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:45,800
Is Moo-young dating your sister?

940
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:48,560
What do you mean?
I'd never approve of him.

941
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:50,300
Your sister won't ever end it.

942
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,560
I've never seen my brother

943
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:53,729
hating someone so much
like this before.

944
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,359
Why do you think
he hates him so much?

945
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:57,060
What time is
Kim Moo-young's interrogation today?

946
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:58,800
Mind your own business.

947
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:00,600
What's so wrong with
a detective asking

948
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,200
for the time of an interrogation?
Am I wrong?

949
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:04,130
Please stop it, please!

950
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,960
Think of who raised you until now!

951
01:09:06,029 --> 01:09:07,960
I have no intention of getting in
your brother's good graces.

952
01:09:08,029 --> 01:09:09,700
How can you say that

953
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,800
when you know how much
he means to me?
