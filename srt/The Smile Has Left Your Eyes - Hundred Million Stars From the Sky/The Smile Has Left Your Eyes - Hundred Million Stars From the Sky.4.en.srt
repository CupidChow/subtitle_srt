7
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,130
Hey, police officer!

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,260
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,400
What would I be doing here?

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,230
Waiting for you, obviously.

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,230
Why?

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,700
You asked me the other day…

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,060
How I would feel if someone
dies because of me.

14
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,430
Let me ask you this time…

15
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,030
How did you feel

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,330
when you killed her?

17
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,500
It was awesome.

18
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,759
The murderer you were looking at

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,630
in the station was you, right?

20
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,460
It wasn't Choi Sang-hoon.

21
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,130
It was you in the mirror.

22
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,230
Right.

23
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,460
I killed her.

24
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,930
I wish I could say that.

25
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,860
Stop watching so many dramas, man.

26
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,900
I was talking about the movie.

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,200
The movie titled

28
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,060
Fantasy.

29
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,660
I should get to work.

30
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,360
Kim Moo-young.

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,360
You're left-handed.

32
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,730
I'm ambidextrous.

33
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,100
Perfectly.

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,960
It's a snow ball.

35
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,460
Where would you have put that
if you were her?

36
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,060
Next to the sailboat

37
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,330
- or the angel?
- The angel.

38
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,560
Right, the angel.

39
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,230
Should I tell you a funny story?

40
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,100
You know my sister?

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,500
There's this good friend of hers.

42
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,600
Once, her bracelet broke
and her boyfriend fixed it.

43
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,530
Later, she found out that
the bracelet looked exactly the same.

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,560
Even though there were
more than 20 beads,

45
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,230
he put everything back
in the same order.

46
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,030
That's amazing.

47
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,829
That's not all.

48
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,860
Hewitt Vill at
Wonyoung Intersection…

49
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,329
You know that girl
who was killed.

50
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,000
She collected a lot of snow balls.

51
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,660
When she got killed,
the snow balls fell down

52
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,660
but someone put them all back
into their original places.

53
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,800
This time, it was more than 50.

54
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,300
- Could it be the same guy?
- That's right.

55
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,230
That's you.

56
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,600
Me?

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,760
Then, it's not me. I only fixed
Seung-ah's bracelet.

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,130
Ah.

59
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,860
Angel.

60
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,260
Sailboat.

61
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,900
Rudolph.

62
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,060
Snowman.

63
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,300
Flower.

64
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,400
Angel.

65
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,430
Next to the angel
would be better

66
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,760
since it's a merry-go-round.

67
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,030
Are you having fun playing me?

68
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,960
You're a suspect now.

69
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,060
You've become a suspect
as of today.

70
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,600
Wait and see. I'm all worked up.

71
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,900
Way to go!

72
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,560
Let me know when you catch him.

73
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,930
He put 50 back into place?

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,260
I can't wait to see who he is.

75
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,200
What took you so long?
I'll be late for work!

76
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,930
You said Kim Moo-young is
dating Seung-ah?

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,460
- I said pretend like you don't know.
- Stop her.

78
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,860
Stop her

79
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,930
from meeting him ever again.

80
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,430
The rest is in the car.

81
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,230
Everything you ever gave me.

82
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,960
I just asked you if you forgot
about our dinner yesterday.

83
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Is this your answer?

84
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,130
This is everything
I've ever given you?

85
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,930
I was with him.

86
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,760
I slept with him.

87
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,260
I don't regret it.

88
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,860
You don't regret it?

89
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,630
Seung-ah.

90
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,930
You don't even know
what regret is yet.

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,260
How can you say that
you don't regret it?

92
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,100
Seung-ah, look at me.

93
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,030
When you break a promise,
you must apologize first.

94
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Am I right?

95
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,600
That'd at least make me
go easy on you.

96
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,060
Understood?

97
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,060
Get out.

98
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,600
Wow, finally he's being
handed over to the prosecution!

99
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,730
Team 3 finally got something done!

100
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,560
You must be so proud.

101
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,160
Stop her.

102
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,230
Stop her from meeting
him ever again.

103
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,100
Hey, Seung-ah. What's up?

104
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,230
Hi, Mrs. Baek. How are you?

105
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,230
You don't want to take it?

106
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,400
Hello?

107
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,930
Jin-kang.

108
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,500
Right. Is this for the exhibition?

109
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,830
Exhibition? What do you mean?

110
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,230
Hold on. Let me check on that.

111
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,360
It'll probably be until this month
as far as I remember.

112
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,360
Seung-ah, what are
you talking about?

113
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,830
Jin-kang, help me. I'm grounded.

114
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,500
Grounded? Why?

115
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,960
I stayed out last night.

116
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,130
The Art Nouveau design

117
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,960
shows very well how I felt

118
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,260
when I first established
the company.

119
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,000
So it is very important

120
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,230
- to keep its signification.
- Yes.

121
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,230
But it's way too similar, so…

122
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,130
I must meet Moo-young.

123
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
You're the only one
who can help me out.

124
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,600
What do you think,
Manager Jin-kang?

125
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,000
Pardon me?

126
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,060
Let's all pray with our heart

127
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,730
for Sister Jung Theresa

128
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,360
who has left us

129
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,060
to be with the Lord.

130
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,360
Dear Lord in Heaven.

131
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,860
Please accept the soul
of Sister Jung Theresa,

132
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,400
your servant whom
you called from this world,

133
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,030
free her from the shackles of sin,

134
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,760
help her take eternal rest

135
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,800
and have brilliant happiness…

136
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,130
Jin-kang, is everything
alright with you today?

137
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,360
You made me worried by zoning out
in such an important meeting.

138
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,960
You better not next time.

139
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,830
President Hwang, I'm really sorry.
Excuse me for a while.

140
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,600
- Wait.
- Manager!

141
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,460
- Can I see Kim Moo-young?
- Ah…

142
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,300
- He's not here.
- I see.

143
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,500
Then, can you tell him…

144
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,660
No, can I have his number?

145
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,900
Moo-young!

146
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,760
Moo-young!

147
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,560
Moo-young!

148
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,830
Who is he?

149
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,430
- Do you know him?
- It's Moo-young.

150
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,330
Moo-young…

151
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,200
How did he know that
Mother Theresa died?

152
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm sure he's Moo-young.

153
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,560
I'm Yoo Jin-kang.

154
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,530
She wants to see you at the
riverside on Saturday at 4PM.

155
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,100
Why are you telling me that?

156
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,130
She's grounded.

157
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,100
She even got her phone
confiscated.

158
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,460
Why?

159
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,300
Obviously, because she stayed
out with you the other night.

160
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,460
Be on time.

161
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,600

(Flying Band)

164
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,230
- You're… what?
- Sir!

165
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,930
You're not here to learn
how to play the guitar, are you?

166
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,060
I am.

167
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,360
He said there are many
good teachers here.

168
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,160
- Who?
- Kim Moo-young.

169
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,460
Who are you?

170
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,160
Kim Moo-young's neighbor.

171
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,200
So…

172
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,000
Kim Moo-young used to
date Jung Mi-yeon, right?

173
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,200
What?

174
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,430
Who dated who?

175
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,230
Or is it you?

176
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,960
You like Kim Moo-young, right?

177
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,800
You think I'm nuts?

178
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,560
Why would I like that old
30 year old man?

179
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,930
Old man?

180
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,430
30 is not old.

181
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,800
Kim Moo-young would cry
if he heard you.

182
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,730
You said you're a cop.

183
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,360
Should I show you again? It's me.

184
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,800
Then, why are you asking
about Moo-young?

185
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,360
To warn you to be careful.

186
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,030
I'm suspecting Kim Moo-young
for Jung Mi-yeon's case.

187
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,560
You'd better watch out.

188
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,100
You could end up in trouble

189
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,600
if you protect a culprit.

190
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,930
You are…

191
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,660
suspecting Moo-young?

192
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,130
Why?

193
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,460
He didn't even know
Mi-yeon that well.

194
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,360
Is that so?

195
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,560
- Re-investigation?
- That's right.

196
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,960
It's too late to
re-investigate the case.

197
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,230
Plus, it's just us two.

198
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,700
If it isn't Choi Sang-hoon,

199
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,330
and someone else is the culprit,
in the worst scenario,

200
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,660
there might be another victim.

201
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,860
What if that's Lim Yoo-ri?

202
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,000
Another victim?

203
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,400
No way, I think Choi Sang-hoon
is the culprit.

204
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,600
Are you hoping that he's the one
or do you really think so?

205
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,630
- Both.
- So are you up for this

206
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,360
or not?

207
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,230
I can't.

208
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,660
It's a message. Sir, I got a text.

209
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,660
I should go.

210
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,329
It's Jin-kang!

211
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,460
We're supposed to have
dinner on Saturday,

212
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,800
but she'd like to change it
to lunch.

213
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:21,260
That's not important now.

214
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:23,200
Yes, it is.

215
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,730
Sir, I'm not sure if it's the best
time to ask you this question…

216
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,900
When is Jin-kang's birthday?

217
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,460
Goodness, you punk.

218
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,060
- April 7th.
- April 7th.

219
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,300
April 7th.

220
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,430
Okay, April 7th.

221
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,730
What time was she born?

222
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,430
You're too young to believe

223
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,960
in such superstitions.

224
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,300
You want to check
your compatibility?

225
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,400
Then, what about you?

226
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,030
When is your birthday
and what time were you born?

227
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,760
Hey, isn't he Eom Cho-rong?

228
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,560
Yeah, he is.

229
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,730
Why's he wearing his uniform
on his day-off? That's hilarious.

230
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,430
He must've wanted to look
cool in front of his girlfriend.

231
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,560
I'm sorry.
I know it's been a while since we met.

232
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,100
But we still had a meal
and even got coffee together.

233
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,900
We can meet again soon.

234
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,300
I don't have to go to work on my day off
since the big cases are closed.

235
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,330
- Eom Cho-rong!
- Salute!

236
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,300
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

237
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,930
- Mrs. Eom?
- Jeez.

238
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,360
- It's not like that.
- Hello.

239
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,200
Hi.

240
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,860
Jin-kang, this is our Captain.

241
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,860
Oh, are you the Captain
of Homicide Squad 3?

242
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,730
Please take care of my brother.

243
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,730
- Your brother?
- Oh, she's the sister of Sergeant Yoo.

244
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,130
- Sergeant Yoo?
- Yes.

245
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,900
I'm Yoo Jin-kang,
Yoo Jin-kook's sister.

246
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,560
Oh, really?

247
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,500
Nice to meet you.

248
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,830
Let's go.

249
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,830
- Salute!
- Goodbye!

250
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,100
That was a surprise.

251
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
- Shall we go?
- Shall we?

252
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,460
Yeah.

253
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,930
(Victim Jung Mi-yeon)

254
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,530
(Middle school in the States)

255
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,630

259
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,830
(Captain Lee Kyung-chul)

260
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,200
- We should go.
- Alright.

261
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,000
Please take her around
to get some fresh air.

262
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,230
- Sure, ma'am.
- I'll be back.

263
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,560
See you at home.

264
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,160
Gosh, why couldn't Seung-ah
make friends

265
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,900
with people in the
same league as her…

266
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,260
Gosh, I feel so alive!

267
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,500
Thanks, Jin-kang!

268
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,430
I'm not sure if I'm doing
the right thing for you.

269
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,600
- Where is your car?
- Uhm…

270
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,860
I don't have it anymore.
Let's take the bus.

271
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,930
I'd like to take the bus.

272
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,200
I really don't know
if this is the best for you.

273
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,230
It's because you don't know
about Moo-young.

274
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,460
You have no idea
what he's done for me.

275
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,700
- What has he done for you?
- Well…

276
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,400
Give me access to the case.

277
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,560
You don't have the
right to stop me

278
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,660
from investigating just
because he's been handed to the prosecution.

279
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,100
You know very well,
I don’t plan to do so.

280
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,730
And… Yoo Jin-kang?

281
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,360
Yoo Jin-kook. Yoo Jin-kang.

282
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,160
You named her to
really sound like your sister.

283
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,330
She's that little kid, right?

284
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,530
She's all grown up now.

285
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,660
I almost couldn't recognize her.

286
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,060
Don't get so tense.

287
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,700
Are you afraid that I might've
told her something?

288
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,330
I didn't say anything.

289
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,500
I even lost my appetite when
I realized she was your sister.

290
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,100
I couldn't say anything.

291
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,300
Hey, Sergeant Yoo!

292
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,930
It's your day off.
Why are you here?

293
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,030
Well, just…

294
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,560
I just dropped by.

295
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,530
So this was all because of him?

296
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,960
Now I see why you're so obsessed
with the Jung Mi-yeon case.

297
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,100
(Kim Moo-young)

298
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,630
It was because of Kim Moo-young.

299
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,030
Why are you so obsessed with him?

300
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,660
- Am I?
- Yeah.

301
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,860
From the way I see it,
these are just several coincidences.

302
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,130
You really think so?

303
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,400
I think he's just a normal kid.

304
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,630
Well, if I may say,

305
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,800
he's got a different energy.

306
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,760
You're just hypersensitive.

307
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,030
Moo-young!

308
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,630
It's because you don't know
about Moo-young.

309
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,030
You have no idea
what he's done for me.

310
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,060
- What has he done for you?
- Myself.

311
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,900
Yourself?

312
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,900
I really feel like myself

313
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,660
only when I'm with him.

314
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,860
Is 7PM enough time for you?

315
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,160
Um… 7:30PM?

316
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,630
- Sure, meet you here at 7:30PM.
- Okay.

317
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,260
- You don't have much time, so bye.
- Thanks, Jin-kang!

318
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,130
- How have you been?
- Nothing much.

319
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,030
Nothing in particular.

320
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,330
Here.

321
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,460
Toast. Cheers!

322
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,660
- I bet you'll end up drinking it.
- No, I won't.

323
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,700
I'm still on the clock,
why'd you drag me all the way here.

324
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,130
Want me to make you feel
the urge to drink?

325
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,930
I overheard what
Lee Kyung-chul said earlier.

326
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,730
You should've smashed his face.

327
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,000
He was being an asshole.

328
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,330
How dare he bring up Jin-kang?

329
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,560
Seriously…

330
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,630
this tastes good.

331
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,830
There is something

332
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,260
I want to tell you so bad.

333
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,100
I'll tell you right after
I bottom this up.

334
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,560
- Enough.
- Why? What's wrong?

335
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,030
Don't say it.

336
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,800
Whatever it is
that you want to say,

337
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,160
save it.

338
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,100
You should forget it,
Sergeant Yoo.

339
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,000
You're saying it, huh?

340
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,230
I mean…

341
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,660
Humans aren't perfect creatures.

342
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,200
No, never.

343
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,960
Everyone makes mistakes.

344
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,200
A mistake…

345
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,960
It's been 25 years already.
You've done enough.

346
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,130
If it's been that long,
you must get over whatever it is.

347
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,800
Stop it.

348
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,360
Think about how adorable
Jin-kang is.

349
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,730
You've raised her so well.

350
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,330
That already proves

351
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,330
you deserve to be happy.

352
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,930
Alright.

353
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Now I really want to drink.
So stop talking and let's drink.

354
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:47,760
- Take it.
- Pour it.

355
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,260
- Here you go.
- Cheers!

356
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,160
'Take a rest before you go'
means this?

357
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,860
It's fun, isn't it?

358
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,900
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Of course.

359
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,900
I was the one who wanted
to come here.

360
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,230
Then… we can rest here
before we go.

361
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,500
Why are you just standing there?

362
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,100
- Let's leave.
- What?

363
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,330
You can't even touch the bedsheets
because it's disgusting.

364
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,330
That's not true.

365
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,060
I can touch it well.

366
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,800
I don't like this kind of place.

367
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,260
I love you.

368
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,730
(Jin-kook)

369
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,860
Jin-kang!

370
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,300
- You must've been bored. What did you do?
- Not at all.

371
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,330
I enjoyed the view, I took a walk,
and I also had coffee.

372
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,960
Time flew.

373
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,700
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah, thanks to you.

374
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,030
Mom.

375
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,800
Mom!

376
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,100
Mom, are you crazy?

377
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,960
You classless brat!

378
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,630
This is all because of you.

379
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,700
- Let's go.
- Let me go!

380
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,300
Let go! Moo-young!

381
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,100
That lady is really something…

382
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,000
You've never gotten
slapped before?

383
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,800
This really must be your first time.

384
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,700
Do you want to go and eat?

385
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,460
I'm sure you didn't eat anything.

386
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,860
It sucks if you eat alone
on a day like this.

387
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,530
So?

388
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,660
Why should I even eat with you?

389
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,230
Right, this was my first time
getting slapped.

390
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,130
I don't know
what's going on at all.

391
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,430
I'm so embarrassed, upset
and hurt.

392
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,330
Why should I even eat with you?

393
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,900
Why should I eat with you
just to make things more fun for you

394
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,060
when you're enjoying
this so much already?

395
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,960
Why would I? Why?

396
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,800
- Don't, if you don't want to.
- I don't want to!

397
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,800
I don't!

398
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,600
This is all because of you!

399
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,300
It's natural that
Seung-ah's mother got mad.

400
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,960
I would hate it too

401
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,160
if my daughter dated
someone like you.

402
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,000
No mom in the world would like it.

403
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,530
- Is that so?
- Yes!

404
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,360
So go!

405
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,300
So just leave me alone!

406
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,200
Okay.

407
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,930
My silly girl.
She can't become a swan.

408
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,630
- She's just silly.
- You just love her so much.

409
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,900
Unbelievable.

410
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,200
She wouldn't hurt you even if
you put her into your eyes.

411
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,700
I haven't tried.
Should I try putting her?

412
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,500
Come here, get in!

413
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,260
Gosh, it hurts!

414
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,630
What a fool.

415
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,160
She's still so immature.

416
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,230
You're one to talk.

417
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,660
She matured a long time ago.

418
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,230
Really? Has she grown up already?

419
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,730
That's right. She's just pretending
she's immature,

420
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,660
so you feel comfortable.

421
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,760
Right.
How do you know so well, Tak?

422
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,960
Tak, you're the best!

423
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,800
Look.

424
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:27,830
She's pretending she's immature

425
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,060
because I'll be sad
if I realize she's matured.

426
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,700
And if I pretend to know
that she's matured,

427
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,160
- she'll be sad so...
- Yeah.

428
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,730
That's why I'm treating her

429
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,700
- like a child.
- Yes.

430
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,430
That's why she's acting like a child.

431
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,030
- Yes.
- So I treat her…

432
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,400
Treat her like a child,

433
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,500
- so this is being childish.
- Ah.

434
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,860
I get it. But…

435
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,960
what the hell
are you talking about?

436
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:02,400
And how do I understand this?

437
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,630
Sergeant Yoo.

438
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,130
Yes.

439
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,800
You got old, too.

440
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,400
You're getting old

441
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,460
yet you're not thinking of yourself.

442
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,960
Why are you still here?

443
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,330
Look.

444
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,100
There are so many strange things
in this world.

445
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,760
- What's this?
- I think it's the Executive Director's doing.

446
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,760
Call the Head of HR in.

447
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,560
Yes, sir.

448
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,100
Mrs. Baek is here.

449
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,300
I don't know if I should say this,

450
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,930
but there's one thing
you should know…

451
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,560
Money is scarier than you think.

452
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,100
Oh dear.

453
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,500
Please forgive us.

454
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,730
This will…

455
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,500
This will never happen again…

456
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,360
What do you think you're doing?

457
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,930
Ah…

458
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,360
Seung-ah wants to make a deal.

459
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,130
And it's taking a while for me
to calculate things.

460
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,600
You may leave.

461
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,360
I'll call you when it's time.

462
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,900
Jin-kang, it's me Seung-ah.

463
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,030
I'm texting you with
my helper's phone.

464
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,730
You classless brat!

465
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,200
This is all because of you!

466
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,200
I'm so embarrassed, upset
and hurt.

467
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,630
This is all because of you!

468
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,730
So just leave me alone!

469
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,930
What? Did you just throw it away?

470
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,300
It's all broken!

471
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,060
It's expensive.
You should've given it to me!

472
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,360
Did he get dumped by Seung-ah?

473
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,030
Of course you can't beat
a billionaire.

474
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,260
Why didn't you say anything
after I sent you a gift?

475
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,800
I'm impressed by Seung-ah.

476
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,800
Frankly speaking, she's so
quiet and boring.

477
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,230
I was wondering how you
could meet her for years.

478
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,100
But she's brave.

479
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,030
She's attractive.

480
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,700
Now, I even think
she's too good for you.

481
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,930
Things aren't going to go the
way you want, brat.

482
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,460
Oh, what then?

483
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,760
Are you going to marry her
after all?

484
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,330
This is getting interesting!

485
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,330
(Jin-kang, it's me Seung-ah)

486
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,300
(I'm texting you with
my helper's phone)

487
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,360
(Please send this to Moo-young)

488
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,360
(Kim Moo-young)

489
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,100
I don't want to!

490
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,830
I don't!

491
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,100
This is all because of you!

492
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,830
It's natural that
Seung-ah's mother got mad.

493
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,360
I would hate it too

494
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,700
if my daughter dated
someone like you.

495
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,460
No mom in the world would like it.

496
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:30,200
- Is that so?
- Yes!

497
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,530
So go!

498
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,530
So just leave me alone!

499
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,060
Can we meet this evening?

500
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,130
What's up with you?

501
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,330
You asking me out?

502
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Seung-ah asked me to
send this to you.

503
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,700
That's it?

504
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,100
You could've texted me.

505
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,960
That's right.

506
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:22,800
I'd like to apologize.
I'm sorry about that day.

507
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,760
It wasn't even your fault.

508
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,200
I crossed the line.

509
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,960
What are you doing?

510
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,030
Saying sorry isn't enough.

511
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,560
Buy me lunch first.

512
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,900
Hey, wait!

513
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,530
Hey!

514
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,760
Wait!

515
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,930
I realized something important.

516
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,760
I decided to be smarter
from now on.

517
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,660
I'm going to find a way
that we can be together forever.

518
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,700
- I want to eat too.
- Sure.

519
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,130
I'm not going to see him again.

520
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,630
It was my fault.

521
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,700
My love for you won't ever change.

522
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,630
So just wait for me.

523
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,230
You said you had lunch already.

524
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,760
- Excuse me, can we get 2 more?
- Okay.

525
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,330
That's why you should've
eaten faster!

526
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,560
Eat slowly.

527
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,430
Do you still want to run an errand for her
after getting slapped?

528
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,060
This is the last time.
I won't do it again.

529
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,360
- The order is wrong.
- What?

530
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,560
Jin-kang, it's me Seung-ah.
I'm texting you with my helper's phone.

531
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,130
Please send this to Moo-young.

532
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,600
She never apologized.

533
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,160
It's because she was in a hurry.

534
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,260
Also, she was using
someone else's phone.

535
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,360
That lady too.

536
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,630
If she were to slap someone,
should've been her daughter first

537
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,130
and her boyfriend next.

538
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,900
The order is strange!

539
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,400
Don't talk about it.
It makes my heart pound.

540
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,400
It's because
her daughter is precious.

541
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,930
Then you're not precious?

542
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,860
I said stop it already.

543
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:12,100
It bothers me even without
you bringing it up.

544
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,660
Even if I didn't want to,
I thought about it more than 10,000 times.

545
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:19,060
Every time I think about it,
I feel sad, pathetic

546
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,430
and apologetic
just like that moment.

547
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,660
I get that you feel sad
and pathetic,

548
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,200
but what's apologetic about?

549
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,400
My brother.

550
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,730
I let someone slap my face
like a fool.

551
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,360
I feel sorry to him.

552
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,760
When I think of that,
I start to hate Seung-ah.

553
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,400
Yes, meat!

554
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,660
Eat up. It's on me.

555
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,330
What?

556
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,660
Don't give me that look.

557
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,100
Your mom would've done
the same for you.

558
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,200
All moms are like that.

559
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,700
I don't know.
I've never had a mom.

560
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,400
- What about a dad?
- I don't have one.

561
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,400
Since when?

562
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,860
Since I was young.

563
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,430
Hey.

564
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,530
Let's not feel pity for us
with that.

565
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,230
We're turning 30 soon.

566
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,030
- I don't have parents either.
- I know.

567
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,460
Oh, did Seung-ah tell you?

568
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:51,000
I feel like I knew it
from the beginning.

569
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,760
Does it show that I was raised
without parents?

570
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,500
- Then, who raised you?
- The orphanage.

571
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,800
- You said don't feel pity.
- Who did?

572
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,830
I didn't feel pity at all.

573
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,800
Enjoy your meal.

574
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,130
And I'm 30 already.

575
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,760
I'm not turning 30 soon,
but I'm already 30.

576
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:37,660
So what?

577
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,060
Call me oppa.

578
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,630
Jin-kook!
This weirdo is teasing me.

579
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,760
When did you get that?

580
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,030
Now you're asking.

581
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,630
I don't remember.
What about you?

582
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,360
I don't remember either.

583
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,960
Jin-kook said there was a fire
at home.

584
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:09,930
What about your parents?

585
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,730
My dad died even
before I was born.

586
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,360
Mom died when I was 7.

587
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:18,130
My sister immigrated abroad
before I entered grade school.

588
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,100
I've lived with my brother.

589
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,900
He raised me all by himself.

590
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,360
It's amazing that
you never got hurt.

591
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,130
I was lying.

592
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,730
That was a lie when I said
I never got hurt.

593
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,800
It's obvious.

594
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:50,000
How could I not get hurt
when I don't have parents

595
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,900
and I even have a
burn scar on my arm?

596
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,860
Now I know.

597
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,800
- What?
- Why I want to pick a fight with you.

598
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:11,100
You remind me of grade school.

599
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,660
My grade school life
that was like war.

600
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,860
That was another lie.

601
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:20,160
I got slapped before.

602
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,660
By a teacher when I was 9.

603
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,630
- If it's just once, that's not too bad.
- Yeah?

604
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,460
But…

605
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:35,360
I was too young then

606
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,030
so I told my brother.

607
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,660
He cried that night

608
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,100
under his blanket.

609
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,860
He cried a lot.

610
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:58,200
Eat up.

611
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,430
- Nice job with all your lies.
- Thanks.

612
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,730
An alien and a reptile.

613
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,330
An alien and a crocodile wallet.

614
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,800
I had tons of other
nicknames, too.

615
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,400
When I was in Haesan,

616
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,630
those kids used to throw
my bag away into the chicken coop.

617
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,630
- Haesan?
- Yes, during grade school.

618
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,530
Why?

619
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,200
I used to live in Haesan too.

620
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,900
Really?
The orphanage was in Haesan?

621
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,730
Right.

622
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,300
Why are kids so cruel?

623
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:45,430
When it comes to cruelty,
adults are worse.

624
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,100
But there are more good people
in the world.

625
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,430
You're jaded, aren't you?

626
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,360
Don't be.

627
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,700
I'll get going.

628
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,900
How's the cat doing?

629
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:09,960
- Yeah.
- What's its name?

630
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,760
Its name?

631
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:16,200
- Kang.
- Kang.

632
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,230
It's a pretty name.

633
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,260
Last name is Jin, first name is Kang.

634
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,230
I'm the idiot for asking.

635
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,930
You know
you're like a grade schooler.

636
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,930
It doesn't have a name.

637
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,030
What will you
do when you lose it?

638
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,660
I'm not going to lose it.
It's not mine.

639
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:39,060
I always tell it to go away.

640
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:43,160
I think I'm going to continue
hating you.

641
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,460
Good luck with that.

642
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:57,500
Thanks.

643
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,900
Are you going to jump?

644
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,330
Play with me. I'm really fun.

645
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,130
(Fortune telling)

646
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:31,300
The man was born
on January 11th, 1990, Shin

647
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,500
and the girl was born
on April 7th, 1990.

648
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,830
You want to check
their compatibility?

649
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,530
No, that's not it.

650
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,260
Please let me know the time
for the girl

651
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:46,030
that works best with the man.

652
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:50,360
Jin.

Still, no more medication.

I won't prescribe you anymore.

to get better, too.

I'm going to kill you!

I'm going to kill both
you and that woman!

I want you to die!

676

That jerk?

00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,430
Don't call him 'that jerk.'

679
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,930
He's not a jerk.

680
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,930
I've never seen him
like that before.

- What about dad?
- I don't have one.

- Then who raised you?
- The orphanage.

683
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,600
He's never mentioned any of that
stuff to me before.

He…

685
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:13,030
told something that
he hasn't told you before

686
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,800
to someone else, right?

687
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,500
Do you like him?

688
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,730
No, I don't!

689
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,730
Why does everybody ask me
that question?

690
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,660
I really don't like him!

691
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:32,630
I really don't!
But why is everybody asking me?

692
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,330
You think I don't know you?

693
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,960
You're planning to
collect my story

694
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,060
and sell your book again, right?

695

I won't fall for that twice.

696
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,930
Pills.

697
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,030
Give me pills.

please?

700

702
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,530
Give me some pills!

703
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,300
Are we getting pork or beef?

704
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,160
- You heard that? Beef!
- Beef!

Salute!

707

Don't tell him

708
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,830
we're going to have
dinner together tonight.

709

He'll totally ruin the mood.

710
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,530
- I wouldn't do that.
- Huh?

- Come on.
