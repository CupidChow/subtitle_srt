(Psychiatrist Yang Kyung-mo)

8
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,300
I guess this was when you were going
through a turbulent time.

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,430
How old were you then?

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,100
I was 27.

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,000
Actually, I was 28.

12
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,860
You were very handsome.

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,160
And charming.

14
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,530
Why is he in this…

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,530
Pardon?

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,400
I mean, why is he in this picture…

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,360
Are you, by any chance,
talking about

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,030
- the boy of destiny?
- Ah, yes.

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,200
I didn't know, either.
Now that the photo has been enlarged…

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,860
I can see that he's in here…

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,330
What a coincidence.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,330
Actually, my next question
was going to be about that boy.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
That being said,

24
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,500
let's move onto the next question.

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,860
You said an encounter with a boy
changed your life

26
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,830
when you were having a difficult time
adjusting to medical school.

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,500
So, I wonder just how much
an 8-year-old boy

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,460
could possibly change

29
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,000
a grown man's life.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,200
He had quite a mysterious look
in his eyes.

31
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,960
At first, I chased him around
out of curiosity.

32
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,759
- Did you?
- Yes.

33
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,600
But then,
I realized later on

34
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,130
that everything I'd been through

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,730
was to meet this boy.

36
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,060
(Episode 1)
was to meet this boy.

37
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,600
(Episode 1)

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,100
That sounds very interesting.
(Episode 1)

39
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,530
That sounds very interesting.

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,900
Then, would you say that

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,260
your encounter with the boy

42
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,930
made you who you are today?

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,829
Absolutely. That's what I think.

44
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,930
I'm getting more and more
curious now.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,660
Please tell us more.

46
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,930
Yes, I got it.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,130
- Hey, Jae-min.
- Yes.

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,160
What are you doing?

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,060
I mean, around the time she fell…

50
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,460
were there any witnesses or…

51
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,930
anyone who

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,160
heard weird noises?

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,829
So, you mean, no one
knew about this

54
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,360
until you found the corpse and
reported it to the police, right?

55
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,030
- You don't know when it happened.
- Correct.

56
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,030
I had no idea.

57
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,200
You know how crazy it was
last night

58
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,829
with the rain and thunder.

59
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,100
Gosh, do you mind
if I turn the TV off?

60
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,660
- No, go for it.
- Cho-rong.

61
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,060
He would be around thirty by now.

62
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,400
What do you think
he'd be doing now?

63
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,130
Do you have any idea, Doctor Yang?

64
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,400
No, not at all.

65
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,329
That's what I've
always wondered, too.

66
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,530
How did he turn out?

67
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,530
Let's go.

68
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,230
- Hi.
- Salute!

69
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,630
What brings you here,
Section Chief?

70
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,829
Why haven't you gone home yet?
You're off duty today.

71
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,899
I should at least know
what happened before I leave.

72
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,329
What is it?

73
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,360
It was suicide by jumping.

74
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,700
- A 22-year-old college girl.
- Why would a 22-year-old do this?

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,900
We don't know yet.

76
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,360
My eyes locked with
the dead girl's eyes earlier and…

77
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,130
Aw…

78
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,230
She was so pretty.

79
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,800
Why would a pretty girl like her
commit suicide?

80
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,100
- Are you sure?
- Yes, she was definitely pretty.

81
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:44,760
Gosh, you little.
I mean, are you sure it's suicide?

82
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,800
Well, it's probably…

83
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,030
- Almost…
- Look me straight in the eye.

84
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,400
Huh? Section Chief.

85
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,830
Wow…

86
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,030
Hey.

87
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,930
What? Huh?

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,200
What's so surprising?

89
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,230
Wow, you must be going
somewhere really fancy.

90
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,760
Wow, maybe because
her family is super-rich

91

94
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:11,800
even the invitation
looks luxurious.

95
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,130
(You're sincerely invited to
Baek Seung-ah's Ceramic Exhibitions)
even the invitation
looks luxurious.

96
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,960
Seung-ah's family isn't
super-rich.

97
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,400
My phone,

98
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,660
wallet, and portfolio…

99
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,760
Checked, checked, and checked…

100
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,130
Here you go, Manager Yoo.

101
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,000
- The invitation, checked.
- Good luck.

102
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,560
- See you.
- Alright, see you.

103
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,900
Are you going now?

104
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,800
- Did you pack the portfolio?
- Yes.

105
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,800
Okay, then, go get
changed already.

106
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,360
What's this?

107
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,230
You know our company's fate
lies in your hands today, right?

108
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,360
And that's what
you're wearing, huh?

109
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,400
She's a bit late, though.

110
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,360
That's right. I'm late.
I'll go and get changed there.

111
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,930
Will you? Okay, alright.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,630
Change as soon as
you get there.

113
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,700
Before you meet Jang Woo-sang.

114
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,960
I heard that today's event is
actually being hosted

115
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,160
by the son of NJ Group's chairman.

116
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,760
From the exhibition to the reception, all
for his girlfriend's birthday.

117
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,800
What a life.

118
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,200
What the heck?
It's not even rush hour.

119
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,860
Is there a car accident
or something?

120
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,830
Gosh, who cares?

121
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,960
I'm not working. I'm off duty.
It's none of my business.

122
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,360
Hmm, I don't see anything.

123
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,630
I'll check first and then
call my insurance company, okay?

124
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,360
You were driving like…

125
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,060
Alright, now that I called
the insurance company…

126
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,260
- Forget about the insurance…
- Move.

127
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,260
- He's moving the car right now.
- Move.

128
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,159
Move forward.
Gosh, please don't fight.

129
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,700
I'm not trying to fight,
but this guy is…

130
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,760
Go on.

131
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,230
(Get a boyfriend for
goodness sake)

132
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
- Hey.
- Where are you? Are you on your way here?

133
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,960
Of course, I'm on my way.

134
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,760
I'm flying over there.
Are you on your way, too?

135
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,660
Yes.

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,760
Oh, I'm opening my car door
right now.

137
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,860
I'm getting out of the car
like this.

138
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,360
Yes, I just opened the door.
Yes, just now.

139
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,200
(Light and Soil)

140
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,400
- Seung-ah.
- Oh, Jin-kang.

141
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,630
What's wrong? Are you sick?

142
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,300
No. I should go in now.

143
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,300
You're nervous, right?

144
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,400
I want to die.

145
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,200
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

146
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,299
I was just kidding.

147
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,100
- Were you surprised?
- Hey.

148
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,260
You freaked me out.

149
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,760
What's all this?

150
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,760
Why don't you leave it in my car?

151
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,130
Huh?

152
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,060
Should I?

153
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,160
Let's go.

154
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,130
Wow, Moo-young.

155
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,000
Look at this.

156
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,730
This is crazy.

157
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,000
Wow.

158
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,260
Isn't this cool, Moo-young?

159
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,900
She never showed up
to prepare.

160
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,160
But, people are still calling
her an artist.

161
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,630
She was born with a silver spoon,
you know.

162
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,000
Hey, no matter how rich she is,
this is still way too much.

163
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,230
She's pretty, you know.

164
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm jealous of her car, though.

165
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,330
780S white?

166
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,730
That was a Valentine's day gift
from her boyfriend.

167
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,700
Because Baek Seung-ah is pretty.

168
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,630
You know she's really pretty.

169
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,300
Did you hear that, Moo-young?

170
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,060
That car was
Baek Seung-ah's.

171
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,930
You can come down
in about 20 minutes.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,730
The reception party starts at 8.

173
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,960
It's going to be an amazing party.

174
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,300
Director Jang said

175
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,960
not to tell you this
as it's supposed to be a surprise…

176
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,660
- Okay, thank you.
- Umm…

177
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,360
The Artist Talk session
with the reporters

178
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,930
starts at 7 and will last
for about 30 minutes.

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,730
The Artist Talk session?

180
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,830
Since reporters are showing
such keen interest in your exhibition,

181
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,230
they want to talk directly
to you than me.

182
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,700
Why would you decide on such a thing
without consulting me first?

183
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,760
I received direct orders from
Director Jang…

184
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,630
Woo-sang. Where are you?

185
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Where's Director Jang?
Is he there?

186
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,600
Um, not yet.

187
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,760
What about the clothes?
Did you change?

188
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,160
Of course, I did.
It fits me perfectly. I love it.

189
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,660
Great. You're all set to charge.

190
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,900
Then, now go and flirt
with Jang Woo-sang.

191
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,930
Here you go, Director Jang.

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,100
A new standard for brand design,
Design & Look.

193
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,630
I hope to receive
your great support.

194
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,730
- Okay?
- Okay.

195
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,530
Aw, it's done.

196
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,000
Director Jang. Okay?

197
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,160
Well, let's do it.
It's just a little flirting.

198
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,200
I'm sorry. Are you alright?

199
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,430
I'm so sorry.

200
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,030
Are you working for Arts,
by any chance?

201
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,560
- Yes.
- Oh…

202
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,300
Are they going
to serve your beer today?

203
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,330
What kind of beer will you serve?

204
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,600
Lummen Belgium Ale,
Sunshine Golden Ale.

205
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,600
Live Lime Pale Ale,

206
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,400
Blue Label Light Stout,

207
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,300
and Clove Weizenbier.

208
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,530
How about Something You Brown Ale

209
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,930
and Last Dance IPA?

210
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,260
We don't have those today.

211
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,200
You don't.

212
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,400
I see.

213
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,100
Is this your car?

214
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,160
Oh, no. It's my friend's car.

215
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,500
Well, no wonder.

216
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,160
What do you mean?

217
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,500
No wonder,
you don't look that pretty.

218
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,600
Hey, look. Do you know me?

219
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,700
No, not at all.

220
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,300
I guess your outfit's new, huh?

221
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,760
What's he talking about?

222
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,100
What's new?

223
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,860
You said you were flying,
but you're walking.

224
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,960
See? I'm running.

225
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,000
Wow, who is this?

226
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,460
Are you really the Yoo Jin-kang
I know?

227
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,600
Stop it. Stop it.

228
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,630
Don't say a thing. I know.

229
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,630
You're definitely the Yoo Jin-kang
I know. Here.

230
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,100
Huh? This is…

231
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,130
Ah, that's why…

232
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,760
So…

233
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,930
Gosh, so embarrassing.

234
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,100
Gosh, I'm more embarrassed, okay?

235
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,930
Just because
you bought new clothes,

236
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
you don't need to advertise it
all over the neighborhood.

237
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,000
- I bought new clothes, people.
- Stop it.

238
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,000
Shush, shush.

239
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,200
- There she is.
- Jin-kook.

240
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,930
Congratulations, Artist Baek.

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,130
Thank you so much.

242
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,960
Wow, it looks awesome.

243
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,260
Did you make all of this?

244
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,400
- Isn't this amazing?
- It's amazing, indeed.

245
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,030
I heard you're throwing
an after party, too.

246
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,730
Woo-sang's prepared fireworks
as well.

247
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,560
- For Seung-ah's birthday gift.
- That sounds wonderful.

248
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,800
While someone's getting that kind
of present from a boyfriend…

249
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,660
- Has she been single since birth?
- No way.

250
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,260
People usually keep their love
lives a secret from their family.

251
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,130
I really hope that's the case.

252
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,030
Oh, he's here.

253
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,860
Wow, he's much better-looking
in person.

254
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,360
Jin-kook, could you
excuse me for a second?

255
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,530
No problem.

256
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,530
We need to talk.

257
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,400
Why does she look so upset
on such a great day like this?

258
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,500
I know, right?

259
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,760
- Shall we?
- Yep.

260
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,530
What's your problem again,
Miss Baek Seung-ah?

261
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,100
Cancel it. The Artist Talk.

262
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,500
- Why?
- How much longer do I have to…

263
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,760
Professor Hong will be here, too.

264
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,800
How could I do such a thing
in front of the professor?

265
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,960
Why not? In this case,
you should do it even more.

266
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,800
Woo-sang.

267
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,460
Let's just remove the pieces
that the professor made, okay?

268
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,130
White Shadow,
Cherry Blossom Sound.

269
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,300
Just looking at it
makes me feel suffocated.

270
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,930
This is seriously wrong.

271
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,800
How could I hold an exhibition
with art that isn't even my own work?

272
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,760
You said you'd like to
hold a private exhibition,

273
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,330
but it's above your capability.

274
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,800
I thought you also agreed.

275
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,900
I didn't know
things would get this big.

276
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,400
Whose idea do you think this was
in the first place?

277
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,300
Hong Ji-won.

278
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,430
- That woman.
- What?

279
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,600
She wanted to sell her work, so I bought it.
I don't see a problem here.

280
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,830
It's all yours now.

281
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,500
Hey.

282
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,900
What are you doing?

283
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,500
Kim Moo-young?

284
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Are you an Arts employee?

285
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,360
You know what this means, right?
Mister Kim Moo-young.

286
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,960
I do.

287
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:17,260
So what do they want from us?

288
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,160
- Right now?
- Woo-sang.

289
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,030
I have to get back to the office.

290
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,599
You're going to be fine, right?

291
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,230
- Woo-sang.
- Aren't you going to take this?

292
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,930
Do you really not want to do it?

293
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,130
The Artist Talk?

294
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,160
If you hate it so much,
then just don't do it.

295
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,700
What's so hard about that?

296
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,400
Look. You just keep
your promise, okay?

297
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,730
Promise? Ah, I made a promise,
didn't I?

298
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,700
What are you doing?

299
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,030
Because I don't want
to keep it anymore.

300
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,260
I don't want to keep
a promise like that.

301
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,530
You don't want
to keep the promise?

302
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,730
Why, all of a sudden…

303
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,760
Then, tell me what you want.

304
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,800
Hmm…

305
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,360
Don't do it. The Artist Talk.

306
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,200
Why?

307
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,230
I see. You actually
want to do it, huh?

308
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,460
I see what's going on.

309
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,000
You pretend like you
don't want to do it.

310
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,700
But, you still pretend
you made all of that.

311
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,100
What do you think you're doing?

312
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,860
Because you have something on me,

313
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,360
do I look that easy to you?

314
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,100
A little bit?

315
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,660
What do you know about me?

316
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,860
Who do you think you are
to tell me what to do…

317
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,660
I feel pathetic enough

318
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,130
without you making it worse.

319
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,130
I feel so pathetic that
I want to kill myself.

320
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,630
However, what choice do I have
when I've come this far?

321
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,260
What do you want me to do now?

322
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,830
I got it.

323
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,400
Hey.

324
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,430
Hey, what do you think you know…

325
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,860
I know that Baek Seung-ah doesn't

326
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,160
want to do the Artist Talk.

327
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,100
And now that I know,
you don't need to do it.

328
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,960
Hey.

329
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,100
Jin-kook.

330
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,800
Have you seen Seung-ah?

331
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,200
- I haven't seen her since then.
- I know, right?

332
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,830
Where did she go?

333
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,400
Do you really not want to do it?
The Artist Talk?

334
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,300
If you hate it so much,
then just don't do it.

335
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,460
What's so hard about that?

336
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,060
You pretend like you
don't want to do it.

337
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,530
But, you still pretend
you made all of that.

338
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,060
I see. You actually
want to do it, huh?

339
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,800
When is the artist coming?

340
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,560
Gosh, I don't have
much time, though.

341
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,760
- It's half past seven.
- Should we just leave?

342
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,700
The Artist Talk will start now.

343
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,700
- It fell off.
- Oh, my gosh.

344
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,260
What happened?

345
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,260
It wasn't me.

346
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,560
This guy…

347
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,460
I'm sorry. Because of me…

348
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,130
What the heck did you do?

349
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,600
Get over here and
clean it up, okay?

350
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,560
Security.

351
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,360
Section Chief. It turned out to be
a homicide, not suicide.

352
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,400
It's a murder case.

353
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,600
Can I get a refill of
Sunshine Golden Ale?

354
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,460
- Refill?
- I'll have the same one, please.

355
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,600
Yes, the same one.

356
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,160
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

357
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,630
Drink this.

358
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,330
Since you were looking for
Something You Brown Ale.

359
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,900
Don't, if you don't want to.

360
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,330
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

361
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,600
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

362
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,960
- Can I have another one?
- Ah, here it is.

363
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,400
I just poured this.

364
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,830
- How did it go?
- Well…

365
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,600
- Am I that ugly?
- What?

366
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,400
I said do I look that ugly?

367
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,230
- Yes, you look absolutely ugly.
- Hey.

368
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,430
You have an ugly personality, too.

369
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,100
What's wrong? Did somebody
tell you that you look ugly again?

370
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,760
That guy on the right,
with the black shirt.

371
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,660
That's right. What people see is
no different from what I see.

372
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,860
You must be happy that

373
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,500
your beloved little sister

374
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,200
looks ugly in people's eyes.

375
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,800
It serves you right.

376
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,400
Anyways, have we… seen that guy

377
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,230
somewhere before?

378
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,130
I mean, do we know him?

379
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,430
You saw him
breaking the pottery earlier.

380
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,430
I mean, before that.

381
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,300
No. I'd never seen such a rude guy

382
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,460
like him in my whole life.

383
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,730
Is that so?

384
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,360
By the way,
when will the fireworks start?

385
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,960
That's right.

386
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,530
It'll start in no time.
Let's go grab a good spot.

387
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,030
- Good seat, good seat.
- That way, that way.

388
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,060
- Jin-kang. Jin-kang.
- Huh?

389
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,860
What's that you've been holding?

390
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,600
It keeps getting in the way.

391
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,200
- That's right. Jang Woo-sang.
- What?

392
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,630
Gosh, forget it.
He left a while back.

393
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,400
- Let's just drink.
- Yes, let's drink.

394
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,760
- Let's go.
- Let's go that way.

395
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,260
You're going to spill it again.

396
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,560
How many kegs did you change?

397
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,800
I changed it three times
while you were gone.

398
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,730
Hui-joon.

399
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,260
Keep an eye on it for a bit, okay?

400
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,900
Moo-young.

401
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,700
Well…

402
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,860
you did that on purpose
earlier, right?

403
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,430
But why?

404
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,030
Um…

405
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,030
- Because you're really pretty.
- Pardon?

406
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,300
What the…

407
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,500
Aren't you disappointed?
I heard it was really expensive.

408
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,200
No.

409
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,600
No, I feel like I could fly.

410
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,900
It's all good then.
Go and have fun now.

411
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,700
Seung-ah.

412
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,460
Baek Seung-ah.

413
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,660
He's looking for you.

414
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,630
- Wow.
- Wow…

415
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,430
Wow.

416
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,700
Cheers.

417
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,260
(Woo-sang)

418
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,130
What do I do?
(Woo-sang)

419
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,700
What do I do?

420
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
(Woo-sang)

421
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,230
The person you're trying
to reach is unavailable…

422
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
He's gone.

423
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,860
Here's your birthday gift
since it's your birthday.

424
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,900
Congratulations.

425
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,430
Hey.

426
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,960
Gosh, it's so loud.

427
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,460
Too loud, hey.

428
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,200
I said, it's too loud. Get up.

429
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,260
Get up. Get up.

430
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,660
Look at how lazy you are.

431
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,200
You didn't even eat the breakfast
I cooked for you.

432
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,130
Do you even wash your hair
at least once every three days?

433
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,300
That's why you don't
have a boyfriend.

434
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,930
You didn't know?
I do have a boyfriend.

435
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,260
A serious one.

436
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,330
A boyfriend?

437
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,300
I haven't found any evidence of

438
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,400
your boyfriend
for the past 2 years.

439
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,660
For the last 2 years, you haven't
had any type of sleepover,

440
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,730
sexy underwear, or

441
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,400
sneaked out to
make a phone call.

442
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,730
On your birthdays or
Valentine's days,

443
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,500
you've never come home with

444
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,430
any jewelry that smell like guys

445
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,100
such as rings, earrings,
necklaces, bracelets, or etc.

446
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,430
- What a great rapper you are.
- Peace.

447
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,860
Come on. You know
that I'm a born detective,

448
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,400
the veteran of veterans.

449
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,630
As soon as I joined the police department,
seniors were showering me with

450
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,000
compliments like where on earth
did this amazing guy come from?

451
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,660
You were born with it.
You're just a natural…

452
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,830
Even so, you're just
a Section Chief.

453
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,430
What did you say?

454
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,530
What now?

455
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,500
As long as I've known you, you've

456
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,260
never once been
a veteran detective.

457
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,330
To top it off, your nickname
is Section Chief Yoo. Why?

458
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,460
Because you don't look like a
detective, but a company employee.

459
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,760
A section chief who's been in that
position for God knows how long.

460
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,400
How did you know?

461
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,560
- Tak sister told me everything.
- This little…

462
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,730
Get lost. You're late.
Have a good day.

463
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,030
You too.

464
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,230
Chin up, Section Chief Yoo.

465
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,830
So what did Jang Woo-sang say?

466
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,600
What, don't tell me
you didn't even hand it over.

467
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,730
You did. Please say you did.

468
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Come on. It could bring in 3 hundred
thousand dollars per year.

469
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,500
Can't we just use your connection
for once?

470
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,930
- How could my friend's boyfriend…
- Darn it.

471
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,930
He could also be my connection.
Precious connection.

472
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,830
Gosh, seriously.

473
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,700
President Hwang, but I think
we're going to be fine.

474
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,430
I think we can win the bid
even without a connection.

475
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,500
I'm absolutely confident in
our presentation this time.

476
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,900
I don't care. I hate you.

477
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,230
I hate myself, too.

478
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,630
Gosh.

479
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,500
Victim Jung Mi-yeon. Age 22.
She was a junior studying

480
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,530
contemporary dance at Sungmin
Univ. She was taking a gap year.

481
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,930
We checked the black box
footage from a nearby car

482
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,460
in front of the garden
where the victim fell onto,

483
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:50,030
and found out that the exact time the fall
happened was at 3:04am yesterday.

484
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,260
The immediate cause of death was
cervical spine injury. However,

485
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,660
judging by the amount of blood
we checked through luminol tests,

486
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,100
the victim had already
suffered a fatal injury

487
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,630
in the occipital area
caused by blunt force trauma,

488
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,630
and sheltered herself
in the balcony

489
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,260
before someone purposely

490
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,929
forced her to jump from there.

491
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,199
Afterwards, the criminal
cleaned the crime scene

492
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,800
very thoroughly then ran away.

493
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,060
This is the photo we took
when we first got there.

494
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:23,530
As you can see,
it looked perfectly clean.

495
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,659
Next is
the luminol reaction photo.

496
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:30,960
Gosh, I'd rather turn myself in
than clean all of that.

497
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,199
Cleaning blood is no joke,
you know.

498
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,800
I mean, why are you…

499
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,400
Salute.

500
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,260
Where have you been?

501
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,460
- What do you mean where? I just arrived.
- Where's the weapon?

502
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,800
Yes.

503
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,260
At the 1st autopsy,
we found this metal fragment

504
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,830
in the victim's occipital area.

505
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,100
It's made of similar material
to her dance competition trophy.

506
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,860
So they're running some tests
as we speak.

507
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,700
But, we weren't able to find the trophy
at the crime scene.

508
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Judging by the shape of
the victim's injury,

509
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,000
the criminal must be left-handed.

510
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,400
Left-handed, huh?

511
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,160
Can you specify the suspect?

512
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,660
Yes, the key suspect is
her boyfriend, Choi Sang-hoon.

513
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,030
(A photo of Jung Mi-yeon's
birthday party)

514
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,630
This is Choi Sang-hoon.
(A photo of Jung Mi-yeon's
birthday party)

515
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,960
This is Choi Sang-hoon.

516
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,200
We found a small amount of

517
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,200
male DNA under her nails.

518
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,500
And according to their friends,

519
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,860
they argued a lot lately.

520
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,500
And Choi Sang-hoon's car was…

521
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,830
Well, Jae-min.

522
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,600
Um, we've got proof that

523
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,030
Choi Sang-hoon's car
was parked in the parking lot

524
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,000
from 2:08am to 4:24am

525
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,000
- on the same day.
- Can we locate him?

526
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,130
Um, the thing is,
he left the country…

527
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,460
He flew to Canada
the same morning,

528
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:46,300
and now he's been out of contact.

529
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,560
Canada?

530
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,830
Could you give me some more eggs?

531
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,800
Enjoy.

532
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,460
Thank you.

533
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,460
Enjoy your meal.

534
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,760
Hey, what the heck?
Are you going to eat alone?

535
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,230
Gosh, I said I don't mind
eating alone.

536
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,900
No, that's not going to happen.

537
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,800
- I heard it's a murder case.
- Yes.

538
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,700
We received a report at 8:47am.

539
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,630
Gosh, that was close.

540
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,600
They should've waited
13 minutes longer.

541
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,930
If it was reported at 9am, it
would've been assigned to Team 4.

542
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,360
- I know, right?
- Gosh.

543
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,400
Try to have some conscience, okay?

544
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,830
I mean, you have nothing
to do anyways.

545
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,200
You're nobody
but a Section Chief Yoo.

546
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,700
That's right. Speaking of
section chief…

547
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,330
Section Chief Yoo,
Section Chief Yoo.

548
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,830
I heard you're the one
who told Jin-kang.

549
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,560
Oh, my. Is that something
I shouldn't have told her?

550
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,730
Why? Is Jin-kang disappointed?

551
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,100
What do you mean
disappointed?

552
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,730
I'm a hero to her. A hero.

553
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,760
- What? Hero?
- Yes.

554
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,530
Gosh, I cannot eat
with you anymore.

555
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,630
- What do you think of him?
- Who?

556
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,060
That one who looks pathetic.

557
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,730
- Eom Cho-rong?
- Yes.

558
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,030
He's cute. Why?

559
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,730
Do you want to know something?

560
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,630
Yes, what is it?

561
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,060
- Eom Cho-rong is…
- Yes.

562
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,630
an idiot.

563
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,530
Ti-di-di-di-ri.

564
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,530
Is that so?

565
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,630
Why?

566
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,130
- What do you like about him?
- Huh?

567
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,360
How do you know?

568
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,060
No matter what you do,
you're in the palm of my hand.

569
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,230
When you say he's an idiot,

570
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,830
you like him a lot or
you think he's cute.

571
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,930
- Am I right?
- That's correct.

572
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,200
He got caught.

573
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,500
What are you saying?
What's on your mind?

574
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,530
That idiot and Jin-kang, you know.

575
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,230
Gosh.

576
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,500
He's not Jin-kang's type.

577
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,360
- Are you sure?
- Wait. Let me think.

578
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:04,260
He went to the police academy and
he's already a level 7 officer.

579
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,400
He's actually an eligible bachelor
judging by his cover.

580
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,360
- I told you.
- However…

581
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,600
Do you think he'll like Jin-kang?

582
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,060
What?

583
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,160
So what you're
saying is that

584
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,430
idiot Eom Cho-rong
isn't going to like Jin…

585
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,500
Is he out of her league?

586
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,800
Hey, look. Do you know me?

587
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,560
No, not at all.

588
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,330
Drink this. Since you were looking
for Something You Brown Ale.

589
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,830
Anyways, have we seen that guy
somewhere before?

590
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,530
He works for Arts, it's the hottest
craft beer company right now.

591
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,330
He works there as a brewery crew.

592
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,560
- Is this all?
- Yes.

593
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,530
Where are you going?

594
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,460
Aren't you here to see me?

595
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,530
What should I do?
I still have some work left to do.

596
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,030
Go ahead then.

597
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,860
Follow me.

598
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,560
Hello.

599
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,360
I don't think he'll introduce us.
I'm Noh Hui-joon.

600
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,100
Yes, he's my colleague.

601
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,460
You're Seung-ah, right? I saw you
at your exhibition yesterday.

602
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,630
Wow, it was awesome.

603
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:18,000
Aw, mom.

604
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,300
What mom? Are you
a mama's boy? Drive off.

605
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,960
To where?

606
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,530
Just go.

607
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,030
I'm on my way to the crime scene.

608
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,060
- Should I drop you off somewhere?
- Gosh.

609
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,530
Ah…

610
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,430
That was pretty tough, right?

611
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,760
This is our last delivery stop
for today.

612
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,760
Wait a second.

613
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,300
Wow, it's so busy today. Please
stay here for a bit, Seung-ah.

614
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,760
- Yes.
- Could you give us the menu?

615
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,230
Can we get two glasses of beer?

616
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,330
- Let's go.
- What about Hui-joon?

617
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,330
He works part-time here.

618
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,260
Are you going, Moo-young?
Are you, Seung-ah?

619
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,600
Thank you, Seung-ah.

620
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,630
- Oh, I'll be right there.
- Excuse me.

621
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,060
Don't you still want
to help us out?

622
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,130
Not at all.

623
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,730
So…

624
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,000
How many girlfriends
have you had so far?

625
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,060
I've had just as many as
other people have.

626
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,600
That one.
Is that also not working?

627
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,200
I heard the CCTVs here are
all messed up.

628
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,730
That works fine.

629
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,530
That one, the one in the parking lot,

630
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,530
and the one in the garbage room
are real.

631
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,530
- This one's not working.
- This one?

632
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,100
Yes, and the one in the back door
on the ground floor, too.

633
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,330
There's no CCTV
in the stairways at all.

634
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,430
Which means blind spots
are everywhere.

635
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,800
Didn't you…

636
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,060
sign up for something like that?

637
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,360
What do you mean?

638
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,960
Well, I mean…

639
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,600
You know, they introduce people…

640
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,100
and fix them up with eligible
bachelors and bachelorettes

641
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,300
to find a life partner or
something…

642
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,530
- Ah, a matchmaking company?
- Yes.

643
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,260
Aw, I hate such a thing.

644
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,200
People are not objects.

645
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,630
And I'd like to marry a person
I truly love.

646
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,800
What's your mother like?
She's fussy, right?

647
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,730
No, my mom is really kind.

648
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,460
My little sister is
really kind, too.

649
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,400
I said my little sister
is kind too.

650
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,330
I'm sure she is.

651
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,100
My little sister is really pretty,
you idiot.

652
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,230
Anyways, why are you here,
Section Chief?

653
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,330
You're being funny.
Does a detective

654
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,000
need a reason
to visit the crime scene?

655
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,530
This little bastard.

656
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,460
Wow, snow globes, huh?

657
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:57,400
Sailing boat, Rudolph…

658
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:01,460
Snowman. Huh?

659
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:03,300
Snowman right here.
My little sister

660
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,130
really likes to build a snowman.

661
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,560
My super-pretty and
super-kind little sister.

662
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,260
I'll go to that side
and check something.

663
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,130
Gosh.

664
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,530
You're not supposed to touch things

665
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,200
so recklessly like this…

666
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,960
This little.

667
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,660
Such a crybaby.

668
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,300
What are you doing?

669
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,360
Are these all the photos we have
for the blood traces?

670
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:19,400
No, we have some more
in the office. Why?

671
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,500
Wow.

672
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:48,900
- You fixed it.
- Wow.

673
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,030
Oh, it looks just the same.

674
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,430
I mean the bracelet.

675
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,730
It must've been hard
for you, Seung-ah.

676
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,430
If it weren't for you,
we might've died today.

677
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,760
It was fun.

678
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,160
But it'll be tough
if I have to work every day like this.

679
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,600
He does 3 part-time jobs like this
every day to pay for his tuition.

680
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,460
He's a computer science student
after all. At Yeongang University.

681
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,160
Yeongang University?

682
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,860
I guess you're very smart,
Hui-joon.

683
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,330
I think I might have
to quit university, Moo-young.

684
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,800
What's the good of
graduating university anyway?

685
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,900
Why? You won't be able
to go back this semester either?

686
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,630
Next semester's fine. It's not
like I'm the only one suffering.

687
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,830
That's my house.

688
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,660
Go in then.

689
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,260
I thought you'd ask me why I came.

690
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,000
Pardon?

691
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,200
When you saw me earlier,

692
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,600
I thought you'd ask me why I came.

693
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,130
Did you? Why?

694
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,300
I was so glad to see you, though.

695
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,430
- Were you glad to see me?
- Yes.

696
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,400
That's a lie…

697
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:16,930
I couldn't even call you
when I got your number.

698
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,460
Because I was afraid you'd say
why did you call me?

699
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,100
You didn't even think about me,
did you?

700
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,400
I've missed you.

701
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:34,000
- Really?
- Yes.

702
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:43,030
Then, can I like you?

703
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,960
But, you have a boyfriend.

704
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,130
Ah, Woo-sang is…

705
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,760
Captain, Choi Sang-hoon
turned out to be left-handed after all.

706
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,600
Ha, this bastard is busted.

707
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:29,660
If his DNA matches the sample,
then he has nowhere to go.

708
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,400
When will the DNA result come out?

709
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,760
The one that cleaned the scene
is right-handed, though.

710
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,630
Look at the traces of blood.

711
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,600
It's true that the person who hit
her with a weapon is left-handed.

712
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,800
But the person who mopped
the floor is right-handed.

713
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:48,200
Huh? It's true. This person is
obviously right-handed.

714
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,500
Gosh, people use both hands
when they mop.

715
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,300
No, look. The radius is different.

716
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,260
A right-handed person makes
a bigger circle on the right.

717
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:59,600
And a left-handed person makes
a bigger one on the left.

718
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:02,130
It tends to fade away
as it reaches the edge.

719
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,360
Because you put force in here
and push it away.

720
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,200
Isn't that right?

721
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,100
Captain Lee, could you
have a look at this?

722
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,700
I found something strange
at the scene yesterday.

723
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,130
The snow globes here
in the cupboard are…

724
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,430
Why are you doing something
you usually don't?

725
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,160
Sergeant Yoo.

726
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,000
I already told you politely

727
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,960
when they weren't around.

728
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:41,430
Homicide Squad 3
consists of me,

729
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,830
two here, and two here, 5 members.

730
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,200
So Sergeant Yoo should keep

731
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,700
doing what you always do
like a section chief.

732
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,430
You know, just like that case of
the stolen scooter.

733
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,700
Section Chief Yoo.

734
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,030
Scooter, that's right. Scooter.

735
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:04,360
Here.

736
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,900
Thank you.

737
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,660
Scooter.

738
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,330
Don't you think
the captain is too much?

739
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,100
I mean, we've got a murder case,

740
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,760
so we're trying to cooperate
with the other teams.

741
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:26,760
At a time like this, why did he
ask him to find the scooter?

742
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,560
He definitely said snow globes.
What could that be?

743
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,530
He brought the first
photo taken at the crime scene

744
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,400
and the photo of
Jung Mi-yeon's birthday party.

745
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,730
Mind your own business, you idiot.

746
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:44,260
This is what
I've always been curious about.

747
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:47,430
Why does our captain hate
Section Chief Yoo that much?

748
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,360
Why? Do you feel sorry for him
because he's getting ignored at that age?

749
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:52,660
There's nothing good to be gained
from hanging out with him.

750
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,330
So stop caring about him.

751
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,060
Sergeant Yoo will be eliminated
in 3 months anyway.

752
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:59,300
Captain will do whatever it takes

753
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,700
to get rid of Sergeant Yoo
in the next personnel realignment.

754
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,230
Let's go, you idiot.

755
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,300
Um…

756
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,930
You fixed it.
Oh, it looks just the same.

757
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,960
I mean the bracelet.

758
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:51,600
Hui-joon.

759
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,230
The intellectual window
to the world,

760
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,000
Yeongang University Seoul Campus.

761
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,130
Press 1 for inquiries
for admission,

762
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,300
press 2
for administration department…

763
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,600
I'm so curious,
Section Chief.

764
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,660
What's wrong with the snow globes?

765
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,860
Section Chief, Section Chief.
I'm here.

766
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,030
Glad you made it.

767
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,830
Is Hui-joon going back
to university this time?

768
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:44,960
- No.
- Hmm…

769
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:48,400
I'd like to help him. Can I?

770
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,000
I was worried that
I might hurt his pride.

771
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,300
Let me talk to him. He'll
accept it as long as it's for university.

772
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:22,460
That's a lie.

773
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:25,560
They said
there's no such student.

774
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:29,100
No one named Noh Hui-joon studies
computer science at Yeongang Univ.

775
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,960
This is funny.

776
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:40,300
Is this funny to you?

777
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,360
Because of money…

778
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,460
Don't you feel ashamed?

779
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,230
Maybe it wasn't about money.

780
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,500
Sorry?

781
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,860
The intellectual window
to the world,

782
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,430
Yeongang University Wonju Campus.

783
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,700
Wonju?

784
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:09,930
Here, look.

785
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Sailing boat, Rudolph,
snowman, flower, and angel.

786
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,600
Here, sailing boat, Rudolph,
snowman, flower, and angel.

787
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,360
Yes.

788
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,260
The order is the same.

789
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:26,760
Yes.

790
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:30,100
Yes, so what?

791
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,960
How many times
do I have to tell you?

792
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,500
The blood traces were only found
on the floor and dining table.

793
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,560
However, when we got there,

794
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:40,830
I found blood clots on
the bottom of the snow globes.

795
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,730
It wasn't spattered with blood.

796
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,330
It must've been soaked in blood
on the floor.

797
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,330
In other words,
the cupboard fell over once

798
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,360
and someone reorganized it.

799
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,430
Yes, I mean

800
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,800
I know what you're talking about.

801
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,500
But, I don't see any strange…

802
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:01,730
I got it. I got it.

803
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,000
So you mean somebody
wiped all those things

804
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,600
and put them back again, right?

805
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:11,530
Do you get it now?

806
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,800
Oh, my.

807
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,300
But, how come
it's exactly the same?

808
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,960
Oh, the front row looks
exactly the same too.

809
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,900
There are dozens of these, though.

810
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,860
Wow, how could this be
exactly the same?

811
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:24,100
That's what I found suspicious.

812
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,200
What's this person?

813
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,260
It can't be like this person
has a photographic memory.

814
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,830
Or this person might
have an IQ of 1,000.

815
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,760
Or he might've taken a picture

816
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,330
before killing Jung Mi-yeon.

817
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,860
It wasn't necessary. These are
just ornaments after all.

818
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:42,600
What'd be so strange even if
they were put back in a different order?

819
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:45,130
Why would he put it back in order
when he was in such a hurry?

820
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,600
That's right.

821
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:53,760
I think he might've put it back in
order without even realizing it.

822
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:57,030
He didn't intend to do it, but
when he put it back, he naturally…

823
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,360
I mean, how could he possibly

824
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:01,960
do this just naturally?

825
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,300
Does he really have
photographic memory?

826
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,830
I don't know.

827
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,100
What I'm sure of is that

828
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,430
he is…

829
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,760
a bit strange.

830
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,660
I couldn't find the last eight.

831
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,360
I'm sorry.

832
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,960
I'm really sorry.

833
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:50,960
I think I'm going crazy.

834
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,560
Are you crying?

835
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:57,300
Because you lost 400 dollars?

836
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,730
Do you want me to go
and search a little more?

837
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,260
I'm sorry.

838
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,530
You look less pretty when you cry.

839
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,200
You chucked it away.

840
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,200
Hmm?

841
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,160
You chucked it away because
you got it from a bad guy, huh?

842
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:34,400
No, I didn't.

843
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:44,560
How could I throw it away?

844
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,760
It was from you out of all people.

845
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,460
It's pretty.

846
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,330
Ah, I discovered something
really interesting.

847
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:05,600
Who are you really, Moo-young?

848
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,800
The bracelet looks the same.

849
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:14,560
Look, you made it exactly the same
as the first one.

850
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:17,900
I mean, there are more than
20 charms. How did you do that?

851
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,060
I don't know.

852
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,560
I guess my boyfriend is a genius.

853
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,060
Boyfriend?

854
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:37,760
Yes, that's up to me.

855
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:08,560
Once he sees something,
he can remember everything.

856
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,830
(A remake of the Japanese series A Hundred
Million Stars Falling From The Sky)

857
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:32,300
(Thank you to Actor Yoo Jae-myung
for guest starring)

858
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:51,000
(Hundred Million Stars From The Sky)

859
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,060
Are you seeing someone else lately?

860
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,500
There's someone that I like.

861
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,800
- Is this pottery?
- I got it as a gift.

862
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,100
I was wondering who that could be.

863
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,460
Choi Sang-hoon got caught.

864
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,700
Are you sure?
Is he really the murderer?

865
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,330
- It's strange.
- What's so strange about it?

866
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,030
That's what I want to know, too.

867
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:09,160
This is my boyfriend, Moo-young.

868
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:11,130
I'm asking you
if you really like her.

869
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,330
- I do.
- You're doing this on purpose.

870
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,730
- Doing what?
- To draw my attention.

871
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,630
Then what about you, Yoo Jin-kang?
