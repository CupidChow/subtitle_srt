It seems like someone purposely

(The previous episode)

Have we seen that guy
somewhere before?

(The previous episode)

19
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,960
Hey, look. Do you know me?

(The previous episode)

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,630
No, not at all.

(The previous episode)

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,330
Look. You just keep
your promise, okay?
(The previous episode)

24
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:01,400
(The previous episode)

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,600
I don't want to keep it anymore.
A promise like that.

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,300
(The previous episode)

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,600
You did that on purpose
earlier, right?
(The previous episode)

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,030
(The previous episode)

29
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,260
- I missed you.
- Really?

(The previous episode)

31
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,160
Do you want to know something?

(The previous episode)

33
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,100
Does he really have
a photographic memory?
(The previous episode)

34
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,060
(The previous episode)

35
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,660
You fixed it.
Oh, it looks exactly the same.

(The previous episode)

37
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,360
Once he sees something,
he can remember everything.

(The previous episode)

39
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,130
How did he turn out?
(The previous episode)

40
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,500
How did he turn out?

41
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,660
Thank you.

42
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,300
(Episode 2)

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,300
Um, it looks like we
finished our meal

44
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,660
and even
our dessert already.

45
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,229
If you don't like it,
you don't have to finish it.

46
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,960
I'm taking my
time savoring it.

47
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,229
Taking your time…

48
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,400
It doesn't taste good when you
eat it like that because it'll melt.

49
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,860
Why do you keep rushing me

50
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,500
like a puppy that wants to poop?

51
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
- Did I?
- Yes.

52
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,759
No, I didn't. I didn't…

53
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,900
Cho-rong, how do you feel about
DB(Daytime Beer)?

54
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,200
DB?

55
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,530
- Yes, I'd love to.
- I'm still…

56
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
Hey, I still haven't
finished this, here…

57
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,329
You can take as long
as you want.

58
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,560
What the heck?

59
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,360
Are you guys ditching me?

60
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,060
Cho-rong… Jin-kang.

61
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,760
- You were obviously in the wrong.
- I feel hurt, seriously.

62
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:33,960
What's wrong with
young people these days? Gosh…

63
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,700
Why are you being
so tactless like that?

64
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Once you set them up,
you should leave them to it.

65
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,030
- Is that how you do it?
- So where are you now?

66
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,400
- Should I come keep you company?
- No, no, no.

67
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm in front of my place.
Yes, my place.

68
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,760
- I'm almost home. Almost.
- What the heck?

69
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:51,329
Don't tell me you tagged along,
did you?

70
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,930
Do you think…
You think I'm crazy, huh?

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,160
With no pride?

72
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,060
Anyway…

73
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,860
what's DB?

74
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,700
Are you sure you'll be fine?

75
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,930
Since I've tried everything
except for these five.

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,230
Of course, I am.
Which one should we try first?

77
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,130
- Probably this one?
- Cheers.

78
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,160
Cheers.

79
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,160
I know you're a brand designer,

80
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,860
but do you have to personally try
every single product like this?

81
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,530
Yes.

82
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,400
A product designer's
purpose is

83
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,560
to make people curious about

84
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,460
and interested in the products.

85
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,430
So, I think
I need to directly experience it first

86
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,900
in order to make it work.

87
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,030
That's called
real professionalism.

88
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,829
I'm similar to you
in that sense.

89
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,760
- Okay.
- What else should we drink now?

90
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:42,130
- This one?
- Yes, this one.

91
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,660
Huh, look at those clowns.

92
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,430
Look at how they're going
nuts for their drinks.

93
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,560
Gosh.

94
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,159
What a huge plot twist.

95
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,260
- What do you mean?
- I actually didn't have

96
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,360
any expectations for today.

97
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,130
Since you're
Section Chief Yoo's younger sister.

98
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,260
You don't like my brother
that much?

99
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,130
No, no, that's not what I meant.

100
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,830
Actually…

101
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,200
I thought you'd be
like a granny at first…

102
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,930
A granny?

103
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,260
What I mean is that I didn't know
he'd have such a young sister

104
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,330
like you…

105
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,530
Um, and when he said his sister,
I thought you'd look like…

106
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,230
What? My brother and I totally
look alike, though.

107
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,930
Come on. You don't look
anything like him.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Not at all.

109
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,000
Oddly enough,
it sounds like a compliment.

110
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,200
It was totally a compliment.

111
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,000
Anyway, I guess people really call
my brother Section Chief Yoo, huh?

112
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,660
No.

113
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,360
Well, it's just a nickname.

114
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,860
Because our dearest
Section Chief Yoo is…

115
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,659
I mean Detective Yoo has
such a good personality…

116
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,000
It's okay. I've heard everything
from Tak sister.

117
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,800
Have you?

118
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,500
That's a relief.

119
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,000
But it's a bit weird.

120
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,500
Section Chief Yoo is like

121
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,430
a hidden master sometimes.

122
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,230
Because he completely amazes me
from time to time.

123
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,260
No way.

124
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,900
I can't even picture my brother

125
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,830
catching a criminal or
anything like that.

126
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,100
He doesn't have
any funny stories either.

127
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,130
Do you, by any chance,
like those kinds of stories?

128
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,030
Scary ones like
about catching murderers and such.

129
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,700
Of course, I do.

130
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,560
Then, can I see you sometimes
and tell you a story?

131
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,300
- Okay.
- Then, will you be my girlfriend?

132
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,600
- Pardon?
- Sorry, it came out wrong.

133
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,800
What I meant was…

134
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,300
I'd like to go out with you.

135
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Officially.

136
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,730
Ah, then what you mean is…

137
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,960
you'd like to go out with me

138
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,200
- officially?
- Yes.

139
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,400
- In a cool way.
- In a cool way?

140
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,600
Like, get dinner together, go see a movie,
and play hard to get.

141
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,800
Eveything that we haven't
done before. Eveything.

142
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,760
Everything that we wanted
to do. All of it.

143
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,230
Oh, my.

144
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,530
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

145
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,100
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

146
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,730
Can you please bring us
some napkins?

147
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,500
- Are you okay, Jin-kang?
- Yes, I'm fine. It's okay.

148
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,060
- With this…
- I'll do it.

149
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,400
- It's okay.
- Are you alright?

150
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,530
- Yes. I'll go to the bathroom.
- Yes.

151
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,159
Please excuse me.

152
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,560
- I'm so sorry.
- Ah, seriously…

153
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,830
- Hello.
- Stay still.

154
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,659
- I said stay still.
- What are you doing?

155
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,360
I said stay still.

156
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,600
Did you have fun without me?

157
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:54,000
Whoa, I think I drank too much.

158
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,360
That's right. So why did you
guys drink one after another like…

159
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,200
One after another…

160
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,930
What did Eom Cho-rong say?

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,300
Don't tell me
you got dumped by him, too.

162
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
None of your business.

163
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,300
- How is it none of my business?
- You have good manners.

164
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,900
What? Are you saying
I can't have good manners?

165
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,360
Are you saying
I can't be super-rich?

166
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,660
I heard technology
has improved a lot.

167
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,630
Don't you want to remove it?

168
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,760
Remove what?

169
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,030
Ah…

170
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,730
Why? It's kinda cute
if you stare at it long enough.

171
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,560
Cute, my butt.

172
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,659
Look. If you look long enough,
you'll become fond of it.

173
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,630
Don't come any closer.
What are you talking about?

174
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,730
Gosh, get away from me,
for goodness sake.

175
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,660
What's that? I've never
seen that hoodie before.

176
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,800
Ah, it's nothing.

177
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,200
I mean, she kept saying it's cute
and how she's become fond of it.

178
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,230
But how does that make sense?

179
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,700
Maybe she really
doesn't care anymore.

180
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,800
Jin-kang is quite boyish
after all.

181
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,030
Listen to me.

182
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,700
When Jin-kang was
in middle school,

183
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,730
she secretly saved money

184
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,900
- to get that scar removed.
- Oh.

185
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,230
After I realized that,
I quickly took her to the hospital

186
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,700
and set a date to get it removed.

187
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,060
However, she changed
her mind at the last minute.

188
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,530
- Why?
- That's what I don't understand.

189
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Since then, she's been like that.

190
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,830
Talking about how it's cute, and how she's
become fond of it, blah blah…

191
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,800
Oh, well.

192
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,600
That does sound strange.

193
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,300
Does her scar
bother you that much?

194
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,260
Of course, it does.

195
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,030
He might not care, but what about
her parents-in-law? Huh?

196
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,730
They might feel reluctant
about her.

197
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,100
Not only does she not have
her parents anymore,

198
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,330
she also has a burn scar on her arm…

199
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,060
Aw, seriously. Aw…

200
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,960
Aw, it's too soon to worry about
her parents-in-law for goodness sake.

201
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,900
- Oh, here he comes, Eom Cho-rong.
- Oh.

202
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,160
Hey, what did they say?
Did the DNA test result come out?

203
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,860
The DNA matched it 99.9 percent.
It's definitely Choi Sang-hoon's.

204
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,930
Now, all you need to do
is catch him.

205
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,330
Are you going to contact Interpol?

206
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,860
Yes, this bastard is busted.

207
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,360
Hey, go in and report it first.

208
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,530
- They're probably waiting for it.
- Alright. Salute.

209
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,400
Salute. Aren't you going,
Section Chief Yoo?

210
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,900
- I should, ugh.
- Let's go.

211
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,360
Section Chief, I own an apartment.

212
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,630
Well, I still have some mortgage
left to pay,

213
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,830
but it's still my apartment.

214
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,600
Anyway, I do have an apartment.

215
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,060
- So what?
- I know, right?

216
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,330
Strangely enough,
I've wanted to tell you this…

217
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,600
for a while now.

218
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,560
He said he owns an apartment.

219
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,760
Why, why is he so funny?

220
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,530
Hey, he must've
really liked Jin-kang.

221
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,160
Oh, my.

222
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,630
Hey.

223
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,360
- Hi, you're here.
- Have you been waiting long?

224
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,800
- I just got here, too.
- That's great.

225
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,460
I'm so hungry.

226
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,830
What should we eat?

227
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,830
- Jin-kang.
- Yes.

228
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,300
Don't you have something
to give me?

229
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,460
- Huh?
- President Hwang called me earlier.

230
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,600
Why are you so hesitant
about something so important like that?

231
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,100
Ah…

232
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,130
It's just because…

233
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
I don't want to burden you.

234
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,830
So what if it burdens me?

235
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,100
She said it's a matter of
life or death for your company.

236
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,030
It's not to that extent, but

237
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,760
it is a big project for sure.

238
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,060
Is Woo-sang going to
make the final decision on this?

239
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,600
Umm… Woo-sang's company recently

240
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,260
acquired a lot of Arts' shares.

241
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,200
Which means
he's a major shareholder.

242
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,830
- Arts?
- Yes, you didn't know?

243
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,460
No… I don't know
much about his business.

244
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,230
Then, it must be urgent, right?

245
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,260
A little bit?
The sooner, the better, I guess.

246
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,860
Why?

247
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,200
Um, nothing.

248
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,300
I've been avoiding
Woo-sang lately,

249
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,060
but I guess I have no choice
but to see him because of you.

250
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,760
Because of me? Hey, forget it.
It's alright then.

251
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,600
I was just joking.

252
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,400
It's better this way.

253
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,700
I need to talk to him
at least once anyways.

254
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,830
Did something happen
between you and Woo-sang?

255
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,760
Jin-kang.

256
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,630
I have someone
I'd like you to meet.

257
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,130
Someone you'd like me to meet?

258
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,660
Here he is.

259
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,830
Here, Moo-young.

260
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,360
This is Moo-young,

261
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,500
my boyfriend.

262
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,130
This is Jin-kang, I told you about her.
She's my best friend.

263
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,130
Yes.

264
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,630
Nice to meet you.
I'm Yoo Jin-kang.

265
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,430
What's wrong with you?

266
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,130
- Pardon?
- Don't you remember me?

267
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,860
Or are you just pretending
that you don't?

268
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,860
Is this really the first time
you saw me?

269
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,600
I think we've already met
three times before.

270
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,400
Today is the fourth time.

271
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,100
Really? When?

272
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,630
Was the last time
the day before yesterday?

273
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,830
At a pub in Itaewon.

274
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,000
It's not like we met.
We just ran into each other.

275
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,960
At Arts Pub? Oh, did you go there?

276
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,960
Yes, I had a blind date.

277
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,230
- A blind date?
- Yes, well…

278
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,630
Since my brother kept pushing me…

279
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,600
You know what my brother is like.

280
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,800
Jin-kook set you up
on a blind date?

281
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,400
Yes.

282
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,960
You guys looked cute together.

283
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,530
Really? What's he like?

284
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,530
Huh? Come on. What does he do?

285
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,630
Well…

286
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,000
What should we eat?

287
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,700
Why don't you come with us?

288
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,260
Moo-young can drop you off
after me.

289
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,600
No, I don't want to be a hassle.

290
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,030
No, Moo-young also lives in
Wonyoung-dong. Right?

291
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,660
Where exactly did you say you live
in Wonyoung-dong, Moo-young?

292
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,860
No, Seung-ah. Wonyoung-dong is
much bigger than you think.

293
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,060
He probably lives far away from me.
See you then.

294
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,000
Get home safely.

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,060
What's this?

296
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,100
Wow.

297
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,730
Is it okay to give something
like this to just anyone?

298
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,230
It's okay
because it's something like this.

299
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,100
This is what I really made myself.

300
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,900
It's beautiful.

301
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
What? Don't you want
to give me a kiss?

302
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,160
We have an audience, though.

303
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,860
You didn't know, did you?

304
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,260
I don't care about
things like that anymore.

305
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,400
She

306
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,560
must've followed you around
to mooch off you like this.

307
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,500
Jin-kang is not someone

308
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,800
you can talk easily about like that.

309
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,500
You look pretty when you're mad.

310
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,530
I'll cut you some slack,
since you're pretty.

311
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,560
Just drop it. I'm sure she doesn't
want your help this way, either.

312
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,130
Why don't we go to Japan
next weekend?

313
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,330
I think I'll make myself
clear for the both of us.

314
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,430
Let's stop seeing each other
from now on.

315
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,500
- What?
- I, um…

316
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,960
There's someone that I like.

317
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,030
I like him more than he likes me.

318
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,430
I came here to talk to you
about this today.

319
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,400
- You're in a relationship, huh?
- Yes.

320
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,760
He's my first love.

321
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,630
First love?

322
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,859
Why are you being so adorable?

323
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,300
Gosh, seriously…

324
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,900
I'll be off then.

325
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,230
Go on and date him.

326
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,900
Having a cute and
beautiful fling like that just once…

327
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,600
It doesn't sound that bad.

328
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,300
Go on.

329
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,530
But don't sleep with him, okay?

330
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,500
Love?

331
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

332
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,260
Did you get home okay
that night?

333
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,130
Here. Thank you for this.

334
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,330
- You can keep it, though.
- Ah, no thanks.

335
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,160
See you later then.

336
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,300
Looks like you live near here.

337
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,630
Yes, well…

338
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,230
Wonyoung-dong is
not that big, I guess.

339
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,930
I know, right?

340
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,500
It's the weekend. Don't you
have a date with Seung-ah?

341
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,300
She said she's going
to go see her grandmother today.

342
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,860
Ah…

343
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,260
Hi, Cho-rong.

344
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,760
Do you have any plans
tomorrow evening?

345
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,800
Um, then would you like
to go see a movie with me?

346
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,460
Yes, I'd love to.

347
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,160
No, I wanted to
see that movie too.

348
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,000
Alright. See you tomorrow then.

349
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,200
Yes.

350
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,200
It looks like
you decided to go out with him.

351
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,360
Officially, huh?

352
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,930
In a cool way,
get dinner together, go see a movie,

353
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,500
What else did he say? Hmm…

354
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,430
Ah, play hard to get.

355
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,900
What's so funny?

356
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,430
- Are you mad?
- Yes, I'm mad.

357
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,030
Who do you think you are,
eavesdropping on us?

358
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,130
I listened because I could hear it.
And I watched because I could see it.

359
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,800
Since we run into
each other quite often, you know.

360
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,900
I apologize, if you're offended.

361
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,760
Look.

362
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,760
You said we met
three times, right?

363
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
One time was at Seung-ah's
exhibition.

364
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,460
And the second time
was when you lent me this at the pub.

365
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,700
Then, when was the third time?

366
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,460
No matter how hard I try,
I can only remember those two.

367
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
You're wrong.

368
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,260
You're doing this on purpose,
right?

369
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,460
- Doing what?
- To draw my attention.

370
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,160
No way.

371
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,560
When was it then?

372
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,330
A long time ago.

373
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,830
Somewhere…

374
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
somewhere…

375
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,200
You feel like…

376
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,830
You feel like
my long-lost, cute little sister.

377
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,660
A cute little sister.

378
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,760
- How old are you?
- The same age as you.

379
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,460
- How old am I?
- How do I know?

380
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,130
Now, I know
what type of person you are.

381
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,230
I never saw you before

382
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,800
and I didn't even know you well.

383
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,230
However, there was something
ominous about you from the start.

384
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,130
I know people like you.

385
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,330
You're cocky and rude.
You act as if

386
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,830
you're allowed
to flirt with everyone

387
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,430
and think that
every woman likes you.

388
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,960
You're such a jerk.

389
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,830
Am I?

390
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,800
Probably? I bet you
know that better than me.

391
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,530
Sir, stop. Stop for a second.

392
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,930
I'm sorry.
Please wait a second.

393
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,660
It's okay.

394
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,800
I can do it.

395
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,500
Do you want to take it?

396
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,930
Are you going to take it?

397
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,260
- Have you ever raised a cat?
- No.

398
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,530
Wait. Here, your hoodie.

399
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,730
You can keep it.

400
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,200
With our diverse infrastructure
and years of experience,

401
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,900
we promise to give you
ideas and designs

402
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,130
that can help with your branding.

403
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,460
Wow, isn't it great? I like it.

404
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,560
It's great.

405
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,060
Huh?

406
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,430
Those are our beers, right?

407
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,830
- Yes, you're right.
- That's right.

408
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,960
These are Arts' beers that

409
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,660
I bought myself and personally
tried during the past month

410
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,960
while preparing for this presentation.

411
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,160
At first, I had one or two
out of obligation.

412
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,930
But the more I drank,
the greater the taste became.

413
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,530
There's an old saying,

414
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,760
No one can beat a person
who enjoys what they're doing.

415
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,360
Imagine the amazing design
we'd create

416
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,330
because we love the product itself
when we're already good at designing.

417
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,460
In order for more people
to be able to taste Arts' beer,

418
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,760
we will come up with
the best design.

419
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,830
Thank you for listening.

420
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,800
Oh, I love it.
It was great, indeed.

421
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,060
Thank you for your hard work.
I mean it.

422
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,130
I love it.

423
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,630
She said it's my tuition.

424
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,460
What's up with Baek Seung-ah?
I'm so dumbfounded.

425
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,860
I said I'm fine,
but she left this and ran off.

426
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,630
Why don't you just enroll then?

427
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,160
You want me to start acting
like I'm a university student now?

428
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,260
What is it, Moo-young? Why did you
tell such a lie out of nowhere?

429
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,760
I was just wondering
how to move a rich girl's heart.

430
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,630
What about this then?

431
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,860
Yay.

432
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,560
It was awesome.

433
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,600
You did a great job.

434
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,630
If they dare cut us after

435
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,430
all that positive feedback,
I'll seriously, ugh.

436
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,800
No way.

437
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,860
- I'm hungry.
- Are you? What do you feel like eating?

438
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,600
- Loach soup?
- Sounds good.

439
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,100
Deal?

440
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,200
Let's go.

441
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,500
Oh, my. Isn't that
Director Jang Woo-sang?

442
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,800
- Huh? You're right.
- Oh, my.

443
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,530
- I guess he's here to support us.
- Wow, that's wonderful.

444
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,100
We're counting on you,
Director Jang.

445
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,800
This is where the final brewing

446
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,100
process takes place.

447
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,400
In other words,
it's the heart of our brewery.

448
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,030
- He should try some beer.
- Yes, bring it over.

449
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,660
Moo-young. Moo-young.

450
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,500
Can you please get us
a cup of Befree?

451
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,060
This way, please.

452
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,230
I thought you looked familiar.

453
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,330
Hmm, this is nice.

454
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,300
What is that place?

455
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,530
Um, this is our warehouse
and office,

456
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,700
where we grow yeasts
and design new recipes.

457
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,230
Feel free to look around.

458
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,130
Huh? What is that?

459
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,660
Is this yours, Moo-young?

460
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,500
Oh, it's beautiful.
Where did you buy it?

461
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,330
It was a gift.

462
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,860
It looks beautiful.

463
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,200
Although, it doesn't suit you.

464
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,200
So what you're trying to say is,

465
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,560
someone stole your scooter so

466
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,130
you stole someone else's too, huh?

467
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,130
It's not that I stole another one.

468
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,100
I just took one
that looks the same.

469
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,830
- One that looks the same as mine.
- Gosh.

470
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,530
Hey, "Oh Right". Your parent must've

471
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,260
desperately wanted you to grow up
to be a righteous person

472
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,700
so much so that
they named you "Oh Ba-reun".

473
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,060
Then, should I just have done nothing?
What about my loss?

474
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:08,060
Gosh, that sounds very fair,
you bastard.

475
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,530
- Hey.
- Yes.

476
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,860
This little bastard.

477
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,130
You should've reported it
to the police when you lost yours

478
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
instead of stealing someone else's.

479
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,630
I'll report it. I will do it now.

480
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,560
Since he's the one
who stole mine first,

481
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,560
go arrest him first.

482
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,560
Look at this bastard.

483
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,960
Hey, listen carefully.

484
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,330
The day you stole the scooter,
a person died.

485
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,930
What do you think is more urgent,
catching a murderer

486
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,760
or finding a scooter thief?

487
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,800
Huh?

488
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,100
Hey.

489
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,860
- Eom Cho-rong.
- Yes.

490
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,830
- What do you think you're doing?
- Um…

491
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,900
Going home.

492
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
Isn't he the youngest one?

493
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,760
Oh, I guess you guys
are very flexible.

494
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,460
If you laugh after crying… I mean.

495
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,360
- If you cry after laughing…
- Brainless.

496
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,130
My brother always
calls me brainless.

497
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,330
Because I laugh when other people
laugh and I cry when others cry.

498
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,800
That's because you're pure.

499
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,700
Um, it's not like that…

500
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,600
But, let's just say that's the case
because it sounds like a compliment.

501
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,900
- Yes, let's say it's true.
- Okay.

502
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,230
That tattoo, seriously…

503
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,400
Hmm, it's nothing.

504
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,560
Darn it.

505
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,560
What's wrong?

506
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,200
That jerk we just passed by.

507
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,230
Is he someone you know?

508
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,630
The cop who visited me
the other day.

509
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,060
The one that visited you
because of your dead friend?

510
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,900
What friend?

511
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,760
She wasn't even my friend.

512
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,130
Look at how she's bothering me
even in her death.

513
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,030
Gosh, whatever. Why would I care?

514
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,160
Yes, I'm coming.

515
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,300
I'm coming
even though I'm really busy.

516
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,900
I'm sorry.
But it shouldn't get crumpled.

517
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,100
Gosh, I wonder how
you managed to remember it.

518
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,530
The fact that the blouse
you washed last night,

519
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,260
a blouse that
should never get crumpled,

520
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,760
was still in the washing machine.

521
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,200
Aren't I so clever?

522
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,860
Gosh, you're amazing.
My Jin-kang is so amazing.

523
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,260
Hey, I've got to go. I'm driving
right now. I'll hang up then.

524
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,200
Wow.

525
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,800
Are you okay? You didn't get hurt?

526
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,200
Ah, yes. I'm sorry.

527
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,760
This little guy suddenly
ran into the road.

528
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,100
It was his first time
getting vaccinations.

529
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,760
It's alright, as long as you didn't
get hurt. I was freaking out.

530
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,800
Whoa, gosh.

531
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,900
It was your little sister, right?

532
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,760
At the pub in Itaewon.

533
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,700
Oh?

534
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,560
How did you know
she's my little sister?

535
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,500
Ah, I just happened to know.

536
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,200
Then, you stalked
your own little sister, huh?

537
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,360
Pardon?

538
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,900
Come on.

539
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,600
It's not like I was stalking her.

540
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,760
It's just that…

541
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,860
Cho-rong… Umm, gosh.

542
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,460
You have a good memory.
Is that because you're young?

543
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,730
Should I go straight or go right?

544
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,600
You can just drop me off here.

545
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,200
Well, I'll take you home.
You have a lot of things to carry.

546
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,430
And we're neighbors, actually.

547
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,930
Um, then keep going straight,
please.

548
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Aha, going straight? Alright.

549
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,200
You're really kind. Is that
because you're a police officer?

550
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,630
You know it, I'm a public servant
after all.

551
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,700
When I was little, my dream was
to become a police officer, too.

552
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,900
Is that so?

553
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Yes, because my dad was
a police officer.

554
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,460
Oh, really?

555
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,330
Which area did he serve?

556
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,800
Haesan. Haesan Police Station.

557
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,660
Haesan…

558
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,700
Why?

559
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,400
Do you know someone in Haesan?

560
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,130
Ah… No, I don't.

561
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,100
Um, you can pull over at
Wonyoung Print Shop over there.

562
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,860
Ah, over there?

563
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,300
Officer, do you have a gun?

564
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,199
- A gun?
- Yes.

565
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,000
I forgot to bring it.

566
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,560
I was joking.
I don't carry around such a thing.

567
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,330
- Have you ever shot one?
- Countless number of times.

568
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,630
I still do once a year, you know.

569
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,100
Because we have a test.
Bang, bang.

570
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,560
No, except for that stuff.

571
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,000
I mean have you ever shot a gun
at a person?

572
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,730
Ah…

573
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,930
The thing is… Hmm, you know…

574
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,660
There aren't many police officers

575
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,860
who shoot a gun
at people during their service.

576
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,730
It's probably less than
10 percent.

577
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,130
However,

578
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,600
you have.

579
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,000
I guess you have a lot of interest

580
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,100
in that area.

581
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,730
Yes, absolutely.

582
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,730
It looks like you really have
shot a person, by the way.

583
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,460
I was just joking, though.

584
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,360
What happened to that person?

585
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,430
Dead?

586
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,000
What does it feel like?

587
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,300
When a person is dead
because of you?

588
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,330
Do you really want to know?

589
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,930
It feels like everything is over.

590
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,900
It was a joke.

591
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,660
Gosh, just the thought of it
feels like that, I mean.

592
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,400
I don't think it'd feel like that.

593
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,930
What do you think
it'd feel like then?

594
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,860
It feels weird.

595
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,300
Very weird.

596
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,530
You know murderers often say,

597
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,360
they feel like God.

598
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,100
- Is it really true?
- God?

599
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,960
You become a murderer

600
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,800
if you kill someone.

601
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,830
You won't become God,
just a vicious murderer.

602
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,900
That's right. A murderer.

603
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,800
You're very direct.

604
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,230
Thank you.

605
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,300
Can I ask you something?

606
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,800
What's your name?

607
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,060
Kim Moo-young.

608
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,800
Have we met somewhere before?

609
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,260
Yes, you know, we met the other day
in Itaewon.

610
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,960
Not recently.
I mean, a long time ago.

611
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,300
I don't think so.

612
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,730
Hi, Seung-ah.

613
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,130
Hey, Tak. Can you look up
a person for me?

614
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,400
He's about 30 and
lives in Wonyoung-dong.

615
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,960
Although, I'm not sure
if this is even his real address.

616
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,060
- I guess you know this is illegal.
- Huh?

617
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,030
I mean, why can't you be…

618
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,400
more natural? Huh?

619
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,030
He is ab, ab… about 30 and
lives in Wonyoung-dong.

620
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,430
When, when, when did I…

621
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,860
Are you asking me to look up
someone without a case number?

622
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,660
Do you want me
to take off my uniform?

623
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,460
Oh, my. What did I just say?

624
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,760
Take off my uniform?

625
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,400
No, it came out wrong,
Section Chief Yoo.

626
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,530
No, I didn't mean that.

627
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,260
So, don't get me wrong.
Go, just go. Go already.

628
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,630
Did you eat something wrong?

629
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,000
What is he talking about
when it's so busy?

630
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,030
Kim Moo-young?

631
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,830
One second.

632
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,160
(Location: Arts Brewery)

633
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,300
Hello, Manager Oh.

634
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,960
Can I get a list of the buyers

635
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,200
who were at
Seung-ah's exhibition?

636
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,260
Hi, Seung-ah. It's me.

637
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,130
Hi, Jin-kang.

638
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,300
We won the Arts project.

639
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,860
Ah, really? That's great.

640
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,700
Our president seems
to be very grateful to you.

641
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,500
She said she'd like
to treat you to a fancy meal.

642
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,760
No, Jin-kang.
I'm not the reason for it.

643
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,930
Actually, I didn't even have
a chance to give it to him.

644
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,800
Because I haven't met
Woo-sang yet.

645
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,600
Ah, really?

646
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,000
Hey, that's even better. Because
I felt a bit uncomfortable.

647
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,700
I know, right?

648
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,160
Let's keep it a secret
from President Hwang

649
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,830
and let her buy us a nice meal.

650
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,860
- What about tomorrow evening?
- Tomorrow?

651
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,960
Tomorrow is tough…

652
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:11,160
- You have a date, huh?
- Yes.

653
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,400
Ah, umm, Seung-ah.

654
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,260
Yes.

655
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,600
You know, your boyfriend.

656
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,730
Moo-young?

657
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,400
What about him?

658
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,700
Yes. Ah, really? Where?

659
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,430
Uh-huh.

660
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,800
Alright.

661
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,160
Jin-kang said she saw everything.

662
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:08,100
- Saw what?
- Everything.

663
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,160
I guess you know
you did something wrong, huh?

664
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,930
Do you still not know
what you did wrong?

665
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,430
What,

666
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,260
you still don't know?

667
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,360
What? What is it?

668
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,560
Did you watch a movie alone?

669
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,360
She saw everything. She said
you looked very bored.

670
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,360
- Of course, I was bored.
- Why did you do that?

671
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,700
You should've gone with me.

672
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,530
Did you do wrong?

673
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,630
Yes, I did.

674
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,100
(Criminal Investigation Division)

675
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,930
Oh.
(Criminal Investigation Division)

676
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:06,130
(Criminal Investigation Division)

677
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,700
- Choi Sang-hoon got caught.
- Really?

678
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,700
The local police caught him
using his credit card

679
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,900
at a convenience store
near Toronto.

680
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,200
- I'm off to Foreign Affairs Div.
- Hey.

681
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,960
He used his credit card?

682
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,100
Why did you come down so late?

683
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,400
Director Jang is going
to buy you a nice meal.

684
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,560
Why don't you come with us?

685
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,960
Gosh, I'm okay.
Just buy her lots of nice food.

686
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:02,260
I don't have much of an appetite
these days.

687
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:05,260
- Is there something wrong?
- No.

688
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,360
It's just that her dad can't
sleep well these days.

689
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,260
Neither can I.

690
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,260
He's a vice president, but he's
just another salary employee.

691
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,630
It's natural for employees to feel
nervous during reorganization.

692
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,700
Don't worry about it.

693
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,460
I forgot to mention this.

694
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,760
You'll hear good news soon.

695
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,030
Don't worry and get some rest.

696
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,000
I had no idea.

697
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,030
Oh, my, Seung-ah.
We didn't have any idea.

698
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,000
Where are you going?

699
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,330
Seung-ah.

700
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,760
I'll tell my mom.

701
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,060
So please leave.

702
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,160
Who are you seeing these days?

703
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,100
Do you know when
you look the most adorable?

704
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,300
I don't need any of this.
I'm a bit different.

705
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,830
At least, I'm not a superficial snob
like you guys.

706
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,260
When you act like that.

707
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,830
Like you're doing now.

708
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,400
So adorable.

709
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,100
However,

710
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,030
you cannot live without this.

711
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,860
Because you're as much of a
superficial snob as I am.

712
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,130
I don't care what you think.

713
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,500
I take it back. My permission
has been withdrawn.

714
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,600
So get rid of him.

715
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,230
Ah…

716
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,300
My father will fly back to Korea
next week.

717
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,260
I'll officially introduce you
to him. Then, let's get married.

718
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,930
Woo-sang.

719
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,130
I'm not an object
that you own.

720
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,100
I'm a person.

721
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,330
Whether you're a person or an object,
you're still mine.

722
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,330
Dress nicely,
then come down.

723
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,430
- Hello.
- Can I get a noodle soup?

724
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,130
Sure.

725
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,900
Who was that woman?

726
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,360
At the cinema.

727
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,130
Little sister.

728
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,700
I guess all women are like
cute little sisters to you.

729
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,360
Not at all. I have
only one cute little sister.

730
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,260
At least, Seung-ah's feelings
for you are real.

731
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,900
So?

732
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,260
I'm asking you
if you really like her.

733
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,100
Then what about you, Yoo Jin-kang?

734
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,030
Because that guy's feelings
seemed real, at least.

735
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,400
Don't try to change the subject.

736
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,500
Since he's a police officer,
his job is secure.

737
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,860
And he seems nice, too.

738
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,400
However, he's a bit too naive.

739
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,860
Am I able to fall in love
with him?

740
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:28,260
Well, it's just a date.

741
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,700
Let's just go for it.

742
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,360
Are you talking about
these kinds of real feelings?

743
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,930
- What do you want it to be?
- What do you mean?

744
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,430
Your closest and dearest friend

745
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,230
met a guy.

746
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,760
And you'd like to know if the guy

747
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:47,060
- really likes your friend, right?
- Correct.

748
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,300
I mean, why would you want
to know something like that?

749
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,230
How would you feel if
the guy didn't really like her?

750
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,530
I'd feel very upset.

751
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,860
I don't believe you.

752
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,660
What do you mean
you don't believe me?

753
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:07,200
You might feel good about it
in secret.

754
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,130
Like I knew that'd happen.

755
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:14,630
Do you feel that way?

756
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,830
Do you secretly enjoy it

757
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,230
when someone you
love gets hurt?

758
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I mean, maybe…

759
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,460
Maybe…

760
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,260
you're the one
who's interested in me.

761
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,230
Without even realizing it.

762
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,200
I'm afraid

763
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,460
that tactic
doesn't work on me.

764
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,060
Enjoy.

765
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,830
I am being sincere.

766
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,530
You asked me if I really like her.

767
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:09,460
Yes, I really like her.

768
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,960
Eat up.
Otherwise, it'll get soggy.

769
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,060
- You've never seen a burn scar?
- Yes, I have.

770
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,900
If you're done,
why don't you just leave?

771
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,930
Aw, that'd be too heartless.

772
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,200
- Does it bother you?
- I think it bothers you for sure.

773
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,330
You looked very embarrassed
in front of him the other day.

774
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,300
- Because it was a blind date.
- What about me?

775
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:00,430
- You what?
- Aren't you embarrassed?

776
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,730
Oh, right.

777
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,630
I'm not embarrassed about it
at all. Why is that?

778
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:22,630
I mean,
what's so strange about that?

779
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,000
If you're short on cash,
you have to use a credit card.

780
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,130
What I mean is,

781
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,060
it sounds too sloppy for someone

782
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,030
who killed a person and
ran to a far away place like Canada.

783
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,260
- Um, is that so?
- And his place, too.

784
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,430
Even for a guy's room,

785
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,330
it was, gosh…

786
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,600
He doesn't know a thing about
tidying up.

787
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,800
Aha.

788
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,200
What you're saying is
that he doesn't seem like someone

789
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,930
who's capable of putting back 50
snow globes in perfect order, huh?

790
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:52,530
- How did you know?
- Eom Cho-rong.

791
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,800
Eom Cho-rong,
such a big mouth. Gosh.

792
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:59,230
But he sounds interesting
for sure.

793
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,860
Does he really remember everything
once he sees something?

794
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,930
That's what I'm saying.

795
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,530
What time is it now?
When will our food come out, huh?

796
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,160
You're waiting for
Choi Sang-hoon, right?

797
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:14,160
Look. He's probably arriving
at Incheon Airport as we speak.

798
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,930
He's not going to get here
anytime soon.

799
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,860
- Oh, here it is.
- It's here.

800
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,260
I'm the only person who
buys you something like this, huh?

801
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,730
Is this on you?

802
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,630
No, you should pay.

803
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,730
- Let's go.
- Then don't eat.

804
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,730
Alright, alright.
On this special occasion,

805
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,730
we'll specially go Dutch.

806
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,000
Aw, forget it.
What a stinge you are.

807
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,060
If you're going to pay,
you should pay for everything.

808
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,500
- What kind of person is…
- Alright.

809
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,130
Alright. Then
let's go half and half.

810
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,200
You've never seen a burn scar?

811
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,600
Kim Moo-young.
Kim Moo-young. Kim Moo-young.

812
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,900
None of them.

813
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,830
- Are they not?
- No.

814
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,230
Um, then the
Kim Moo-young

815
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,230
you're looking for is clean.

816
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,760
At least he's not an ex-convict.

817
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,460
That's a relief.

818
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:25,460
Who is it? Huh?

819
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,860
Why are you looking for him?

820
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,700
He's just someone who
lives in my neighborhood.

821
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,360
I asked you because
he seems very familiar.

822
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:40,860
Oh, my. What the…

823
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:42,300
Did you really ask me for this

824
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,760
to screw me over...
You made me

825
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,500
- It hurts.
- Look up an innocent person?

826
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,560
- Are you really crazy?
- It hurts. It hurts. Okay, okay.

827
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,200
But…

828
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,760
It's weird.

829
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:58,960
What's weird?

830
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:01,900
It's a bit strange.

831
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:05,330
My heart bounces in a weird way.

832
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,760
When I see him…

833
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:13,500
I get strangely nervous.

834
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,900
Moo-young, I think the basin
is clogged.

835
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,100
The water won't drain.

836
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,000
- Oh…
- Ugh, seriously.

837
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,700
Gosh, you ungrateful bastard.

838
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,230
I fed you fancy food, but you
don't even buy me a cup of coffee?

839
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,100
I will. I will. I'll definitely
buy you coffee tomorrow.

840
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,630
Hey, you're such a miser.
Gosh, you're so cheap.

841
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,800
Aw, seriously.

842
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,160
Here it comes.

843
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:18,800
Get off the car.

844
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,500
- What's your motive for murder?
- What's your motive for committing the crime?

845
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,300
Please say something
to the victim's family.

846
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,160
Doesn't he look too plain?

847
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,600
Is that right?
Is he really the murderer?

848
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,300
It's clogged.

849
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,500
(Moo-young)

850
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:33,730
Are you close?

851
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,360
I didn't say I'd come over.

852
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,860
Gosh, I'm telling you.
It's completely clogged.

853
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,600
I couldn't even wash my face.

854
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,800
You're still pretty even if
you don't wash your face.

855
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,230
What are you doing?

856
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,430
Why are you so busy that
you can't even come?

857
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,430
I'm busy watching you.

858
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,900
Huh? Really? Where are you?

859
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,200
Gosh, the raw fish might've
gone bad. Ugh, diarrhea…

860
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:16,560
Where?

861
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:23,060
I don't see you.

862
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:25,600
What…

863
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,460
Where are you, really?

864
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,800
I said I'm watching you.

865
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:42,400
What are you doing here?

866
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,000
Um, the door was open…

867
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,760
This is not a place you can just
enter on your own.

868
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:51,160
- Let's go.
- Ah…

869
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,360
I said wait
in front of the bathroom.

870
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:10,900
Why would you go into my office…

871
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,760
I'm sorry. I didn't know
I wasn't allowed to go in.

872
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:16,600
What were you looking at?
You looked quite immersed.

873
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,460
- A murderer.
- A murderer?

874
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:22,460
- Yes, on the wall.
- On the wall?

875
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:25,130
Ah, in the picture?
Choi Sang-hoon?

876
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,730
Yes.

877
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:39,500
(A remake of the Japanese series A Hundred
Million Stars Falling From The Sky)

878
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,300
(Hundred Million Stars From The Sky)

879
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,860
- Choi Sang-hoon got caught.
- It wasn't me.

880
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:05,900
Where would you put this?
Where did you hide it?

881
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:09,530
- It was definitely it.
- I feel like it wasn't Choi Sang-hoon.

882
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,960
Did you send Assistant Lim
away on purpose?

883
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:12,960
No one's here.
You sent them away one by one.

884
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:14,230
There's only us
two left now.

885
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,930
- What the heck is wrong with you?
- I'm with a different woman.

886
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
If you get caught doing
something dodgy one more time,

887
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,460
I'll tell Seung-ah everything.

888
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:22,200
I'm not going
to get married to Woo-sang.

889
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,130
Woo-sang is a very scary person.

890
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,430
What kind of joke is that?

891
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,730
You're seriously out.
