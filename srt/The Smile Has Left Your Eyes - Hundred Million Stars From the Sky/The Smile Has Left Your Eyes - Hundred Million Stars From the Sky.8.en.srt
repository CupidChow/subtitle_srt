(Episode 8)

7
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,130
When I came to my senses,

8
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,930
I was in Mi-yeon's house.

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,630
Hey.

10
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,830
- I'm not going.
- How could you not go?

11
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,900
They were arguing.

12
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,360
How can I go on a trip right now?

13
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,400
- Let's talk about it when we get there.
- I said I'm not going!

14
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,830
Later, Sang-hoon left.

15
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,000
How could you not go?
Let's talk when we get there.

16
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,100
- Mi-yeon came back.
- I'm so freaking upset!

17
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,330
Such a piece of trash.

18
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,700
And the next thing I remember is…

19
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,560
blood…

20
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,560
There was blood…

21
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,560
No, I don't remember.

22
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,700
Yoo-ri!

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,130
I don't remember.

24
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,500
What are you thinking of doing

25
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,329
against someone like him?

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,900
I'm not thinking about anything.

27
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,730
That's how I win.

28
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,500
Don't get caught.

29
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,360
Kim Moo-young!

30
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,460
They only told me Seung-ah's
car was in an accident.

31
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,330
Even the police don't
want to talk about it further.

32
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,930
Jin-kang.

33
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,360
They said the man in her car
is dead too.

38
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,230
Yeah, it's okay. Good.

39
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
So when you came to your senses,

40
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,100
you were already inside, right?

41
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,960
I know it's hard for you,

42
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,660
but you'll remember
once you enter.

43
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,400
Come in.

44
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,500
That's fake.

(Security CCTV is operating)

(Operation Room)

49
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,960
The operation went well,
so her life is no longer at risk.

50
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,360
But we'll have to monitor
her closely from now on.

51
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,860
Thanks.

52
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,560
Our Seung-ah is fine…

54
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,130
We've just bought off
for Seung-ah's evidences.

55
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,600
- What happened to Seung-ah?
- She's alive!

56
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,530
The operation went well.

57
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,530
Gosh, I'm so glad.

58
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,160
So relieved.

59
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,330
Are you alright?

60
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,760
- You must've been shocked.
- I'm fine.

61
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,830
Jin-kook,

62
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,430
something's weird.

63
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,900
- Did you say Kim Moo-young?
- Right.

64
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,299
There's no such person.

65
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,860
He's not here?

66
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,700
No, he's not.

67
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,630
They said he's not here.

68
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,300
He's not here?

69
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,900
It was only Jang Woo-sang
who's dead and

70
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,830
Baek Seung-ah who came in last night
from the accident.

71
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,430
No way…

72
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,560
Are you sure Kim Moo-young
was in Seung-ah's car?

73
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,860
I'm 100% sure.

74
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,600
I saw him.

75
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,030
Kim Moo-young was sitting next
to the driver's seat

76
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,300
in Seung-ah's car

77
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,760
and Jang Woo-sang was
following them

78
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,500
in his own car.

79
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,800
But no one is talking
about Kim Moo-young.

80
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,030
Even in the news,

81
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,230
they're reporting as if Seung-ah was
in Jang Woo-sang's car.

82
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,160
But, no, that's not true.

83
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,300
And Seung-ah's mom told me when
she called me this morning,

84
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,600
that the police said

85
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,530
Seung-ah's car got in an accident.

86
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,800
Jin-kook, something must've
happened to him.

87
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,500
Jin-kang, Jin-kang.

88
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,900
Calm down and talk to me.

89
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,760
Slowly, tell me everything
from the beginning.

90
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,960
A few days ago, Jang Woo-sang
beat Kim Moo-young up.

91
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,900
Beat him up?

92
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,860
He paid thugs to do the job.

93
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,160
What's wrong with your face?

94
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,900
Did you get in a fight?

95
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,000
I was beat up. It wasn't a fight.

96
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,030
It was pretty much
a one-sided beating.

97
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,430
I think everything
started from then.

98
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,600
I was too worried. I felt like
something was going to happen.

99
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,200
He said that

100
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,260
the thugs don't even know

101
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,830
why they had to beat him up.

102
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,730
If he's filing a case or fighting
back, he should do it right

103
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,300
by fighting the real bad guy
who's behind it.

104
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,800
The death of Director Jang Woo-sang
of NJ Group was

105
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,000
a disaster caused by speeding
in the rain.

106
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,960
Here's Reporter Jo Kang-tae
with the story.

107
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,760
Around 12:15AM this morning,

108
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,900
a sedan that swerved out
of control in the rain

109
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,230
crashed past the guardrail and

110
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,800
fell 10m down the cliff.

111
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,260
The accident happened because
the driver didn't keep the speed limit

112
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,630
and couldn't slow down

113
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,060
while making a sharp
turn in the rain.

117
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,230
We're still investigating
the exact cause of the accident.

118
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,060
Uh? It's Sang-jin.

119
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,700
We will make a further
announcement

120
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,960
- Do you know him?
- once the investigation is over…

121
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,730
Yeah, he's my senior from
my old team.

122
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,900
Director Jang Woo-sang
when the accident…

123
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,130
Gosh, he's aged, too.

124
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,600
We haven't completed

125
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,660
our investigation on that yet…

126
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,930
Old team?

127
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,700
You know,

128
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,830
my team that got disbanded
because of someone.

129
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,600
NJ Group hasn't officially

130
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,230
released a statement yet.

131

Reporter Park Jae-min.

136
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,660
Hello, I'm currently at
NJ Group's funeral home.

137
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,400
I don't believe this.

138
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,430
- Due to this abrupt accident…
- This is unbelievable.

139
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,660
He was completely fine
until last night.

140
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,830
I don't know.

141
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,600
This is really terrifying.

142
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,000
The investigation is
being kept confidential…

143
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,960
Oh, she's here.

144
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,560
How's Seung-ah? Is she alright?

145
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,560
Yes, luckily she's no longer
in critical condition.

146
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,460
The operation went well too.

147
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,200
Thank god.

148
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,900
Did you get to see her face?

149
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,630
I did.

150
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,460
But she's still unconscious…

151
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,660
Even if the operation went well,
they still have to monitor her.

152
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,600
Because she's not
completely stable yet.

153
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,160
Makes sense.

154
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,960
Isn't it a miracle that
she's still alive

155
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,430
when the car fell
from a 10m high cliff?

156
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,200
Why?

157
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,100
You're done eating?

158
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,130
Yeah. You should finish.
Take your time.

159
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,230
You said her operation went well.

160
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,800
Isn't that a relief? Right?

161
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,200
So eat up now.

162
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,500
Hurry.

163
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,060
Kim Moo-young disappeared.

164
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,930
What do you mean he disappeared?

165
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,900
But…

166
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,760
what's more surprising
to me is that

167
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,600
Kim Moo-young was
seeing Baek Seung-ah!

168
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,060
Yeah, not for too long though.

169
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
So?

170
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,560
Are you saying that NJ Group

171
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,200
is hiding Kim Moo-young?

172
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,900
I can't really say for sure.

173
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,830
But it's clear they're controlling
the accident itself.

174
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,560
Even the media.

175
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,760
According to Jin-kang,

176
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,860
a total of 2 cars
crashed and fell,

177
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,600
but no one's reporting that.

178
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,730
Can conglomerates actually
control all this stuff?

179
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,460
Damn, this freaks me out.

180
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,630
But…

181
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,060
You really think something
happened to him?

182
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,300
No way.

183
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,130
Let's go.

184
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,200
The number you're calling is not
available. Please leave a message.

185
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,130
(Care Animal Clinic)

186
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,160
Jin-kang.

187
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,230
Yoo Jin-kang.

188
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,630
Where the hell is she going?

189
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,630
Jin-kang!

190
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,700
Hey!

191
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,130
What were you thinking so hard
about you couldn't even hear me?

192
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,000
Why did you go to
an animal clinic?

193
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,630
Ah, well,

194
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,330
I just bought some cat food.

195
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,530
Cat?

196
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,230
You don't have a cat.
What is it for?

197
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,130
Kim Moo-young.

198
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,430
Did you find anything?

199
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,860
Not yet.

200
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,330
Should I report him as missing?

201
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,830
Why would you?

202
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,960
Because he's gone missing!

203
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,160
Why would you do that?

204
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,060
Why do you care?

205
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,000
It doesn't matter!

206
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,760
I'm worried and
I want to report it!

207
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,800
You're seriously…

208
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,330
Whether it's a report
or an investigation, I'll do it.

209
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,860
So you just stay still.

210
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,400
You got it?

211
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:53,360
(Head of Traffic Security:
Kim Sang-jin)

212
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,260
How may I help you?

213
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,360
Hey.

214
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,360
Aren't you Director
Jang Woo-sang's secretary?

215
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,860
Yes?

216
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,260
You know Kim Moo-young, right?

217
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,360
Kim Moo-young?

218
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,760
You were in Wonyoung-dong
last Thursday night.

219
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,560
I was?

220
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,160
I bumped into you

221
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,360
in front of Wonyoung Printing.

222
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,260
In front of Kim Moo-young's house.

223
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,000
I don't follow.

224
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,900
You got the wrong person.

225
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,530
Sorry.

226
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,300
Can't you just tell me
where he is?

227
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,600
Is he…

228
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,360
even alive?

229
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,230
Hey, hey, let me.

230
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,560
Here.

231
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,060
You disgraceful punk.

232
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,960
Well… yeah…

233
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,430
Hey, I knew you were an asshole,

234
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,430
but how could you let me
find out your

235
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,430
mother passed away
3 years later through someone else?

236
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,530
Yeah…

237
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,900
Come on. I'm so sorry.

238
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,360
You're sorry?

239
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,030
If you are, drink.

240
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,400
Drink and spend the night here.

241
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,930
Otherwise,
I'm never going to see you again.

242
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,760
Sure. I will.

243
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,200
I'm so sorry.

244
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,360
Hey, anyways,
what brings you here?

245
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,760
I'm sure you didn't come all
this way just to see my face.

246
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,030
Where's Kim Moo-young?

247
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,660
Kim Moo-young?

248
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,230
The guy who was with the lady
in the car accident.

249
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,530
Where did you hide him?

250
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,260
How dare you.

251
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,660
Are you interrogating me?

252
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,630
Was I too straightforward?

253
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,900
Maybe I was too hasty.

254
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,260
I'm sorry, my bad.

255
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,560
It's because
I was taught too well.

256
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,700
You were the one who taught me
to be straightforward!

257
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,530
- Be straightforward so…
- He answers straightforwardly.

258
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,660
Shut up, punk.

259
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,900
You call yourself well-taught,

260
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,860
and you're working under someone
who used to work under you?

261
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,300
I heard you're in
Lee Kyung-chul's team.

262
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,830
That's right.

263
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,530
Should I be ashamed?

264
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,760
You think you should
just be ashamed?

265
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,460
You should be damn embarrassed,
you know that?

266
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,300
Anyway…

267
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,260
Why are you asking that?

268
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,660
- You know him?
- Yeah.

269
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,860
Just tell me everything you know
without filtering anything.

270
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,360
Where is he

271
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,860
now?

272
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,330
No, I don't know.

273
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,300
I'm serious. I don't know

274
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,430
where he is now.

275
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I mean he's a witness.

276
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,760
Of course they're sensitive
about him.

277
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,260
They don't even know
when he'll wake up.

278
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,260
Plus, they don't know what
he'll blabber once he wakes up.

279
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,000
You mean
he's currently unconscious?

280
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,560
I don't know about now,

281
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,000
but he was unconscious
during the accident.

282
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,830
But he wasn't in
critical condition.

283
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,500
Hey, have you

284
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,800
ever seen a $2M check?

285
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,700
A $2M check?

286
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,060
Yeah.

287
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,760
This incident was a crime
of passion.

288
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,400
- A crime of passion?
- Yeah.

289
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,030
That's why the company is doing
everything they can

290
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,530
to bury the case.

291
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,430
We found a $2M check
in the girl's purse.

292
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,860
There was a note with the check.

293
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,600
We assumed it was written
by the guy.

294
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,860
What did it say?

295
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,630
I'm not sure
whether it's love or not,

296
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,600
but let's try anyway.

297
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,400
Something similar to that.

298
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,260
I think they got caught trying
to run away together

299
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,430
by the rich man who died.

300
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,200
When the accident occurred,

301
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,230
Jang Woo-sang was wasted.

302
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,500
The girl's car slipped in the rain
in front of him,

303
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,900
but he just rammed into it.

304
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,630
The height of both cars' collision

305
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,660
is exactly the same.

306
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,460
You mean Jang Woo-sang didn't
step on the brakes?

307
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,830
That's it.

308
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,730
If he stepped on the brakes,

309
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,560
the following car would've
been stuck

310
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,760
in the bottom of the front car.

311
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,430
Plus, the height of collision
should be much lower.

312
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,330
But for this case,

313
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,060
the height is almost horizontal.

314
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,700
Now tell me.

315
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,230
It was a "I die, you die" thing.

316
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,730
He must've rammed into them
on purpose.

317
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,230
Where the hell are you?

318
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,660
Thank you.

319
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,030
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

320
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,060
A beer glass?

321
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,060
Yeah, the one in
Jung Mi-yeon's picture.

322
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,860
I just met her friend

323
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,160
in the same ballet major,

324
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,600
and there was the
same glass cup

325
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,460
in the practice room.

326
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,230
- Really?
- Yeah.

327
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,300
She said she got it
with Jung Mi-yeon

328
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,600
at a beer festival in the summer.

329
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh, right. That cup…

330
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,030
I heard it was made
for a festival.

331
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,430
Right, so we should
look into it more.

332
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,300
Where are you, Sergeant?

333
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,160
I'll be there in a couple
of hours.

334
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,330
So see you then.

335
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,430
Okay.

336
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,830
- I should go.
- Okay, bye.

337
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,100
Hey, take this.

338
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,130
Goodness, what is this?

339
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,830
What do you mean?
Buy some snacks for your kid.

340
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,960
Snacks? Gosh.

341
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,860
That kid is turning 30 soon.

342
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,260
Just buy some for her.

343
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,500
Do it. Okay?

344
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,430
I've felt so bad

345
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,800
for her these

346
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,030
past 30 years that's why.

347
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,730
Gosh, fine.

348
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,030
I'll buy her snacks.

349
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,530
Jeez, I'm really leaving.

350
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,230
- Hey, Jin-kook.
- What?

351
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,700
Didn't Kyung-chul
tell you anything?

352
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,830
What?

353
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,030
The kid came here.

354
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,660
Who are you talking about?

355
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,860
The boy you were looking for.

356
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,430
He came here? When?

357
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,360
It's been more than 20 years.

358
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,160
Around 3 months
after you left for Seoul.

359
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,630
He came to the police station.

360
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,460
I wasn't on duty that day,

361
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,800
so Kyung-chul saw him.

362
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,630
Why didn't you tell me
the boy visited the police station?

363
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,000
What do you mean?

364
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,060
I heard you met the boy
I was looking for!

365
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,100
Why are you doing this?

366
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,660
What did you say?
What did you tell him?

367
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,330
What does it matter now?

368
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,500
I told him to leave.

369
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,100
- What?
- I told him to leave!

370
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,730
To get lost because the person
he was looking for wasn't there!

371
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,930
- What?
- It's true.

372
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,930
You ran away to Seoul!
You weren't even there!

373
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,700
Sergeant Yoo,
are you even listening to me?

374
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,400
Sir?

375
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,100
Sergeant Yoo!

376
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,030
Kim Moo-young and Jung Mi-yeon
have met before!

377
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,400
Sir!

378
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,660
Gosh, what do I do?
I really don't get him.

379
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,060
Why's he acting like
he's going through puberty?

380
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,660
Hey.

381
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,030
You punk.

382
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,060
- Why did you hit me?
- You.

383
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,330
What do you want to eat, you punk?

384
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,500
- Oh, so what happened?
- And…

385
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,000
Excuse me, can we get
one more assorted sushi set?

386
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,800
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

387
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,530
At first, I thought
I was just lucky.

388
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,560
I saw the same glass cup

389
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,900
with the girl I met this morning.

390
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,160
So just to make sure,

391
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,930
I went to the place
where the event was held.

392
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,600
He didn't even look at the glass
that I asked him to.

393
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,100
Damn, that crazy tramp.

394
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,500
She's totally awful.

395
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,200
He just brought up Jung Mi-yeon.

396
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,830
You know this girl, Jung Mi-yeon?

397
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,130
I guess everyone at the event
was drunk and crazy.

398
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,230
But Jung Mi-yeon especially was

399
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,800
very rude because she was drunk.

400
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,300
I wasn't really into
his story until,

401
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,160
- but suddenly…
- If it hadn't been for Kim Moo-young,

402
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,260
I would've beat up that girl
and just gone to jail.

403
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,630
He started talking
about Kim Moo-young!

404
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,400
- Kim Moo-young?
- What, Kim Moo-young?

405
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,200
That Kim Moo-young?

406
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,300
That Kim Moo-young.

407
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,530
And he said

408
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,160
Kim Moo-young took

409
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,460
drunk Jung Mi-yeon home that day.

410
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:04,600
Gosh, this is awesome!

411
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,630
That's why I don't understand

412
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,300
why Sergeant Yoo is like
that after hearing all this.

413
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,460
I hear you.

414
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,500
You must be damn frustrated.

415
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
I wasn't sure
he was even listening to me.

416
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:20,000
I was all worked up,
but he was completely zoned out.

417
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,160
He made me skeptical
about the whole thing.

418
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,760
He didn't feel like the
Sergeant Yoo I know.

419
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,600
It's almost meaningless
working together.

420
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,900
Eom Cho-rong, listen.

421
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,430
- You know how he's like.
- What?

422
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,330
When he's acting strange,

423
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,130
you should just close your eyes

424
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,460
and wait for him.

425
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,360
Hey, eat up.

426
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,630
Eat as much as you want.

427
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,660
Where are you?

428
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,460
Where did you…

429
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,760
(Emergency Room)

430
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,260
Doctor.

431
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,500
You're home.

432
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,860
Why are all the lights off?

433
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,260
I fell asleep.

434
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,760
It doesn't seem like
he's in critical condition.

435
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,460
I don't know where he is now,

436
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,560
but he'll come back.

437
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,130
I know.

438
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,960
He came back.

439
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,700
He came back?

440
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,230
Yoo Jin-kang, how the hell
do you know that?

441
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,160
Did you just meet him?

442
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,900
Yes.

443
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,030
How could you…

444
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,960
He's back now.
That's what matters.

445
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,460
I'm not going to see him anymore.

446
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,830
Jin-kook, I'm so tired.

447
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,130
Stay a little longer.

448
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,060
Let's not see each other again.

449
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,900
Jin-kang.

450
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,130
It's okay…

451
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,800
(Ms. Baek, the fiance of NJ group's
director Jang Woo-sang, is found dead)

452
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,060
Ms. Baek, the fiance of NJ Group's
Director Jang Woo-sang,
(Ms. Baek, the fiance of NJ group's

453

(Ms. Baek, the fiance of NJ group's
director Jang Woo-sang, is found dead)

454
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:02,730
who was in the same car as him,
(Ms. Baek, the fiance of NJ group's
director Jang Woo-sang, is found dead)

455
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,230
who was in the same car as him,

456
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,960
died last night,

457
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,100
4 days after the accident.

458
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,160
Did you hear that?

459
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah.

460
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,930
Enjoy your meal.
This is a freebie.

461
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,700
Thanks.

462
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,700
Let's all go for drinks sometime.

463
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,100
Sure thing.

464
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,830
Damn, what's happening?

465
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,660
I didn't know
she was Jin-kang's friend.

466
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,460
How can you call yourself her
boyfriend when you don't even know that?

467
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,760
I know…

468
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,930
Come on.

469
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,200
It's because Jin-kang is prudent.

470
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,500
You two are going to
get along well.

471
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,860
(Late Baek Seung-ah)

472
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,030
You look better now
that you work for me.

473
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,760
The Baek Seung-ah incident
has been taken care of.

474
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,100
But still, you should show up

475
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,900
and offer your condolences
in person tomorrow.

476
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,200
Forget it. It's all over now.

477
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,330
What did he say when you told
him to write a memorandum?

478
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,800
- Did he just do it?
- Yes.

479
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,930
Do I just need to stamp
my fingerprint here?

480
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,200
($1M)

481
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,860
What about the money?

482
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,730
He took it without
saying anything.

483
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,860
$1M?

484
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,800
As if it was $100.

485
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,730
Like it was $100?

486
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,760
That's interesting.

487
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,230
What brings you here?

488
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,600
I should get to work.
Don't you have work today?

489
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,900
Is this

490
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,660
what you wanted?

491
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,400
Is this all about

492
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,760
an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth

493
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,730
stuff you were talking about?

494
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,930
I understand about Jang Woo-sang

495
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,200
because he got you beat up.

496
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,260
What…

497
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,530
What did Seung-ah do wrong?

498
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,500
Why do you sound like

499
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,600
I did everything on purpose?

500
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,000
Right.

501
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,560
Surely you had no idea
it would end up this way.

502
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:40,230
Then let me ask you one thing.

503
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,630
Would you not have done this

504
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,300
if you knew it would
end this way?

505
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,960
I'm not sure.

506
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,200
You bastard!

507
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,960
Seung-ah is dead.

508
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,160
Because of your petty revenge,

509
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,930
an innocent young girl died!

510
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,230
I would've.

511
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,800
I would've done it even if
I knew it would end up this way.

512
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:14,530
How dare you?

513
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,730
You think you won?

514
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,430
You still think you won
when 2 people died

515
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,560
because of your little game!

516
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:25,330
You call it even because
you risked your life too?

517
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,100
Right.

518
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,430
Don't call yourself human.

519
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,530
If…

520
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,530
If you were human,

521
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,860
if you really were a human…

522
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,260
What should I do?

523
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,900
If…

524
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,160
I were human?

525
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,630
Tell me.

526
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,660
Things are not going to
go the way you want.

527
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,600
I'm not going to let that happen.

528
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,160
Whatever or

529
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:06,760
whoever you are,

530
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,500
I don't give a crap.

531
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,360
That's kind of absurd.

532
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,030
Did I ever

533
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,030
mean something to you?

534
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,430
I thought you left?

535
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,100
Keep your word

536
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,700
that you're never going to
see him ever again.

537
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,500
I came back to say that.

538
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,330
Everything is a joke
and a game for him.

539
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,630
Nothing in this world
matters to him.

540
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,230
He even bet his own life

541
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,000
in his little game!

542
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,160
Jin-kook.

543
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,560
Remember.

544
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,930
Seung-ah…

545
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,000
died because of him.

546
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,400
He killed her.

547
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,100
How can you say that?

548
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,460
He said he would've done
the same thing…

549
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,730
even if he knew Seung-ah
would've died,

550
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,100
even if he would've died,

551
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,230
he still would've done it.

552
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,800
Jin-kook.

553
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:02,130
Good morning.

554
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,330
Hi, good morning.

555
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,700
Jin-kang, did you say
goodbye to your friend?

556
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,160
I don't know what to say…

557
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:21,330
Eom Cho-rong, you take this.

558
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,100
- Sir.
- What?

559
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,460
There won't be much to this.

560
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:26,830
What do you mean
there won't be much?

561
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,330
How do you know
without even watching them?

562
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,000
This is the list of dash cams
from cars near the incident.

563
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,930
I know.

564
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,600
- And?
- Sergeant Yoo already…

565
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,830
I'll do it.

566
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,630
I'll go through them.

567
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,360
You said you'll do it.

568
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,260
Let me just finish my text.

569
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,460
Are you insane?

570
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,200
Remember.

571
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,260
Seung-ah…

572
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,860
died because of him.

573
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:11,130
He killed her.

574
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,660
How can you say that?

575
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:15,100
He said he would've done
the same thing…

576
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,460
even if he knew Seung-ah
would've died,

577
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,800
even if he would've died,

578
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,700
he still would've done it.

579
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,000
(Eom Cho-rong)

580
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,730
I don't remember!

581
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,600
I told you already!
I don't remember anything else!

582
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,130
That's why I'll ask
you the questions.

583
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,400
Fine.

584
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,130
Go ahead.

585
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,300
You said you saw Choi Sang-hoon
and Jung Mi-yeon fighting

586
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,500
when you came to your senses?

587
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,760
Right.

588
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:06,300
Meaning you got inside
without them knowing.

589
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,560
Did you know her house passcode?

590
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,200
Yes.

591
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,000
You saw the CCTV installed
in front of Jung Mi-yeon's place?

592
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,660
Who do you think
was caught on that?

593
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,460
I don't care.

594
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,200
Why the hell should I care?

595
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,860
No one.

596
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:44,460
Because that CCTV is fake!

597
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,360
You probably didn't know,

598
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,660
but the culprit who cleaned up
the scene definitely knew

599
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,630
that CCTV was fake.

600
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:57,260
It was Kim Moo-young, wasn't it?

601
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:02,330
No.

602
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,560
It wasn't Moo-young.

603
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:07,700
The day you went to
Mi-yeon's place with me,

604
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,100
I followed you
on your way back home.

605
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:16,330
Even though you were
so distracted,

606
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,100
you took a route that completely
evaded CCTV cams.

607
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,900
(109th street/SI Building/Siso System)

(Market/Wonyoung Street/Jangse-ro 110th)

610
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,630
He also taught you that route.

611
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,300
Kim Moo-young.

612
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,400
No.

613
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,230
Even the passcode
to Jung Mi-yeon's place.

614
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,060
No, no, that's not true.

615
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,530
Is this why you saved me?

616
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,530
To give me a hard time?

617
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,960
You pretended to be a good guy
and secretly followed me!

618
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,560
So that you can bring
up your performance results!

619
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,000
You think I don't know that?

620
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,630
I didn't kill her!

621
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,860
Neither did Moo-young,
nor did I!

622
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:05,760
Killed a person.

623
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:09,000
I didn't kill! I didn't! I didn't!

624
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,700
I didn't kill her!

625
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,600
I mean…

626
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,030
I killed a person.

627
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,430
When I was 2 years
older than you.

628
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,160
But…

629
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,300
You can still get a fresh start.

630
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,000
I'm proof of that.

631
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,830
You've run out of time.

632
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,460
Wrap it up and come to
the station tomorrow morning.

633
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,830
You show up

634
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,430
and you turn yourself in.

I'm going out.

640
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:18,400
Cho-rong, can we meet tonight?

641
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,700
There's something
I have to tell you.

642
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,660
Something she has to tell me?

You knew all about this,
didn't you?

649
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,030
So this is the huge piece of evidence
you mentioned before, right?

The one Sergeant Yoo found.

651

Hey, Cho-rong.

652
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:05,660
Please search through Kim Moo-young's
personal information.

653
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,060
Yeah, sure.

00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:32,930
Damn it…

657
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,960
(Sergeant Yoo)

658
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,600
Jin-kang.

659
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,860
I'm sorry but I don't think
I can meet you tonight.

660
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:03,060
Still, enjoy your dinner.

661
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:04,800
Welcome.

662
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:08,260
I'm sorry.

663
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,760
We don't have any available seats.

664
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,260
I'll sit there.

665
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,500
- Can I have 1 kalguksu?
- Okay.

666
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,400
You've decided not to talk to me?

667
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,900
I guess you did.

668
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,530
What's wrong with you?

669
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,760
What's wrong with you, then?

670
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:49,860
What did I do?

671
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,960
Why are you acting like
nothing happened?

672
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:00,560
Fine, I might get an upset stomach.
I surrender.

673
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:15,830
Thanks.

674
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,860
Jin-kook said

675
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,930
you played a game.

676
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,430
Nothing in this world
matters to you.

677
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:18,500
You even bet your own life
in your game.

678
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,030
Is that right?

679
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,030
Is that why you're not sad?

680
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,500
Even if it's Seung-ah?

681
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,230
Is that why you would
still do it again

682
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,230
even if you knew you or Seung-ah

683
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,400
would die…

684
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:52,700
If you could turn back time?

685
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,760
You would.

686
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,300
I was only worried about you I didn't
even know Seung-ah was dying.

687
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:20,330
I was so scared

688
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,200
they might've done
something to you.

689
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:28,300
That you might've died

690
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,560
in the ward where
Seung-ah was actually dying.

691
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,300
I prayed for you
to come back alive.

692
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,360
But Seung-ah died.

693
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,500
I couldn't even tell
her that I was sorry

694
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,260
and that I was thankful.

695
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,060
Why are you not sad?

696
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,460
Why are you fine?

697
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,060
How could you not
care about your own life?

698
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:34,160
The life I was worried sick about

699
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:36,830
without even knowing
that my friend was dying?

700
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,230
I don't know either.

701
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,030
Uh?

702
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,760
- Isn't he the one?
- Right.

703
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:08,400
Mr. Kim Moo-young.

704
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:15,000
You're under arrest
for murdering Jung Mi-yeon

705
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,600
and abandoning her dead body.

706
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,260
You have the right to
consult an attorney.

707
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:20,300
You can remain silent.

708
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,700
If you say anything,
it can be used against you

709
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,830
in a court of law.

710
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,000
Let's go.

711
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,830
(A remake of the Japanese series A Hundred
Million Stars Falling From The Sky)

712
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,160
(Thank you to Seo Eun-soo and
Do Sang-woo for guest starring)

713
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,600
(Hundred Million Stars From The Sky)

714
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,400
- He's not the culprit.
- Sergeant Yoo.

715
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,030
The real culprit is outside
here right now.

716
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,100
What did you do?

717
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,930
Were you just waiting
for everything to end?

718
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,130
You don't need to date me,

719
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,400
but you can't date him either.

720
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,660
He also feels pain if you hit him.

721
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:21,560
He must be enjoying the pain.

722
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:24,160
He's the devil.

723
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,160
Are you scared of me?

724
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:27,500
I'm scared because it seems
like you're going the wrong way.

725
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,000
Jang Se-ran's pub in Sungsoo-dong!

726
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,230
Kim Moo-young will
be running it!

727
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,000
I won't do it
if you tell me not to.

728
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,030
Promise me you'll
become a good man.
