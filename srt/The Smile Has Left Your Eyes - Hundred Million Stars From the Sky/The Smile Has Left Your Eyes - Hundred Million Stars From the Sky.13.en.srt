Was it you, Doctor?

7
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,400
My father was killed, wasn't he?

8
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,700
No,

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,660
your father…

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,160
committed suicide.

(Looking for a missing kid)

00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,660
I'm looking for that kid.
(Looking for a missing kid)

14
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,060
Do you know what my real name is?

I'll tell you later)

Autumn of 1993,

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,200
I was at Haesan Hospital too.

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,600
I was a first year intern in ER.

20
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,800
I was the one who
treated his burn.

21
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,500
Is Moo-young…

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,200
Sun-ho?

23
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,030
Gosh, I'm nervous.

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,160
What's your real name?

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,800
Sun-ho.

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,760
My name is Kang Sun-ho.

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,600
Kang Sun-ho?

28
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,300
Moo-young is trying to recover
his memories.

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,729
I'm not dead.

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,960
You're not laughing.
I was just joking.

31
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,300
Were you seriously
trying to kill me?

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,400
It doesn't suit you.

33
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,660
You said killing people
will make you a murderer.

34
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,760
A vicious murderer.

35
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,260
It just doesn't suit you.

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,660
(Episode 13)

37
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,730
Morning, sir.

38
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,630
- He's here.
- Is that so?

39
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,329
Since he's here, I guess

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,430
everything went well
and his resignation was rejected.

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,700
I hope that's the case.

42
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,400
Manager, do you want another one?

43
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,630
Yes.

44
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,530
No.

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,560
I don't think I can eat lunch
if I have another one.

46
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,060
Right? It's really filling.

47
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,230
So I'll just eat 2 of these
for lunch.

48
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,800
I should do that too.

49
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,700
How can you guys eat so well

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,530
when you couldn't even get
a deal for Jang Se-ran's pub?

51
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,130
Ma'am, you don't want another one?

52
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,360
Yes, I want it!

53
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,530
It's delicious.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,860
President.

55
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,700
What does 'sun' mean?

56
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,500
- What?
- I mean your name.

57
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,329
What does the 'sun' in your
name Sun-ah mean?

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,660
It means kind.

59
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,360
Can't you tell?

60
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,260
Wow, that's really good.

61
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,430
What's so good about it?
It's so common.

62
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,000
Is it?

63
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,329
It's even better when it's common.

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,630
Because that means
it's true, right?

65
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,800
What's wrong with her today?

66
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,860
Let's say you're advised
to resign.

67
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,700
I'm sure you want to get
your unemployment benefits, don't you?

68
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,260
This is all I can do for you.

69
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,000
Is there anything
you'd like to complain about?

70
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,830
No.

71
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,860
Thanks for everything.

72
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,930
Did you hand in your resignation?

73
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,560
No, I got fired
even before I handed it in.

74
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,760
- Hey.
- You got fired?

75
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,760
Yes, I was advised to resign.

76
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,500
I was going to quit anyway,
so it's actually better.

77
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,360
He already cut me some slack
for not showing up without notice.

78
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,900
Yeah, that's right.

79
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,500
I'll finish work early today.
Shall we meet later?

80
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,159
What time will you be done?

81
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,830
I see.

82
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,960
Alright, see you.

83
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,360
(Mortar of Mountain Geumah)

84
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,530
Mortar of Mountain Geumah.

85
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,260
That's what everyone
seems to call the place.

86
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,130
Kang Sun-ho!

87
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,960
Let's take a picture!

88
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,460
A picture?

89
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,000
To commemorate!

90
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,360
- Here.
- You prepared a lot.

91
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,400
Right?

92
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,430
Come here.

93
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,860
- Does it even work from here?
- Of course!

94
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,560
Look.

95
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,159
One, two, three.

96
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,060
One, two, three.

97
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,230
One, two, three. Cheese!

98
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,500
Let's see!

99
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,159
Do we look good?

100
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,630
Yeah.

101
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,400
Perfect.

102
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,530
I'll send it to you as well.

103
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,659
To commemorate what?

104
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,500
To commemorate your unemployment!

105
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,430
- What?
- Stupid. Isn't it obvious?

106
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,400
Of course, Kang Sun-ho!

107
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,960
To commemorate
finding your real name.

108
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,760
'Sun' means kind and 'Ho' means high.

109
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,160
I love it.

110
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,230
Hey, who says it means

111
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,900
kind and high?

112
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,430
I said I didn't know
what it means.

113
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,130
You invented one for me.

114
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,200
I'm not sure about the 'ho',

115
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:34,100
but I'm pretty sure
'sun' means kind.

116
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,659
What?

117
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,730
I love it so much, you don't?

118
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,360
It's not a matter of
whether I like it or not,

119
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm still awkward with the name.

120
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,100
Names are really interesting…

121
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,900
The name Kim Moo-young,

122
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,700
feels somewhat lonely.

123
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,060
But the name Kang Sun-ho,

124
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,260
feels kind and brave.

125
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,960
- Are you that happy?
- Yeah, I am!

126
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,700
I really think

127
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,930
your parents are nice people.

128
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,830
People who gave you that name

129
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,830
must be good people.

130
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,560
Really?

131
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,900
Yeah.

132
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:36,200
Didn't Doctor tell you
anything else other than your name?

133
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,330
Your father committed suicide.

134
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,230
Not much.

135
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,100
I think I'm vicariously satisfied.

136
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,960
It feels like I found my own name.

137
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,530
You can find your name too.

138
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
Let's find it together.

139
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,030
I'm pretty sure

140
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,330
Jin-kook will tell me
when it's time.

141
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,530
I'll wait until he tells me.

142
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,460
(Kang Soon-gu)

143
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,130
I thought I could enjoy
some autumn leaves,

144
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,800
but they're all gone already!

145
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,500
Right, they look creepy.

146
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,760
But it's still really nice here.

147
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,430
It's an open road.

148
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,660
It's great we came here, right?

149
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,560
Yeah, I like it.

150
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,960
Apparently,
my father committed suicide.

151
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,030
He died in the mountain,

152
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,800
but I'm not sure

153
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,030
whether Doctor doesn't want
to tell me

154
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,430
or he really doesn't know.

155
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,530
Whatever.

156
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,130
It turns out

157
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,600
our family

158
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,830
wasn't really that happy.

159
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,000
So your father…

160
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
has passed away…

161
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,560
already.

162
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,030
I'm planning to go to Haesan.

163
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,130
Because of my father.

164
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,030
I want to go there.

165
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,800
Where in Haesan?

166
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,130
It's called
Mortar of Mountain Geumah

167
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,130
It's a cliff.

168
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,060
That's where he died.

169
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,300
Should I come with you?

170
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,560
All right.

171
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,860
Go and say hi to him.

172
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,460
What should I say?

173
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,530
Should I say hi?

174
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,630
I don't even know his name.

175
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,630
How do I greet him?

176
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,260
Father.

177
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,530
That's all you need.

178
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,060
Father, it's me, Sun-ho.

179
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,230
Right, that's all I need.

180
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,930
It's coming.

181
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,460
You take the bus first.

182
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,560
Yeah.

183
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,160
It's really hard to secretly date.

184
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,230
We can't even take
the bus together.

185
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,960
Right?

186
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,660
Why am I so anxious?

187
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,330
I know you're just going there
to say hi to your father...

188
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,030
But why am I suddenly so anxious?

189
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,400
You shouldn't be.

190
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,260
I'll be back very soon.

191
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,660
Is Moo-young…

192
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,600
Sun-ho?

193
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,160
Yes.

194
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,300
Moo-young is Kang Sun-ho…

195
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,730
How dare you?

196
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,060
Don't call yourself human.

197
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,160
If you were human,

198
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,760
if you really were a human…

199
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,400
I just dropped by your office.

200
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,160
Would you like some?

201
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,400
I guess you don't get it at all.

202
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,930
You can't become a policeman only
if you're smart and pass the exam.

203
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,460
Only a person can be a policeman,

204
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,530
not a murderer like you.

205
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,900
Jin-kook, he's just a poor boy.

206
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,630
He had a tougher life than I did.

207
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,300
Even without you hurting him,
he's already full of scars.

208
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
Why did he commit suicide?

209
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,060
I don't know.

210
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,400
Do you think you can stop here
if you were me?

211
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,660
I don't do things halfway.

212
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,200
What do you think is left?

213
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,730
A gun.

214
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,230
I still…

215
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,400
have dreams about my father
getting murdered.

216
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,460
Everyone tells me to stop

217
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,400
as if I can't come back
once I go there.

218
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,900
(Mart)

219
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,730
- Can I have a bottle of soju?
- Alright.

220
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,000
It looks like a folding screen.

221
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,359
I don't know
why people call it a mortar.

222
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,200
(Mortar)

223
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,360
I thought of bowing, but decided not
to because it was too awkward.

224
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,630
I couldn't even call him father.

225
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,400
I'm not sad at all.

226
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,900
I feel like I'll have sweet dreams
if I sleep here.

227
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,330
Dad?

228
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,960
(Mortar)

229
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,200
(Mortar)

230
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,000
Yoon!

231
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,900
Yoon!

232
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,360
I think I'm home.

233
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
(Haesan
Mortar of Mountain Geumah)

234
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,430
I feel like I'm really back.

235
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,830
Look at this!

236
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,630
A gun?

237
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,300
I'm worried about

238
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,860
what Moo-young told me last time.

239
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,160
Did a gun have anything to do

240
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,330
with his father's death?

241
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,230
(Yoo Jin-kang)

242
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,930
How was your trip?
(Yoo Jin-kang)

243
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,460
How was your trip?

244
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,400
So he really was the boy.

245
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,530
I feel bad.

246
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,800
If I feel like this, I can't imagine
how you must be feeling.

247
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,130
Are you alright?

248
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,960
Jin-kang said

249
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,700
he was hurt by people like me.

250
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,330
Those kinds of people

251
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,330
who only think about their child

252
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,900
and don't care
about other children!

253
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,260
How did things end up like this?

254
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,000
It did it because I was so scared.

255
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,560
Kim Moo-young is like a car
without brakes.

256
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,930
And Jin-kang wouldn't get off
the car.

257
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,800
If I hadn't forced her to stop,

258
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,700
she could've ended up anywhere.

259
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,830
So as Jin-kang said,

260
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,030
I hurt another kid
just to protect my child.

261
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,130
But that kid…

262
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,300
turned out to be Sun-ho…

263
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,230
So what are you going to do now?

264
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,530
He said that.

265
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,960
No, I said it first

266
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,930
that nothing's free.

267
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,430
Nothing's free in this world.

268
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,160
Nothing is just good luck.

269
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,700
That sounds reasonable.
I hate getting something for free.

270
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,760
An eye for an eye, a tooth for
a tooth, that's my type.

271
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,760
Right.

272
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,630
Nothing's free in this world.

273
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,400
If that's what he wants,

274
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,200
I'm okay with

275
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,860
an eye for an eye, a tooth for
a tooth.

276
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,860
Sergeant Yoo.

277
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,730
- Jin-kook.
- Hold on.

278
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,230
- Oh my god.
- Come here.

279
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,400
Look at my girl, Yoo Jin-kang!

280
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,230
Jin-kang, I'm sorry.
I had him drink too much.

281
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,000
- No, you don't need to be.
- It's you!

282
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,500
You're ugly, you're Yoo Jin-kang!

283
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,830
- Go to your room.
- I'm sure you didn't force him to drink,

284
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,100
and he drank willingly.

285
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,100
What did you say?

286
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,730
Come on, man!

287
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,360
Tak, just leave it there.
I'll pick it up later.

288
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,530
Who's this chestnut? This chestnut?

289
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,660
- Please don't.
- Jin-kook!

290
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,730
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

291
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,860
It looks like you really have
shot a person, by the way.

292
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,400
What happened to that person?

293
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,260
Dead?

294
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,460
Have we met somewhere before?

295
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,200
Not recently.
I mean, a long time ago.

296
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,800
I don't think so.

297
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,060
How was your trip?

298
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,300
Why are you so out of breath?

299
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,930
I pedalled here really fast
because I missed you.

300
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,200
Wait.

301
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,130
You went home?

302
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,930
Yes.

303
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,900
The house where you used
to live with your family?

304
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,400
Yes.

305
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,530
Where? How did you find it?

306
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,060
Just on my way, passing by.

307
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,300
In the woods.

308
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,460
In the woods?

309
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,430
Yes, a house like a picture.

310
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,360
No, that's a lie.

311
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,260
- What?
- That's a lie.

312
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,700
There was no house.

313
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,330
I just thought
there might be a house

314
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,530
when I passed by.

315
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,660
What the heck?

316
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,600
I was happy because
I thought you really found it.

317
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,960
Would I be happy
if I really found it?

318
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,930
Of course!

319
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's your family's house!

320
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,630
You know,
when you go somewhere,

321
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,630
you think of something
you couldn't remember before.

322
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,730
Right.

323
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,860
Did you say hello to your father?

324
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,360
I did.

325
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,800
You said your brother was
a police officer in Haesan, right?

326
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,460
- Yes.
- When did you guys move to Seoul?

327
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,760
Uhm, it was the summer
when I was 7…

328
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,860
Then it's the summer of 1996.

329
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,860
That was a quick calculation.

330
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:42,159
Why did you move to Seoul?

331
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,760
I don't know exactly but
it could've been for me.

332
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,199
I wasn't able to adjust to
the kindergarten there,

333
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,460
and my mom died that spring.

334
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,730
That must be why.

335
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,330
I see.

336
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,900
But why are you suddenly asking?

337
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,060
Police officers work in 4 shifts,
right?

338
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,030
Yes, weekly rotation.

339
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:07,000
Most officers are busy even
on their days off and holidays,

340
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,630
except for my brother.

341
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,060
He always takes those days off.

342
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,730
When?

343
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,330
This month, 4th, 8th, 12th…

344
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,860
Multiples of 4.

345
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,530
So he must be
on his day shift today.

346
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,100
But I asked why you're suddenly
asking these questions.

347
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,860
Didn't I tell you before?

348
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,000
I wanted to become a police
officer when I was young.

349
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,930
So I'm interested in the police.

350
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,960
Ah, right.

351
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,260
That's why you said your father
could've been in the police too.

352
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,600
Yeah.

353
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,060
Why did you suddenly
exercise in the morning?

354
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,260
I was wondering where
you went so early.

355
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,160
I can't go anymore when it gets
colder even if I want to.

356
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,360
So I'll work out
every day for now.

357
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,730
What, you want to join?

358
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,030
No way.

359
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,160
Jeez, bird droppings…

360
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,460
Seriously!

361
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,600
Hey, sleepyhead! Wake up!

362
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,960
Ugly, wake up! Wake up!

363
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,630
Did we arrive already?

364
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,760
- We're not there yet!
- Just go now!

365
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,600
Get off! Take the bus now!

366
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,730
- Go!
- Fine.

367
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,000
Jin-kook, don't forget the movie
later at 6PM!

368
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,100
(Looking for a missing kid)

369
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,230
(Kang Sun-ho)

370
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,000
Kim Moo-young.

371
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,630
- Kim Moo-young?
- Yes.

372
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,530
Should I let him in?

373
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,300
No.

374
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,300
Ma'am is busy today.

375
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,100
I'll come back next time.

376
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,930
You know my number, right?
Call me after you check her schedule.

377
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,300
I can't meet him right away
after what he did to me.

378
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,060
If it's alright,

379
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,800
she may be free

380
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,630
2 hours later.

381
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,530
Ma'am, Kim Moo-young is going in.

382
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,660
Hi.

383
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,500
Please have a seat.

384
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,430
What's up?

385
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,730
I have a favor.

386
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,300
Favor? What is it?

387
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,660
I need a gun.

388
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,300
Can you get it for me?

389
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,030
A gun?

390
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,130
A gun.

391
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,460
I thought hard about why you came

392
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,300
to me for the past 2 hours.

393
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,630
Maybe it was difficult for you
to handle the prosecution

394
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,200
unlike the police?

395
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,560
Or you had second thoughts
about my offer you previously declined?

396
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:04,030
But what? A gun?

397
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,130
So that's the kind of reason

398
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,130
you need to come and see me.

399
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,760
But too bad.

400
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,660
I can't do that for you.

401
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,430
If I get you a gun,

402
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,700
what will you do for me?

403
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,430
Anything.

404
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,430
(Looking for a missing kid)

405
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,760
What's this?

406
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,760
I want to know about this kid.

407
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,460
Who made this,
why they were looking for him

408
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,600
and what kind of people
this kid's parents were like.

409
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,100
Kang Sun-ho.

410
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,930
Who is he?

411
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,900
Gosh, this is so good.

412
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,700
I feel so much better.

413
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,860
This is really good.

414
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:14,860
How kind of you to help me

415
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:17,030
with my hangover.

416
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,900
It was worth raising me, right?

417
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,930
Totally, even though
I didn't do much.

418
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,060
Tak.

419
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,800
Yes?

420
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,660
What do you think about
my brother?

421
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,560
What do you mean by that?

422
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,900
I mean what do you think of him

423
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,960
as a boyfriend?

424
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,900
A boyfriend?

425
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,660
Boyfriend? Come on.

426
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,300
Seriously? Boyfriend?

427
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,000
That's crazy.

428
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,000
Is it?

429
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,660
Right, it is.

430
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,630
Of course!

431
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,800
I guess you're right.

432
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,230
You're way too good for him.

433
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,000
What do you mean? I'm a divorcee.

434
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,360
Plus, it's hard to find
a good guy like Jin-kook!

435
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,300
I heard this movie
is really funny.

436
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,000
Gosh, I'm honored.

437
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,530
Jin-kang bought me hangover soup
and treated me to a movie.

438
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,400
Oh, gosh.

439
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,060
Tak, I'm sorry.

440
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,330
What?

441
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,800
I left something at work.

442
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,360
Oh no, what're you going to do?

443
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:39,600
I'm fine. Just go.

444
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,860
It's okay, go ahead.

445
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,860
How about that guy instead?

446
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,900
Oh no, Jin-kang!

447
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,100
I know it was too obvious,

448
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:55,260
but I still hope you
have a nice time.

449
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,860
Your sister is really obvious.

450
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,630
Let's go!

451
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,860
Come on, smile.

452
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,530
I said smile. Smile!

453
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:19,830
(Kim Moo-young)

454
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,230
Where are you?
(Kim Moo-young)

455
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,060
You're home.

456
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:33,360
Yeah.

457
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:36,830
- You fixed it?
- Huh, I fixed it?

458
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:39,630
I just brushed off the dust
inside the spring,

459
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,900
and it worked.

460
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,160
Really?

461
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,600
Where did you get it?

462
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,500
I just found it.

463
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,560
- You found it?
- Yes, in Haesan.

464
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:58,860
What about its arm?

465
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:00,630
It's lost.

466
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,430
It's lost?

467
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,760
Yeah.

468
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,300
It didn't have it.
That must be why it was thrown away

469
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,160
because it didn't have an arm.

470
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,060
I'll go wash my hands.

471
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,900
I see.

472
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,360
So that was why it
was thrown away.

473
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,160
Where did you go?

474
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:32,030
I texted you earlier.

475
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,860
I stopped by somewhere.

476
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,000
Smile.

477
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,430
- I said smile!
- It hurts.

478
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,360
I'm trying to make you smile!
What do you mean it hurts?

479
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:46,100
Let's smile!

480
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,030
- You smiled!
- We should hurry!

481
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,400
Uh?

482
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,100
Hey.

483
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,130
You didn't turn off the water,
you didn't hear what I said.

484
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,260
What are you thinking about?

485
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,800
Hello?

486
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,160
What are you thinking?

487
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,030
You are just you.

488
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,060
What?

489
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,700
No matter what happens,

490
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,300
you are just you

491
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,200
for me.

492
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,000
So what do you mean by

493
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,460
I'm just me?

494
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,230
Nothing.

495
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,100
I'm just saying.

496
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:45,460
Jin-kang did a pointless thing
for us.

497
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,330
You don't even know
what the movie was about, do you?

498
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,660
Sorry?

499
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:56,060
Yes, I watched it!
That was really funny.

500
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,560
No, you never laughed
not even once.

501
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:03,300
I think I did… didn't I?

502
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,300
It's okay. You can think
about something else.

503
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,160
Let's just take a walk.

504
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,530
I mean it. Go ahead!

505
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,900
You can think
about whatever you want.

506
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,830
He…

507
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,930
came to our house this morning.

508
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:30,060
What do you mean
he came to your house?

509
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,830
I mean, after Jin-kang and I
left for work.

510
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,060
I don't know. He managed
to get in somehow.

511
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,660
That's trespassing.

512
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,130
You're right, that's trespassing!

513
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,760
What's so funny now?

514
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:46,300
- And then?
- Nothing.

515
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,460
That's all.

516
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:51,430
Jesus…

517
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,700
Thanks to you, I've finally
seen a gun in real life.

518
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,260
How do you feel?

519
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:19,660
Seeing it real close.

520
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,660
It's much cooler than I expected.

521
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,230
A gun is beautiful
because it's dangerous.

522
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,760
Don't you think
it looks like someone?

523
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,460
Sit.

524
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,530
What are you going to do with it?

525
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,730
Are you seriously going to
kill someone with this?

526
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,560
You know,

527
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,100
if you shoot someone with that,

528
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,600
you'll get me in trouble too.

529
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,500
I won't ever say
you got me the gun.

530
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:07,830
So you're really thinking
about killing someone.

531
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,930
Aren't you curious

532
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,630
why I'm risking so much

533
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,660
just for you?

534
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,230
I am curious.

535
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,460
Because I want you.

536
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:24,660
I want you to be completely mine

537
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:27,030
like a toy in my pocket.

538
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,730
I fell for you, Kim Moo-young.

539
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,500
Don't get caught.

540
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,360
You remember that?

541
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,230
Don't get caught.

542
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,060
I heard there was an accident.

543
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:48,330
I was so curious
what happened that night.

544
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,630
So I checked the dash cam
footage in Seung-ah's car.

545
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,530
I couldn't understand
what you said at first.

546
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,960
So I must've replayed
it like 10 times.

547
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,760
And then I heard it.

548
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,700
Don't get caught.

549
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,260
You drove me crazy!

550
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:09,530
I loved it.

551
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,460
I didn't know there would be
another person just like me.

552
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,130
Me?

553
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,260
I told you, we're very similar.

554
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:21,300
We're like different branches
growing from the same root.

555
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,930
I'll think about it.

556
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,630
Thanks for the gun.

557
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,630
Won't you take more bullets?

558
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,100
This is enough.

559
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,500
Who is this kid?

560
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,900
(Looking for a missing kid)

561
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,930
I'm kind of confused.

562
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,400
Should I be mad at you or not?

563
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,830
This kid is related
to your girlfriend.

564
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,730
My girlfriend?

565
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,600
Yoo Jin-kang.

566
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,860
Wasn't that why you asked me
to look into it?

567
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:03,330
Because it was the kid
Detective Yoo Jin-kook was looking for?

568
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,860
(Looking for a missing kid)

569
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,260
It was Detective Yoo Jin-kook
who looked for this kid?
(Looking for a missing kid)

570
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,430
It was Detective Yoo Jin-kook
who looked for this kid?

571
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,100
Yes.

572
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,260
It seems like you
really didn't know.

573
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,200
(Yoo Jin-kang)

574
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,160
(Permanent Account)

575
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,730
Why was he looking for me?

576
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:52,400
You?

577
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:55,300
It's me.

578
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,400
Kang Sun-ho, that kid is me.

579
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,000
(Looking for a missing kid)

580
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,300
You should've told me sooner.

581
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,660
It probably changed now,

582
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:14,600
but the owner of this number
was Yoo Jin-kook until June, 1996.

583
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:17,330
I totally lost interest to look into this
for you when I found out.

584
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,660
I thought you were having me
do something

585
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,600
for your girlfriend.

586
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,130
(Looking for a missing kid)

587
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,560
I don't know my father's name.

588
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,300
They said he committed suicide
in Mortar of Mountain Geumah

589
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,360
in Haesan, autumn of 1993.

590
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:34,700
But I don't think it was suicide.

591
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:38,300
I believe my father was murdered.

592
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,260
He's your father but
you don't know his name.

593
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:44,360
They said he committed suicide
but you believe he got killed.

594
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,930
Okay, I'll look into it.

595
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,930
It won't take long.

596
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:55,900
Now you finally seem to
recognize my worth.

597
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,400
This kind of job is nothing to me.

598
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,960
Then, I have one more.

599
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:03,760
I'm looking for my family.

600
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,000
Your family?

601
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,530
Mom and brother.

602
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:11,560
He's my younger brother.

603
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:14,860
He must be 2-3 years younger
than me at most.

604
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,630
He's Yoon.

605
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,930
I'm not sure,
but he's probably Kang Yoon.

606
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,330
Kang Yoon.

607
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,700
So you want to look
for your brother.

608
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:32,230
Why? What about your mom?

609
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,830
You must look for your mom.

610
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,830
I mean, she could be rich by now.

611
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,700
But your brother?

612
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,600
Isn't it better not
to have a brother?

613
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,960
You should feel thankful
you lost him. Why look for him?

614
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:48,760
But I want to find him.

615
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,300
I guess we aren't as similar as

616
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,360
you think we are.

617
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,760
Thanks in advance.

618
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,660

(Kim Moo-young)

620
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,500
What time do you get
off work today?
(Kim Moo-young)

621
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,300
What time do you get
off work today?

622
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,930
Around 10PM at the earliest.

623
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,100
But I'll probably finish
after midnight.

624
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,060
See you in the morning.

625
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,400
Okay.

626
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,030
You're here.

627
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,700
(A remake of the Japanese series A Hundred
Million Stars Falling From The Sky)

628
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,160
(Thank you to Actor Yoo Jae-myung
for guest starring)

629
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:15,000
(Hundred Million Stars From The Sky)

630
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,860
Right, I killed him.

631
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:18,230
Your father, Kang Soon-gu.

632
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,530
I thought he was a police officer,
but he was a murderer?

633
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,000
You ruined my childhood!

634
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:24,960
People like you disgust
me the most.

635
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,560
What brings you here at this hour?

636
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:28,460
I came to return this to you.
I used one bullet.

637
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:30,400
Your anger will
only hurt yourself.

638
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,430
It'll only hurt you

639
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,200
and the people who love you.

640
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:36,360
I hope everything will
hold onto you tight

641
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:37,760
so you can't go anywhere.

642
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:41,400
Even if I lose everything and
no matter how far away I go,

643
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,130
I'll come back

644
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,160
to you.
