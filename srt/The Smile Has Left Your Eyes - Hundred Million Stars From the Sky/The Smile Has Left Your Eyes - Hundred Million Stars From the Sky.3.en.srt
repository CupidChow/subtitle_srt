My heart bounces in a weird way.

7
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,360
When I see him,
I get strangely nervous.

8
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,660
Doesn't he look too plain?

9
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,760
Is it right?
Is he really the murderer?

10
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,160
Where?

11
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,130
I don't see you.

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,160
Where are you, really?

13
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,330
I said I'm watching you.

14
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,460
I told you to wait
in front of the bathroom.

15
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,400
Why would you go into my office…

16
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,130
I didn't know
I wasn't allowed to go in.

I'm sorry.

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,530
What were you looking at?
You were completely preoccupied.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,130
A killer.

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,030
- A killer?
- Yeah, on the wall.

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,700
On the wall? You mean the picture.

25
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,229
Choi Sang-hoon?

26
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,000
Right.

the primary suspect in
the murder case of a female

in her 20s, Mr. Choi,

the boyfriend
of the victim,

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,200
was arrested

33
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,930
- 12 days after the incident.
- It's Cho-rong!

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,460
Right after the murder,
the suspect disappeared,

35
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,130
making the investigation
much more difficult.

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,460
Since he's a police officer,
his job is stable.

37
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,660
And he seems nice, too.

38
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,030
However, he's a bit too naive.

39
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,930
Will I be able to fall
in love with him?

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,360
Well, it's just a date.

41
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,960
Let's just go for it.

42
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,060
Are you talking about
these kinds of real feelings?

43
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,329
Gosh, he doesn't
even know anything!

44
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,360
What are you doing?
You're so focused on the TV

45
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,400
you didn't even notice me coming in.

46
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,960
Should I push you into the TV?

47
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,530
- What?
- Jin-kook, it's Cho-rong!

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,660
Cho-rong? Where?

49
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,260
YBN, Kim Nam-soo.

50
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:33,030
Ah, it passed.

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,329
Hey, it seems like
Cho-rong caught the culprit.

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,829
It wasn't just him,

53
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
the entire squad caught him.

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,200
Homicide Squad 3.

55
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,700
If the whole squad caught him,
why aren't you on TV?

56
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,800
I'm sure you must've
slacked off again.

57
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,530
What's all this mess?

58
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,130
You're a grown woman now!

59
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,760
And you never organize your stuff.

60
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,800
Are you like that too?

61
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,400
What? What did I do?

62
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,600
I didn't do anything.

63
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,300
Do you hit on anyone

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,230
and think she'll fall for you?

65
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,630
Do you go and watch a movie
with another girl

66
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,130
when you already
have a girlfriend?

67
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,330
- Is that how all men are?
- What?

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,600
Does he have a girlfriend?

69
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,230
I'm going to kill that jerk!

70
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
I'm not talking about Cho-rong.

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,860
Then, who?

72
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,860
- You don't need to know.
- Tell me who!

73
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,200
There's this bastard
you don't need to know.

74
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,730
Where did you hide it?

75
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,230
Where did you hide the trophy?

76
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,000
It's in Mi-yeon's room.

77
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,200
It's Mi-yeon's favorite.

78
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,530
It's not in her room.

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,030
Why? Because you killed her
with it.

80
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,230
With the trophy
your girlfriend liked the most.

81
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,130
- Where did you throw it away?
- You don't have much time.

82
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,800
It wasn't me.

83
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,329
I didn't kill her.

84
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,430
You don't have time for this.

85
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,459
I'm begging you to go out there

86
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,960
and catch the culprit
instead of doing this crap!

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,400
Go catch the bastard

88
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,830
who killed Mi-yeon!

89
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,030
You're here.

90
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,530
Yeah.

91
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,800
He's been doing that all night.

92
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,960
How did he react at first?

93
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,430
He just laughed.

94
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,400
He asked if Jung Mi-yeon really died

95
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,460
and if the body
really was Jung Mi-yeon's.

96
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,960
Then he cried for
3 hours straight.

97
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,460
I didn't realize it was this hard
to make someone confess.

98
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,700
What about his DNA found
under her nail?

99
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,230
Uh, that was obvious too.
They had a fight

100
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,460
but he said he didn't kill her.

101
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,230
According to what
Choi Sang-hoon said,

102
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,600
they were supposed to

103
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,930
go on a trip together.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,560
But they quarreled a lot recently

105
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,460
and Mi-yeon said she
wouldn't go on the trip,

106
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,960
that was how it got worse.

107
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,260
In a fit of anger, he left alone.

108
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,860
What if the arrest warrant
gets dismissed tomorrow

109
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,760
because he didn't confess?

110
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,330
Gosh, that would definitely
complicate things.

111
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,500
He was caught abroad, so I'm sure
the warrant will be issued.

112
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,730
Hey, but is it true that

113
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,659
he was supposed to go
to Canada with Mi-yeon?

114
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,100
Well, the reservation was made
under both of their names

115
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,700
2 months ago.

116
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,260
But I think he's acting.

117
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,600
He was an acting major in college.

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,700
By the way, Jin-kang was happy
to see you on the news.

119
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,000
Really? Did she see me?

120
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,560
Jin-kang…

121
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,730
And Lieutenant Tak
was looking for you!

122
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,530
We will let you know

123
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,930
after internally discussing
your proposal.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,800
- I should contact Manager Jin-kang?
- That's right.

125
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,000
Now that we're family,

126
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,860
I want you to meet the members
in the brewery as well.

127
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,600
Of course.

128
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,530
And can you show Jin-kang

129
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,560
how you brew beer sometime?

130
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,530
I was going to bring that up.

131
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,300
Why don't you make an appointment
before you go?

132
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,460
That sounds perfect.

133
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,500
It would be totally different
from learning from books.

134
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,030
Good for you!

135
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,159
- Let's go.
- Alright.

136
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,700
Guys, do you have a minute?
I'd like to make some introductions.

137
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,500
Please come here.

138
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,300
Everyone.

139
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,860
These ladies are from
Design & Look

140
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,230
and they'll be in charge
of our design.

141
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,400
- Hello.
- A round of applause!

142
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,659
Starting from here, this is
President Hwang Sun-hwa.

143
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,630
It's nice to meet you.

144
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,200
This is Manager Yoo Jin-kang.

145
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,860
Nice to meet you all.

146
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,730
And Assistant
Lim So-yeon.

147
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,300
Hi, glad to meet you all.

148
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,300
They're excellent at designing,

149
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,800
so please take good care of them.

150
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,630
So these are my family members.

151
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,700
The pride of our brewery,
Master Gil Hyung-joo.

152
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,200
Cool!

153
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,900
And he studied abroad.

154
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,430
Manager Tony.

155
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,900
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

156
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
You heard that?

157
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,830
This is our youngest, Yoo-jin.

158
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,730
Hello.

159
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,700
And here, our handsome boy,
Hee-joon.

160
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,400
I'm Hee-joon.

161
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,600
And at the end,
our first assistant, Moo-young.

162
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,230
Hello.

163
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,100
Now we're all in this together,

164
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,659
- Let's do it in a fun way.
- Sure.

165
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,600
Okay.

166
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,400
Is it lunchtime already?

167
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,360
Today's menu is pollack soup.

168
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,600
No, coffee instead.

169
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,100
Let's go out and have some brunch.

170
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,160
What brunch?

171
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,160
You said you would buy me coffee!

172
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,900
Stop acting like you
don't know anything.

173
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,660
Come on, you have a lot of money.

174
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,600
Do you really feel bad that
you bought me some sushi?

175
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,800
- Are you serious?
- Who says I have a lot of money?

176
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,830
It's obvious you have a lot!

177
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,600
You don't even have any children

178
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,030
you need to feed.

179
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,860
And you don't go out
and spend at all.

180
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,030
There's no space to spend
money on you.

181
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,030
Right!

182
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,230
I got divorced from my husband
because I couldn't have kids!

183
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,860
Thanks to that, I don't have a
husband or children to feed!

184
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,400
Cool?

185
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,700
Seriously…

186
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,559
Thanks for reminding me
when I'm trying my best

187
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,260
to forget.

188
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,360
- Forget about it.
- Wait!

189
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,960
Tak, I didn't mean it that way.

190
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,860
Let's go. Now!

191
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,900
Come on, that was a compliment.

192
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,800
What was a compliment?

193
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,900
Hear me out, Tak.

194
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,360
You never dress up,

195
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,960
or buy any high-end brand stuff,

196
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,830
or get botox that
everyone else gets.

197
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,160
You're easygoing.

198
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,930
Who are you calling easygoing?

199
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,360
This dress costs $480.

200
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,760
This cardigan $350.

201
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,000
These shoes are $280
after a 30% discount.

202
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,960
My manicure and pedicure
cost a total of $100.

203
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,260
Jesus,
was everything that expensive?

204
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,530
How dare you judge

205
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,330
whether I dress up or not?

206
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,230
And what? Botox?

207
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,800
No one gets Botox these days!
Fillers are all the rage!

208
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,760
And why would I not get fillers
when everybody else gets them?

209
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,800
What makes you think so?

210
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,000
It's been a while since my smile
wrinkles have dropped to my feet!

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,800
- So you got injected?
- Yes!

212
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,860
I did, twice!

213
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,460
Are you serious?

214
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,560
Gosh!

215
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,700
Do you want to get scratched
by my $100 nails

216
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,060
and see how bad it could be?

217
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,730
I'm going to stop myself.

218
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,160
I ruined my life
for lunch.

219
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,100
I'm sorry.
I was in the middle of something.

220
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,100
I see.

221
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,730
We caught the culprit yesterday,

222
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,400
so it's been really busy.

223
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,360
I saw you on the news!

224
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,500
You were on for quite some time!

225
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,630
Really? I didn't even know
I was on the news.

226
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,760
So you're a designer?

227
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,700
That's right.

228
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,360
You look pretty combative.

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,100
If you get caught doing
something dodgy one more time,

230
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,160
I'll tell Seung-ah everything.

231
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,760
Go ahead.

232
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,860
I don't care.

233
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,260
Are you being shameless
or arrogant?

234
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,160
I'm just sure of myself.

235
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,060
What's so funny? Do I look funny?

236
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,800
Yes.

237
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,630
Your face looks funny now.

238
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,230
It says "I'd rather die than lose."
Is that right?

239
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,300
At least to someone I
shouldn't lose to.

240
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,160
So you think you've lost.

241
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,800
I never thought
we really had a fight.

242
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,360
You must be really good
with words, huh?

243
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,900
Confident at making everything
turn your way

244
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,100
with all that talk.

245
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,800
Is that so?

246
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,800
I'm really used to that.

247
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,230
There's also someone like that
at my house, too.

248
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,060
I know how to deal with
that kind of people.

249
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,530
How?

250
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,900
By completely ignoring them.

251
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,560
I'm warning you. This is the last
conversation we'll have in person.

252
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,400
- Don't talk to me.
- Okay.

253
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,760
- Oh my god!
- Gently!

254
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,930
- Are you okay? Let me see!
- Gently!

255
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,760
Wait…

256
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,530
Ouch.

257
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,600
You talked to me first.

258
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,100
It took exactly a minute.

259
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,360
What kind of joke was that?

260
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,400
You're seriously over.

261
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,430
Don't you ever dare talk
to me again.

262
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,000
Geon and Gi-joo should
get Choi Sang-hoon.

263
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,000
The rest should interview
all the witnesses again.

264
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,560
Get his confession

265
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,000
or find new evidence by tonight.

266
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,730
Bring me either of the two.

267
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,330
Okay?

268
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,500
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir.

269
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,300
Geon! Geon!

270
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,930
I'm sorry, but can you take
'Tattoo' over for me?

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,330
No, I can't. Why?

272
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,630
Well, it's…

273
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Nevermind, I'll just do it.

274
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,830
What's the matter?

275
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,930
Hey!

276
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,230
What is it? Who's 'Tattoo'?

277
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,830
One of the witnesses.
She's such a brat.

278
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,700
You know the photos
you always look at.

279
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,730
- Yeah.
- The girl at the back.

280
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,460
- There.
- I see…

281
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,260
You can go now.

282
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,730
- Salute.
- Yeah.

283
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,830
If I get fired, it's on you.

284
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,860
I don't want to see you either.

285
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,230
Hurry and look at this.

286
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,730
What, does it ring a bell?

287
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,330
- What's this?
- The primary evidence.

288
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,960
Jung Mi-yeon died when
she got hit with that.

289
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,230
I see.

290
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,630
- You know Choi Sang-hoon got caught.
- Yes.

291
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,600
Do you have any guesses?

292
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,860
Where would he have hidden this?

293
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,630
I don't know.

294
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,660
(Moo-young)

295
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,930
I'm taking it back.

296
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,230
I'm taking my approval back,
so you settle it.

297
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,730
My father will be here next week.

298
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,400
Let's officially meet him
and get married.

299
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,760
Moo-young isn't coming today.

300
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,130
Beer.

301
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,030
Is this how you
treat your customer?

302
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,130
I have something to tell him.

303
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,100
You really don't know
where he is now?

304
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,030
He's out on a date.

305
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,130
He must be having a great time
with her.

306
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,430
So what?

307
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,860
Whether he dates or not,
it doesn't have anything to do with me.

308
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,200
The girl is very rich.

309
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,859
You'll be surprised to know.

310
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,300
And most importantly,
you must know this.

311
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,930
She is such a beauty.

312
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,430
Just because she's pretty

313
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,760
and rich,

314
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,200
do you think he'll
seriously fall in love with her?

315
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,400
More than you.

316
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,660
Then,

317
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,760
who do you think he'll rescue

318
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,860
if she and I are both drowning?

319
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,330
Are you crazy?

320
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,330
Of course, he'll rescue her!

321
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,830
Whatever you think.

322
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,460
I know what you're thinking.

323
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,830
You like him so much but
you're aware that he'll

324
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,930
cut you off if you confess.

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,160
You can't even tell him
because you're scared.

326
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,230
What are you blabbering about?

327
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,830
What?

328
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,330
- Did I get it right?
- Who says I like him?

329
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,600
- You loser.
- Loser?

330
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,630
Hey! Hey!

331
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,600
Clean this up!

332
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,560
Damn, that rude brat!

333
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,060
Why aren't you picking up?
It keeps ringing.

334
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,330
Oh, it must be my mom.

335
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,700
I already sent her a message
that I'm almost home.

336
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,100
Moo-young,
what are your parents like?

337
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,660
My parents?

338
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,200
Uhm, my parents are…

339
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,400
- Institute?
- Yes, sir.

340
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,060
He was raised in an orphanage from
the age of 6 to 15.

341
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,630
Jamyung Orphanage.

342
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,130
It's a Catholic orphanage
located in Haesan.

343
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,000
- So he's an orphan?
- Yes.

344
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,900
My mom used to be very strict.

345
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,130
She used to scold me a lot

346
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,230
but everything she said was right,

347
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,930
so I couldn't really complain.

348
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,630
And she wore the same clothes
throughout the entire year.

349
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,830
No way. No one does that.

350
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,560
I'm serious. She did.

351
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,160
I had many aunts.

352
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,800
They were just like my mom.

353
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,660
They always said the right things

354
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,560
and wore the same clothes.

355
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,100
That's hilarious.

356
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,960
What about your dad?

357
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,700
My dad was part of the police.

358
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
He was a passionate detective
who caught bad guys.

359
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,030
He was 6 when
he entered the orphanage.

360
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,360
His records prior to then
are not confirmed.

361
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,960
He got his name Kim Moo-young
while he was there.

362
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,660
He is a hardworking person

363
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,330
who even gets recognized
in his workplace.

364
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,260
There's an intern named
Noh Hee-joon.

365
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,760
He stayed with Kim Moo-young

366
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,700
in the orphanage
when they were young.

367
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,300
He got adopted later.

368
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,430
Kim Moo-young always had a lot of
women around him,

(Wonyoung Printing)

371
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,760
but he never dated one woman
for a long time.
(Wonyoung Printing)

372
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,800
but he never dated one woman
for a long time.

373
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,700
He never brought a woman
to his house either.

374
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,100
What about your parents?

375
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,900
My parents?

376
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,400
They're ordinary.

377
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,800
Moo-young.

378
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,730
Well…

379
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,730
Jin-kang's brother is also a cop.

380
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,400
- Jin-kook.
- I know. I saw him around here.

381
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,630
He's really funny.

382
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,400
But he raised her alone.

383
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,500
He didn't even get married.

384
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,900
- All by himself?
- Yeah.

385
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,000
Their parents died
when she was young.

386
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,830
Ah…

387
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,600
How unfortunate.

388
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,160
- You think so?
- Of course.

389
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,260
I pity her the most.

390
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,860
Whenever I hate my mom,

391
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,960
I think of Jin-kang.
That makes me feel better.

392
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,130
Gosh,
she said she's almost home.

393
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,930
What?

394
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,000
Is she out of her mind?

395
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,160
Ah…

396
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,730
Goodness…

397
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,260
Woo-sang…

398
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,430
Order everything you want.

399
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,130
What's the most
expensive thing here?

400
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,130
Do you have something like luwak?

401
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,900
Anything $20 or above?

402
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,400
Sir, we don't have that

403
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,730
but we have blueberry
yogurt cream bing-soo,

404
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,760
it's the most expensive one.

405
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,960
It's only $12.

406
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,400
- Will this be enough?
- Forget it.

407
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,300
It'll be too cold for my teeth!

408
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,660
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

409
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,000
Stop being so mad already.

410
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm here just for you
even though I'm not on duty today.

411
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,560
You must've come out
for something else.

412
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,600
There's no way you came out for me,

413
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,060
- you mighty Section Chief Yoo.
- That's not true!

414
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,360
The arrest warrant for
Choi Sang-hoon

415
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,800
was issued this morning.

416
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,930
I got nothing to do today.

417
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,300
I came out

418
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,400
just to buy you coffee!

419
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,060
- You sure about that?
- Yeah!

420
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,400
If you don't go home
straight after,

421
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,500
you know what'll happen, right?

422
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,000
- Just scratch me!
- My hands are dying to scratch you!

423
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,300
- I'll just get an iced Americano
- Okay.

424
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,560
Will that be enough?
It's only $4.50.

425
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,630
Don't think we're even.

426
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,630
I still have $15.50 left.

427
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,760
She's good at math.
Please make it 2.

428
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,360
$15.50…

429
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,030
$20 minus $4.50…

430
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,260
This machine is for
mashing and lautering.

431
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,100
And next,
that machine is for boiling.

432
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,100
Once the liquid is complete,
it's sent to the fermenting machine

433
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,460
through that pipe.

434
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,060
Once it's done fermenting,
it's matured in there.

435
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,200
Wow, it's fascinating.

436
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,830
Can I take a picture?

437
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,160
- Of course, go ahead.
- Thanks.

438
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,660
Yoo-jin!

439
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,860
But it's too bad.

440
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,760
He must not be here today.

441
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,400
Who?

442
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,430
You know, that handsome guy.

443
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,100
- I'm here!
- Oh my gosh!

444
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,660
Weren't you looking for
a handsome guy?

445
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,260
I heard everything.

446
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,860
Then, where is he?

447
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,860
- You said you heard everything
- It's me…

448
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,300
Look at his face.

449
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,260
What makes kids these days
so tall?

450
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,830
How nice… He's really handsome.

451
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,300
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

452
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,860
Stop it.

453
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,900
What's wrong? Sorry, it's nothing.

454
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,460
- That's alright.
- What's the matter with you?

455
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,230
What did you eat for breakfast?

456
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,360
Gosh, I'm sorry.

457
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,430
He must be out of his mind.

458
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,900
You know there are a lot of
lunatics these days, right?

459
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,330
Stop it already!

460
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,200
Are you out of your mind?

461
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,930
She said she was curious about

462
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,630
what you eat to get so tall.

463
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,630
Though, I think I'm much taller.

464
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,030
Ah, milk?

465
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,360
It's just a joke.
I don't eat breakfast.

466
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,900
Ah…

467
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,900
So you don't eat breakfast.

468
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,030
Is she your girlfriend?

469
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,860
- No.
- What do you mean?

470
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,100
I want to get married soon!

471
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,960
She's just a colleague.
Completely a colleague.

472
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,960
- Right, colleague!
- Cross!

473
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,760
Way to go, my colleague!

474
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,900
I knew it.
She's way too pretty for you.

475
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,360
Don't mind him.

476
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,200
I usually just ignore him too.

477
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,460
What brings you here at this hour?

478
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,160
I came to meet a friend.

479
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,700
Yeah…

480
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,330
- I should get going.
- See you.

481
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,900
What the heck, I was so surprised.

482
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,000
Who is he? Who is he?

483
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,860
Kim Moo-young.

484
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,560
- Kim Moo-young?
- Yeah.

485
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,560
The…

486
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,460
- Kim Moo-young I know?
- Yeah.

487
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,800
It's true.

488
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,960
- You're right.
- About what?

489
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,560
You said your heart bounces

490
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,530
and you get nervous
when you see him.

491
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,230
Oh, I get nervous too.

492
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,700
What's with me?

493
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,730
What's gotten into you?

494
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,000
Aren't you supposed to go?

495
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,730
It's 5 to 1PM.

496
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,660
Oh no!

497
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,900
Why does time fly so darn fast?

498
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,730
- I'm sorry.
- Damn it…

499
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,600
That rude little brat…

500
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,230
She bumped into me too!

501
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,060
- Just go.
- What makes kids these days

502
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,460
so rude?

503
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,660
Excuse me!

504
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,960
What did you have for breakfast?

505
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,560
What is he saying?

506
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,400
- Hey, stop it.
- Okay.

507
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,130
- Just come out.
- Fine.

508
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,930
Is this fun for you?

509
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Then, what did you eat to

510
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,000
make you so silly?

511
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,860
Age.

512
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,560
Being old is not something
you should be proud of.

513
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,500
- Don't get silly.
- Okay.

514
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,400
Kids these days seem so
different from back in our day.

515
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,260
- Right.
- What?

516
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,100
Seriously? It's so disappointing!

517
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,300
Unfortunately, he has bad taste
in women!

518
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,900
Why? She's pretty.

519
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,400
- Should I get a tattoo too?
- What tattoo?

520
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,600
I want to look like a brat too.

521
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,000
- Tattoo?
- Yeah, what do you think?

522
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,730
Will it look good on me?

523
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,860
I should go first.
You can take your time.

524
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,960
What is it now? What again?

525
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,960
Sir.

526
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,030
It was definitely it.

527
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,060
It's so odd.

528
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,700
I didn't even know that was hers.

529
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,360
So I just threw it away
into a trashcan.

530
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,700
And then I realized,

531
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,100
it was the morning
Mi-yeon got killed.

532
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,860
Which means…

533
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,060
Sang-hoon left it for me that night.

534
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,700
But…

535
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,700
I swear…

536
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,700
I couldn't hear anything
because I was sleeping.

537
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,630
But why?

538
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,630
Why did he leave it at my place?

539
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,760
Did you sleep well that night?

540
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,700
You said you were in deep sleep.

541
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,860
I just wonder if you sleep well
without any medication these days.

542
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:19,830
Of course, it's been so long
since I stopped taking meds.

543
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,900
I quit right after I met you.

544
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,030
Right?

545
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,430
Her name is Lim Yoo-ri.
22 years old.

546
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,030
She went to the same middle school
with Jung Mi-yeon in the States.

547
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,660
Jung Mi-yeon came back to Korea
3 years ago

548
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,060
and Lim Yoo-ri came
back last year.

549
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,560
They met up quite often after
Yoo-ri returned to Korea.

550
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,830
They were like best friends.

551
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,430
She's staying at a
nearby band studio

552
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,800
and working some part-time jobs.

553
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,560
Nothing particular
other than that.

554
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,060
What's the matter?

555
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,800
That's it?

556
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,900
Nothing, I just wanted to check.

557
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,660
(Room 1502)

558
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,600
You said you might not get back.

559
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,560
- But you're back early.
- Yeah.

560
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,860
Take some pictures, too.

561
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,700
Was the circulation too strong?

562
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,700
It looks too light, right?

563
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,960
I know right?

564
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,230
The gravity is lower
than I thought.

565
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,960
- You haven't seen a burn scar before?
- No.

566
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,430
- Does it bother you?
- It seems like you're bothered.

567
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,930
You were flustered
in front of him.

568
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,530
Because it was a blind date.

569
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,460
- What about me?
- What about you?

570
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,500
I don't bother you?

571
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,700
Right, you don’t bother me at all.

572
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,700
- What do we do?
- What do you mean?

573
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,860
It's your responsibility, Master.

574
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,600
What are you looking at?

575
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,700
Ah.

576
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,160
That's it?

577
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,930
Please come test our beer!

578
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,900
Thanks for showing me around.

579
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,530
You said you would try our stout.

580
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,860
Yes, please.

581
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,300
It's good.

582
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,530
I love Master
Gil Hyung-joo's recipe.

583
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,159
Thanks and it's my recipe.

584
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,659
Ah.

585
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,699
It's good.

586
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,429
Did you send Assistant Lim away
on purpose?

587
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,900
No one's here.
You sent them away one by one.

588
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,760
There's only us two left now.

589
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,200
So that's why I'm leaving too.

590
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,960
You've sent everyone away.

591
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,000
You're all alone. Goodbye.

592
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
I switched on purpose!

593
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,800
Hee-joon was supposed to
be on duty today!

594
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,860
Hey.

595
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:47,030
Can I borrow your umbrella?

596
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,230
Ah, umbrella…

597
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,460
We shouldn't get involved personally,
so do you want an official one?

598
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,160
The official umbrella is…

599
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,160
not here.

600
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,530
Just give me anything you have.

601
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,760
I'll return it right after
I buy a new one at the store.

602
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,800
I'm serious. There aren't any.

603
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,730
It looks like it'll pour
for a while.

604
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,730
Wait here. I'll give you a ride.

605
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,000
Get in. I won't talk to you.

606
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,960
I wanted to see you in that dress.
Why are you just bringing it back?

607
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,900
Mom.

608
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,800
There's something
I'd like to tell you.

609
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,500
Go ahead.

610
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,530
Mom.

611
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,860
I'm not marrying Woo-sang.

612
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,430
I'm also not going to the dinner
with the President.

613
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,700
Why not?

614
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,630
Did he tell you not to go?

615
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,760
- What?
- The guy you're seeing these days.

616
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,400
Surprised?

617
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,860
I know everything.

618
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,300
Good job.

619
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,030
Men are always like that.

620
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,530
He never talked about marriage
when I was waiting for so long.

621
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,960
I was wondering what had
gotten into Woo-sang.

622
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,430
But…

623
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,900
You should stop here.

624
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,030
Don't provoke him anymore.

625
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,330
In short, stop seeing him.

626
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,500
Mom.

627
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,830
I'm really not marrying Woo-sang.

628
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,000
I don't want to!

629
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,700
He's not a guy

630
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,400
you can easily break up with.

631
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,930
Woo-sang is a very scary person.

632
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,260
How great is that? He's so manly.

633
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,700
Gosh, it's so good.

634
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,700
It's $7.

635
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,700
These too.

636
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,800
You're so heartless.

637
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,700
How could you only buy yours
when it's pouring like this?

638
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,960
Why are you so fickle?

639
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,100
You always thought about making

640
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,400
fun of me like a child,

641
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,430
and now you're acting like
you're mad at me.

642
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,230
If you were going to keep making
me uncomfortable,

643
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,330
why did you give me a ride?

644
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,900
Stop using honorifics.

645
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,200
You're the one
who's so inconsistent.

646
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,360
Just talk casually
like you always do.

647
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,900
Fine.

648
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,700
Let's talk casually then.

649
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,730
You were the one who talked to me
first personally, not me, okay?

650
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,700
Gosh, so childish…

651
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,500
Damn, it's so cold.

652
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,060
I haven't put my jacket on
for you to see,

653
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,030
but you didn't pay any attention.

654
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,500
Don't get shocked.
She's the weirdo.

655
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,330
Other women aren't like her.

656
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,330
It's actually kind of
my lethal move for women.

657
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,360
'I have a burn just like that,'

658
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:06,000
is that what you're thinking?

659
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,600
Do you really think
that works on women?

660
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,300
Of course.

661
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,560
Oh no, when did this happen?
That must've hurt.

662
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,730
Look at the attitude of
a person who has it all.

663
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,300
A burn scar isn't a big deal.

664
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,730
Anyone could get one in life.

665
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,260
Your face looks like
it's telling me

666
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,160
that you've never been
hurt in your life

667
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,200
and you aren't stressed out.

668
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,160
That's right.
I've never been hurt.

669
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,400
How unfortunate.

670
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,100
I pity her the most.

671
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,460
Good to hear that
you weren't ever hurt.

672
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,500
What?

673
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:54,230
(Seung-ah)

674
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,530
It's Seung-ah.
(Seung-ah)

675
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,000
It's Seung-ah.

676
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,260
It's Seung-ah!

677
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,300
Pick up now.

678
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,300
It'll stop ringing.

679
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,760
Why aren't you picking up?

680
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,760
I'm with another woman.

681
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,230
Another woman…

682
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,800
Me?

683
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,660
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

684
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,860
Let me ask you seriously.

685
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:30,100
What the hell is wrong with you?

686
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,230
I go a step further.

687
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,330
A step, what?

688
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,700
I always go a step further.

689
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,900
I don't know when to stop
when I'm with you.

690
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,300
I just speed up.

691
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:09,100
Your eyes…

692
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,360
really annoy me.

693
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,760
I get irritated
if I don't do anything.

694
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,530
See, I'm already annoyed.

695
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,060
What happened?

696
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,560
Hello, police officer.

697
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,300
Hey.

698
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,760
Hi.

699
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,260
What happened?
Why did he give you a ride?

700
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,130
- I'm finally home!
- I'm asking you.

701
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,030
Why did you just get off
from his car?

702
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,660
I went to a brewery today.

703
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,300
It's called Arts, a big and
famous craft beer company.

704
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,130
We got a design deal
with them this time.

705
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,030
And he's working there.

706
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,230
Arts? What does he do there?

707
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,660
- An assistant who makes beer.
- You…

708
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,900
shouldn't get involved with him.

709
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,530
Why would I get involved with him?

710
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,260
Don't worry. He's dating Seung-ah.

711
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:57,200
What? Seung-ah?

712
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,260
Kim Moo-young is dating Seung-ah?

713
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,800
Don't act like you know anything.

714
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:06,400
I shouldn't have said that.

715
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,430
Hey, Moo-young.

716
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,000
You've met him before, right?
He's Director Jang Woo-sang.

717
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,860
Director wants to request a

718
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,400
special recipe from you.

719
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,730
It's just for a small event,
so don't feel burdened.

720
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,200
I want some beer for my wedding

721
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,430
and I want you to make it.

722
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,400
He says his fiance loves
our beer a lot.

723
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,300
Ah, why don’t you come here

724
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,900
with her some time?

725
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,800
Once he knows her taste,
it'll be easier for him to make it.

726
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,260
That's a great idea.
That would definitely be helpful.

727
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,230
Let me schedule it with her.

728
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,930
Sure.

729
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,760
I'm Choi Sang-hoon. I'm Choi Sang-hoon.

730
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,360
I'm Choi Sang-hoon...

731
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,300
I'm Choi Sang-hoon.

732
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:23,560
I'm Choi Sang-hoon.

733
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,130
- I'm Choi Sang-hoon.
- What are you muttering?

734
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,800
I'm trying
some psychological profiling.

735
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,760
I'm Choi Sang-hoon.

736
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:36,160
Do you even know
how to spell 'profiling'?

737
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,930
- I do.
- Hurry.

738
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,860
- P, R...
- Yeah.

739
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,130
- O, F...
- Hey.

740
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,860
Hey, go back to the previous picture.

741
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,560
- This one?
- Yeah.

742
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,500
Snow ball.

743
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:11,960
(Snow Ball)

744
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,860
(Male Detention Room)

745
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,960
Well…

746
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,000
I have a question for you.

747
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:39,900
Did you buy this as a gift?

748
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,830
Your dead girlfriend loved
snow balls, didn't she?

749
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,860
She collected a lot

750
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,260
in the living room.

751
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:50,800
Where do you think
she'd have put this?

752
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,160
Wow, it's a merry-go-round.

753
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,930
Do you think

754
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,830
she'd have put this
next to the sailboat

755
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,030
or the angel?

756
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,760
I mean, if she were alive.

757
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,530
Where would she put it?

758
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,430
What is it you want to know?

759
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,600
Would she put it
next to the sailboat

760
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,260
or the angel?

761
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:23,630
What the hell
are you talking about?

762
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,930
Explain it so I can understand.

763
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,900
- I'm here, in front of your house.
- Is this Moo-young?

764
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,200
You didn't have to
get out of your car.

765
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,060
I'm Seung-ah's mom.

766
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,660
She isn't going out.

767
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,300
- Seung-ah is...
- Mom!

768
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:07,460
going to go greet
her future parents-in-law tomorrow,

769
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:08,760
she's busy now.

770
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:11,460
You get what I mean, right?

771
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,200
I'll delete your number.

772
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,130
You should do the same.

773
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,660
Mom…

774
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,860
(Delete)

775
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,360
I need to talk to you
for a minute.

776
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,930
It's about Choi Sang-hoon.

777
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,030
Will you hand him over
to the prosecution tomorrow?

778
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,760
Make your point.

779
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,930
I feel like
it wasn't Choi Sang-hoon.

780
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,030
There's no compelling
evidence just yet.

781
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,630
I think it'd be better
for our team

782
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,530
to investigate further.

783
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,060
Our team?

784
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:29,700
Are you jealous because we caught
him sooner than you expected?

785
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:35,460
This is why you're not
part of our team.

786
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,830
Stop being nosy and
get back to work.

787
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,100
Circumstantial evidence
is only circumstantial!

788
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,700
It's not compelling!

789
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:00,800
(Complaint)

790
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:01,560
(Oh Ba-reun)

791
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:02,330
(I'm suing a guy who
took my bike)

792
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,230
(on December 9th in Wonyoung-dong)

793
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,000
Seung-ah.

794
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,000
Smile.

795
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,500
(Wonyoung-dong 37-4)

796
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:01,160
What are you looking for today?

797
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:03,460
The punk who stole someone
else's bike also lost his.

798
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:06,360
He wants us to find out
who stole his.

799
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:09,500
Oh. It's 37-4.

800
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,800
Why did he have to park in our
surveillance camera's blind spot?

801
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,100
I know right.

802
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:31,030
It's a dud.

803
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,300
- See you.
- Bye.

804
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:59,530
You know when I
find you the cutest?

805
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,360
When you think

806
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,300
you don't need this stuff,

807
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,430
when you think you're different

808
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,100
and you're not a snob like others.

809
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,300
Right now,

810
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,800
you're being cute.

811
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,800
But you…

812
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,660
You can't live without
these things.

813
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,300
You're just as snobbish as I am.

814
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,530
I'm sorry.

815
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,960
You really don't want to do it?

816
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:35,560
If you hate it that much,
just don't do it.

817
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,200
It's as simple as that.

818
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,330
Why?

819
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,630
You actually want to
do it, don't you?

820
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,700
That could be the case.

821
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,900
Acting like you're giving in.

822
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,660
That's not true.

823
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,360
Oh gosh…

824
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,130
You're home.
I don't want dinner.

825
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,600
You busy?

826
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,600
Goodness, what's all this?

827
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,460
I have to finish a CI by tomorrow.

828
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,030
CI?

829
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,230
Yeah, I need to change
the logo for Arts.

830
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,860
Oh, logo.

831
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:05,830
You look like a career woman.

832
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:17,530
What…

833
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,700
What's this?

834
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,760
I'm asking! What's this?

835
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:26,200
Ah, you mean goods.

836
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,830
Goods?

837
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,900
It's a logo made by Arts
that was put on gifts

838
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,060
for the beer festival last summer.

839
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,260
You know like umbrellas and cups

840
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:38,560
- given away to customers.
- Umbrella?

841
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,660
Gosh…

842
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:45,400
Jesus, I don't have time for this!

843
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,430
I can pick them up.

844
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,960
I always clean up for you.

845
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,960
No, you can't just
put them randomly!

846
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:54,300
It has to be in order.

847
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,960
Give me one by one
in the order according to the color.

848
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:58,230
- All of these colors?
- Yeah.

849
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,700
It's…

850
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,730
By the way,

851
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,360
that’s where Kim Moo-young
works, right?

852
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:10,360
Right, Kim Moo-young!

853
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:12,660
He would've finished this in a
minute if this had happened to him.

854
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:15,060
When are we going to
finish organizing this?

855
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:17,360
Finish it in a minute?

856
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:19,800
Seung-ah said he's a genius.

857
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,360
Her bracelet broke and

858
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:23,260
the beads were scattered everywhere,

859
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:24,600
but he fixed it for her.

860
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,530
Later, she found out that the beads were
exactly in order like before.

861
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,800
- What?
- Seriously it looked the same!

862
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,760
When there were
more than 20 beads.

863
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,660
Jin-kook, where are you going?

864
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,700
You can't just leave!

865
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,560
Oh, the front row looks
exactly the same, too.

866
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:48,560
There are dozens of these, though.

867
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:50,960
It can't be like this person
has photographic memory.

868
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,260
Seriously it looked the same!

869
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:55,300
When there were
more than 20 beads.

870
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,400
Goods.

871
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,300
It's a logo made by Arts
that was put on gifts.

872
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,000
That’s where Kim Moo-young
works, right?

873
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,600
What were you looking at?
You were completely preoccupied.

874
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,900
A killer.

875
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,430
- A killer?
- Yeah, on the wall.

876
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:51,400
On the wall? You mean the picture.

877
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,600
Choi Sang-hoon?

878
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,760
Right.

879
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:44,730
No, it's not what you think.

880
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,860
I really don’t want
to get married.

881
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,060
I know.

882
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,130
Hey, police officer!

883
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,530
What are you doing here?

884
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,660
What would I be doing here?

885
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:15,300
Waiting for you, obviously.

886
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,300
Why?

887
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,830
You asked me the other day…

888
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,260
How I would feel if someone
dies because of me.

889
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,300
Let me ask you this time…

890
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:31,000
How did you feel

891
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:32,360
when you killed her?

892
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,030
(A remake of the Japanese series A Hundred
Million Stars Falling From The Sky)

893
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,560
(Hundred Million Stars From The Sky)

894
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,530
What's gotten into you?

895
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,200
You asking me out?

896
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,000
I don't know.
I've never had a mom.

897
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,730
- I don't have parents either.
- I know.

898
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,560
I feel like I knew that
from the beginning.

899
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:18,560
How's the cat doing?
What's its name?

900
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:20,230
Last name is Jin, first name is Kang.

901
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,430
- Jin Kang.
- This is everything I've ever given you?

902
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,660
I was with him.

903
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:26,300
- I slept with him.
- Who are you?

904
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,030
I'm suspecting Kim Moo-young
for Jung Mi-yeon's case.

905
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,330
- You'd better watch out.
- Why are you still here?

906
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,230
Stop her. Stop her
from meeting him again.

907
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,630
Yoo Jin-kang!
