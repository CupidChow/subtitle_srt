6
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,800
Who is she?

7
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,760
A girl I'd like to look good for.

8
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,400
I'm not his real sister.

9
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,100
I thought I wouldn't tell anybody
until I died.

10
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,160
I want to sleep with you.

11
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,900
He didn't commit suicide.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,860
Nor did he fall off the cliff.

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,960
He didn't even try to

14
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,030
run away…

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,760
I shot him with a gun.

- Uh?
(Episode 11)

18
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,360
- Sergeant Yoo.
- Uh?

19
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,030
What?

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,830
How did you live like that?

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,360
How could you live
keeping something like that to yourself

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,630
for the past 25 years?

23
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,530
Jin-kang was there.

24
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,229
I had Jin-kang.

25
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,660
Right, Jin-kang was there for you.

26
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,760
Fate really is incredible.

27
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,030
If you hadn't lost that child
at the hospital,

28
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,530
Jin-kang wouldn't have come
to your house.

29
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,230
You're right.

30
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,230
At first, I somehow convinced
mom and Jin-yi

31
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,800
and took her in,

32
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,360
but she never gave me her heart.

33
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,800
She didn't even talk or smile.

34
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,060
I was actually scared.

35
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,500
I wasn't sure if it was a good idea.

36
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,360
But one day, I woke up,

37
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,960
and this kid… this girl

38
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,400
was holding my finger.

39
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,760
This little, pretty, poor girl

40
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:56,860
was holding onto my
finger so tightly,

41
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,960
I felt overwhelmed.

42
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,600
Aren't you sleeping?

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,430
No.

44
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,700
I'm not sleepy.

45
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,130
I don't have enough
time to get some sleep anyways.

46
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,660
Ah…

47
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,630
But how did you find out

48
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,829
he wasn't your real brother?

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,560
When I was in junior high,

50
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,430
I had to submit some documents

51
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,160
for a scholarship application.

52
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,860
And I saw my birthday registration
date on the document.

53
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,530
It was May 1994.

54
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,460
But that was so strange.
I was born in April 1990

55
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,930
but he registered me in 1994.

56
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,500
I was going to ask him
when he got back.

57
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,760
But he was on duty that day.

58
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,000
I was thinking about it all night

59
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,230
and then I realized…

60
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,030
Ah… that was why.

61
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,400
That was what happened.

62
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:42,460
I had found so many questionable
things even before then.

63
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,960
It would've been difficult to not
have realized at that point.

64
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:54,600
It must've been a shock
especially because you found out so late.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,930
I was.

66
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,200
I was lost.

67
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,630
All by myself without
anyone else knowing.

68
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,700
It was a turbulent time.

69
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,860
Oh!

70
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,100
The funny thing was…

71
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,100
I found out the day before

72
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,260
I was supposed to go
to the hospital.

73
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,900
To get my scar removed.

74
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,800
So you were going to remove it.

75
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,060
Yeah.

76
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,130
But…

77
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,330
Once I found out,

78
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,730
I felt like I shouldn't remove it.

79
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,800
I felt like

80
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,060
there wouldn’t be a way
for me to find myself if I did.

81
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,430
It's so strange.

82
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,660
We came here to find
your memories,

83
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,760
but it feels like
I found myself instead.

84
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,600
Do you want to see something
very, very cute?

85
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,960
- Very, very cute?
- Yeah!

86
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, too bad.

87
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,500
It's really cute.

88
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,630
But my phone is out of battery.

89
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,860
What is that really,
really cute thing?

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,860
Me.

91
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,700
- You?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,700
Me when I was young.

93
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,930
You're getting shameless.

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,760
Right.

95
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,200
Aren't I cute?

96
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,030
- Uh?
- Good evening.

97
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,500
I'm sorry. I got a little lost
because I haven't been here before.

98
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,730
No, we're thankful
you even came this far.

99
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,860
- Thanks.
- Sure.

100
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,500
Who is it?

101
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,000
- Hello?
- I'm sorry for calling you this late.

102
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,330
Hello, I'm Hwang Sun-ah,

103
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,600
the president of
Manager Jin-kang's company.

104
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:54,300
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know this was here.

105
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
I even called you at this hour…

106
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,360
I hope I didn't wake her up.

107
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,860
She worked all night because she
had to go to the temple today.

108
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,330
What time did
Kim Moo-young's interrogation

109
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,130
end today?

110
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,600
Huh? That got delayed.

111
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,230
- Delayed?
- Yes.

112
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,530
He called us around 1PM and
said he was out of town.

113
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,500
Out of town? Where?

114
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,460
Haesan.

115
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,860
Haesan?

116
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,700
He's a jerk but what can I do?

117
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,960
We can't go all the way there
just to catch him.

118
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,799
So it was delayed until tomorrow,
why?

119
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,799
Is everything alright?

120
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,059
It's nothing.

121
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,500
Alright. See you.

122
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,960
Why, what's going on?

123
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,900
It seems like Jin-kang went to
Haesan with Kim Moo-young.

124
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,800
Kim Moo-young?

125
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,330
- To Haesan?
- Yeah.

126
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,060
What do I do if she really did?

127
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
I'm late.

128
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,660
Yeah.

129
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,230
Go. You're late for work too.

130
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,430
Go! I'll text you soon.

131
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,160
Bye.

132
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
You woke up?

133
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,500
Did I wake you?

134
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,930
How did your date with Tak go?

135
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,060
Jin-kook.

136
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,000
Your gimbap was so popular.

137
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,800
Our president said
it's good enough to sell…

138
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,330
Your president called me
last night.

139
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,400
She said she couldn't
find your draft…

140
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,830
Oh, did she?

141
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,830
I see.

142
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,430
I told her I left it on her desk…

143
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,300
I'm sorry for lying.

144
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,800
Actually…

145
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,060
I went to Haesan yesterday

146
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,600
with Kim Moo-young.

147
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,960
You don't need to explain.

148
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,930
Just tell me
what you're going to do.

149
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,100
I clearly told you not to

150
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,600
and you promised me
you wouldn't see him ever again.

151
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,630
Jin-kook, I…

152
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,360
- I like him.
- What the hell did you say?

153
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,100
Have you lost your mind?

154
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,530
How can you say you like
that kind of bastard?

155
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,730
Is it that wrong to like him?

156
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,500
You think that makes sense?

157
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,260
Why aren't you hearing me out?

158
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,030
Hearing you out?

159
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,260
Just ask anyone out on the street.

160
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,560
Who's going to understand
you liking him

161
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,500
instead of a kind guy
like Eom Cho-rong?

162
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,430
Who's going to understand you?

163
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,230
I don't care
what other people think.

164
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,930
I know you hate him.

165
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,760
I'm not asking you to understand
me right now.

166
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,330
But this isn't right.

167
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,300
You're not even listening to
what I'm thinking

168
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,000
or what he's going to do.

169
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,630
Why are you being so reckless?

170
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,760
Reckless or whatever.

171
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,400
No is no. Understand?

172
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,300
Answer me.

173
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,660
Sit down.

174
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,060
Sit down!

175
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,630
- You little...
- What's wrong with you?

176
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,730
Seriously?

177
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,600
You weren't like this even
during puberty. Why now?

178
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,800
Are you really not going
to listen to me?

179
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,360
Even if I'm asking you so
desperately like this?

180
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,360
Think of who raised you until now!

181
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,130
I'm telling you!

182
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
I'm begging you!

183
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,560
Jin-kook! Please stop it, please!

184
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,860
What am I supposed to say
if you say that?

185
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,260
What can I say when
I feel so bad?

186
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,430
My puberty…

187
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,960
What was I like in my teens?

188
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,400
I was so sorry even just
looking at your face

189
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,200
and at your back!

190
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,200
I couldn't even breathe
when I was a teen!

191
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,100
You…

192
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,600
I know I'm a burden in your life.

193
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,100
I know you raised me.

194
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,930
I know it all too well,
so please stop it.

195
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,700
I already feel bad as is,

196
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,000
so please stop patronizing me.

197
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,460
Patronizing you?

198
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,460
Yes, stop patronizing me.

199
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,630
How dare…

200
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,830
You little…

201
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,930
You aren't my burden!

202
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,800
You aren't my burden
and I'm not…

203
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,360
Jin-kang,

204
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,930
you don't really think that way,
do you?

205
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,400
Yes, I do.

206
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,860
I'm suffocating

207
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,130
and I'm sick of it.

208
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,860
(Seoul Wonyoung Police Station)

209
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,400
What time is
Kim Moo-young's interrogation?

210
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,730
4PM.

211
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,300
- 4PM.
- Mind your own business.

212
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,960
Stop being so nosy…

213
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,360
Why don't you mind
your own business?

214
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,200
How dare you…

215
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,960
What's so wrong with
a detective asking

216
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,700
when an interrogation is?
Am I wrong?

217
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,329
No.

218
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,430
Hi. Enjoy your lunch.

219
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,530
Enjoy your lunch.

220
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,630
He doesn't want to eat lunch.

221
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,730
What's going on with Sergeant Yoo?

222
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,860
He's been weird all day…

223
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,860
I've never seen him like that.

224
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,900
- Go eat your lunch.
- Join us for lunch.

225
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,530
Stop worrying so much
about Sergeant Yoo.

226
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,030
I do?

227
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,960
Oh, Eom Cho-rong.

228
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,930
Are you worried about me?

229
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,360
- Of course.
- Goodness.

230
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,500
Thanks.

231
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,130
I heard it didn't go well
with Jin-kang.

232
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,800
Right.

233
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,530
Oh…

234
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,830
Yeah, life is unfair.

235
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,860
But it's the most unfair when
it comes to love, right?

236
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,230
You're right.

237
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,800
Jeez,

238
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,860
even if it's unfair, what can I do?
I can't help myself.

239
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,330
Go in.

240
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,860
Alright.

241
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,960
Bye.

242
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,360

If you've charged your phone,

245
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,060
show me that really,
really cute picture.

(Tak So-jung)

247
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,560
Tak.

248
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,260
Welcome.

249
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,360
Hey, Jin-kang!

250
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,630
I don't want you to feel bad but,

251
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,930
your brother looked
depressed all day.

252
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,200
I've never seen him

253
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,330
that depressed before.

254
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,560
So you really went to Haesan?

255
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,230
Yes.

256
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,830
He was mad at you, wasn't he?

257
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,560
Was he harsh?

258
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,230
I was harsh to him.

259
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,730
I told him to stop patronizing me
because I'm sick of it.

260
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,300
Jin-kang!

261
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,260
I know, Tak.

262
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,860
Hey, look.

263
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,600
Of course he knows
you didn't really mean it.

264
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,530
But Jin-kang,

265
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,930
even if he knows that,
it probably still hurts.

266
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,260
Did he…

267
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,200
eat lunch?

268
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,060
What about you?

269
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,060
I'm an idiot for asking.

270
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,230
You're just like your brother.

271
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,060
Let's go, come on.
Let's go eat first.

272
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,260
It's okay, come on.

273
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,900
Let's go and get lunch first.

274
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,660
Uh?

275
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,300
It's your fault,

276
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,530
but it's okay.

277
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,430
He knows you didn't mean it.

278
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,030
And it's okay to do that
when you're still young.

279
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,060
No.

280
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,530
I'm serious. You can do that.

281
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,760
Sergeant Yoo is always sad

282
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,430
you matured so quickly.

283
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,360
Is it because you think
he went through too much because of you?

284
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,030
That's what a brother does
when there aren't any parents.

285
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,500
That's natural.

286
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,330
Come on, it's nothing.

287
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,860
- It's okay.
- It's not natural.

288
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,660
It's not natural, Tak.

289
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,030
I shouldn't do that to him.

290
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,930
Ever.

291
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,430
You can do that, come on. Get up.

292
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,400
Let's go get lunch first.

293
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,430
- Take your purse.
- Tak, I'd like to ask you something.

294
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,800
I mean…

295
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,860
I've never seen my brother

296
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,500
hating someone so much
like this before.

297
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,900
Even before I started dating
Kim Moo-young.

298
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,060
He just hated Moo-young
without a particular reason.

299
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,800
Why do you think
he hates him so much?

300
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,200
The police investigation is over
now.

301
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,400
You'll get a summons
from the prosecution shortly

302
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,760
by call or mail.

303
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,630
- Okay.
- You can't just change

304
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,000
your interrogation time as you
please with the prosecution.

305
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,260
It'll only work against you.

306

00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,060
I'm heading out to meet Tak.
(Yoo Jin-kang)

308
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,560
I'm heading out to meet Tak.

309
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,800
My brother's closest friend.

310
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,230
Jin-kook found out I went
to Haesan with you.

311
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,730
I was really mean to him this morning.

312
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,900
I think she wants to meet
because of that.

313
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,660
- 3.
- No, 1.

314
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,000
I said it's fun!

(Police Recruitment)

316
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,560
I just stopped by your office.

317
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,330
- For what?
- Nothing.

318
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,600
Just wanted to see you
since I'm here.

319
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,230
Would you like some?

320
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,300
Gosh, lasers are shooting
out of your eyes.

321
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,700
Why aren't you listening to me?

322
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,460
I told you not to meet my sister.

323
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,930
Should I do that?

324
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,960
Can't you just let me see her?

325
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,030
I'm thinking of giving that a go.

326
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,230
(Police Recruitment)
I'm thinking of giving that a go.

327
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,960
I'm thinking of giving that a go.

328
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,200
I told you I wanted to be
a policeman when I was young.

329

What do you say?

330
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,260
I'm confident I'll pass the exam.

331
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,430
You're confident you'll
pass the exam?

I guess you don't get it at all.

333
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,360
You can't become a policeman only
if you're smart and pass the exam.

334
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,860
Only a human being
can be a policeman,

335
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,860
not a murderer like you.

336
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,400
You're a murderer.

337
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,630
Just because you were lucky enough
to get charged for

338
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,800
fleeing and spoliation of evidence
instead of murder,

339
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,900
you shouldn't forget your sins.

340
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,900
Think about why Seung-ah died

341
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,060
and why Yoo-ri is locked up!

342
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,500
How dare you try to be

343
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Jin-kang's boyfriend?

344
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,760
I'm not going to let you

345
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,230
ruin Jin-kang's life.

346
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,200
It won't happen!

347
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,660
So stop acting up

348
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,460
and get lost.

349
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,230
I guess

350
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,560
I really wanted to…

351
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,930
look good to you up until now.

352
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,900
Seeing as that I feel so bad now.

353
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,960
Okay, I get it.

354
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,500
We can never make up.

355
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,600
I must've mistaken something

356
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,130
because you're the brother
of the girl I love.

357
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,260
You're you and
Jin-kang is Jin-kang.

358
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,930
You're nothing but a brother.

359
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,860
I'm nothing but a brother?

360
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,500
You're scared of nothing, right?

361
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,430
You do whatever you want
because you have nothing to lose.

362
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,000
But I can do anything
because I'm so scared.

363
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,960
Because I'm so scared
my sister might get hurt,

364
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,360
I can do anything to prevent it!

365
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,160
I won't be just talk
with you from now on.

366
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,600
I don't care what you do.

367
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,160
I'll keep seeing Jin-kang.

368
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,630
Do whatever you want.

369
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,460
You do whatever you want

370
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,230
and I do whatever I want.

371
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,830
I'm quite curious to see what
you'll do if it won't be just talk.

372
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,930
Can't you reconsider your
feelings for Moo-young?

373
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,930
There might be a reason
we don't know about.

374
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,860
So what is that reason?

375
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,330
Don't you have a clue?

376
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,100
Me? No, I don't.

377
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,430
You said Sergeant Yoo hated
Moo-young from the beginning

378
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,660
and that's unusual.

379
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,200
Jin-kang.

380
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,930
Can't you just…

381
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,900
Frankly speaking,

382
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,760
I don't really like
Kim Moo-young either.

383
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,800
I don't think he's good for you.

384
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,830
You're here.

385
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:41,230
Yes, I'm here.

386
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,900
How come you didn't eat all day?

387
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,330
It's not that I didn't,
I just couldn't.

388
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,200
I went all the way home…

389
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,600
But I couldn't go inside.

390
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,430
I'm glad I'm here.

391
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,330
This tastes good
because I'm eating it with you.

392
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,960
Are you really that worried
about your brother?

393
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,500
Of course!

394
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,630
She said he was depressed all day…

395
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,060
That sounds complicated…

396
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,630
Why?

397
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,760
You feel bad because
he doesn't welcome you?

398
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,400
But his reaction is natural
from his perspective as my brother.

399
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,130
I just wish time would
pass by quickly.

400
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,000
I hope this time passes quickly

401
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,760
and a time comes
when he'll like you.

402
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,400
Right?

403
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,360
I'm not sure.

404
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,560
You're not sure?

405
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,100
Does that even matter?

406
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,100
You're not a minor
who needs his permission to date.

407
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,800
I didn't say
I needed his permission.

408
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,630
You know it's not like that.

409
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,600
I hate complicated things.

410
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,000
You're you

411
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,230
and that man is that man.

412
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,000
That man?

413
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,400
Is Jin-kook just a
stranger to you?

414
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,760
Why?

415
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,730
Can't he be?

416
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,860
You're so mean.

417
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,930
That's not new.

418
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,930
It's just because
he doesn't know you well.

419
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,630
He isn't aware of
how hard you're trying.

420
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,030
I really don't want to be
in his good graces.

421
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,700
I guess you've forgotten.

422
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,900
I'm really used to
being turned down.

423
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,560
Things like that
don't bother me at all,

424
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,630
so don't force me to care.

425
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,460
That man, that man.

426
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,300
How could you say
that as if it's none of your business

427
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,160
when you know everything?

428
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,400
Others might not know,
but you know

429
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,000
how precious Jin-kook is to me.

430
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,360
How could you

431
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,930
say that

432
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,860
when you know everything?

433
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,900
I should go.

434
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,000
Bye.

435
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,330
(Yoo Jin-kang)

436
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,000
Liar.

437
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,160
No one ever gets used to
such a thing!

438
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,760
No one ever gets used to
being turned down!

439
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,659
You're breaking my heart.

440
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm on your side, you know.

441
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,199
I was scared.
I thought you left me.

442
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,560
You're so mean.

443
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,630
Where did you go?

444
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,800
Your place.

445
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:49,500
Did you run?

446
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,600
Yeah.

447
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,730
Did you run fast?

448
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,530
I did.

449
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,560
You're not going to do that
again, are you?

450
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,230
You're going to stop me even if
I tell you I'm leaving, aren't you?

451
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,560
Yes.

452
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,800
Gosh, I'm thirsty.

453
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,400
I didn't even get to drink
because I was so upset.

454
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,300
My purse!

455
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,960
Hey, come on.

456
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,630
I'm so thirsty.

457
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,330
- Where did you learn that?
- I'm so thirsty.

458
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,230
Giddy up!

459
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,460
Up here.

460
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,900
There aren't any cups
in this house.

461
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,400
No.

462
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,400
It's not only cups
that are missing here.

463
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,200
No microwave, no rice cooker,

464
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,500
and no washing machine.

465
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,100
Now I see why the cat ran away.

466
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,160
Why?

467
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,930
Put me down.

468
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,700
It thought this wasn't a house.

469
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,830
Who thinks this is a house

470
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,730
when there's nothing here?

471
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,430
It's a house.

472
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,360
Hey, do you even have money?

473
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,600
I'm sure you do, right?

474
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,160
Money?

475
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,900
Not a lot but I do have. Why?

476
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,830
Fine.

477
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,730
What is it? I'm getting scared.

478
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,530
No, I can't tell you yet.

479
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,830
- Come on.
- No, it's a secret.

480
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,760
Still a secret.

481
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,630
I heard your alarm.

482
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,560
Yeah, I went to the mart
to buy these.

483
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,800
You want some bread?

484
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,030
Go take a shower and
eat some bread after.

485
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,460
Alright.

486
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,160
It's delicious.

487
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,560
Is it? You want some more?

488
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,400
Yes, please.

489
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,400
I'm sorry about yesterday.

490
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,560
You think I'm dumb? I understand.

491
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,260
Please give me some time.

492
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,930
He and I will do better…

493
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,030
to get you to like us.

494
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,960
So I want you…

495
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,600
to give us some time.

496
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,130
I don't think Jin-kang can change.

497
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,730
Why not?

498
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,330
Haven't you guys made up yet?

499
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,300
Didn't she apologize to you?

500
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,160
Of course she did

501
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,360
but she never said
she would break up with him.

502
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,600
That's awful.

503
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,500
Oh, right!

504
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,660
Nevermind. Nothing.

505
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,930
What is it?

506
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,130
Just say whatever you
were going to say.

507
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,800
Are you sure

508
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,100
Jin-kang doesn't know anything?

509
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,630
What do you mean?

510
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,330
That you took her in
when she was young.

511
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,060
That she's not your real sister.

512
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,900
She looked so stressed out because of
what she said to you.

513
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,660
She said she shouldn't
have done that to you

514
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,730
and she shouldn't do that
to you ever.

515
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,200
She sounded like she knew something.

516
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,530
Do you remember
what you said before?

517
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,530
Which one?

518
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,800
You said...

519
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,400
Your sister is an orphan, right?

520
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,160
What, orphan? Who said that?

521
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,360
She has me.
How come she's an orphan?

522
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,060
Where did you hear that?

523
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,360
Kim Moo-young and your sister.

524
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,330
They found out
they're both orphans.

525
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,630
Ever since then,
they've fallen in love!

526
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,130
I was curious about
what they said.

527
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,500
I mean what you meant when
you said she's an orphan.

528
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,830
I heard you don't have parents.

529
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,560
So?

530
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,600
She said there's another sister

531
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,230
who went to the States

532
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,530
so it's been just you and Jin-kang

533
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,200
living together.

534
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,730
Yes, that's right.

535
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,800
That's all I heard.

536
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,900
What? Is something wrong?

537
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,830
No, it's correct.

538
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,100
Everything you said is correct.

539
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,030
I was wondering why she said
she was an orphan

540
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,160
when she has me, that's all.

541
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,930
Gosh, this is irritating.

542
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,900
You came here just to ask me that?

543
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,300
Not for me?

544
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,760
Come on, that's not true!

545
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,200
I came here for you, to see you!

546
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,860
I was wondering how you're doing

547
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,230
before the trial and all that.

548
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,230
You're such a bad liar.

549
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,930
Is it that obvious?

550
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,730
It's good to see you

551
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,360
doing better than I expected.

552
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,130
Right.

553
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,260
Although time passes
so damn slowly.

554
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,630
Is Moo-young dating your sister?

555
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,960
What do you mean?
I'd never approve of him. Never.

556
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,730
Do you think
she'll break up with him

557
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,160
just because you object?

558
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,460
Your sister won't ever
break up with him first

559
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,460
unless he dumps her.

560
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,330
A woman who falls for him

561
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,530
will never get over him.

562
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,260
You said you have money.

563
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,630
You can spend $2,000.

564
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,560
What are you going
to do with that $2,000?

565
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,730
Why do you ask?
I'm going to spend it all!

566
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,060
What are you trying to buy?

567
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,860
Cup, microwave,
washing machine, rice cooker,

568
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,530
bowls, pot, frying pan, plates,

569
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,700
chopping board, knife…

570
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,060
so on.

571
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,760
Gosh, $2,000 won't be enough.

572
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,700
Do you have $3,000?

(Yang Kyung-mo)

575
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,030
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

576
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,300
I don't think
you can visit Lim Yoo-ri today.

577
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,200
Excuse me?

578
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,000
- Why?
- Someone's visiting her already.

579
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,200
A prisoner awaiting trial can only

580
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,200
have one visitor per day.

581
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,830
Ah, I see.

582
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,460
Doctor, what brings you here?

583
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,800
I was worried
when I heard the news.

584
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,800
Yoo-ri's mother called me up.

585
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,260
She asked me to visit Yoo-ri

586
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,900
since she's refusing an attorney.

587
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,360
I chose the wrong day.

588
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:06,200
I didn't know you still had
more interviews with her.

589
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,530
Oh, I didn't come here
for an interview.

590
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,730
I came here to ask her
some personal questions.

591
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,860
She's already transferred
to the prosecution.

592
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,260
The prosecution is handling

593
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,360
the remaining case
regarding the accomplice.

594
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,830
You mean the guy who helped her
tamper with evidence?

595
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,030
How is he related to Lim Yoo-ri?

596
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,960
Ah, Kim Moo-young?

597
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,200
I think Lim Yoo-ri had

598
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,360
a crush on him.

599
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,730
You said Kim Moo-young?

600
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,530
Yes, Kim Moo-young.

601
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,760
How old is he?

602
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,700
He's 30. He was born in 1989.

603
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,600
I see.

604
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,430
I think I know him.

605
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,660
You know him?

606
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,660
Right, I'm not certain though…

607
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:02,630
I have something to do.
I'll excuse myself first.

608
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,660
- Thanks for the talk.
- Sure.

609
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,560
Are all of these necessary
in daily life?

610
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,660
I can't even push
because it's too heavy.

611
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,500
I only bought
urgently needed ones.

612
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,800
I'll order the rest online.

613
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,030
Oh, it's there.

614
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,730
- Where are you going?
- Cashier.

615
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,300
We still have to go around
one more floor.

616
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,460
We already bought home appliances
and other stuff,

617
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:38,260
we should go downstairs
and buy some food.

618
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:40,930
- Food?
- Yes.

619
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,630
Rice, ramyun, kimchi,

620
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,760
egg, gochujang, dwenjang,
soy sauce, olive oil

621
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,100
and so on.

622
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,830
Let's just eat out!

623
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,860
When will you have a
housewarming party?

624
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,400
The microwave and washing machine
will arrive the day after tomorrow,

625
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,160
so what about 2 days after tomorrow?
What'll you cook for me?

626
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:03,460
A housewarming party?
Cook for you?

627
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:05,660
I guess you haven't figured
me out yet, this is not my thing.

628
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,360
For the past 30 years…
Where are you going?

629
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:11,130
Look at this!

630
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,100
Put it back.

631
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,260
Where were you, kitty?

632
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:17,360
Let's go home.

633
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,560
This isn't really my thing…

634
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,400
The police arrested Mr. Kim,

635
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,460
a man in his 30s, at 6:40PM yesterday

636
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,000
as the prime suspect

637
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,000
in the Wonyoung-dong murder case.

638
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,560
They found the murder weapon
at his home

639
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,330
and it is now being investigated
by National Forensics.

640
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:04,500
What're you doing there?
Aren't you tidying things up?

641
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,600
Look.

642
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,430
You take it.

643
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,400
You said you wanted it.

644
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,130
Which one?

645
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,460
The really, really cute one.

646
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,160
You said you wanted it.

647
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,260
Uh?

648
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,260
Isn't it really, really cute?

649
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,330
Not really.

650
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,800
Give it back then.

651
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,630
You already gave it to me.

652
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,960
But can I really have it?

653
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,760
Yeah, it's a copy.
I have the original at home.

654
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,800
I'm giving it to you for you to become
closer to my brother.

655
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,300
A photo of me with my brother.

656
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,860
Just organize this first.

00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,430
Sergeant Yoo.

661
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,600
Someone's looking for you.

662
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,630
- Me?
- Yes.

663
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,860
Alright.

664
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,230
You came here because of
Kim Moo-young, not Yoo-ri?

665
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,500
That's quite surprising.

666
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,800
I'm not sure

667
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,360
how exactly I can help you.

668
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:25,830
I'm not allowed to tell you

669
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,630
anything about the suspect.

670
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,030
I see.

671
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:33,960
When you came to me for Yoo-ri,

672
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:36,860
you said you read my book, right?

673
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,460
That's right.

674
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:43,030
A boy called Myung-ho in chapter 2

675
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,900
is Moo-young.

676
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,800
Moo-young is…

677
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,700
the first kid I met.

678
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,260
Because of him, I went back to
medical school

679
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,660
and studied child psychiatry.

680
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,860
So Moo-young is

681
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,830
very special to me.

682
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,160
So you mean…

683
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,160
You've known him
since he was in Haesan…

684
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,230
Right.

685
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,500
I didn't know

686
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,360
you also knew
he grew up in Haesan…

687
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,630
It seems like
I came to the right person.

688
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,700
No, I just happened
to coincidentally

689
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,130
find out that
his hometown is Haesan.

690
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:33,930
Please, Detective.

691
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,030
I feel so uneasy about them.

692
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,700
I was already shocked with
what Yoo-ri did.

693
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,900
I can't believe Moo-young is
related to that case as well.

694
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,900
If Moo-young is not living
an upright life,

695
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,800
I'm partially responsible too.

696
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,030
Because it means
my decision was wrong.

697
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,860
Your decision?

698
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,830
Right.

699
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,200
A long, long time ago,

700
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,900
I made a decision…

701
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,260
Isn't he Yang Kyung-mo?

702
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,230
How do you know that?

703
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,400
Oh my god! He really is
Doctor Yang Kyung-mo!

704
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,000
Gosh, I'm a big fan of him!

705
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,800
I should've gotten his autograph.

706
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,930
Is he that famous?

707
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,930
Of course! He's even on TV.

708
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,200
I even read his books and
searched for his videos online.

709
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,760
Awesome!

710
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:45,100
Lim Yoo-ri is the girl
from chapter 7

711
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,700
of the book "Together With Trauma"?

712
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,730
And Kim Moo-young is in chapter 2?

713
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,030
- According to him, yeah.
- Jeez.

714
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,230
What does it say? I only read
Lim Yoo-ri's chapter.

715
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,330
It was really sad.

716
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,200
I really cried a lot reading it.

717
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,660
But I can't clearly remember.
I should look for it again.

718
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,000
But why did he come to meet you?

719
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,000
He has a lot of questions.

720
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:13,360
About how Yoo-ri is related
to Kim Moo-young.

721
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:15,660
He seems concerned.

722
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:19,100
I bet he does since they were
both his patients.

723
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,630
Right.

724
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,460
What did Lim Yoo-ri say?
Did you meet her?

725
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,730
Yeah, but I don't think she knows.

726
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,660
Jin-kang doesn't know anything.

727
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:40,230
Thank god.

728
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,960
Yeah.

729
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,930
But…

730
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,660
Would it matter

731
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:51,260
if she only knew up to that part?

732
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,330
She's all grown-up now.

733
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,300
Which part?

734
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,000
No, never.

735
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,930
I didn't mean
what happened before.

736
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,030
I meant that you took her in
when she was young.

737
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,200
She should know one day.

738
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,460
I said no.

739
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,530
Alright, fine.

740
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,900
You don't need to get
worked up about it.

741
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,260
You know you're so sensitive.

742
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,760
You're getting more sensitive
day by day.

743
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,230
Yes, I know

744
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,430
but I can't deal with it.

745
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,000
I shouldn't have met him
in the first place.

746
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:29,660
Ever since I met him,

747
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,260
I feel like something's
been choking me.

748
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:36,160
Nothing just gets by.

749
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,830
It's like some kind of karma.

750
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,060
And…

751
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:42,260
When I think

752
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:44,730
it might even sweep
Jin-kang through,

753
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,430
I can't stand it.

754
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,530
It's driving me crazy.

755
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,430
300g of beef.

756
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,030
Cabbage.

757
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,000
Perilla leaf, oyster mushroom…

758
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,200
(A golden recipe for
Mille-Feuille Nabe)
Perilla leaf, oyster mushroom…

759
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:07,260
(A golden recipe for
Mille-Feuille Nabe)

760
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,800
King oyster mushroom, enokitake…
(A golden recipe for
Mille-Feuille Nabe)

761
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,030
King oyster mushroom, enokitake…

762
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,760
Aren't you going for lunch?

763
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,330
I'm coming.

764
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,460
What're you looking
at so intently?

765
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,160
Top 10 foods for a
housewarming party

766
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,160
that are simple but delicious.

767
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,530
Are you having a
housewarming party?

768
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,200
Let's go for lunch.

769
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,560
(Kim Moo-young)

770
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:57,830
White wine? Red wine?
(Kim Moo-young)

771
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:00,000
White wine? Red wine?

772
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,660
White.

773
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,460
(Jin-kook)

774
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,160
Yes, Jin-kook.

775
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,030
Codfish?

776
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:23,260
Yeah, I came grocery shopping

777
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:24,530
and codfish looks fresh.

778
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,700
If you're having dinner
at home tonight,

779
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,630
I'll make some codfish stew.

780
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,260
Ah…

781
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:33,500
I think I'll be a
little late tonight.

782
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,060
Will you be really late?
Working overtime?

783
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,830
Well, I'm not sure
if I'll work overtime yet.

784
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,860
But I'll get home after dinner.

785
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:45,000
Alright, then let's have
codfish stew later.

786
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,300
Don't skip your dinner.

787
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,360
Sorry, Jin-kook.
Don't forget your dinner either.

788
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,030
Isn't it too little?

789
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,200
Do you have a large one?

790
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,460
I'm eating it with my girlfriend.

791
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:20,730
For shabu-shabu?

792
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:23,700
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

793
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,500
Have a good day.

794
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,660
Do you think
she'll break up with him

795
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:12,000
just because you object?

796
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:15,430
A woman who falls for him

797
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,730
will never get over him.

798
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,960
What's this?

799
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:27,830
Toilet paper and detergent.
Housewarming gifts!

800
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:30,030
Oh.

801
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:35,560
You know why people bring
these as housewarming gifts?

802
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:38,060
To help things go smoothly!

803
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:41,260
Hope things go smoothly,
Kim Moo-young!

804
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,060
Wow,
it looks like a real house now!

805
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,160
Everything you need is here!

806
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,260
Uh?

807
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:57,860
This is that…

808
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,700
- Its name is!
- It's Mille-Feuille Nabe.

809
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,700
Right, Mille-Feuille!

810
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,830
Damn, I wanted to eat this so bad!

811
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,230
Aren't you overdoing it
for your first time?

812
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,730
Yeah, I totally am.

813
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,830
They said this is the
simplest dish

814
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,130
but it's damn complicated!

815
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,130
Do you want me to help?

816
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,600
No thanks. Sit right there.

817
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,100
Don't move.

818
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,600
How have you been?

819
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:41,100
Look.

820
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,300
It's a new house!

821
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,360
I changed the house!

822
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,830
Look, he's become much better now.

823
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,700
Still a long way to go?

824
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,260
Yeah? Maybe I should try harder.

825
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,960
Uh?

826
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:02,960
Where's the picture?

827
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Where's Jin-kook?

828
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,460
Where did you put it?

829
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,860
I must focus on cooking now.

830
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:40,400
Where's the picture?

831
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,460
Did you put it away because
you don't like Jin-kook?

832
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:55,100
I put it away because of you.

833
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,760
I put it here.

834
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,060
Well done.

835
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:10,100
How adorable.

836
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,200
By the way,

837
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:19,460
where's this place?

838
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:24,000
Here? It's Haesan.
Myungsung University Haesan Hospital.

839
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,500
Myungsung University
Haesan Hospital?

840
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,100
Kid.

841
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,600
Where are you going?

842
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,400
What's wrong?

843
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:52,130
I don't know. I remember something

844
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,430
but I can't figure out
what it is yet…

845
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,300
Was I there?

846
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,630
There?

847
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,160
Right, you might've been.

848
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:09,030
It's the biggest hospital
in Haesan.

849
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,900
You might've received
some treatments there too.

850
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,400
I received treatment
for my burn scar

851
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:18,230
there until I was 7.

852
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:24,200
It's boiling!

853
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,660
Oh!

854
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,700
Wow, it looks so nice!

855
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,700
Let's eat.

856
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,600
Wait, wait.

857
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,530
Unbelievable.

858
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,260
Of course, I'll do even
more unbelievable stuff.

859
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,900
Come in. One, two, three.

860
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,760
Let me see.

861
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:03,260
- Your head!
- What did you just do?

862
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,960
Give it back to me for a second.

863
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:09,200
Oh no, your head is so big!

864
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,660
Hey, give it back now!

865
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:16,400
Give it back!

866
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:18,400
Right now!

867
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:32,060
This is our last shot.

868
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,700
One, two, three.

869
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:40,660
- Do you like it?
- Perfect, I love it.

870
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:50,060
You have this now
when you had nothing before?

871
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,960
Gosh, it's really hard
to cook and eat dinner.

872
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,300
Oh no!

873
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:01,660
- What?
- I forgot to buy a corkscrew.

874
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:04,030
Oh my…

875
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,360
No, forget about it.
Let's just drink it.

876
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:08,160
Come on, we can't leave out
drinks at a housewarming party.

877
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:10,860
You eat first.
I'll go quickly and buy it.

878
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:12,230
It's okay, let's just eat.

879
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,330
No, I'll go and get it.

880
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,660
I'll make it quick. Eat first!

881
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,630
Hey, don't finish the whole thing
all by yourself!

882
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,130
You think I'm a pig?

883
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:54,060
Uhm, it's so good.

884
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,400
No, no more.

885
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,130
(Wonyoung Mart)

886
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:04,730
Do you have a corkscrew?

887
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,000
No.

888
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,200
Okay.

889
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,660
Crap, he's really something…

890
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:04,660
I'm so hungry.

891
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:06,600
Right?

892
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,100
He'll be here soon.
He must be running now!

893
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,100
(A remake of the Japanese series A Hundred
Million Stars Falling From The Sky)

894
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:48,930
(Thank you to Actor Yoo Jae-myung
for guest starring)

895
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:06,960
(Hundred Million Stars From The Sky)

896
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,030
- What happened?
- It's nothing.

897
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,400
I'll tell you everything later.

898
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,830
Did he call you?

899
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,200
You know anything about it?

900
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,200
I stabbed him with a knife.

901
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:16,960
Jin-kook, I don't care about
other people

902
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:19,660
but you shouldn't have done it
because you're my brother!

903
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:20,900
Stop seeing him.

904
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,630
Are you really quitting?

905
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,060
Go confirm if Kim Moo-young

906
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:26,060
is the kid you're
really looking for

907
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,760
or just forget it if you can't.

908
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:29,000
You need to make a decision.

909
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,900
You can leave whenever you want.

910
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,700
And you can come back whenever.

911
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,360
Goodbye.

912
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:36,930
Now go.
