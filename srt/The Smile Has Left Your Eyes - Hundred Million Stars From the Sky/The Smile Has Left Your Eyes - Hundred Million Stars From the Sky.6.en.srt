13
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
But, you look fine.

14
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,130
You're giving me that look again.

15
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,330
The "I pity you" look.

16
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,930
- Jin-kang.
- Cho-rong!

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,100
Great, I caught you just in time.

18
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,030
- Right.
- Did I surprise you?

19
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,500
My mom kept telling

20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,560
me to bring you
some beef bone soup.

21
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,760
Oh, thank you so much.
I'll enjoy it.

22
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,460
Hope you like it.

23
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,100
Did you eat already?

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,300
No, not yet.

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll come back after putting
this away. Let's eat together.

26
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,230
Okay.

27
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,660
I'll be here.

28
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,860
She's so stubborn.

29
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,760
It's packed and frozen
into portions,

30
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,500
so heat each one up and eat it.

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,700
Yes, thank you so much.

32
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
I'm sure she put a lot of effort
in it and she even gave me some…

33
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,730
That's totally fine. Enjoy it.

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,360
Okay.

35
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,500
Thanks.

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,900
Looks delicious.

37
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,030
Welcome!

38
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,200
- Can I have a kalguksu, please?
- Okay.

39
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,460
(Mommy)

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Answer it, it's your mother.

41
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,860
I don't need to answer it.

42
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,500
Come on.

43
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,460
- What's up?
- Did you catch?

44
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,030
Catch…

45
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,500
Catch what?

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,900
I've got to go.

47
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,100
She meant the culprit.

48
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,900
She's asking
if I caught the culprit.

49
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,730
Uh?

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,060
Is she waiting to eat dinner

51
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,600
with you?

52
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,000
No, no.

53
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,300
It's not like that,
so don't worry.

54
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,730
- Alright.
- Eat up.

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,130
You too.

56
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,730
Eom Cho-rong,
I didn't give birth to a fool.

57
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,400
If you don't hold

58
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,330
her hand today,

59
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,900
I'm going to disown you.

60
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,330
Aren't you going to eat?

61
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,000
I am.

62
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,630
Eat up.

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,460
My hands are…

64
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,560
really sweaty…

65
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,660
Doesn't matter.

66
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,930
Should we date?

67
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,460
Let's stop being
in a vague relationship.

68
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,530
Let's stop being
in a vague relationship.

69
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,930
Right, not a vague relationship.

70
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,930
- Hey, Jin-kang.
- Yes.

71
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,700
- I should go.
- Alright.

72
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,330
Excuse me,

73
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,100
I have to pull out my car.

74
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,830
- I'll call you.
- Drive safely!

76
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,300
What are you doing?

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,530
I was just watching to make
sure he wouldn't kiss you.

78
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,960
What? Are you disappointed?

79
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,830
You wanted to kiss him
but couldn't because of me?

80
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,659
Yeah, I'm disappointed.

81
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,100
Then you should
really talk to me.

82
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:49,100
- For what?
- You said you want to kiss him.

83
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,230
If you don't talk to me today,

84
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,500
I'll be standing here
again tomorrow.

85
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,500
That look has been

86
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,060
following me around all day

87
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,400
I pity you, I pity you,
I pity you.

88
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,830
It's been bugging me so much,
I couldn't do anything today.

89
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,860
Even now it's bugging me.
Do you want to go to my place?

90
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,430
Those words are probably floating
around my house.

91
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,730
When I open the door and enter,

92
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,100
there's, "I pity you."

93
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,000
So…

94
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,930
I must know the reason.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,930
What you meant by that

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,430
and why you pity me.

97
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,600
So that was it?

98
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,360
Just because you heard
something you didn't want to hear?

99
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,560
It's literally nothing.

100
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,600
But why am I feeling this way
when it's literally nothing?

101
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,330
How do you feel?

102
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,500
I feel like crap.

103
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,330
Yeah?

104
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,300
Good for you.

105
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,659
Serves you right.

106
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,230
Why?

107
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,860
You play with others' feelings
as you please.

108
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,060
Can't you feel like crap for once?

109
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,330
This is unbelievable.

110
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,560
Haven't you heard
something like that before?

111
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,230
You came all the way here
for nothing.

112
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,930
Of course I've heard it
countless times before.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,430
Those words

114
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,460
and those looks.

115
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,430
How do you think I felt each time?

116
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,660
Nothing much.

117
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,760
I didn't feel anything.

118
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,160
When other people say
they pity me,

119
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,460
it means they're relieved.

120
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,600
I pity you because
you are an orphan.

121
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,630
I'm so relieved
my children have me.

122
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,330
Oh no, something must've
happened to get that burn scar.

123
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,159
How pitiful.

124
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,429
I'm so relieved
I don't have any scars on my arm.

125
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,830
But what you said
can't be interpreted.

126
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,460
Because you really meant it.

127
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,500
Because you really did pity me.

128
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,230
Aren't I right?

129
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,500
Right.

130
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,600
Why is that so?

131
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,430
Why are you asking me that?

132
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,760
I said that because
I felt that way.

133
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,100
Think about what you did to others

134
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,900
instead of asking me.

135
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,360
You came all the way here
for nothing.

136
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,860
- You're home.
- Yeah.

137
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,200
Hey, did you…

138
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,360
meet Kim Moo-young, by any chance?

139
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,530
Why would I meet him?

140
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,200
You said you were going
to get close to him!

141
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,860
Nevermind.

142
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,800
Eat some beef bone soup
if you're hungry.

143
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,830
Cho-rong came by
and gave it to me.

144
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,430
- Did Cho-rong visit?
- Yeah.

145
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,730
His mom asked him
to bring me some.

146
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,560
What do you think of Cho-rong?
Isn't he nice?

147
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,130
None of your business.

148
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,860
Why do you care so much
about my relationship?

149
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,560
Relationship? Relationship?
Did you just say "relationship"?

150
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,700
Jin-kang? Jin-kang?

151
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,830
Because you really did pity me.

152
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,530
Because you really meant it.

153
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,400
Are you serious?

154
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,500
Did you really see

155
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,700
Kim Moo-young in the footage

156
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,360
- from the day of the murder?
- Yes.

157
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,360
Gosh, that's creepy!

158
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,630
Look, I have goosebumps!

159
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,700
Sergeant Yoo.

160
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,100
What's with you?

161
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,460
What do you mean?

162
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,630
You said you felt
something was off

163
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,400
when you first saw Kim Moo-young.

164
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,460
You said your heart bounces in a weird
way and you get nervous.

165
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,100
Listen.

166
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,860
Do you really…

167
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,830
see things?

168
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,560
You can tell whether they're
the culprit just by looking at them?

169
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,630
What are you talking about?

170
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,030
Kim Moo-young strangely looked
familiar from the beginning.

171
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,800
That was probably why
I felt that way.

172
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,630
Gosh…

173
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,530
So what did Eom Cho-rong say?

174
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,160
If I'm this shocked,
he must be so worked up, right?

175
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,960
I didn't tell him yet.

176
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,500
How could I tell him when he was
rushing to the emergency center?

177
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,400
Oh right.

178
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,930
His mom got a burn, right?

179
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,530
What happened?

180
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,200
She burned her leg
with a steam iron.

181
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,900
Oh, Jesus…

182
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,260
Burn scars don't heal fast
on older people.

183
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,630
So, what are you going to do now?

184
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,260
I guess I should go ask directly.

185
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,400
Ask who what?

186
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,260
Ask Kim Moo-young.

187
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,300
You're going to ask him directly?

188
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,200
Saying you saw his face
in the footage

189
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,500
- from the dash cam?
- Yeah.

190
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,160
Damn, you must be insane.

191
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,330
Do you seriously think he'd admit

192
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,660
that he killed the girl

193
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,330
and that he was there that night?

194
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,100
- He might.
- What?

195
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,560
I'm serious. He might admit it.

196
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,500
He's the weirdest guy
I've ever seen.

197
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,500
How did you feel

198
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,900
- when you killed her?
- It was awesome.

199
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,300
Even if he pretended to be firm,

200
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,230
I clearly felt that

201
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,160
he was anxious.

202
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,030
I wish I could say that.

203
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,160
Stop watching so many dramas, man.

204
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,660
Kim Moo-young.

205
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,100
Where would you have put that
if you were her?

206
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,030
Next to the sailboat

207
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,830
- or the angel?
- The angel.

208
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,460
But, he played a game with me.

209
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,100
When she was killed,
the snow balls fell down,

210
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,760
but someone put them all back

211
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,130
into their original places.

212
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,430
This time, it was more than 50.

213
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,160
- Could it be the same guy?
- That's right.

214
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,800
It's you.

215
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,930
Me?

216
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,630
Then, it's not me. I only fixed
Seung-ah's bracelet.

217
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,530
At first, I thought he played
a game with just me.

218
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,400
- But…
- Sailboat.

219
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,060
Rudolph.

220
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,430
Snowman.

221
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,930
Flower.

222
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,900
Angel.

223
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,430
- Angel!
- But he didn't.

224
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,760
He was also playing

225
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,360
a game with himself.

226
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,030
Why?

227
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,260
Why would he do that?
That's too dangerous.

228
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,260
That's why I'm saying
he's the weirdest guy.

229
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,330
Maybe he feels adrenaline rushing

230
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,030
during the most dangerous moments?

231
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,830
Could you please deliver this
to Director Jang?

232
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,500
Of course.

233
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,260
Excuse me!

234
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,860
Thank you.

235
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,930
Who is he?

236
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,330
(Wedding Beer)

237
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,060
- So he's Kim Moo-young from Arts?
- That's right.
(Wedding Beer)

238
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,600
- So he's Kim Moo-young from Arts?
- That's right.

239
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,330
He said Director Jang directly
ordered this beer from him.

240
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,160
You may leave.

241
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,500
- I'll give it to Director Jang myself.
- Okay, ma'am.

242
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,830
(Love Forever)

243
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,500
Wedding beer?

244
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,030
(From Kim Moo-young)

245
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,560
What are you doing here?

246
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,700
What the hell?
She's making me feel bad.

247
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,300
Hello.

248
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,460
- Salute.
- Salute.

249
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,230
- You're just coming in?
- Yes.

250
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,830
Right, I heard your mom
got a burn.

251
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,600
Is she alright?

252
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,800
It looks like a slight burn,

253
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,560
but she still needs a skin graft.

254
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,230
My sister and her husband came by

255
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,960
and took her to Daejeon.

256
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,630
Oh my god.

257
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,300
Did you see Sergeant Yoo?

258
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,030
I didn't see him
after this morning.

259
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,300
- I see.
- Hey.

260
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,660
Hey.

261
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,730
Don't get super worked up

262
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,130
after hearing
what Sergeant Yoo says.

263
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,800
Just stay calm like this, okay?

264
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,530
What?

265
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,530
Did he find something?

266
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,100
- Something incredible.
- What is it?

267
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,500
I don't know.

268
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,630
You ask him.

269
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,830
- Go.
- Hooray!

270
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,760
Is he going to be like
Sergeant Yoo when he grows up?

271
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,530
He gets cuter the more I see him.

272
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,830
(Eom Cho-rong)

273
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,030
I'll go back to the office,
see you soon.

274
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,630
Hey, this place is…

275
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,530
kinda romantic.

276
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,300
- What brings you here?
- Right.

277
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,200
Lim Yoo-ri was waiting for you,
sitting on the stairs.

278
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,829
- Yoo-ri?
- Yeah.

279
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,900
She ran away when she saw me.

280
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,660
Ah, I put her in handcuffs and locked
her up in a detention room

281
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,130
a few days ago.

282
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,800
Didn't she tell you?

283
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,829
Why did you do that to her?

284
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,630
Did you just ask me why?

285
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,730
She almost ran someone over,

286
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,000
but she didn't seem sorry at all.

287
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,230
I wanted to teach her a lesson.
Isn't that obvious?

288
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,700
Ah, right, your sister.

289
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,660
But she didn't look sorry at all?

290
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,900
Not at all.

291
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,900
I didn't plan to lock her up

292
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,160
but she didn't care about
what happened at all.

293
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,860
I asked her to promise me
not to do it again,

294
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,900
but she said she couldn't
do that either.

295
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,730
What's so funny?

296
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,030
That's typical Yoo-ri.

297
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,630
What's typical Yoo-ri? Being rude?

298
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,830
No.

299
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,330
Being honest even during moments like that,
that's typical Yoo-ri.

300
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,700
What?

301
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,530
Anyways, why did you come here?

302
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,430
Oh yeah.

303
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,230
September 12th, 2:34AM.

304
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,760
Where were you and
what were you doing?

305
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,430
What was I doing then?

306
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,960
The day Jung Mi-yeon died
at Hewitt Vill.

307
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,660
Do you still think I killed her?

308
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,430
Yeah, it'll be you forever.

309
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,460
Isn't that exciting?

310
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,360
Why would I get excited
about such a thing?

311
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,000
That's ridiculous.

312
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,800
What did you do that night?

313
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,600
I must've been sleeping
if it was past 2AM.

314
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,160
No, you went to
Hewitt Vill that night.

315
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,930
You even got splashed with rainwater
by a passing car on your way.

316
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,730
There's no CCTV in that area,
right?

317
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,560
Right. As you already know,
they're all fake.

318
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,730
That's why I'm here
to ask you about it.

319
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,730
It would be possible to
get through blind spots

320
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,300
if you investigated
nearby roads beforehand.

321
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
But not inside the building.

322
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,060
It's hard to figure out whether
they're fake just by looking.

323
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,500
How did you know that?

324
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,030
Who told you?

325
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,060
Jung Mi-yeon.

326
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,260
Lim Yoo-ri.

327
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,030
The security guard.

328
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,800
Jin-kook, you're hilarious.

329
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,430
I was just guessing

330
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,000
the CCTVs would be fake

331
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,530
because you brought up
the dash cam

332
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,630
just now.

333
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,030
So you heard it from Jung Mi-yeon.

334
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,900
You've always been
telling the truth

335
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,530
as if it's a joke.

336
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,930
Why?

337
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,060
Because that’s the most dangerous.

338
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,500
The more dangerous it is,
the more of an adrenaline rush you get.

339
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,300
I do?

340
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,260
Gosh, that sounds so cool.

341
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Thanks for the compliment.

342
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,730
Why do you use that smart brain

343
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,600
to hurt people?

344
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't know about my brain.

345
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,730
But you do have nice legs.

346
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,500
Why do you use your nice legs
to chase after something so useless?

347
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,130
You should go now.

348
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,200
There's not much to see.

349
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,900
This isn't your first time
seeing a burn scar.

350
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,800
Uh… I'm sorry.

351
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,030
Jin-kook.
Don't be too harsh on him.

352
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,000
He's also…

353
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,160
He's also what?

354
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,300
He's from Haesan too.

355
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,660
Let's not be mean
to someone from our hometown.

356
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,930
Haesan.

357
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
What is that incredible
piece of evidence?

358
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,530
Incredible evidence?

359
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,830
Right, Lieutenant Tak

360
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,730
told me you found something huge.

361
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,930
What's that?

362
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,360
Ah… well.

363
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,830
It's not really something

364
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,800
incredible or huge.

365
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,630
What's this? What's inside this?

366
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,860
It's…

367
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,800
the dash cam memory card
from Lim Yoo-ri's car.

368
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,360
She threw it out into the bushes.

369
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,330
Lim Yoo-ri?

370
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,500
Yes.

371
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,160
And why is this incredible?

372
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,660
Lim Yoo-ri is not even a culprit.

373
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,660
That case is more important

374
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,160
but she almost hit Jin-kang.

375
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,260
But she still didn't

376
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,600
show any signs of regret.

377
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,900
I understand, but…

378
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,800
I would've let it slide

379
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,530
only if she promised me
she wouldn't do it again

380
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,700
but she was too shameless
and refused to promise…

381
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,600
What's wrong?

382
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,560
Being honest even during moments like that,
that's typical Yoo-ri.

383
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,300
That was why she said…

384
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,160
she couldn't promise?

385
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,300
What promise
are you talking about?

386
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,300
Sir?

387
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,400
Sir.

388
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,830
Cho-rong, get off.

389
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,830
- Now.
- What's going on?

390
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,860
Get out now. I'm in a hurry.

391
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,630
What's wrong with him?

392
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,660
I'm with the police.

393
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,030
Patient Lim Yoo-ri who was here
last Thursday night.

394
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,630
I'd like to see the results
of her blood test again.

395
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,730
One moment please.

(Shinha University Hospital)

398
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,800
We're leaving now to go search
for the missing child.

399
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,130
Join us at Wonyoung-1dong.

400
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,030
- Follow me.
- Good afternoon.

401
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,800
Where are you guys going
as a group?

402
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,260
Hey, Eom Cho-rong!

403
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,600
Where are you going?

404
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,430
That was so disappointing.

405
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,830
That wasn't anything incredible.

406
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,000
Hey.

407
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,730
Sergeant Yoo looked very hard

408
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
to find that,
that's incredible enough.

409
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,030
With his bad eyesight and all.

410
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,100
You should be grateful to him.

411
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,230
- I get that he has bad eyesight, but...
- What?

412
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,360
He only found the dash cam
memory chip

413
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,100
Yoo-ri threw out.
It's not incredible at all.

414
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,800
Lim Yoo-ri, what?

415
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,260
Her dash cam memory chip!

416
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,300
Her dash cam memory chip?

417
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,430
What is it exactly you'd like to

418
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,560
confirm with me?

419
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,730
Here's the results of Lim Yoo-ri's
blood test from that night.

420
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,330
I'd like to find out
how those sleeping pills

421
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,660
are related to this case.

422
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,200
I'm starting to think

423
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,700
she probably can't even remember

424
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,060
what she did that night.

425
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,760
Well, I can't really say…

426
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,430
There are controversies
over zolpidem these days.

427
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,030
In fact, it is the most basic pill

428
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,660
prescribed to patients

429
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,360
who suffer from insomnia.

430
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,230
There shouldn't be a problem
if she took as advised.

431
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,460
The doctor there said
she took about 6 pills.

432
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,730
Is that the proper dose?

433
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,900
Up to around 10 pills
is the proper dose.

434
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,360
- With this number...
- Lim Yoo-ri…

435
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,800
Is she an addict?

436
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,800
As you know,

437
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,430
I can't tell you anything
related to her medical records.

438
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,660
I'm sorry I can't be of any help.

439

With Trauma.

440
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,760
I read your book.

441
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,600
And I'm also aware that
the kid named Soo-jung in chapter 7

442
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,960
is Yoo-ri.

443
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,430
Mr. Kim Moo-young.

444
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,830
It's a pleasure to be
working with you.

445
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,530
Same here.

446
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,300
President Jung from Arts
complimented you a lot.

447
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,100
Why did you move?

448
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,130
Though, it's better for us.

449
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,530
So where did you guys go
to search for the missing kid?

450
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,360
What? Wonyoung Printing?

451
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,230
Okay, I'll be there soon.

452
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,930
Oh my gosh, our land price might fall!

453
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,260
What do we do, if she really jumps.

454
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,930
Are you going to jump?

455
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,260
Play with me.

No, Yoo-ri!

No!

00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,200
Yoo-ri!

462
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,500
Grab my hand!

463
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Yoo-ri!

464
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,500
Please don't!

465
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,030
Oh my god!

466
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,260
What do we do?

467
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,000
You're fine.

468
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,660
You're okay.

Lieutenant Tak, it's me Cho-rong.

471
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,300
She can just keep it simple

472
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,660
- only write the necessary information.
- Okay, thanks.

473
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,730
This is the witness statement form.

474
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,200
You just need to write
when, where, and why it happened.

475
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,660
Don't forget to write that
you won't ever do it again.

476
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,300
Here you are.

477
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
You can do it, right?

478
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,560
Come on.

479
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,960
It's okay. Take your time.

480
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,860
I'm sorry, Jin-kook…

481
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,300
That's okay.

Forget about it

483
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,000
for now and get some sleep.

484
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,130
Hey.

485
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,060
I…

486
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,900
I'm going to come back tomorrow.

487
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,500
You know what I mean?

488
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,630
I'm not going to die.

489

How can you just leave like that?

490
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
How could you do that?

491
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,260
How could you?

492
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,960
What's wrong?

493
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,100
You should have let go!

494
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,430
You held on and fell together?

495
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,660
- Were you really going to die?
- I wasn't going to die.

496
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,200
I fell because I saw
the air mat below.

00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,060
Yeah? Good for you.

498
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,500
You could've been dead
if the air mat was 10 seconds late.

499
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,830
What was I supposed to do then?

500
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,630
Should I just have let the kid go

501
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,430
to survive on my own?

502
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,600
That's why I said good for you!

503
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,100
- I didn’t say anything else.
- Come on, Tak!

504
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,130
Tak! Tak!

505
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,960
Don't even call my name.

506
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,530
I'm never going to see you again.

507
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,130
Come on, Tak.

508
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,930
Tak!

509
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,260
She's pretty when she gets mad.

510
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,330
There.

511
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,760
She gave me such a hard time

512
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,330
asking for your address.

513
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,600
She can't even drink well,

514
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,700
why is she so reckless?

515
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,100
Moo-young.

516
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,200
- Hee-joon.
- What?

517
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,700
Can you get me another
warm wet towel?

518
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,060
Uh? What brings you here?

519
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,130
Give that to me.

520
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,730
Seung-ah called me
but I got here a bit late.

521
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,929
Manager Jin-kang,
you know Baek Seung-ah?

522
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,630
Yes.

523
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,760
Sit.

524
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,600
What's up?
Why did you ask me to come?

525
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,900
Does it taste good?

526
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,160
How's the taste?

527
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,760
Just get to the point.

528
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,730
Love Forever.

529
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,860
It's the name of the beer.
Does it taste like one?

530
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,460
Amber ale. Alcohol content 6.4%.

531
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,300
What else was written?

532
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,000
It's perfect to enjoy
at 7.5 degrees.

533
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,660
- What are you doing?
- I'm reading you the recipe.

534
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,360
Beer for wedding anniversary.

535
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,360
Love Forever.

536
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:53,300
A beer recipe for you
and Seung-ah's wedding.

537
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,600
(Love Forever)
A beer recipe for you
and Seung-ah's wedding.

538
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,900
(From Kim Moo-young)

539
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,400
I understand.

540
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,800
Of course firing Seung-ah's dad
wasn't enough.

541
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,860
But still, you shouldn't have

542
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,660
asked your rival
to create your wedding beer

543
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,830
or fired him because
you got your girlfriend stolen.

544
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,760
Why are you acting so cute
these days?

545
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,060
You definitely look like

546
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,300
you have a lot of
time on your hands.

547
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,800
Kim Moo-young is
even cuter than you.

548
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,430
He brought it himself

549
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,000
to the reception desk
of NJ group's headquarters.

550
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,130
Seung-ah got dumped.

551
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,500
If you still like her,
go and beg her to accept you.

552
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,230
She got dumped?

553
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,660
Is Seung-ah alright?

554
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,600
Yes, I think so.

555
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,300
You look gentle today.

556
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,400
I mean, your eyes look gentle.

557
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,600
It's boring though.

558
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,960
Weren't you glad
to see me earlier?

559
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,300
There you go.
You have that look again.

560
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,600
The look that makes
my heart skip a beat.

561
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,830
It gives me a heart attack.

562
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,000
Shut up and focus on driving.

563
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,100
The light's changed.

564
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,860
You get off and go there.

565
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,900
I'll talk to Seung-ah's mom.

566
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,330
Get out.

567
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,000
I said get out of here.

568
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,330
She'll get mad.

569
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,330
That's why you should get out.

570
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,200
Hurry.

571
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Your daughter is very drunk.

572
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,060
Were you scared?

573
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,160
That she would slap
your face again?

574
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,700
Are you doing this on purpose?

575
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,860
I really don't get it…

576
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,030
What?

577
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,000
What do you mean
I'm doing this on purpose?

578
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,200
You'll be nice in the end.

579
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,730
Why do you have to pretend
to be so mean?

580
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,830
So that is what you call nice?

581
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,960
No?

582
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,260
Then what is it?

583
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,360
How was that being nice?

584
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,300
Sometimes, you force yourself
to do things even if it's annoying.

585
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,600
Sometimes, you get annoyed,
so you don't do it.

586
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,360
Right?

587
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,730
That's a type of being nice.

588
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,700
Hey, step back.

589
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,200
Hey!

590
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,860
Jeez…

591
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,060
I said step back.

592
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,700
We missed a cab because of you.

593
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,060
It's really hard
to get a cab here.

594
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,430
(Civil Affairs Office)

595
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,700
Your renewed license
will be out after 4 days.

596
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,930
Here is your temporary license.

597
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:46,930
(Sergeant Yoo)

598
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,600
Gosh, I must be crazy.

599
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:56,000
He no longer exists
in my life, okay?

600
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,800
Did you look hard for
mom and dad?

601
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,960
We were so worried about you.

602
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,230
I'm so glad to have you back.

603
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:18,760
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

604
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:19,930
Thank you so much.

605
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,500
Min-jae, say thank you.

606
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,730
Thank you.

607
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,660
Ah, missing kid?

608
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,930
I'm so glad we found him.

609
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,260
What would've happened to him
if we didn't find him?

610
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:38,460
Choi Sang-hoon's first verdict
will be out later today.

611
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,560
Did you know…

612
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,100
Who am I talking to?

613
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,260
Goodbye.

614
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,200
Why did you drink so much?

615
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,400
How did I get home last night?

616
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,200
Why do you worry your mom so much?

617
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,660
You said you wouldn't
meet him again.

618
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:33,100
Did he bring me home?

619
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,660
Tak.

620
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,000
I'm sorry.

621
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,160
Please forgive me.

622
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,560
I know you'll forgive me.
I know you already did.

623
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,900
Hey, it's mine.

624
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,900
Excuse me, this guy here wants
his own soju!

625
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,430
- We're paying separately.
- Okay.

626
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,500
Moo-young has a burn scar
on his shoulder.

627
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,230
On his shoulder and arm.

628
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:42,230
Thanks.

629
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,630
- Here you go.
- Am I being…

630
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,700
hypersensitive again?

631
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,300
Of course.

632
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,100
That sounds like nonsense.

633
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,030
Sergeant Yoo,
burn scars are not a big deal!

634
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,700
Everyone could have it!

635
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,060
Right, even Cho-rong's mother.

636
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,360
She burned herself
a couple of days ago.

637
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:06,000
It was his right shoulder

638
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,800
and arm.

639
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,730
I must say you're delusional
not just sensitive.

640
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,500
Which part of the body do
people get burned the most?

641
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,830
Arm, leg, belly
either left or right.

642
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,030
Sergeant Yoo.

643
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,960
What the hell are you thinking?

644
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,100
No way, because of his burn,

645
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,160
you think Kim Moo-young was
the one…

646
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,260
Gosh…

647
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,100
Ah.

648
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,760
Is that why you kept it
from Cho-rong?

649
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,660
That you saw Kim Moo-young
in the footage?

650
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,900
Yeah.

651
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,560
Hey, Sergeant Yoo.

652
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:52,800
Wake up!

653
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,830
You're a policeman.
What do police do?

654
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,100
You catch bad guys no matter what.

655
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,660
Stop thinking stupid
and tell him right now.

656
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,730
That's your job

657
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,760
and the proper manner
towards your partner.

658
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,600
Or do you look down on him
because he's young?

659
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,760
It's not like that.

660
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,660
I think…

661
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:14,200
I got the wrong person.

662
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,330
What?

663
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,860
I have no doubt that
Kim Moo-young is related to this case.

664
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:20,100
I'm sure of it.

665
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,230
But I missed things I shouldn't have

666
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,160
even when I saw it
several times

667
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:27,230
because I was so fixated
on Kim Moo-young.

668
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,500
What do you mean?

669
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,630
Lim Yoo-ri is left-handed.

670
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,630
It's okay.

671
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,030
Jeez, this is bullcrap.

672
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,030
How could Choi Sang-hoon
that bastard be acquitted?

673
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,600
All we need to do is

674
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,760
what the higher-ups order.

675
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,600
Sergeant Yoo.

676
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,560
Should I tell him?

677
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:05,100
Why not?

678
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:10,230
Hey, what are you doing?
Aren't you going to go out?

679
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,400
Hey.

680
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,930
Move your ass! Review Jung Mi-yeon's
case all over again!

681
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,530
Go through the history
of transactions and calls

682
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,000
of Jung Mi-yeon
and Choi Sang-hoon!

683
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,400
Interview the testifiers!
Get out!

684
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,200
CCTV and dash cam footages nearby!

685
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,730
What is going on with you?

686
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,730
- There's some place I need to go.
- Ah…

687
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,500
Sir.

688
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,630
The prosecution has officially
ordered us to reinvestigate,

689
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,360
which is good for us.

690
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,160
We can investigate the case
as much as we want.

691
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,530
But why won't you?

692
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,830
It's not that I won't,

693
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,660
but I can't.

694
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,500
Are you serious?

695
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,260
Sergeant Yoo, wait.

696
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,600
Come on!

697
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:22,100
Yoo-ri…

698
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,500
needs time

699
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,260
and someone
she can completely trust.

700
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,330
Trivial things like

701
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,500
moms looking at babies,
smiling

702
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,560
and appeasing them when they cry

703
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,560
teach them very important things

704
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:40,960
as they grow up.

705
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,460
But Yoo-ri didn't get anything

706
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:45,800
from the very beginning.

707
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,260
Because Yoo-ri's mom has

708
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:49,660
never given her anything.

709
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,160
Kim Moo-young said

710
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,400
you don't know how to lie.

711
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,200
So let me just ask you.

712
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,530
You don't need to answer
today if you don't want to.

713
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,700
I mean, you must answer me

714
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,400
someday,

715
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,430
but just not today.

716
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,960
The thing is…

717
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,800
You couldn't remember

718
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,900
that you hit my sister, right?

719
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,130
You learned it by watching
your dash cam, didn't you?

720
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,830
That's why you said
you wouldn't promise me anything

721
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,860
because you can't.

722
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,860
And another thing is that…

723
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,400
There's one more day

724
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,400
you can't remember, right?

725
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,260
That's not good.

726
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:07,160
What am I supposed to do then?

727
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,530
Then… why don't we do this?

728
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,730
They say crying is good
for your health. You cry here

729
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,430
and I'll get some sunlight here.

730
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,930
Getting sunlight
is good for your health too.

731
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,760
Just cry it out.

732
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,500
Seung-ah.

733
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,500
Get in.

734
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:00,230
Is Seung-ah alright?

735
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,800
Yes, I think so.

736
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,260
You look gentle today.

737
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,530
I mean your eyes look gentle.

738
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,630
It's boring though.

739
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,530
Weren't you glad
to see me earlier?

740
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,360
There you go.
You have that look again.

741
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,830
The look that makes
my heart skip a beat.

742
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,500
- It gives me a heart attack.
- Shut up and focus on driving.

743
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,430
Seung-ah, I understand you're mad.

744
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,700
I'm sure you're mistaken.

745
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,730
But it's not what you think.
He was just joking.

746
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,330
I just told him a few days ago
something that upset…

747
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,630
Do you like Jin-kang?

748
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,060
Yeah.

749
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,100
What about you?

750
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,060
Do you like him too?

751
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:54,630
Seung-ah…

752
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:57,100
Since when?

753
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,300
Why are you running away?

754
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,800
What do you mean?
I'm not running away.

755
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,430
You saved Yoo-ri.

756
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,530
Not really.

757
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,460
Thanks.

758
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,260
Welcome.

759
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,860
Hey, Jin-kook.

760
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,330
What?

761
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,830
Why did you lie to me?

762
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,630
Lie?

763
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,730
- You said you have no cop friends in Haesan.
- What?

764
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:07,060
But you're from Haesan.

765
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:11,360
Are you sure there's not a single cop
you know in Haesan?

766
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:16,030
No.

767
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,460
You must've become
a cop pretty late then.

768
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,500
Right.

769
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,700
Too bad.

770
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,830
(Yoo Jin-kang)

771
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,030
- Yes.
- Where are you now? Meet me now.

772
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,560
Hey, I've waited too long for you.

773
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,660
- What the hell are you?
- What?

774
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,300
Why did you say that to Seung-ah?

775
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,030
Ah, Seung-ah.

776
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:22,930
Hey, Kim Moo-young.

777
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,930
I'm not going to talk about
Seung-ah with you anymore.

778
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,800
Kim Moo-young.

779
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,730
This is my place.

780
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:42,700
On the rooftop.

781
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,700
Eat some cake before you go.
It's my birthday today.

782
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,530
Why did you do that?

783
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,130
It's just my legal birthday.

784
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,560
But it's still only once a year,
so I don't want to spend it alone.

785
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:57,860
Tell me. Why did you do that?

786
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,460
Because it's the truth.

787
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:04,060
I like seeing you.
I don't get bored at all.

788
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,960
I really like it.

789
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:10,200
Do you…

790
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,330
Do you really mean it?

791
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,160
I'm hungry.
You sure you won't eat this?

792
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,630
Okay.
Come by if you change your mind.

793
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,900
You're welcome
until I blow out the candles.

794
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:31,360
Go tell Seung-ah
it isn't like that.

795
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,600
It was just a joke.

796
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,300
Do you know what you've done?

797
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,400
This may all be just
a joke to you, but I…

798
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:45,430
Go and tell her
it's not like that.

799
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,660
Fine.

800
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,300
It wasn't true.

801
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,830
It was just a joke.

802
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,730
I did it because
I loved you so much.

803
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,930
I thought I could forget you
that way.

804
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,300
What are you doing?

805
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,300
Now I know.

806
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,230
Why you're so pitiful.

807
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,460
Yeah?

808
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:37,130
Because you don't have a heart
to start with.

809
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,360
That's why you toy with people
as you please.

810
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,900
You hurt them while playing,
but never feel sorry.

811
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,400
You watch them and be happy
because you win.

812
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,800
Without realizing you're
the pitiful one.

813
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,830
Sorry.

814
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,460
Yoo Jin-kang.

815
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,330
Do you want me to tell you

816
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,460
why you're so furious?

817
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,330
Because you know it so well.

818
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,200
You already knew

819
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,800
what I told Seung-ah

820
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:21,130
wasn't just a joke.

821
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,160
Now tell me.

822
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,860
Haven't you ever thought about me?

823
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:35,930
No.

824
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,230
Haven't you ever missed me?

825
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:40,930
No.

826
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,530
Haven't you ever been happy
when you coincidentally ran into me?

827
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,030
No.

828
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,830
Do you really think

829
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,800
I have no heart?

830
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,730
No.

831
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,930
Okay.

832
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,800
Hey.

833
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,130
Is it more pitiful not
to have a heart in the first place

834
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,930
or to ignore your heart
when you have one?

835
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,500
I'd say having
no heart is less pitiful.

836
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,700
Hey, hey!

837
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:29,330
(Looking for a missing kid)

838
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,800
(He has a severe burn scar
on his right shoulder and arm)

839
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:31,800
(In a Haesan hospital
patient uniform)

840
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:32,630
(Disappeared on Tuesday,
November 9th,1993)

841
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,600
(Disappearance location:
Myungsung University)

842
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,930
(A remake of the Japanese series A Hundred
Million Stars Falling From The Sky)

843
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,800
(Thank you to Actor Yoo Jae-myung
for guest starring)

844
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:07,630
(Hundred Million Stars From The Sky)

845
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,830
Stop hitting him! What are you?
Why are you hitting him?

846
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,360
Why?

847
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,500
- What have you been doing?
- Bad things.

848
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,330
I want to do bad things
when I see you.

849
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,860
What the hell
were you thinking to do

850
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:18,330
with those kinds of people?

851
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,060
Are you worried about me?
You should do it better.

852
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:23,230
- So that you can win.
- So she's your girlfriend?

853
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,160
Yoo Jin-kang.

854
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:25,330
Perfect match.

855
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,360
If you bother him one more time,
I'm going to kill you.

856
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,260
Let go!

857
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,760
I'm not sure
whether it's love or not,

858
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,130
but let's try anyway.

859
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:34,830
Damn it…
