You are just you.

7
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,460
No matter what happens,

8
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,130
you are just you

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,660
for me.

10
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,430
I need a gun.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,760
A gun?

12
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,660
Are you seriously going to
kill someone with this?

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,460
(Episode 14)

14
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,660
You're here.

15
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,260
It seems like you already knew

16
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,000
who I am.

17
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,200
I do.

18
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,060
Kang Sun-ho.

19
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,200
How interesting.

20
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,930
Is that why you hated me so much?

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,900
Calling me the devil
and a murderer?

22
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,230
Are you really going to shoot me?

23
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,860
If so, let's go outside.

24
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,430
You can't do it here.

25
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,160
I said not here!

26
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,829
How do you feel hearing
a gunshot again?

27
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,860
For me, I was able to recall
things I had forgotten.

28
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,460
What are you reminded of
when you hear it?

29
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,930
If you're asking me
if I killed your father…

30
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,660
Right,

31
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,500
I killed him.

32
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,330
Your father, Kang Soon-gu.

33
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,600
Ah.

34
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,200
His name was Kang Soon-gu.

35
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,530
I…

36
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,200
shot him.

37
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,860
Why?

38
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,329
It was a mistake.

39
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,360
No, not that.

40
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,900
Why did you do it?

41
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,900
Tell me.

42
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,130
If you made a mistake,

43
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,430
tell me why and how.

44
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,500
Kang Soon-gu…

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,630
I didn't even know
that was my father's name until now.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,700
I found out through you,
my father's killer.

47
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,560
If you called me

48
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,200
the devil and a murderer,

49
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,130
you should at least
have a reason.

50
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,800
I was so happy
before you showed up.

51
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,360
I remember.

52
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,360
It was a shabby house in the woods,
but we were still happy.

53
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,400
You ruined everything!

54
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,200
My childhood,

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,360
my house,

56
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,560
and my family!

57
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,430
You ruined it all!

58
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,230
That's right.

59
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,159
So why?

60
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,760
Tell me the reason.

61
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,260
If you shoot me,

62
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,330
you'll really become a murderer.

63
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,560
Please don't do that
because of me.

64
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,930
That's ridiculous.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,460
I shouldn't kill you
for my own sake?

66
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,630
For me?

67
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,300
Don't act like
you're worried about me.

68
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,900
Go ahead if you want to shoot me.

69
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,660
But before that,

70
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,960
promise me one thing.

71
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,200
Don't let my Jin-kang…

72
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,960
see it.

73
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
People like you disgust
me the most.

74
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,560
Is he not home?

75
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,900
Gosh, it's cold.

76
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,560
Who is it?

77
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,660
It's me, Tak.

78
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,460
Why won't he open the door?

79
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,430
What took you so long?

80
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,400
Jin-kang told me to eat dinner
with you…

81
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,130
What the hell?

82
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,830
- Let's go inside.
- Uh? Wait, what was that?

83
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,360
It's the smell of gunpowder.

84
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,700
It was a gun, wasn't it?

85
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,360
Oh my gosh…

86
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,660
Stop letting him sway you.

87
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,930
What the hell is all this?

88
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,760
- Let's eat first.
- Alright!

89
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,030
Ma'am! Ah.

90
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,830
What's the menu?

91
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,760
I'm so hungry.

92
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,360
Kang Soon-gu.

(turned out to be
Mr. Kang, a mailman)

108
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,130
He was a murderer…

109
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,130
(According to Haesan Police,
the culprit, Mr. Kang, had been)

110
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,060
(looking for his wife who
took their kids and ran away)

111
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,230
(2 years ago because
she was into a pseudo-religion)

00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,260
(He harbored ill intent
towards her and strangled her)

117
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,600
(And another follower, Mr. Park,
who was reporting to the police…)

118
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,200
He killed my mom…

119
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,000
It was a mistake.

120
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,330
No, not that.

121
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,230
Tell me the reason.

122
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,430
If you made a mistake,

123
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,700
tell me why and how.

124
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,230
I was so happy
before you showed up.

125
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,900
I remember.

126
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,800
It was a shabby house in the woods,
but we were still happy.

127
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,860
But you ruined everything!

128
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,530

and my family!

131
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,030
You ruined it all!

132
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,230
Right.

133
00:14:59,500 --> 00:14:59,530
I'm going to pass on today's
morning workout, sorry.

(Kim Moo-young)

136
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,230
Was this the real reason

137
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,060
you didn't stop me that day?

138
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,560
This is unbelievable…

139
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,800
I thought he was a police officer

140
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,660
but he turned out
to be a murderer?

141
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,930
A murderer who killed his wife…

142
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,700
Drink some.

143
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,530
It's your father's case.

144
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,430
It's something
you couldn't even remember.

145
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,600
It has nothing
to do with you.

146
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,760
I feel so dirty.

147
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,200
If it has nothing to do with me,

148
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,860
why does it feel like

149
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,630
it describes me so well?

150
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,800
Like that's the reason
I'm the way I am now.

151
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,160
Kim Moo-young.

152
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,260
Kim Moo-young.

153
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,000
He was a murderer…

154
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,300
He sounds perfect for me.

155
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,230
Someone told me that

156
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,500
I'm not even a human.
That I'm the devil.

157
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,800
So what he said turned out
to be true after all.

158
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,060
Are you saying that murderous
tendencies are hereditary?

159
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,030
What do you think I am?

160
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,100
I'm just like you.

161
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,230
My father was a murderer too.

162
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,060
The child in chapter 1
of my book,

163
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,100
the murderer's son is me.

164
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,060
That's why I couldn't stop you.

165
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,660
I believed that was
the last chance

166
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,860
I could give to you.

167
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,030
But I regret it now. I was wrong.

168
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,560
I realized it only after
I turned 40

169
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,300
that what my father did
has nothing to do with me.

170
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,900
Moo-young.

171
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,500
The past doesn't define you.

172
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,860
The present

173
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,030
is what proves who you are.

174
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,300
Don't hurt yourself with
something that's not yours.

175
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,800
Hurt?

176
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,600
I don't get hurt.

177
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,130
Whoever your anger is towards,

178
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,500
it will only hurt yourself.

179
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,700
It'll only hurt you

180
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,060
and the people who love you.

181
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,200
- Did you meet him?
- Yes.

182
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,860
Seeing that you're back so quickly,
he must've given in easily.

183
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,760
Right.

184
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,330
What's that?

185
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,800
You were stationed at Haesan Police
Station, right?

186
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,530
The autumn of 1993.

187
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,160
This is the recording.

188
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,160
As expected…
No one can ignore money.

189
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,160
Call him now.

190
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,000
Wow, it's Yoo Jin-kang.

191
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,730
How was your morning workout?

192
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,430
Where did you go?

193
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,230
I went to see Doctor.

194
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,660
I'm hungry.

195
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,730
I'm going to cook ramyun.
Want some?

196
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,830
Something's wrong, right?

197
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
No, nothing.

198
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,230
I'm serious. Nothing's going on.

199
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,860
It seems like
something happened to you.

200
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,760
What's wrong?

201
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,360
Why are you throwing it away?

202
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,530
It's all fake.

203
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,400
It's a stupid story
I made up by myself.

204
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,400
How could that be fake?

205
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,830
Kids can't lie.

206
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,460
I guess I did.

207
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,600
Kim Moo-young.

208
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,430
I want to tell you everything.

209
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,430
I really do, but…

210
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,630
I'm sure

211
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,900
your parents are nice people.

212
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,700
People who gave you that name

213
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,830
must be good people.

214
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,300
Some other time.

215
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,860
I'm hungry.
Let's eat something first.

216
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,030
I'm hungry too.

217
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,360
What shall I do?

218
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,660
I want some egg in it.

219
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,660
Want some too?

220
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,730
You dropped it.

221
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,700
My father killed people.

222
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,060
What?

223
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,900
As many as 3 people…

224
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,730
He murdered them.

225
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,430
He killed people?

226
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,160
Please leave.

227
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,730
Kim Moo-young.

228
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,530
I want to be alone.

229
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,660
I'm asking you.

230
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You don't want me here?

231
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,960
Not now.

232
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,000
I'll keep the drawing.

233
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,500
It's all fake.

234
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,760
It's a stupid story
I made up by myself.

235
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,200
Hey.

236
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,230
Don't be late
for the meeting later.

237
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,900
Alright.

238
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,000
You don't look good.

239
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,330
It doesn’t seem like
you used the gun.

240
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,500
Take it and listen to it.

241
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,860
You'll know once you listen,
but there's nothing new.

242
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:11,430
The youngest officer who worked
at Haesan Police Station is

243
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,100
working at
Wonyoung Police Station now.

244
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,760
Lee Kyung-chul.

245
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:19,030
The captain of Yoo Jin-kook's homicide team.

246
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,160
Dad?

247
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,460
Who's your dad?

248
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,260
My dad.

249
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,400
Are you, by chance…

250
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,430
What's your father's name?

251
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,500
Go away. You don't even
know your father's name.

252
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,660
Go now. The person you're
looking for isn't here.

253
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,860
What's wrong?

254
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,700
I think I know that face.

255
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,100
I'll listen to it.

256
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,900
Do you want me to handle
Yoo Jin-kook for you?

257
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,630
Didn't you get the gun
because of him?

258
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,930
If you couldn't get rid of him
because he's your girlfriend's brother,

259
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,430
I can handle it for you.

260
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,300
If you recklessly mess with him,

261
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,060
I won't stand for it.

262
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,430
You said we're similar.

263
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,400
Then you must know.

264
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,000
That I can't stand anyone who
tries to butt into my game.

265
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,130
Of course, I know.

266
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,830
To be honest, it's so annoying.

267
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,600
Kang Soon-gu was going to
get the death penalty anyway.

268
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,900
It's so annoying that I still remember

269
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,730
Kang Soon-gu, his wife
Lee Mi-young,

270
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,700
the victims Han Jong-soo
and Park Jung-hye,

271
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
I can't forget those names…

272
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,060
Kang Soon-gu, his wife
Lee Mi-young,

273
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,860
the victims…

274
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,560
Lee Mi-young…

275
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,030
The victims Han Jong-soo
and Park Jung-hye,

276
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,160
I can't forget those names…

277
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,800
Yoo Jin-kook, that man…

278
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm sick of him.

279
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,000
Why would he ruin his life
because of that petty stuff?

280
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,630
He just killed a murderer
by mistake!

281
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,860
It was obviously self-defense.

282
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,930
All of us tried to stop him then.

283
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It was dangerous in the mountains.

284
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,760
We told him to wait
for us to arrive.

285
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,000
But he went there alone

286
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,860
saying that things looked serious.

287
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,100
It was pointless.
When he got there,

288
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,100
Lee Mi-young, Park Jung-hye
and Han Jong-soo were already dead.

289
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,060
And then, he met the guy.

290
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,830
Kang Soon-gu was holding a weapon.

291
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,200
Put the hatchet down.

292
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,130
Do you know what the weapon was?

293
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,400
It was a hatchet.

294
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,760
Covered with blood.

295
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,960
We were ordered to bury the case

296
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,700
but Jin-kook said he
couldn't do that.

297
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,460
So our team was shattered
into pieces.

298
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,230
Jin-kook looked for
the murderer's son

299
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,060
like crazy for months!

300
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,530
Jeez.

301
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,360
Come out.

302
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,260
- Kim Moo-young.
- You said not here.

303
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,700
Why were you looking for me?

304
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,000
I killed your father and…

305
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,960
I lost you.

306
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,100
I mean…

307
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,760
Why?

308
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,930
Just like the others, you should've
thought he deserved to die

309
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,030
because he was going to
be sentenced to death anyway.

310
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,830
You should've just thought
of it as a bad mistake.

311
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,500
How did you find out?

312
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,330
Don't look at me like that.

313
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,760
Can't you be honest
like the others?

314
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,130
I was like…

315
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,730
the others.

316
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,600
It was unfair.
Why did that have to happen to me?

317
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,860
He moved first,
so it was self defense…

318
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,260
I know that.

319
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,900
Kang Soon-gu moved first.

320
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,960
But I found out something later.

321
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,430
That you were there.

322
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Kang Soon-gu.

323
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,060
He wasn't trying to
use his weapon.

324
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,160
He was trying to hide it
behind his back.

325
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,800
Because he didn't want
to show it to you.

326
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,730
Right then…

327
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,030
I heard "dad".

328
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,430
I couldn't forget your voice
calling for your father.

329
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,800
No matter how hard I tried
to believe it was unfair,

330
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,730
I couldn't forget

331
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,630
that I killed a person.

332
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,360
I'm sorry.

333
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,900
Even though you were sorry,
you shouldn't have done that.

334
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,830
Because you were looking for me,

335
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,730
I thought my father was
a police officer this whole time.

336
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,130
Thinking it was you
I thought of

337
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,360
every time I missed my dad
and tried to recover my memories,

338
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,800
I can't stand it.

339
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,560
Just because I didn't shoot you,

340
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,530
doesn't mean I've forgiven you.

341
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,400
I'm never going to
forgive you. Ever.

342
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,630
Kim Moo-young.

343
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,760
Your father is at Bongrin Temple.

344
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,430
At Bongrin Temple's main hall.

345
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,930
His death date is…

346
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,760
September 18th
of the lunar calendar,

347
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,300
and November 1st
of the solar calendar.

348
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,330
- But why today?
- What?

349
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,560
Why do you go to a temple
every November 1st?

350
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,500
I don't know.

351
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,960
Why today?

352
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,660
We did it ever
since we lived in Haesan,

353
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,230
so I haven't really
thought about it.

354
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,830
But I guess I just liked it.

355
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,860
Like an annual event for
just me and Jin-kook.

356
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,430
I waited for November 1st

357
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,630
more than my school trips
when I was young.

358
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,530
Please leave.

359
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,260
I want to be alone.

360
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,730
I'm begging you.

361
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,500
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

362
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,360
I woke up for a glass of water.

363
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:12,400
- I should go to bed now.
- Goodnight.

364
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,560
Jin-kang.

365
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,160
I'm planning to visit Haesan tomorrow.

366
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,460
- Haesan?
- That's right.

367
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,600
It's been a while
since I visited mom.

368
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,860
Should I come with you?

369
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,460
No, you should rest at home.

370
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,700
I guess you want to be alone too.

371
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,300
What?

372
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,200
Nothing.

373
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,660
- Goodnight.
- You too.

374
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,160
Hey, Tak.

375
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,460
Have you changed your
door passcode yet?

376
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,560
Oh, I should.

377
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,000
Stop just thinking about it
and do it now.

378
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,860
- Should I go and change it?
- No!

379
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,600
I won't be home today.

380
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,000
Where are you going?

381
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,830
It's funny.

382
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,700
You still think of your mom
when you're troubled

383
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,760
even if you're all grown up.

384
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,300
I can't deny it.

385
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,430
Lately I've been thinking
about her a lot.

386
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,500
You know,

387
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,600
I was a troublemaker
ever since I was this small.

388
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,000
You know those kids

389
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,530
who never listen to their moms
even if they get beaten up.

390
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,460
So mom had to beat me up
a lot when I was young.

391
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,130
Gosh.

392
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,060
I can totally picture that.

393
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,800
Right?

394
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:12,100
Maybe because she got
used to beating me up,

395
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,360
she'd beat me up
even after I turned 20.

396
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,760
Even after I got a job

397
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,730
as a police officer,
in the morning,

398
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,460
she'd slap my back,
telling me to watch out for cars.

399
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,800
When I came back home,
she'd slap my back again

400
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,300
for forgetting to put
my socks in the wash.

401
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,100
But…

402
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,500
She never slapped my back

403
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,400
after that incident.

404
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,660
She was so worried

405
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,700
that something would happen to me.

406
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:52,560
She walked on eggshells
around me.

407
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,630
She was totally fine

408
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,260
then she passed away
in less than 3 years.

409
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,600
When I was lying down
to go to bed last night,

410
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,600
I wished that my mom

411
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:15,160
could slap my back
really hard once again.

412
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,500
And say, "You punk,

413
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,830
get yourself together!"

414
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,630
(Bongrin Temple)

415
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,130
(Missing Kids)

416
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,130
How do they look?

417
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,260
They look so happy.

418
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:50,160
They're all smiling.

419
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,160
Look, there's an angel too.

420
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,000
I always thought my dad
was a policeman.

421
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,060
My father in my imagination

422
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,000
is still looking for me…

423
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,260
(Kang Soon-gu)

424
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,730
Somewhere…
(Kang Soon-gu)

425
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:12,330
Somewhere…

426
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,560
Desperately…

427
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:15,500
For his lost son... me.

428
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,430
(Kang Soon-gu)
For his lost son... me.

429
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,830
(Kang Soon-gu)

430
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,800
(Kang Soon-gu / Lee Mi-young)

431
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,030
(Kang Soon-gu / Lee Mi-young)

432
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,130
So…

433
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,060
I wasn't abandoned.

434
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,200
I was lost.

435
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,260
(Yoo Jin-kang)

436
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,260
(I love you)

437
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,960
Are you really okay with who I am?

438
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,800
Of course.

439
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:54,730
I want to be born again.

440
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,100
Huh?

441
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,800
More.

442
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,830
- Now?
- A little more.

443
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,430
- Now?
- Okay.

444
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,960
All good.

445
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,400
Now we wait 30 minutes.

446
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,760
What's so important about rice?

447
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,660
You said you want
to be born again.

448
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:24,330
So then?

449
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,200
You must live in a warm house.

450
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,030
A warm house smells

451
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,030
like warm rice.

452
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,600
That's super easy.

453
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,100
Right?

454
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,460
Thanks for the meal!

455
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,200
Me too.

456
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,360
What's so funny?

457
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,160
I'm thinking about the first time
I came to this place.

458
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,960
I thought it was really strange.

459
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,830
And this room was just like you.

460
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:37,360
It was so cold and dark.

461
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,630
It insisted it wouldn't stop
anyone from leaving.

462
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,960
It made me lonely
when I looked at it.

463
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,800
I hope there'll be more and
more reasons to call it a home.

464
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,500
If you have a cat,
you'll need to feed it.

465
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,600
If you have flowers,
you'll need to water it.

466
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:03,530
If you have food,
you must eat it before it spoils.

467
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:10,860
I hope everything will
hold onto you tight

468
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:13,730
so you can't go anywhere.

469
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:16,730
I'm not going anywhere.

470
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:20,060
Even if I lose everything and

471
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:23,260
no matter how far away I go,

472
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,360
I'll come back to you.

473
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,400
(The door has opened)

474
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,960
What brings you here at this hour?

475
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,400
I came to return this to you.

476
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,900
You're giving it back to me? Why?

477
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,060
I don't need it anymore.

478
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,630
I used one bullet.

479
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,430
You used it?

480
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,730
There was nothing on the news.

481
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,630
Whatever.

482
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:45,730
Don't you want to hear
about your brother?

483
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,430
You're giving this pretty thing
back to me.

484
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,060
It's a bit disappointing.

485
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,500
Tell me anytime
if you need it back.

486
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:11,100
You look very curious.

487
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,260
What's this?

488
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,360
It's Kang Soon-gu's
registered certificate.

489
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:24,430
I mean it's his family registery.

490
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,230
I know what I'm looking at.

491
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,630
I mean what's all this?

492
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,530
Are you sure this is right?

493
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,100
Yes, there were 2 children

494
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,930
who came to Haesan
Hospital that day.

495
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,730
It turned out there
wasn't a sibling

496
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,760
you were looking for.

497
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:43,930
What do you mean?

498
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,400
I mean, a younger brother.

499
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,560
The girl was adopted by

500
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:51,300
Lee Jung-sil 6 months
after the incident.

501
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,160
Lee Jung-sil?

502
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:55,060
Yoo Jin-kook's mother

503
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:57,300
is Lee Jung-sil.

504
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,100
So the girl is…

505
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,100
Yoo Jin-kang

506
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,830
What do you mean
I don't have a brother?

507
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,930
You really don't know anything,
do you?

508
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,760
You know nothing
about what's really important.

509
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:18,060
Tell me now.

510
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:20,300
I've never seen you this anxious.

511
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,530
Now that I see your face,
I don't want to tell you for free.

512
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:29,130
You should give me something
in return at this point.

513
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,630
Let's talk about the rest here.

514
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,460
Okay?

515
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,230
Okay.

516
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,900
Wait here. I'll go get tickets.

517
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:06,700
Kim Moo-young!

518
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,500
You got them?

519
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,530
Of course I did.

520
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,230
Let's ride this!

521
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,600
No.

522
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,700
I'm not going to ride it.

523
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,400
Oh come on. Seriously?

524
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,960
It's my first time coming to an amusement
park with my boyfriend!

525
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,730
So what?
You should've done it before.

526
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,030
So will you ride it or not?

527
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,300
No.

528
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:33,630
I said I won't.

529
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,900
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't!

530
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,760
What on earth have you done to me?

531
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,700
I don't know.

532
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,930
I can't even believe

533
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,060
I'm on this.

534
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,600
Look at that!

535
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,300
It's strange.

536
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,160
Don't they look like
they're connected?

537
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:15,830
Right.

538
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,800
Looks like a map.

539
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,730
Maybe we ended up here
by following this map.

540
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,000
You've never seen a
burn scar before?

541
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,630
No.

542
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,930
Don't get shocked.
She's the weirdo.

543
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,560
Other women aren't like her.

544
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:13,430
Do you really think
that works on women?

545
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,860
Of course.

546
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:18,200
Oh no, when did this happen?
That must've hurt.

547
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,900
An alien and a reptile.

548
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,530
An alien and a crocodile wallet.

549
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,330
It's boiling.

550
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,130
It's cold. Put some clothes on.

551
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:51,600
- I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it.

552
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,230
It's hot!

553
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,100
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm good.

554
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,630
Let me see.

555
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,160
This won't do.

556
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,060
I'm fine.

557
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,930
The pharmacy's still open.

558
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,900
Here you go.

559
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,930
Thanks.

560
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,230
Dad.

561
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:35,760
Jin-kook said there was a fire.

562
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,360
Don't they look like
they're connected?

563
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:44,800
I'm not his real sister.

564
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,200
You really don't know anything,
do you?

565
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:52,260
You know nothing
about what's really important.

566
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,460
It turns out there was no sibling.

567
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,560
I mean, a younger
brother, at least.

568
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,700
It was a younger sister.

Million Stars Falling From The Sky)
