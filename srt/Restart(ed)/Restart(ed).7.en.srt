00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,150
<i>Do you have an errand to do?</i>

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,280
<i>I'm going to have lunch with Pat.</i>

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,960
<i>I haven't eaten yet.</i>

9
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,630

00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,530

<i>As usual?</i>

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,190
<i>You're interested about U as usual.</i>

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,060
<i>Not about me.</i>

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,410
<i>Can you stop mentioning about U?</i>

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,810
<i>Why? I want to say it.</i>

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,760
<i>U, U, U, U!</i>

17
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,610
<i>I said stop!</i>

18
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,030
<i>You think so too, right?</i>

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,700
<i>U?</i>

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,250
<i>Let's go home.</i>

21
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,460
<i>don't do that to U again.</i>

22
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,120
<i>If you do...</i>

23
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,140
<i>I won't let it slide.</i>

24
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,530
<i>A guy like you?</i>

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,150
<i>What can you do to me?</i>

26
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,650
</i>You'll see.<i>

27
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,650

28

00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,670
<i>You coward.</i>

30
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,810

<i>[Cruel P'Tin]</i>

32
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,080
Or he's really waiting for me.

33
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,690
Should I go?

34
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,180
Fine, I'll go.

35
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,320
P'Tin, why are you 
not going home yet?

36
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,660
You're here, brat?

37
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,000
If I didn't come, will you 
keep waiting for me here?

38
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,270
You're here now, right?

39
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,280
Such a crazy dude.

40
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,380
What do you want exactly
 asking me to come out like this?

41
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,850
You were driving me 
away at first, like a lost dog.

42
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,180
Haven't you experienced the
 sudden feeling of missing someone?

43
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,210
You're a such a playboy.

44
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,180
You have a lot of people to think about.

45
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,250
Why do you have to think of me?

46
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,340
Even though I seem like a playboy, 
I don't have a one-night-stand with everyone.

47
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,490
That's good.

48
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,450
Even though I seem like a slut...

49
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,880
I never had a one-night-stand
 with anyone else.

50
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,790
But why at first...

51
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,320
you were cold at me?

52
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,000
I think important things like this...

53
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,920
probably hard to answer, I guess.

54
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,260
I thought of it as something fun...

55
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,170
and move on.

56
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,850
But who would've thought that it 
turn into something important like this.

57
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,000
To a point of making me missing you.

58
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,890
Such a nice saying...

59
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,490
coming from a playboy.

60
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,700
I don't want to be
 a playboy anymore.

61
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,740
BB.

62
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,460
Wanna be boyfriends?

63
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,270
No.

64
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,150
What the hell?

65
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,510
I saw you blushing and
 I thought you would've agreed.

66
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,760
If you want to be my boyfriend,
 you need to hit on me first.

67
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,440
But we already have sex, 
do I need to flirt again?

68
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,900
That time doesn't count.

69
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,380
Start over.

70
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,960
So, where should I start?

71
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,280
Start from today.

72
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,750
Let me here, pretend to say this...

73
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,900
"BB...

74
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,300
wanna go ona date with me?"

75
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,970
BB...

76
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,950
wanna go on a date with me?

77
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,690
Of course.

78
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,030
But...

79
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,360
It's already late today.

80
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,220
Then, you set a nother date, OK?

81
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,570
OK, sure.

82
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,580
I'll give you a ride home today.

83
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,780
Coward?!

84
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,890
Do you even have
 the right to say that to me?

85
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,360
Your bag.

86
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,300
Thank you.

87
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,390
Focus in class, small kid.

88
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,920
Then, during lunch break...

89
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,210
I'll text you.

90
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,610
Alright, see you.

91
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,460
Bye.

92
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,510
U.

93
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,030
You're awake?

94
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,610
I slept too long?

95
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,760
You're having a fever...

96
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,430
so you sleep for a long time.

97
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,300
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

98
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,290
Not at all, don't stress about it.

99
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,350
This is the school uniform.

100
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,460
You can borrow mine for now.

101
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,350
You haven't change
 clothes since yesterday.

102
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,010
Thank you.

103
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,850
Did somebody
 called me yesterday?

104
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,370
Chin did.

105
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,060
But I told you 
spend the night with me.

106
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,420
Thanks.

107
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,830
Hurry and get dressed 
so we can go to class together.

108
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,260
Always dropped.

109
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,520
It dropped again.

110
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,150
Everyday it 
drops and hasn't stop.

111
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,880
What are you looking for?

112
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,740
My eraser.

113
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,360
Clumsy as always.

114
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,710
Where did you came from?

115
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,220
I'm running from Donut.

116
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,890
Why are you running?

117
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,820
I don't know what's wrong wrong her lately, 
she's been following me like a ghost.

118
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,240
Zo!

119
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,110
Zo!

120
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,090
Zo!

121
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,890
Are you here?

122
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,100
Zo!

123
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,380
Where are you?

124
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,810
Zo!

125
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,890
Zo, where are you?! Zo!

126
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,850
Zo, why are you...

127
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,700
Relax.

128
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,660
Is she gone?

129
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,030
Not yet, she's still here.

130
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,270
Really? What took her?

131
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,350
No need to look for her.

132
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,010
If she left...

133
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,810
I'll tell you.

134
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,420
Really? She hasn't gone yet?

135
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,170
Are you tricking me?

136
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,530
- Zo.
- Zeemai.

137
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,800
You first.

138
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,790
No, you first.

139
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,790
Earlier, you...

140
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,920
I...

141
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,740
I was just shocked
 because of Donut.

142
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,050
Yeah.

143
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,760
It was an accident.

144
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,970
Then...

145
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,630
I have to go now.

146
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,180
Alright.

147
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,310
He's clearly kissed me on purpose.

148
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,410
Why do you have to play
 with my feelings like this?

149
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
U.

150
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,700
How are you feeling?

151
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,580
Feeling better?

152
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,170
I'm OK, better.

153
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,450
Thank you for worrying.

154
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,810
Why thanking me?

155
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,140
I'm happy to do it.

156
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,040
You're too nice to me.

157
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,880
U.

158
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,910
Open the bag and see.

159
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,890
What is this?

160
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,540
Umbrella and medicine.

161
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,870
If you have a fever again...

162
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,280
take those medicine.

163
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,790
And remember to bring
 an umbrella when it rains.

164
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,590
I'm worried.

165
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,920
I'm fine.

166
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,490
If I got sick...

167
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,460
you come and care for me.

168
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,820
If I'm wet...

169
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,270
you will also come to pick
 me up with an umbrella.

170
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,640
Let's go to class.

171
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,700
OK.

172
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,490
I'll text you later.

173
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,170
See you.

174
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,050
Guys.

175
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,170
You're not in class yet, U?

176
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,690
I don't want to see Ai'Chin.

177
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,710
What about you?
 Why aren't you in class?

178
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,890
I don't want to see Zo too.

179
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,060
U, where are you? I'm worried

180
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,480
Answer me

181
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,480
U, where are you? I'm worried

182
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:19,420
Answer me... please?

183
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:19,420
Answer me

184
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:19,420
U, where are you? I'm worried

185
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,970
Chin, is this purse nice?

186
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,380
It's nice.

187
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,650
Take me to buy it this evening.

188
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,880
I'm not free,
 I have something to do.

189
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,500
What is it? Can I come with you?

190
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,460
No.

191
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,870
You can go there with Jian.

192
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,320
I gotta go.

193
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,320
Where is he?

194
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,890
Guys.

195
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,940
Have you seen Ai'U?

196
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,610
I saw him this morning.

197
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,830
Where?

198
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,500
At that building.

199
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,280
OK, thank you.

200
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,320
What's his deal?

201
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,000
How long are you
 gonna silent like this?

202
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,220
We...

203
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,550
how long do we have to
 endure this uncertain feelings?

204
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,550
Until you die.

205
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,070
Your turn.

206
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,190
How long do we have to endure
 those we love toying with our feelings?

207
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,090
Until your stupidity runs out.

208
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,890
If he doesn't have 
any feelings for me...

209
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,970
why is he giving me hope?

210
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,760
Ask him whether you're his
 play thing or a spare part?

211
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,980
If he told me not to go out on 
a dinner with anyone except him...

212
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,290
does this means he likes me?

213
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,620
He's not.

214
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,860
Others were not 
available so he asked you out.

215
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,890
Why ishe making me wait?

216
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,480
You waited for 
him on your own accord.

217
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,980
You knew he probably won't come.

218
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,430
This problem starts...

219
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,200
is because of you.

220
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,280
You love someone 
who doesn't love you.

221
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,440
For you...

222
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,110
Ai'Chin is unclear and confuse.

223
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,430
he wants both guys and girls.

224
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,520
Ask him...

225
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,820
what will he do.

226
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,350
As for you...

227
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,710
you need to be strong
 when liking a handsome guy.

228
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,430
First, you need to 
stop being too lustful.

229
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,060
I better go to my boyfriend. 
I'm sick of you guys.

230
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,970
See you.

231
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,970
Guys, I bought this for you.

232
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,250
Guys.

233
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,560
Do you know where Ano went to?

234
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,700
He didn't answer
 my calls or replied my text.

235
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,520
He didn't even come to school.

236
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,490
Has he replied to you guys?

237
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,550
He didn't even reply to you...

238
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,690
do you think he'll reply to us?

239
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,190
Yeah.

240
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,400
E'B, your friend is missing and 
we've been wondering about him.

241
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,940
What's wrong you aside
 from thinking about some guys?

242
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,490
He asked me to date him.

243
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,270
How can I not shy about it?

244
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,640
E'B!

245
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,870
Don't you think it's too quick?

246
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,210
E'Wa.

247
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,420
And yours wasn't?

248
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,650
Even a 5G internet 
connection can't catch up with you.

249
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,070
You're right.

250
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,420
That's my business.

251
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,000
But you need to help me first.

252
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,040
Let's find Ano, I'm worried.

253
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,280
E'Jeng.

254
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,510
Call Ano for him.

255
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,170
I want to chat with P'Tin.

256
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,150
Fine, I'll call him.

257
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,910
Did he pick up?

258
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,290
Wait.

259
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,950
Did you get through?

260
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,840
Guys...

261
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,640
I can't get through.

262
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,990
Again?

263
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,560
That's alright.

264
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,820
I think I'm gonna
 find him at his house.

265
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,040
Wanna join me?

266
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,760
Yeah, I'll go.

267
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,530
E'B, what about you?

268
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,080
I probably can't today.

269
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,310
I already have a date today.

270
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,550
E'B.

271
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,410
You need to be careful.

272
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,830
Be careful around others.

273
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,450
Be careful anyway.

274
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,290
Yes sir!

275
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,470
I gotta go now.

276
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,560
Bye.

277
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,740
Ano! Are you home?!

278
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,020
Ano!!!

279
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,750
E'No, come down and see us!

280
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,470
Answer my calls!

281
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,380
I'm worried!

282
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,670
Ano, the teacher said 
he'll deduct your points...

283
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,240
if you don't come to school.

284
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,440
Do you want me to help
 you with your homework?

285
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,240
Dude, let's go home.

286
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,770
We'll come again next time.

287
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,370
I guess.

288
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,270
Then, we'll separate here.

289
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,690
I think I'm gonna go see P'Jed.

290
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,150
Be safe.

291
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,500
Bye.

292
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,920
Wa.

293
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,520
Yes?

294
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,270
Something's wrong?

295
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,770
Why do you look sad?

296
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,080
P'Jed.

297
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,770
I don't know what's wrong with Ai'No.

298
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,580
He didn't answer my calls...

299
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,940
and didn't come down 
when I went to his house.

300
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,860
I'm worried.

301
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,260
So...

302
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,680
have you try text him?

303
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,980
He didn't reply. 
I don't what's wrong with him.

304
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,790
Come now, it's gonna be alright.

305
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,590
He'll reply when he cool down.

306
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,380
Really?

307
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,180
Then...

308
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,580
shall have some ice cream?

309
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,330
So you'll feel better.

310
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,870
Sure.

311
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,270
Which restaurant?

312
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,890
Whichever you prefer.

313
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,340
Usual place then?

314
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,170
Let's go.

315
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,150
Hello, Pat?

316
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,850
<i>Hello, U. How are you?
 Feeling better?</i>

317
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,740
I'm better now. Feeling normal now.

318
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,310
<i>Then, that's all.</i>

319
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,580
You called just for that?

320
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,740
<i>I just wanna know
 if you're feeling better.</i>

321
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,090
OK, thanks.

322
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,880
<i>I'll text you when I got home.</i>

323
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,350
OK, sure thing.

324
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,130
Where were you?

325
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,200
You didn't answer my calls.

326
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,310
I should be the one asking, 
don't you think?

327
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,090
Where were you last night?

328
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,520
I...

329
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,660
I went to see Tisa.

330
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,880
You said you'd come...

331
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,990
but you didn't.

332
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,980
I called you...

333
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,360
but you didn't answer.

334
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,340
At least...

335
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,650
if you're thinking about not coming...

336
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,870
you should've told me.

337
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,550
You even had the audacity to ask...

338
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,800
where was I?

339
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,260
U...

340
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,340
calm down and listen.

341
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,280
Calm down?

342
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,740
I wasn't calm enough yesterday?

343
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,700
I've waited for you 3-4 hours.

344
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,730
When it started raining...

345
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,050
I thought you would come.

346
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,200
When it was raining heavily...

347
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,340
I still thought you would come.

348
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,970
Am I not calm enough as it is?!

349
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,050
U, I'm sorry.

350
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,910
Let me go.

351
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,580
U, I'm sorry.

352
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,690
Let me go.

353
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,340
U...

354
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,010
Forget it.

355
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,140
This is not the first time...

356
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,920
that I cried because of you.

357
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,020
U...

358
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,790
I'm sorry.

359
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,650
I won't do this again.

360
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,700
Please believe me.

361
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,420
Please?

362
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,670
Actually you don't
 have to care for me like this.

363
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,590
We're nothing to each other.

364
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,530
Just care about Tisa.

365
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,170
I got myself hurt...

366
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,020
I can heal on my own.

367
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,160
This one, do it like this?

368
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,740
Zeemai

369
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,990
Toughen yourself, 
don't pay attention to him.

370
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,000
But what if Zo so handsome today?

371
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,750
No, no, no.

372
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,170
He's a jerk.

373
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,840
A handsome cheater.

374
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,520
Remember that.

375
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,840
Take a good look at the note.

376
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,190
Enough, let's take a break.

377
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,180
I think I know
 someone who knows how.

378
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,290
I'll be back.

379
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,140
Zeemai.

380
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,750
What's the answer for this?

381
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,700
Do it yourself.

382
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,630
Don't you study?

383
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,520
Zeemai.

384
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,460
Can I sit with you?

385
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,760
The table's full.

386
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,210
What do you mean? 
There's a lot of space.

387
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,660
It's already 
filled with books and bags.

388
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,700
It's full.

389
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,560
Sit somewhere else.

390
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,970
OK.

391
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,170
Zeemai.

392
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,480
Can I borrow your pen?

393
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,840
I only have one.

394
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,020
What the heck?

395
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,650
Chin, what should we have for lunch?

396
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,410
You pick.

397
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,130
How about something sweet?

398
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,560
Up to you.

399
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:19,380
Chin, how long are
 you gonna be like this?

400
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,350
I told you that it's up to you.

401
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,390
What's wrong with you lately?
 Why always moody?

402
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,320
I'm sorry.

403
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,620
I have to go now.

404
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,920
Chin, you're treating me like this again?

405
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,050
I'm so sick of this.

406
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,920
Hello, U.

407
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,880
Wanna go lunch together?

408
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,890
Sure.

409
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,370
I'll come pick you up.

410
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,430
We'll eat something delicious.

411
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,680
Are you having so much fun?

412
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,130
Come on.

413
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,950
Sawasdee kha, kids.

414
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,910
I'm from the Imaginary 
Couple Association.

415
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,940
It's a perfect timing that we got 
to see you pulling each other.

416
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,740
Can I have a brief
 interview with you today?

417
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,090
Please?

418
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,600
Please?

419
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,260
No!

420
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,030
Fine.

421
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,640
If you don't do
 this interview with me...

422
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,340
I'll report to the teacher about 
you two getting into a fight in school.

423
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,720
I advise you to let me interview you.

424
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,060
OK, kids.

425
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,860
I'll give each
 of you a box of snacks.

426
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,020
Then you look at each 
other and feed each other.

427
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,640
I'll take a video of it.

428
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,130
OK?

429
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,080
How lovely.

430
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,810
This one too.

431
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,130
So cute.

432
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,510
Have some, you busybody.

433
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,780
Hurry.

434
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,590
Yeah, that's it.

435
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,160
Look.

436
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,830
Eat a lot.

437
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,700
Coward.

438
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,730
So cute.

439
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,360
So lovely.

440
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,520
OK, kids.
 I'm done with the recording.

441
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,560
I love it.

442
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,930
Thank you so much.

443
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,840
I should go back
 and edit the video later.

444
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,240
It's a very good clips.

445
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,770
Thank you.

446
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,680
Perfect match.

447
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,190
Guys, Ano didn't come
 to school again today.

448
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,920
Will something happen to him?

449
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,920
Did you do something to him?

450
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,640
I only told him that I'm going to
 get serious with P'Jed the other day.

451
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,140
Since then, he hasn't come to school.

452
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,690
Maybe he's sick.

453
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,910
Are you crazy? 
If he is sick, he'd have told us.

454
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,380
You're right.

455
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,200
Come now, he'll call later.

456
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,860
I've been waiting for so long.

457
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,310
E'Jeng, what are you
 looking at? Let me see it too.

458
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,600
E

459
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,070
Where?

460
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,150
Is it beautiful?

461
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,310
Very.

462
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,090
Need to order fast 
or it'll be out of stock.

463
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,620
Really?

464
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,240
Then let me help you.

465
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,950
Because something like this...

466
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,950
must be in our hands.

467
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,580
Here, all done.

468
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,620
E'B.

469
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,470
Thanks, you owe me money.

470
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,140
What for?

471
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,870
For this bracelet, look.

472
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,150
What's that got to do with me?

473
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,650
I only told you that it's beautiful.

474
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,360
I didn't tell you to buy it.

475
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,850
How much is the price?

476
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,690
Just 2900 baht. Look.

477
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,000
2900?!

478
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,150
What bracelet is so expensive?

479
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,870
Don't worry.

480
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,400
I'll give you 15% 
off in my mom's shop.

481
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,800
E'Jeng!

482
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,050
You jerk!

483
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,760
Why did you do this to your friend?

484
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,390
Come now.

485
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,330
Just visit my mom's shop.

486
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,300
No.

487
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,470
15% percent is not enough for me.

488
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,120
It's alright. It's my mom's shop, 
just help me out.

489
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,350
But 2900...

490
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,410
it's almost a month
 of my monthly expenses.

491
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,300
It's my mom's shop.

492
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,440
Mom's shop, 
it's your mother not mine.

493
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,940
It's beautiful, look.

494
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,460
Look, so beautiful.

495
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,560
My mom won't be giving 
me any money anymore.

496
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,210
Why today is so boring?

497
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,260
Hello, Pat.

498
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,590
<i>Hello, U. Where are you?</i>

499
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,220
I'm at Building 2. What's up?

500
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,500
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

501
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,620
Sure, see you.

502
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,330
<i>OK, I'll be there ASAP.</i>

503
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,600
OK.

504
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,880
Hello, what's up?

505
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,340
<i>Where are you?</i>

506
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,950
Why do you wanna know?

507
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,870
<i>Just tell me.</i>

508
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,010
I'm at Building 2.

509
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,690
<i>OK, that's all. I'll come to you.</i>

510
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,940
U.

511
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,280
I'm here.

512
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,720
I bought you an orange juice.

513
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,090
Thank you.

514
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,050
Pat.

515
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,050
I can't open it.

516
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,930
Open it for me.

517
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,350
Come, I'll do it for you.

518
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,690
Thanks.

519
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,550
I bought you a drink.

520
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,580
What's your problem?

521
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,320
A drink.

522
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,230
U.

523
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,690
I bought you a donut.

524
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,190
Thank you.

525
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,310
Dude.

526
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,980
I bought you brownie.

527
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:55,350
I'm not eating it. It's too sticky.

528
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,650
You're still mad at me?
