5
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,500
Sawasdee krub.

6
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,800
It's like how you think.

7
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,160
I raised you...

8
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,280
in hoping that you'll
 continue our family lineage.

9
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,920
And you repay me...

10
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,340
by becoming a twisted gender?

11
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,880
Love is...

12
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,930
regardless of gender.

13
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,030
How's that possible?

14
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,310
When you go for job application...

15
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,980
they'll still see whether
 you're male or female.

16
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,190
They won't accept 
twisted gender people.

17
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,920
They only sees them 
as a joke to the society.

18
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,340
Love can only happen
 between a girl and a boy.

19
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,670
Tootsies, gay and 
queer can't have children!

20
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,740
You have to like girls.

21
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,740
You need to give me grandchildren.

22
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,260
I don't care...

23
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,390
about how your 
twisted gender love is.

24
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,150
Whether it's about
 different gender or not.

25
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,810
I raised you...

26
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,420
so your life is mine.

27
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,950
I will determine it for you!

28
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:23,420
Healthy food for today, 
I prepared wholeheartedly for everyone.

29
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,350
Let's eat, Uncle.

30
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,960
Let's eat.

31
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,530
I forgot...

32
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,550
that U doesn't like vegetables.

33
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,510
I just found out about it myself.

34
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,130
Because Chin...

35
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,570
knows everything about U.

36
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,780
What he likes and
 what he doesn't like.

37
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,730
But when it's about me...

38
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,940
he knows nothing.

39
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,160
It makes me sad.

40
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,240
I forgot.

41
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,070
This is U.

42
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,440
I'm not sure if you 
already know him or not...

43
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,900
that U...

44
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,620
is Chin's roommate.

45
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,740
You said you're living alone.

46
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,290
Dad...

47
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,560
Shut up!

48
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,540
How dare you come live with my son.

49
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,870
Uncle...

50
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,010
I happen to have something to do.

51
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,570
I might have to let you think about...

52
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,050
whether your son...

53
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,370
can do his duty well enough.

54
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,290
I'm not so sure...

55
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,720
what will become of your business.

56
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,950
Please excuse me.

57
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,260
Leave now...

58
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,070
and don't come near my son again!

59
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,340
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

60
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,530
Go!

61
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,560
Ai'Chin!

62
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,210
How dare you lied to me?!

63
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,560
You like him, aren't you?!

64
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,080
Live as a twisted gender!

65
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,710
Use your life with value!

66
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,140
Have a good lineage.

67
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,420
As your father...

68
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,580
your life is mine.

69
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,150
You have to do things...

70
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,810
as I told you!

71
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,660
Don't let me lose my patience...

72
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,760
and leave you...

73
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,690
just like how I left your mother!

74
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,090
Understand?!

75
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,310
Bastard!

76
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,340
E'B.

77
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,790
What's wrong with you?

78
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,390
You've smiling alone
 for quite some time now.

79
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,180
I'm happy...

80
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,810
because P'Tin is taking 
a very good care of me.

81
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,750
Is he really going to leave 
his playboy life behind?

82
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,100
Yeah.

83
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,780
If he went back to his old self
 when before you dated him...

84
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,390
will that be alright?

85
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,370
Playboys are very scary.

86
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,740
I don't know either.

87
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,200
I just know that I love him...

88
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,180
so I can look pass his past...

89
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,060
and do my best for
 the present is good enough.

90
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,340
Whatever is gonna happen...

91
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,080
just let it happen.

92
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,430
If he loves me...

93
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,710
he won't go back to be a playboy.

94
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,500
But if he's going back to it...

95
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,610
I'll let him go.

96
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,920
Because all my time with him...

97
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,760
I've done my best.

98
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,750
You guys too.

99
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,670
You guys need to be
 happy everyday, understand?

100
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,820
Don't worry about me.

101
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,640
I'll definitely be happy.

102
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,100
Right, Ano?

103
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,460
Yeah, you're right.

104
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,500
I'll be happy everyday.

105
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,850
It makes me wanna puke.

106
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,940
I'm going on a date tomorrow.

107
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,410
I just try some out some outfit.

108
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,030
Actually, I'm already handsome...

109
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,170
I can wear any clothes.

110
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:24,540
U, see you tomorrow. Sweet dreams

111
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:24,540
Pat

112
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,230
Pat, I'm sorry for being late.

113
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,260
It's alright.

114
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,390
No matter how long it takes...

115
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,230
I can wait.

116
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,240
Have thought about where
 you're going to take me?

117
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,400
I've thought about it a little.

118
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,220
There's...

119
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:39,100
going for lunch, watch movie, listen to
 music, go to a cafe, take photos...

120
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,140
breathe in fresh air...

121
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,190
enjoy the environment, see the scenery, 
sitting and chilling, roof-top dining.

122
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,830
Or play golf?

123
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,070
Shall we have lunch?

124
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,020
OK.

125
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,270
Sure.

126
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,470
Shall we?

127
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,600
OK.

128
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,610
U...

129
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,330
what should we have?

130
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,520
You order, I'm fine with anything.

131
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,200
Then I'll order for you.

132
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,500
Nong.

133
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,260
I'll have...

134
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,750
1 friend chicken...

135
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,850
and...

136
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,960
1 fried pork with kimchi.

137
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,780
Thank you.

138
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,100
Just a sec.

139
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,060
Eat a lot.

140
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,920
Thank you.

141
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,310
Are you alright?

142
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,900
Why do you seem spacing out?

143
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,250
Nothing.

144
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,650
Or...

145
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,480
you're afraid of getting fat?

146
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,770
I'll order some light food, OK?

147
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,280
Nong, can I have one box of snacks?

148
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,590
Wait a moment.

149
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,170
Thanks.

150
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,070
Minced fish.

151
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,830
You won't get fat for sure.

152
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,100
Thank you.

153
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,790
Eat a lot.

154
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,550
I'm hungry, P'Jed.

155
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,270
We'll order something.

156
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,310
- Sawasdee krub.
- What do you want to eat?

157
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,740
I'll have...

158
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,370
a vanilla ice cream.

159
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,080
Alright.

160
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,400
I'll have 2 vanilla ice cream.

161
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,910
Sure.

162
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,720
Wait a moment.

163
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,050
Sure.

164
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,210
The drinks look delicious too but...

165
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,600
maybe we can have
 it at another restaurant.

166
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,390
Or should we go
 to another restaurant?

167
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,530
So we can look some other menu.

168
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,960
OK.

169
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,840
No wonder...

170
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,290
that they're being very 
protective behind the scene.

171
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,470
Clearly they're dating 
without telling his friends.

172
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,890
You'll be sorry, Ai'Glasses!

173
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,230
Who are you talking to?

174
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,780
I just happened to
 see someone I knew.

175
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,570
You got me shocked.

176
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,850
Thought you 
were talking to someone.

177
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,670
Let's get some drinks now.

178
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,930
Let's go over there.

179
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,600
Alright.

180
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,090
- Hurry up.
- OK.

181
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,370
Are you P'Zo?

182
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,290
Can I have a photo with you?

183
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,110
Then...

184
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,620
can you take it with my boyfriend too?

185
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,030
I'm here with my boyfriend.

186
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,050
Sure thing, I was just 
wondering about that.

187
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,710
Thank you.

188
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,670
U.

189
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,780
Thank you, Pat.

190
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,680
U.

191
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,570
- Will you...
- I'll go up to my room now.

192
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,280
See you later.

193
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,650
Go home safely.

194
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,390
Will you be my boyfriend?

195
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,780
Wanna have lunch?

196
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,980
Of course.

197
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,580
Let's eat at the canteen.

198
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,600
What happened to you?

199
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,610
U, are you alright?

200
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,750
Get up.

201
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,720
What happened to your face?

202
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,980
I'm worried.

203
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,830
I've tried my best to warn you.

204
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,230
I told you not to 
make me lose my patience.

205
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,530
Seeing your father this angry...

206
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,020
It's clear to me now...

207
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,280
what will your father 
do to that bitch U.

208
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,120
I'm scare.

209
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,940
But I'm not afraid of you.

210
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,140
You should worried 
about you with father...

211
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,180
on how you'd do next...

212
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,680
if my dad got his share back.

213
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,760
U.

214
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,350
I'm here.

215
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,460
U...

216
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,070
is there something wrong?

217
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,770
You look unwell.

218
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,840
No.

219
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,550
It's nothing, let's go.

220
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,650
You, come here.

221
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,930
Come here!

222
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,410
U, are you alright?

223
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,040
Pat...

224
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,450
I'll be right back.

225
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,800
Pat.

226
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,100
Pat!

227
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,530
Just wait here.

228
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,850
Let him clear things up.

229
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,610
Everything will be over today.

230
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,990
Trust me.

231
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm worry about U.

232
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,660
Just wait here.

233
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,890
I want U to get this thing over with.

234
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,530
Come on.

235
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,860
Come on.

236
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,960
What's wrong with you?!

237
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,220
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

238
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,980
When will stop doing
 shitty things to others?!

239
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,370
What kind of inferiority 
complex are you doing there?

240
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,220
It doesn't give you the 
reason to hurt others.

241
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,770
I'm going to ask you one last time.

242
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,500
Do you really like my friend?

243
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,950
I love him.

244
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,210
I really love him.

245
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,450
Can you punch me? You can
 punch me to death if you want.

246
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,120
I really can't stand it anymore.

247
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,340
Please.

248
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,690
I don't know what to do anymore.

249
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,140
Right now,
 my dad is forcing to be with Tisa.

250
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,640
If I don't do it, 
he will cut ties with me.

251
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,080
Now I dare not tell 
him that I am not with Tisa.

252
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,880
Because I want him to get over me.

253
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,320
So he won't have to endure 
with someone like me, get it?

254
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,810
But even so...

255
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,800
I still can't do it.

256
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,040
I still want to be with him.

257
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,000
I want to see him every morning.

258
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,770
I want to always talk to him.

259
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,640
I want to see him smile everyday.

260
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,800
I really hated myself, you know?

261
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,780
I hate myself for not telling 
my dad how much I love him.

262
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,870
I'm scare.

263
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,640
I'm really not ready to lose him.

264
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,100
Then prove it.

265
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,990
That what you said...

266
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,240
is true.

267
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,730
Let me see...

268
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,520
let U sees...

269
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,350
that you're just say it as an excuse.

270
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:45,690
<i>♫ Let's start over for I've 
previously always disappointed you ♫</i>

271
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:55,330

Calm down.

285

Where were you, Ai'Jed?

286
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,230
Let them be alone for awhile.

287
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,900
I can't wait any longer.

288
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,420
Pat!

289
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,620
Come on, let's go home.

290
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,490
What about U?

291
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,940
Come now, let's go home.

292
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:12,560
<i>♫ Because today I just understand how it is without you ♫</i>

293

307
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,750
U?

308
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,470
U, wake up.

309
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,190
Are you alright?

310
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,020
I was probably tired and fell asleep.

311
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,510
So...

312
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,530
where's Ai'Chin?

313
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,980
He's been gone for some time now.

314
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,770
Come on.

315
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,470
Let's go home.

316
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,970
U...

317
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,210
Rest a lot.

318
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,940
And...

319
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,400
don't think too much.

320
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,090
I'm worry too much about you.

321
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,920
Thanks, Pat.

322
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,710
I'm sorry too...

323
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,580
that you have to face
 that unwanted situation.

324
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,810
It's alright.

325
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,030
It's enough that
 nothing happens to you.

326
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,290
Get home safely.

327
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,580
Thank you.

328
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,590
Thank you for everything.

329
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,100
Rest, OK?

330
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,200
Hello.

331
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,780
I need your help.

332
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:29,960
<i>What now?</i>

333
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,670
Can you give me a
 ride to Ai'Chin's house?

334
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,380
<i>You've made your decision?</i>

335
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,910
Yes.

336
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,550
Hurry up.

337
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,340
Thank you so much.

338
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,300
Dad.

339
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,930
I don't want to date Tisa.

340
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,900
What are you thinking of doing?

341
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,000
Can you stop destroying my life?

342
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,370
I don't need your business.

343
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,100
I don't need your money.

344
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,370
I don't need anything from you.

345
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,390
I only ask one thing.

346
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,600
If you still love me...

347
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,580
can you let me go?

348
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,740
When will stop being stupid?

349
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,120
Life as a twisted
 gender won't get you fed.

350
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,700
You must marry a woman...

351
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,260
so you can have kids.

352
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,540
You must marry Tisa!

353
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,480
You must give me grandchildren!

354
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,610
Do you know?

355
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,260
If you have a child...

356
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,940
you can inherit my property.

357
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,800
You'll inherit my company!

358
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,170
And Tisa's too.

359
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,280
Your life...

360
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,760
is business to me.

361
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,770
Is that all my value is?!

362
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:33,090
Yes.

363
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,880
Having a child is like doing business.

364
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,240
I'm an investor.

365
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,850
An investor must
 be able to produce profit.

366
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,450
You have to do what I want.

367
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:52,340
That is your duty.

368
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,430
What about you?

369
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,100
Have you done it good enough?

370
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,650
Ai'Chin.

371
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:06,140
You dare talk back
 at me because of him?

372
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,830
You see him 
being better than me?!

373
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:12,250
Yes.

374
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,220
I love Ai'U.

375
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,560
And my love...

376
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:21,650
is more valuable
 than your business.

377
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,030
Think about it.

378
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,270
Your life...

379
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,980
who else is left...

380
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,260
aside from me?

381
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,750
I still love you.

382
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,110
But what about you?!

383
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,420
Have you ever love me?!

384
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,530
You only talk about money, 
money and money!

385
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,160
Have you ever care about me?!

386
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,530
Ai'Chin!

387
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,460
Dude.

388
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,010
Uncle...

389
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,750
it's all my fault.

390
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,170
Go home.

391
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,450
I was the one who
 forced him to talk to you.

392
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,270
I was the one who like Chin.

393
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:24,330
I was the one who love Chin.

394
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,070
Chin didn't do anything wrong.

395
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,710
Don't beat him up.

396
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,400
Fine.

397
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,260
You love my son so much, right?

398
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,480
Will you die for him?

399
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,370
My son won't be like
 this if it weren't for you!

400
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,850
Right?!

401
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,120
Dad, that enough!

402
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,830
- Tell me!
- Dad, enough!

403
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,390
Right?!

404
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,620
U, don't do this.

405
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,820
Say it!

406
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,960
You twisted gender people...

407
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,100
made my son give
 up his possession...

408
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,300
leave the business...

409
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,250
the money...

410
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,790
and leave everything 
in my life, is that it?!

411
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,420
This love of yours!

412
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,170
You won't survived!

413
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:13,460
Don't think that 
I would let you go that easily.

414
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:16,360
U, that's enough.

415
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,360
You turned my son into this.

416
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:19,070
U...

417
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,610
Your life...

418
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,280
won't have a future!

419
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,710
I'm sorry.

420
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,380
It's alright.

421
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,740
We'll get through this together.

422
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:06,320
<i>♫ Let's start over for I've
 previously always disappointed you ♫</i>

423
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:10,800
<i>♫ I'm sorry that I made you cried ♫</i>

424
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:15,960
<i>♫ Because I've failed ♫</i>

425
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:24,340
<i>♫ I've been confused and not sure how much I love you ♫</i>

426
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:34,500
<i>♫ I just realized it the day you disappeared,
 I'd like for a new love ♫</i>

427
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,710
<i>♫ Do you still remember the day we hold hands? ♫</i>

428
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:43,390
<i>♫ Do you remember the night I used to hug you? ♫</i>
