5
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,950
So handsome.

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,670
Thief!

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,100
Thief!

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,400
Hey.

9
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,480
When are you gonna
 stop me worrying for you?

10
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,820
Why are you walking home alone?

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,220
It's more economical.

12
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,760
Economical but very dangerous.

13
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,210
How do you know I'm here?

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,300
I saw you were peeking outside the
 restaurant for some time now.

15
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,820
So, how's your date today?

16
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,380
It's boring as usual.

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,200
Always boring...

18
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,990
don't you have anything you like?

19
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,250
I don't know.

20
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,000
What about you?

21
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,700
You don't want 
to go for a date?

22
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,080
No one likes me.

23
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,250
Is it because of me?

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,650
Are you into me?

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,900
Even though you 
saw how playboy I am?

26
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,260
I'm gonna go home now.

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,020
Thank you, see you later.

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,450
I already like you.

29
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,010
I still like you no
 matter how playboy you are.

30
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,490
Shit, I'm allergic to cat.

31
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm screwed.

33
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,530
No. 5...

34
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,680
Act like you like the same things they did.

35
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,140
Act like you're aware what they like and...

36
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,600
"Hey, I like that too".

37
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,490
This method makes them feel
 you have a common interest with him.

38
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,420
They'll open their 
heart to you unconsciously.

39
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,590
Do we have to do to that extend?

40
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,210
I can't go back on this.

41
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,110
If I go on, I can't take it.

42
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,210
I can't breathe. I'm dead.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,780
Cats like it when you do it like this.

44
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,170
I'm fucked.

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,030
Do you like it?

46
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,050
Whatever.

47
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,330
Just go with it.

48
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,130
Antihistamines can help me.

49
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,810
I like it.

50
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,320
Zeemai.

51
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,840
Wake up.

52
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,660
It's late.

53
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,910
What time is it?

54
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,510
It's 7 o'clock.

55
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,270
I'm still sleepy.

56
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,160
I was studying until late last night.

57
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,090
Did you sleep well last night?

58
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,210
Did you sleep well?

59
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,550
This dream again.

60
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,340
I'm shy Ai'Jao Zo.
<i>[ "Ai'Jao" is an expression 
used on people who are cute ]</i>

61
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,100
Probably I was to
 shy that I wet my bed.

62
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,290
I'm gonna shower and tell Yu.

63
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,590
I'm here.

64
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,480
Why do you wear short pants?

65
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,090
What's wrong with that?

66
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,370
It's short.

67
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,480
Why are you so serious about it?

68
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,990
I don't want people to 
look at you in a weird way.

69
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,270
Next time, I won't wear them again. OK?

70
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,290
You can't go back on your words.

71
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,310
I know, I won't wear them next time.

72
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,700
Where will we go next?

73
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,300
Have you look at the
 tasks assigned by the professor?

74
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,480
I've listed them down.

75
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,540
Take a look. Is it good?

76
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,800
Yeah.

77
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,840
So, is there anything to modify?

78
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,800
Let's wait for Ai'Yu and Ai'Chin. 
Then, we'll look at this together.

79
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,980
This dance looks interesting.

80
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,550
Yu and Chin are here!

81
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,160
What should we do today?

82
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,790
Did the professor assigned us any task?

83
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,970
The professor asked us to do a play...

84
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,940
and to include a dance.

85
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,260
Before you came, Tisa suggested 
that we do Beauty and the Beast.

86
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,360
Take a look.

87
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,710
Of course, the Beauty will be me.

88
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,580
So, who will be the Beast?

89
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,250
You, Ai'Chin.

90
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,420
Yes, you.

91
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,830
I can't dance.

92
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,580
That's alright.

93
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,340
You can do it after practice.

94
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,580
Tisa is good at it. 
She can help you.

95
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,930
Ai'Yu, no.

96
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,610
Come on, dude.

97
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,860
This is a group task.

98
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,970
You can do it. Trust me.

99
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,940
Yu, persuade him.

100
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,480
OK!

101
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,500
OK, so me, 
Yu and Jet will write the script.

102
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,130
As for you two, 
go and practice dancing moves.

103
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,830
OK?

104
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:27,830
OK.

105
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,090
Let's go, Chin.

106
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,360
Bye.

107
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,810
Come on, let's write the script.

108
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,790
Have you watched 
Beauty and the Beast?

109
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,190
It's been so long.

110
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,520
Haven't watch it for so long.

111
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,610
What's the characters?

112
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,700
Zeemai.

113
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,830
Do you think Tisa 
and Ai'Chin can dance?

114
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,580
Not this one. Left one.

115
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,730
They can. Tisa is amazing at, 
so Chin will be able to do it.

116
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,470
Stop talking.

117
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,970
Always bullying me.

118
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,720
Do your work.

119
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,550
Don't you think this is weird, Yu?

120
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,070
Yu?

121
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,040
What's the matter? 
You don't seem focus on the work.

122
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,590
Nothing.

123
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,050
Ai'Chin seems like
 a quiet person before, right?

124
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,310
Look at him now.

125
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,320
Looks jealous?

126
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,980
What jealous? I'm not.

127
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,150
Nonsense.

128
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,750
Do your work.

129
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,850
Yu.

130
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,750
Let's go get 
some snacks together.

131
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,370
Sure.

132
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,150
Jed, I'll leave this to you. 
I'm gonna buy some drinks.

133
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,290
Yeah.

134
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,820
Why is it so long?

135
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,280
So many people today.

136
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,480
It's gonna take a long time.

137
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,760
I'm gonna eat that.

138
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,670
What else to eat?

139
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,220
Go first.

140
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,160
Thank you.

141
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,420
You can go first.

142
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,790
Will that be OK?

143
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,580
Very.

144
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,870
What?

145
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,670
So handsome.

146
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,150
Please.

147
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,860
After queuing for so long,
 how can you let others go first?

148
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,680
Go first.

149
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,540
Thank you.

150
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,630
What will you have,
 handsome boy?

151
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,740
I'll have pork fried rice.

152
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,050
I'll give you more.

153
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,330
Auntie, you didn't give us more.

154
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,190
Take it home, handsome boy.

155
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,460
Thank you.

156
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,260
I'm sorry,
 I was talking while walking.

157
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,900
I didn't mean it.

158
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,780
Your shirt got spilled all over.

159
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,470
It's alright.

160
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,790
It'll be gone once I wash it.

161
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,480
I feel bad.

162
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,740
How about this?

163
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,430
I'll wash it for you.

164
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,430
You'd do that?

165
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,560
Yes.

166
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,980
Just a sec.

167
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:46,860
What?

168
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,440
Focus.

169
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,520
Give me your number.

170
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,110
I'll call you when it's done.

171
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,790
Then I'll give it to you.

172
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,050
Sure thing.

173
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,580
Give me your phone.

174
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,530
If  you feel guilty...

175
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,620
aside from washing my shirt...

176
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,000
will you have
 lunch with me next time?

177
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,170
Certainly.

178
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,810
I can do that.

179
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,810
I have to go now.

180
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,650
See you later.

181
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,150
What took them so long?

182
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,960
What happened to your shirt?

183
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,100
I wasn't looking when walking.

184
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,750
I have to go back to the dorm.

185
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,710
Tell Ai'Chin that
 I'll see him at the dorm.

186
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,840
Alright, I'm coming with you.

187
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,600
I want to go to the cafe.

188
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,560
I want to have a cup of coffee.

189
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,740
Anyway...

190
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,640
I leave to you to do the rest.

191
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,520
Sure, I'll take care of the rest.

192
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,440
Let's go, Yu.

193
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,230
What are you spacing out about?

194
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,370
Why aren't you 
wiping off your wet hair?

195
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,300
Chin...

196
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,050
You're doing this...

197
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,730
are you not that I 
might have feelings for you?

198
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,760
Umm, I...

199
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,500
like...

200
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,940
How long have you been awake??

201
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,880
A while ago.

202
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,480
Last night...

203
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,410
did you sleep well?

204
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,400
Like any other nights.

205
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,270
Guys!

206
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,360
We got an A in our creative class.

207
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,980
So cool.

208
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,910
It's just the ordinary.

209
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,300
Our team worked so hard.

210
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,690
Am I right, Ai'Chin?

211
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,430
Yu!

212
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,480
We forgot to hand in 
the assignment to Professor Pad.

213
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,670
Shit!

214
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,680
I'll go hand it in.

215
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,300
Ai'Zeemai, hurry. Ai'Jed, you too.

216
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,700
Hello.

217
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,920
<i>Where are you? Wanna grab lunch?</i>

218
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,420
I'll be there later.

219
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,370
I was looking for Professor Pad 
all over the campus. I'm so tired.

220
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,100
<i>Then, I'll buy a meal for you.</i>

221
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,900
That's alright, I'll be late.

222
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,120
Eat first.
 I'll see you back at the dorm.

223
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,130
<i>Alright. Hurry up.</i>

224
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,870
Yeah, OK.

225
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,140
So tired.

226
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,330
I'm hungry too.

227
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,230
We meet again.

228
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,340
What's up, Mr. Spilled Shirt.

229
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,120
My name is Pat, not Spilled Shirt.

230
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,040
There are too many
 people at the campus.

231
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,410
I'll call you this way. It's easier.

232
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,470
I don't even know your name.

233
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,130
Yu, my name is Yu.

234
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,270
Or you can call me YuYa.

235
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,850
YuYa?

236
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,460
What does that mean?

237
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,910
YuYa...

238
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,030
it's like Yayee.
<i>[ He's referring to Yayee from Bnk48 ]</i>

239
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,270
I only joke a little.

240
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,860
That got you shocked?

241
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,300
No.

242
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,470
So, where are you going? 
You look tired.

243
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,260
I was handing assignments 
to the professors all day.

244
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,960
But it's all done. 
I'm on my way to my dorm.

245
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,000
Where is it?

246
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,570
Just in front of the campus.

247
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,690
Do you want me to walk with you?

248
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,980
That's fine,
 no need to burden yourself.

249
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,020
I have to go that way too.

250
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,500
For what?

251
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,890
I'm going to buy
 a vinegar for my mom.

252
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,690
There's a shop 
that sells vinegar there?

253
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,880
There is.

254
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,620
It's around there.

255
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,120
You never noticed.

256
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,790
Really?

257
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,620
About your spilled shirt...

258
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,250
I've sent it to wash.

259
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,070
After it's done, I'll call you.

260
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,470
Sure thing.

261
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,810
I'm not in a hurry.

262
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,230
Not hurry?

263
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,670
Then I'll call you next month.

264
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,940
I only have 3 shirts.

265
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,090
I'm kidding.

266
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,780
Normally, what do you like to eat?

267
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,800
I like crispy pork basil.

268
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,350
Crispy pork basil at 
my neighborhood is delicious.

269
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,260
I like to have it with fried egg.

270
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,120
Fried eggs there are good too.

271
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,930
Something on your hair.

272
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,620
A leaf stuck on your hair.

273
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,150
Since when?

274
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,950
Where have you
 been took you so long?

275
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,220
I was turning in 
assignments to the professors all day.

276
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,840
Freaking tired now.

277
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,150
This kind of thing...

278
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,190
next time, ask me.

279
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,170
Normally, 
I would go send them with you.

280
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,870
This time, 
with whom did you go with?

281
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,730
Tisa?

282
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,310
This is Pat.

283
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,930
A friend from a different faculty.

284
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,620
He wants to buy 
vinegar near the dorm.

285
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,750
So he was walking 
with me to the dorm.

286
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,000
Guys!

287
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,180
I'm thirsty.

288
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,790
Which bottle should I choose?

289
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,360
I'm thirsty too.

290
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,790
You take this red soda.

291
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,900
Thanks...

292
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,600
Ai'Pat.

293
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,900
What are you doing?

294
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,470
Didn't you say 
you were tired just now?

295
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,790
I'll carry you back to the dorm.

296
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,370
Did you got possessed by a ghost?

297
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,010
Hurry up.

298
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:00,080
I have to go now, Pat.

299
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,720
See you later.

300
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,130
See you.

301
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,860
My heart is beating so fast.

302
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,010
Is Chin gonna know?

303
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,810
Americano is ready.

304
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,490
Enjoy your drink.

305
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,900
Ai'No.

306
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,550
You're doing fine at home.

307
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,490
Why do you want to work?

308
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,330
It's boring.

309
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,440
It's better to work with you.

310
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,220
It won't be lonely too.

311
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,890
What about him?
 What is he doing here?

312
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,660
It's Arno here.

313
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,120
He said if i work here, 
I get to drink free pink milk everyday.

314
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,830
Where is the free pink milk?

315
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,810
All I see are coffee, coffee...

316
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,230
and coffee.

317
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,370
Coffee is good too.

318
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,760
Then focus on your job.

319
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,010
It's 100 baht.

320
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,690
Here's your receipt.

321
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,550
Wait at the table for a moment.

322
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,550
Sawasdee krub.

323
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,830
I'll have one hot vanilla latte.

324
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,050
One cup of hot vanilla latte.

325
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,580
It's 100 baht.

326
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,720
Mr. customer?

327
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,980
Mr. customer?

328
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,430
- It's 100 baht.
- Here you go.

329
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,650
Here's your receipt.

330
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,500
So, what day will you come to work?

331
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,500
I'll work on Monday, 
Wednesday and Friday.

332
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,790
OK.

333
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,330
I'll...

334
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,850
see you at the table.

335
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,630
OK, wait a moment at the table.

336
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,800
Alright.

337
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,910
Mr. customer.

338
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,720
Do you want to 
order one more cup?

339
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,100
So you can stare
 for another 10 minutes.

340
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,110
One americano.

341
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,230
Certainly.

342
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,530
E'Wa

343
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,420
That guy just 
ordered another cup.

344
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,320
Give this coupon to him.

345
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,620
- Me?
- Yes.

346
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,300
Why?

347
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,480
Look, he ordered so many.

348
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,520
Alright, alright, alright.

349
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,550
This is a coupon 
for collecting points.

350
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,810
If you buy another 2 cups, 
you'll get free 1 cup.

351
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:55,090
I've been siting here so
 long and I can't find my phone.

352
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,940
Can I borrow your phone.

353
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,130
Phone?

354
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,510
Certainly.

355
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,800
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

356
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,330
It seems I have found my phone.

357
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,910
But...

358
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,440
this is my phone number.

359
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,650
I haven't call it yet.

360
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,830
That means I have to call?

361
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,770
That's your right.

362
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:46,160
OK, I'm gonna get back to my work.

363
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,260
I'll be seeing you around.

364
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,300
You...

365
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,060
have to be careful.

366
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,430
As for you, Mr. customer...

367
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,510
if you finished your coffee...

368
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,500
go home.

369
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,020
It's alright, dude.

370
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,340
I'm OK.

371
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,010
Get back to work.

372
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,900
Excuse me, 
I'm gonna get back to work.

373
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,720
Sure, see you.

374
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,020
Krub.

375
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,920
What's up?
 Are you looking for me?

376
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,220
OK.

377
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,520
I'm now at...

378
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,490
the faculty's library.

379
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,130
Yes.

380
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,670
OK, see you soon.

381
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,980
Dude.

382
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,380
I think I like Tisa.

383
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,810
Help me hit on her, please.

384
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,200
Please.

385
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,610
Of course.

386
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,400
Chin, what are you doing?

387
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,360
Nothing. I was waiting for you.

388
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,180
Really?

389
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,670
What about Yu and Jed?

390
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,420
Let's buy some snacks with me.

391
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,020
I'm hungry.

392
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,220
You're not full yet?

393
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,900
What's wrong?

394
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,550
I don't know.

395
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,870
What's the rush?

396
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,260
Have a sit.

397
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,260
Have you eaten?

398
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,120
Not yet.

399
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,890
Jed.

400
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,350
What is it?

401
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,550
Do you think people can love each other
 but aren't sure about their relationship?

402
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,210
There's no such thing.

403
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,740
It's more like they don't love you.

404
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,640
So, if they don't love me...

405
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,450
then why are they
 treating me like a lover?

406
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,340
They're just lonely.

407
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,970
When they meet the right one, 
they'll go for it.

408
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,760
Is it that easy?

409
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,750
It's not hard.

410
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,910
Our hearts changes so fast.

411
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,220
Damn, how cruel.

412
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,590
Ai'Yu.

413
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:00,350
Do you have anything to tell me?

414
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,660
You know, right?

415
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,780
That I'm worried about you.

416
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,600
I'm waiting to
 hear from you everyday.

417
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,730
When will you tell me?

418
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,600
I think...

419
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,130
I like Ai'Chin.

420
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,380
Then why are you 
going to help him flirt Tisa?

421
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,710
Why are you doing this to yourself?

422
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,860
Because I...

423
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,570
I want him to be by my side.

424
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,060
Come now.

425
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,390
Though it's painful...

426
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,780
I think it will end eventually.

427
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,780
I'm sorry, Yu.

428
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,600
What's wrong with you?
 You're spacing out.

429
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,080
Nothing.

430
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,690
Tisa asked me to go for dinner.

431
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,210
Then, I'll go for a dinner with Zeemai.

432
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,400
We want to have a BBQ buffet.

433
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,750
You do?

434
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,560
Why didn't you invite me?
 I'll come with.

435
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,050
That's alright.

436
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,750
Just go with Tisa.

437
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,110
Tisa doesn't eat BBQ buffet, 
she's on a diet.

438
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,510
That's true.

439
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,230
I have to go now.

440
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,970
So tired.

441
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,980
- Guys, should I call that guy?
- So many customers today.

442
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,480
Or not?

443
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,320
Or just wait for him to call?!

444
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,960
Why am so stressing about this?!

445
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,570
He seems untrustworthy.

446
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,090
He's a bad guy.

447
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,360
It's better not to think about him.

448
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,020
Trust me.

449
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,960
You think so?

450
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,980
Yes.

451
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,030
You cruel!

452
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,690
A scumbag P'!

453
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,820
<i>[ "Pee=ghost" and "P'=senior/someone older" sounds identical ]</i>

454
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,420
Pee Kong Koi!<i>
 (A one legged ghost that sucks 
people's blood in the forest)</i>

455
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,170
A horny P'!

456
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,370
Watch out, a ghost is
 gonna come and strangle you!

457
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,870
I pray that he'll get punish severely!

458
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,190
E'B, what's wrong with you?

459
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,730
You've been talking
 like this for an hour now.

460
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:51,730
Forget about it, 
I don't want to talk about him.

461
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,510
What the heck?

462
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,790
I really don't 
want to talk about him.

463
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,520
Guys, it's like this. I'll tell you.

464
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,600
I had sex with P'Tin.

465
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,620
Really?

466
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,330
Yes and it's like this...

467
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,490
Like this, guys.

468
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,690
Like this?

469
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:14,020
Yes, it's like very...

470
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,700
Like this.

471
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,130
No wonder that day...

472
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,560
Guys...

473
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,070
wanna go for a drink today?

474
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,470
I want to get drunk.

475
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,440
I can't.

476
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,920
You go with Jed.

477
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,910
I have some errands to do.

478
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,580
What about you, Ai'Jed?

479
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,750
I have no problem.

480
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,380
But if you go, Ai'Chin will too.

481
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,920
Will you be OK with that?

482
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,510
Ignore him.

483
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,210
I'll be on my own table.

484
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,920
He'll be with Tisa.

485
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,400
Alright, we'll go then.

486
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,830
Guys, he text me.

487
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,060
Reply it, E'Wa.

488
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,760
Invite him to your house.

489
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,200
Yes.

490
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,160
Dude, don't reply.

491
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,230
He's just a playboy, don't you think?

492
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,220
Really?

493
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,690
Just reply.

494
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,030
Don't listen to him. 
He likes to cut off.

495
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,580
Always.

496
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,440
Go ahead.

497
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,280
Aside from that, 
what were you talking about?

498
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,350
- Talking about this since the beginning.
- Let me see.

499
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,960
Let me give you and dvice.

500
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,360
I'm the mother here.

501
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,600
Stop it!

502
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,100
Stop it, guys.

503
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,390
Let me reply it on my own.

504
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,940
E'Wa.

505
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,180
You're acting like you
 never get hit on before.

506
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,710
I think he's kinda cute.

507
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,440
How can you say he's cute?

508
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,690
He looks like a crossover 
between a kangaroo and a hamster.

509
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,400
Are you jealous?

510
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,130
No. I'm just worried about Ai'Wa.

511
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,690
I better go now.

512
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,370
So sick of you guys.

513
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,870
Ai'No, where are you going?

514
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,670
- Ignore him, let him go.
- Yes.

515
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,430
Let him go, forget him.

516
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,760
Should I reply to him?

517
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,020
What was it earlier?

518
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,940
I've eaten.

519
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,520
Send him sticker.

520
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,610
Use a sticker too?

521
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,060
Is it cute?

522
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,350
Yes, it's cute.

523
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,170
- Looks so sweet.
- I'll use it.

524
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,590
Go ahead.

525
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,920
Come.

526
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,650
Are you alright?

527
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,320
I want to cheers with Yu.

528
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,220
Not with you.

529
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,640
How much did you drink? 
You look all red.

530
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,480
It's really red.

531
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,830
Let's go again.

532
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,730
What the heck?

533
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,590
You invited me here today.

534
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,700
Yeah, I want to get drunk.

535
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,750
Really? You want to get 
drunk but only drink a little?

536
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,980
I'll get drunk eventually.

537
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,760
Ai'Yu...

538
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,440
- What's wrong?
- You invited me but you don't drink.

539
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,460
I'm drinking here.

540
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,300
What are you pouring?

541
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,440
What pour? What drink?
 With only that much?

542
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,390
We can take it easy, right?

543
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,160
There's still so much time.

544
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,370
One more.

545
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,530
Cheers with me.

546
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,410
Alright.

547
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,390
- Come on.
- Are you here for drinks or not?

548
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,020
Come on.

549
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,780
So stubborn.

550
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,450
Come on.

551
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,970
Dude.

552
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,780
Today, I think I'll
 succeed in flirting Tisa.

553
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,920
Congratulate me later.

554
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,380
Yeah.

555
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,690
Good luck.

556
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,790
What's up?

557
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,070
Yu!

558
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,870
Let's bottom up, what are you 
doing sitting there and spacing out?

559
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,400
Team!

560
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,530
Cheers.

561
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,830
Do it.

562
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,820
Finish it.

563
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,470
Tonight, I'll drink and get wasted.

564
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,690
Yeah, that's more like it.

565
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,560
Again?

566
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,410
Ai'Team.

567
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,770
Give me that bottle.

568
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,150
This?

569
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,600
Are you in a hurry?

570
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,010
Ignore me, just let it go.

571
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,660
Your face is so red.

572
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,160
Are you drunk?

573
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,870
I'm alright.

574
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,080
So, who are you here with?

575
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,600
I'm here celebrating
 my friend's birthday.

576
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,810
Cheers with me.

577
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,120
What about me?

578
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,350
- You too.
- You forgot your friend?

579
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,290
- Cheers.
- You're just gonna 
drink with your new friend?

580
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,160
This is Pat.

581
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,230
And this is Jed, my friend.

582
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,660
My close friend.

583
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,870
He looks familiar.

584
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,080
Really?

585
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,800
I bumped into him and got 
spilled on my shirt, remember?

586
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,830
- That day you mean?
- Yes.

587
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,180
Now that we get
 toknow each other, what now?

588
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,720
Alright let's go again.

589
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,950
Ai'Team!

590
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,250
Ai'Yu, they play the music.

591
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,340
Come on, Pat. Raise your hand.

592
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,420
Are you drunk?

593
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,780
Ai'Yu?

594
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,790
Are you alright, Yu?

595
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,260
Yu?

596
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,040
Yu?

597
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,600
What's wrong?

598
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,190
What's wrong?

599
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,210
Why are you crying?

600
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,590
Yu?

601
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,390
What's wrong?

602
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,580
Yu!

603
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,180
Yu!

604
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,960
What's wrong?

605
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,760
Why are you crying?

606
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,890
Yu!

607
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,280
Yu!

608
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,390
Where are you going?!

609
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,670
I'll be back.

610
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,810
What's wrong with you?!

611
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,620
Are you mad at me?!

612
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,910
How's this concerns you?!

613
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,830
Why do you want to know?

614
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:17,970
Of course.

615
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,560
You're my friend.

616
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,800
You're my roommate.

617
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,800
Yes.

618
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,170
I'm your friend.

619
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,230
I'm your roommate.

620
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,200
But do you know something?

621
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,730
I don't want to be that anymore!

622
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,140
Because I...

623
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,840
I like you, Ai'Chin!

624
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,440
I always have been.

625
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,520
I really like you.

626
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,480
When you hugged me...

627
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,160
I thought that you...

628
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,880
feel the same way as I am.

629
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,460
Yu...

630
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,460
I don't have that
 kind of feelings for you.

631
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:14,530
Can we just be friends like before?

632
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,230
Friends my ass, Ai'Chin!

633
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:26,830
Do you mean friends
 who hug each other...

634
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,590
kissing each other.

635
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,410
Play guitar and sing love song together.

636
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,380
Help me finish the 
food that I don't eat.

637
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,550
If you mean that kind of friends...

638
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,700
I don't want anymore!

639
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:45,470
Yu...

640
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,870
You and I...

641
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,300
can no longer go 
back to the way it was.

642
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,550
Ai'Yu!

643
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:36,520
What's wrong with you?!
