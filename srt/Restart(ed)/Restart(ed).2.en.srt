00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,970

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,010
<i>Again and again.</i>

10
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,860
<i>Like we don't know when everything will end.</i>

11
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,610
<i>Like the relationship between the three of us.</i>

12
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,470
Cheers!

13
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,650
OK.

14
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,150
You're here.

15
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,850
Happy Birthday, P'Rud.

16
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,200
Thank you.

17
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,520
You're got one year older now.

18
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,930
Ai'Yu!

19
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,630
You're that much younger than me.

20
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,740
But, thank you.

21
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,320
Happy Birthday, P'Rud.

22
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,960
If Yu is hungry he'll find something to eat.

23
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,980
You and I...

24
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,710
let's party!

25
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,420
We're here!

26
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,150
They're here!

27
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,290
Come, come, come!

28
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,730
Let's start with me.

29
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's go!

30
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,650
Ai'Yu!!!

31
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,440
Do you have a lover yet?

32
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,180
Right now, not yet.

33
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,670
For real?

34
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,260
A guy like you?

35
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,650
Yes, someone like me.

36
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,730
Well...

37
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,990
I haven't met anyone I like yet.

38
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,870
How romantic.

39
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,940
Dude...

40
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,040
You'll have a lover soon, 
you have to fall in love.

41
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,180
You're about to enter a university, right?

42
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,890
You'll have one soon.

43
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,450
Like who?

44
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,050
Like me!

45
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,100
What's with the "ho"?

46
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,240
Spin!

47
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,320
Your turn, Chin.

48
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,880
Ask him something touchy.

49
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,510
Deep.

50
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,390
Smooth.

51
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,780
You're Chin?

52
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,720
Do you like girls or boys?

53
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,000
Why?

54
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,040
Can't answer?

55
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,950
Answer it.

56
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,270
It's not that hard.

57
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,590
There's no right...

58
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,860
or wrong.

59
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,130
That's true.

60
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,790
Cheers.

61
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,350
I like girls.

62
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,760
Really?

63
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,320
Absolutely.

64
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,710
Are you sure?

65
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,220
Are you gonna keep staring at my friend?

66
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,530
You're drunk, come and sit with me.

67
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,600
Come on, let's cheers.

68
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
Go ahead, P'.

69
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,890
One more round.

70
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,930
Come on, let's continue spinning.

71
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,650
Cheers first.

72
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,760
Almost finished, come.

73
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,050
Jed, I'm not drunk.

74
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,570
Yes, you are.

75
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,360
I want to go home.

76
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,690
Jed why are you squeezing me?

77
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,520
Not smooth.

78
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,170
Sleep like this...

79
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,370
you won't realize if I do anything to you, right?

80
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,980
You're cute.

81
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,070
Guys, wake up!

82
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,260
Ai'Yu, wake up.

83
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,110
Yes, I'm awake.

84
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,570
Alright.

85
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,360
We're packing up here.

86
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,580
When you get up, go home.

87
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,940
OK, P'. Thank you.

88
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,970
Jed, wake up.

89
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,860
Damn it, Jed. Get up.

90
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,340
You're pulling my arm
 that it's almost comes off.

91
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,630
Hurry up or my mom will scold me.

92
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,190
P'.

93
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,180
How are you?

94
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,400
We're gonna head home now.

95
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,490
Last night was fun.

96
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,430
Yeah, don't mention it.

97
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,850
Get home safely.

98
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,480
OK.

99
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,000
You're sober up?

100
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,240
You look out of focus.

101
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,320
I'm fine.

102
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,890
Just a little sleepy.

103
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,220
That's how he is.

104
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,330
- Look after him.
- We're going home now.

105
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,930
Be safe.

106
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,900
You guys too.

107
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,160
We're leaving now.

108
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,650
Let's go.

109
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,260
Bye.

110
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,080
Are you gonna help me?

111
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,630
OK.

112
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,780
Is this the dorm that P'Rud told me?

113
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,420
He gave me a number but not the name.

114
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,190
What's in P'Rud's mind?

115
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,740
Hello.

116
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,650
P'Rud gave me this number.

117
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,890
I'm gonna share the room with you.

118
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,260
<i>You're Yu, right?</i>

119
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,190
Yes.

120
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,300
Who are you?

121
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,340
<i>I'm Chin.</i>

122
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,380
I'm screwed.

123
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,550
Can I get through my university life?

124
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,470
I'm gonna ask to move into
the dorm from the first day.

125
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,270
OK.

126
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,270
The left side is mine.

127
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,260
The right side is yours.

128
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,160
As for the work table...

129
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,990
we have to share it.

130
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,550
OK.

131
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,250
Thanks.

132
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,950
Don't mention it.

133
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,940
You can organize your stuff first.

134
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,280
I'm gonna take a shower.

135
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,900
OK.

136
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,440
What are you doing?

137
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,760
Are you bullying me?

138
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,650
Sorry, it's not intentional.

139
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,610
What do you mean?

140
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,480
My arms are all wet now.

141
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,100
I even lost in my game.

142
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,580
My hair is wet.

143
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,830
Wipe them for me.

144
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,190
Why do I have to that?

145
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,220
Do it yourself.

146
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,540
What the heck?!

147
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,220
Sit here.

148
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,320
Stop it.

149
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,660
You'll make my hairs fall, gently.

150
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,230
You're too much.

151
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,650
Are you a khun-chai from somewhere?

152
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,990
You're done yet.
Where are you going?

153
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,240
You're not sleep yet?

154
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,400
Not yet.

155
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,220
Maybe because of the new place.

156
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,390
You'll get use to it.

157
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,090
I'll get use to it.

158
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,580
What about you?

159
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,310
You can't sleep because I'm here?

160
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,920
No.

161
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,340
I'm just excited.

162
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,760
I haven't had a
sleeping partner for so long.

163
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,830
I understand.

164
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,650
Anyway, you and I...

165
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,460
are gonna live
together for a long time.

166
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,250
Is there anything you want me
to cooperate with, just tell me.

167
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,240
So it'll be comfortable for both of us.

168
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,570
Yeah, you too.

169
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,030
Just tell if there's anything
you need my cooperation with.

170
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,580
Then...

171
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,720
Sweet dreams.

172
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,870
Sweet dreams.

173
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,430
Dude, I'm here.

174
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,950
Jed, where's Zeemai gone too?

175
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,830
I've called him so many
times but you didn't picked up.

176
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,610
Normally, he'll wait for me in
front of the room and wake me up.

177
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,480
Try call him.

178
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,170
No need, he'll be around here.

179
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,420
Come on.

180
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,560
Who do you think you are?

181
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,220
How dare you follow Zo
around without looking at yourself.

182
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,510
Where is he?

183
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,290
Can't find him.
He didn't even answer his phone.

184
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,830
Or is he at our
faculty building already?

185
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,820
Don't worry,
he's around here somewhere.

186
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,750
Your face is like a
boiled cauliflower, E'Glasses!

187
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,480
You have four eyes...

188
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,040
but no clear vision.

189
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,010
I really hate people
like you, E'Glasses!

190
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,120
I didn't.

191
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,620
It was Zo who asked me to help him.

192
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,230
Stop pointing finger.

193
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,470
- It'll got you into more trouble.
- Do it.

194
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,590
Who are you people?
Why are you bullying my friend?

195
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,080
Who we are,
that's our business.

196
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,450
Yu, help me.

197
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,090
You, you, you and you...

198
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,130
faces are like stray dogs.

199
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,330
Like to bully others...

200
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,210
bad attitude.

201
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,900
Zeemai, let's go.

202
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,300
Let them know
not to mess with others.

203
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,560
What are you laughing at, Chin?

204
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,910
You already got
into trouble the first day?

205
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,900
It's Ai'Zeemai here.

206
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,630
He likes to help Ai'Zo too often.

207
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,390
So the bitch group bullies him,
follow him and beat him every day.

208
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,640
Yu, don't blame Zo.

209
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,310
I helped Zo out my own willingness.

210
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,270
You're willing to(dtem jai).

211
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,900
But I...

212
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,820
got filled<i>(dtem)</i> at my eye.

213
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:37,610
I don't think he's that handsome, Zen.

214
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,580
You got hurt by them again.

215
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,960
I'm sorry.

216
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,780
It's fine.

217
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,690
I'm alright.

218
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,580
Does it hurt?

219
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,230
Turn your face here.

220
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,130
Let me put some medicine.

221
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,870
Thanks.

222
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,020
But, do it gently.

223
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,080
Do it for me too.

224
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,770
By all means, do it yourself.

225
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,050
Why am I the only have
no one to patch my wound?

226
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,860
I'm really unlucky
when it comes to love.

227
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,990
You're not eating
your veggies again.

228
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,580
Yeah, I don't like veggies.

229
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,470
No wonder you're so small.

230
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,280
What's it to you that I'm small?

231
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,820
Try it.

232
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,250
For your health.

233
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,500
I can eat fruit instead.

234
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,540
If you want then you eat it.

235
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,870
What are you doing?

236
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,560
Exchange.

237
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,240
I want a sweet drink.

238
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,580
Damn it, Yu!

239
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,880
We're here.

240
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,640
That's where our destination is.

241
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,340
Shall we?

242
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,800
Let's charge!

243
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,700
You told us to came
here early but quick enough.

244
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,490
It's all because of this outfits.

245
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,700
Why do we have
to get all dressed up?

246
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,910
Exactly, it's hot too.

247
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,870
How can we not? They say that
the guy in this restaurant is hot.

248
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,560
Jeng, is there a pink milk here?

249
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,130
E'B, look at the place.

250
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,920
A topokki restaurant...

251
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,000
how can it had pink milk?

252
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,410
I need a pink milk.

253
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,880
What should we have today?

254
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,750
- Yeah, I'm starving.
- How about a topokki?

255
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,930
I'll have...

256
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,840
Order chicken for me, I want that.

257
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,210
Yeah, looks tasty.

258
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,690
Add some cheese too, lots of it.

259
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,840
- I want to eat that.
- Korean chicken?

260
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,650
I'll have 2 chickens.

261
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,700
Sawasdee krub, kids.

262
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,810
What will you be having?

263
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,490
I'm the owner of this restaurant.

264
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,420
The staff are so busy.

265
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,520
So I have to take the order myself.

266
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,230
You won't mind, right?

267
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,160
No, I'll have
everything in the menu each.

268
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,560
Sure thing.

269
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,240
Ai'Jeng, my mom
only gave me 300 baht.

270
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,160
Will it be enough?

271
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,060
Shut up, I've already
asked my mom. I'll pay for it.

272
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,520
Everything in the menu each?

273
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:45,330
Yes, one of everything.

274
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,710
Hey, keep it down.

275
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,080
Don't you think
you're being too obvious?

276
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,780
I have to be direct.

277
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,190
What was that?
You keep staring at him.

278
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,030
Aren't you gonna
share with your friends?

279
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,540
You were looking at him too much.

280
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,720
Yeah, are you
gonna eat him quietly?

281
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,670
Are you gonna keep it for yourself?

282
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,580
Yeah, not gonna
share with us at all.

283
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,710
I've booked all of it.

284
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,830
- Go have the chips.
- Yeah.

285
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,820
You eat that stuff.

286
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,780
It's my business.

287
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,870
I'm full, should we check the bill?

288
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,100
I have tuition class after this.

289
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,070
I think I'm going home too.

290
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,060
I'm going to
help my mom after this.

291
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,910
What about you, Wa?

292
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,340
Me?

293
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,380
I'm gonna go home too.
I don't know why I'm so sleepy today.

294
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,980
E'B, we're all going home now.

295
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,080
Are you gonna go home
or do something sneaky here?!

296
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,780
Not yet, I think I'm gonna
sit and eat for a little longer.

297
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,630
Don't let me find out that you
"eat" something that's not in the menu.

298
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,600
Come, let's go home.
My mom will scold me.

299
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,530
E'B, hurry home too.

300
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,460
We have a
morning class tomorrow.

301
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,100
Alright, be home safely.

302
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,130
let's go.

303
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,350
We're leaving, bye.

304
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,750
Thank you, dear customers.

305
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,800
You're not going home?

306
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,420
Not yet,
I'm gonna stay for a long time.

307
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,530
But I think you're drunk.

308
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,450
Please let me stay a little longer.

309
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,520
Then I'll drink with you.

310
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,830
In case you get wasted...

311
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,200
someone can look after you.

312
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,820
Is that a good idea?

313
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,450
Am I bothering you too much?

314
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,420
No.

315
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,600
You're the customer here.

316
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,970
I should be looking after you.

317
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,540
So, what's your name?

318
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,510
I'm Tin. You?

319
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,240
I'm BB.

320
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,870
Why?

321
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:38,660
What are you laughing at?

322
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,340
A guy named BB?

323
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,060
What? Is it not cute?

324
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,530
A handsome guy like you,
I can't control myself anymore.

325
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,560
Your shaven mustache...

326
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,280
and your sharp eyes.

327
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,470
I'm fall for you.

328
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,580
But how are you gonna
be responsible for last night?!

329
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:11,260
We did it last night,
you have to take responsibility.

330
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,880
Can you talk about the
dowry with your mother?

331
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,490
What nonsense are you on about?

332
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,800
We were both drunk.

333
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,070
What responsibility
are you talking about?

334
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,780
It's not like
you're gonna get pregnant.

335
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,930
Are you just gonna leave me?

336
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,240
Here.

337
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,870
Take this and eat.

338
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,010
After done eating,
go home and forget about last night.

339
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,330
Are so sure talking like that?

340
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,770
You'll see...

341
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,670
I'll tell my mom!

342
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,760
<i>[Jeng, I did it with the Topokki Restaurant's owner.]</i>
<i>[A one night stand]</i>

343
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,590
<i>[I'm arriving soon. You're at the school front, right?]</i>
<i>[Jeng, I did it with the Topokki Restaurant's owner.]</i>
<i>[A one night stand]</i>

344
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,840
E'BB!

345
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,270
You traitor!

346
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,030
You destroyed my heart!

347
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,720
You bitch!

348
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,210
Dude, do you have a pink milk?

349
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,280
Are you still gonna about pink milk?

350
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,960
You should only ask for a
female medicine. Do you want one?

351
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,080
What are you mad at me for?

352
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,490
What medicine did you
take that got him go to you?

353
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,300
Share it with me, I want to know.

354
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,740
Dude.

355
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,630
He's so hot.

356
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,810
Then we're start.

357
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,950
Then it's like...

358
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,410
I'm heading home now, Auntie.

359
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,230
Good luck.

360
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,060
- Krub, Sawasdee krub.
- Sawasdee kha.

361
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,120
Let's go, Jed.

362
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,310
Jed!

363
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,540
Let's go!

364
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,460
Dad, I know.

365
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,680
Why did you smack me?

366
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,310
What are you daydreaming about?

367
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,810
Let's go, I'm hungry.

368
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,030
You're smiling again.

369
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,440
What are you doing?

370
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,220
Where is Ai'Zeemai went to, Ai'Jed?

371
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,670
Can't any of my
friend be normal for once?

372
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,860
Zeemai?

373
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,870
Let's go on a date.

374
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,710
Zeemai?

375
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,170
Zeemai?!

376
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,720
Zeemai!

377
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,650
What is it, Zo?

378
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,630
How to do this one? Tell me.

379
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,440
This one?

380
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:33,460
This is target group survey,
you have to investigate quantitatively.

381
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,070
Physical characteristics and
social and psychological characteristics.

382
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,530
The second one...

383
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,930
Are you going somewhere today?
I want to invite for lunch.

384
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,620
L.

385
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,560
Your make up today is so beautiful.

386
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,150
So are you coming?

387
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,140
Sure thing, I'll see you.

388
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,850
I hope you'll come alone.

389
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,340
Because some people is
too embarrassing to bring along.

390
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,690
Doesn't even know how
to dress up and maybe not even
wash his face with facial cleanser.

391
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,020
Lame!

392
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,710
Let's go.

393
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,030
Then, I gotta go now.

394
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,810
Leave this question for now.

395
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,730
I'll leave it to
you to do this for me.

396
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,670
Sure thing.

397
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,940
So what if my face is blemish?

398
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,290
But I'm good at study.

399
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,640
Smart but not pretty.

400
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,070
How can any guy fall for me?

401
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,160
Just having brains won't help.

402
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,710
I better go see Yu.

403
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,350
Yu, I'm here.

404
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,380
We've been looking for you.

405
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,760
Where were you?

406
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,670
I went to help Zo with his homework.

407
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,340
Again?

408
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,420
When will you stop being around him?

409
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
I know.

410
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,110
You know like a thousand times.

411
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:06,450
So, what's wrong with Jed?
He's acting strange.

412
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,290
Probably his retard symptom again.

413
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,980
What do you want to eat?

414
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,390
Looking at you
makes me full already.

415
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,140
Then, I'll order for you.

416
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,310
Sure.

417
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,900
P', I want to order.

418
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:19,230
I'll have topokki and fried chicken.

419
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,970
Of course.

420
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:41,860
Excuse me, what are these?

421
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,350
We only ordered 2,
why there are full of foods here?

422
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,790
This is the he special
service of our restaurant.

423
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,920
Thank you for pulling
a lots of customers today.

424
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,360
Please come to
our restaurant often.

425
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,490
Enjoy the food.

426
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,200
He really went for lunch with L.

427
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,350
I thought he'll refuse her
and go for lunch with me.

428
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,210
I'm hungry too.

429
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,620
OK.

430
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:55,220
- But I'm really hungry.
- Why?

431
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,480
I'm hungry.

432
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,560
Can you hungry for me?

433
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,060
Can you hungry for me?

434
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,310
What are you talking about?

435
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:03,880
What are you shy for?

436
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,040
I'm not shy.

437
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,620
Your face looks shy,
smiling like that...

438
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:07,570
I'm not shy.

439
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,730
You're not shy?
But you were pushing my hand.

440
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,310
I said I'm not shy.

441
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,430
What are you on about?

442
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,910
Why did you nudge me?

443
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,570
Me?

444
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,380
- I was walking properly.
- You did that.

445
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,200
Come here.

446
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,680
What?

447
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,960
You're gonna do it again,
walk in front.

448
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,860
Who did you talked to last night?

449
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,180
Who did you talked to last night?

450
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,410
No one.

451
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,490
I saw you.

452
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,690
No one.

453
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:36,820
Just keep walking.

454
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:45,310
Are you teasing me?

455
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,990
You're kicking for real?

456
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,650
Yu, don't come near!

457
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,690
Yu!

458
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,080
You were teasing me.

459
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,700
No, I'm not!

460
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:14,780
Let me hold your bag.

461
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,260
Thank you.

462
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:19,350
Is your hand too tired that you
need someone to carry it for you?

463
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:20,480
It's cold.

464
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,180
Wanna wear my jacket?

465
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,650
Thank you.

466
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,860
Thailand only has summer.

467
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,770
How can it has any cold wind?

468
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,610
So exaggerated.

469
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,090
Hey!

470
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,170
When are you gonna
stop me worrying for you?

471
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:32,170
.
