9

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,710

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,100

<i>Get home safely.</i>

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,990
<i>You two are close.</i>

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,780
<i>It's not weird for me
 to be close with anyone.</i>

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,760
<i>Why are you come back so late?</i>

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,080
<i>We were watching movie.</i>

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,680
<i>You can watch it here.</i>

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,400
<i>- It's not the same.
- It's same.</i>

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,050
<i>- It's not.
- It is.</i>

21
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,050
<i>I'm not arguing anymore.</i>

22
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,890
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

23
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,610
<i>Yes.</i>

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,800
<i>I had dinner with...</i>

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,850
<i>Tisa.</i>

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,110
<i>Are you going somewhere this Saturday?</i>

27
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,040
<i>This Saturday...</i>

28
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,640
<i>No.</i>

29
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,980
<i>Are you asking to go somewhere?</i>

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,350
<i>Wanna sleep in my place?</i>

31
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,760
What's that, P'Jed?

32
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,480
Sleep at your place?

33
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,420
That's alright, forget it. I was kidding.

34
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,860
No.

35
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,290
I can go.

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,530
But you have to ask 
permission from my mom first.

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,900
Do I have to ask her?

38
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,030
Because you want a 
"daughter" to sleep at your place...

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,960
so you have ask her mom.

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,790
If you can get her permission...

41
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,420
I'll hug you all night.

42
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,230
Really?

43
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,180
Later...

44
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,080
I'll cook fried chicken with 
basil that you like. Do you want it?

45
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,540
OK.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,640
You're home early.

47
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,680
I finished my assignment early and had
 nothing else to do, so I came home early.

48
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,360
I bought some drinks, want some?

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,630
Thanks. Just put them there,
 I'll drink later.

50
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,140
So...

51
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,390
did you went out with Tisa today?

52
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,710
No, she...

53
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,540
was mad at me for some reason.

54
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,310
What about you and Pat?

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,120
The usual.

56
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,930
Do you like him?

57
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,220
Why do you ask?

58
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,230
I'm your friend.

59
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,750
Can't I ask?

60
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,290
Friends doesn't need to know 
everything about each other, right?

61
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,960
I want to know.

62
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,990
You can't even tell me that, I guess.

63
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,000
There nothing between us, 
why would you want to know?

64
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,470
You know in your heart...

65
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,180
what you're feeling, right?

66
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,040
I don't have any feelings for you.

67
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,560
Go and shower already.

68
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,570
I leave them here.

69
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,160
Do you have to take this many?

70
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,260
E'Jeng.

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,930
Finished? 
My shoulder is about to break.

72
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,000
Hurry up.

73
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,840
E'Wa.

74
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,180
You're not done yet?

75
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,600
It's too high, I'm trying here.

76
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,960
Steady, dude.

77
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,660
Come, let me help.

78
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,760
You're moving again.

79
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,430
Got it.

80
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,290
All these?

81
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,460
Thanks, dude. I've waited for
 you for so long. Where were you?

82
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,420
Sorry, I just came
 back from the restroom.

83
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,280
I bought some sticker
 from my neighborhood.

84
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,630
Can I paste them on you?

85
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,540
Go ahead.

86
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,520
Do you like it?

87
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,110
Are you two acting in
 a lakorn for me to watch?

88
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,590
Dude, hurry up.

89
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,620
I'm hungry.

90
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,530
I'm done.

91
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,550
Do you want to go 
to the topokki restaurant?

92
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,100
No.

93
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,680
I don't want to see P'Tin.

94
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,070
You're bickering with him again?

95
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,470
No.

96
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,920
Which restaurant you want to go then?

97
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,410
The Cafe.

98
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,150
The one that says "Hungry" in front.

99
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,290
Are you going to peek
 at the handsome guy again?

100
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,790
After some guys again.

101
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,990
You're not?

102
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,440
E'B, stand still.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,320
If I text him first, I lose.

104
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,590
It'll ruin my reputation.

105
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,080
It was just a one night stand.

106
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,070
Why am I thinking about it?

107
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,210
I didn't feel like this before.

108
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,230
Handsome, 
can you take a photo of me?

109
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,480
1, 2...

110
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,990
One more.

111
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,330
Did you get it?

112
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,750
What are you doing, wild kid?

113
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,220
What's it to you?

114
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,630
How can you talk 
to your husband that way?

115
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,670
What husband? You're delusional.

116
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,760
Hey, be nice.

117
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,110
I went out of my way
 to chat with you here.

118
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,430
But I don't want to chat with you.

119
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,190
Come and see me
 at 7 AM on Saturday.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,990
Why do I have to go?

121
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,550
Just do what I said.

122
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,720
Ano.

123
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,620
What?

124
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,180
When I'm here alone with you...

125
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,790
I just realized that the first time
 I met you, you had a silly face.

126
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,370
But I'm handsome now.

127
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,360
Who says that?

128
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,390
Many people.

129
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,850
By the way, Ano.

130
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,220
I have something to tell  you.

131
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,320
What is it?

132
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,410
I've decided...

133
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,810
to be serious with that guy.

134
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,210
The other day,
when I went on date with him...

135
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,990
I've agreed to be his boyfriend.

136
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,650
I just want you to
 be the first to know.

137
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,390
Good.

138
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,420
No!

139
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,090
Where are you going?

140
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,050
What's the matter with him?

141
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,900
Zeemai.

142
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,760
What's wrong with your ear?

143
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,900
It's nothing.

144
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,410
For real.

145
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,690
Is it hurt?

146
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,460
A little.

147
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,450
Hey, Pat.

148
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,040
What's up?

149
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,520
Have a sit.

150
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,990
Shall we start the discussion?

151
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,540
Yeah, good idea.

152
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,450
Are you sure?

153
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,780
With an outsider with us?

154
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,510
Pat is with me.

155
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,140
Why can't he join?

156
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,530
I'm just asking.

157
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,940
Let's start the discussion.

158
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,760
Ai'U.

159
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,120
Those two are going to fight now.

160
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,350
Will I have to get involved?

161
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,550
U...

162
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,650
they're not gonna 
beat up each other, right?

163
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,490
Come now, guys.

164
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,900
Do your assignment.

165
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,380
Do your assignment.

166
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,750
Pat, help me and check this out.

167
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,720
Do you think this looks good?

168
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,540
Do your think it's all correct?

169
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,490
Let me have a look.

170
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,060
They're all good.

171
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,620
You're good.

172
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,430
You're very good indeed.

173
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,970
Dude.

174
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,650
Do I have anything else to do?

175
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,330
I don't think so.

176
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,310
Do you have an errand to do?

177
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,510
I'm going to have lunch with Pat.

178
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,360
I haven't eaten yet.

179
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,080
Go ahead.

180
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,330
Then, shall we end it here today?

181
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,140
We'll continue next time.

182
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,500
Yeah, good idea.

183
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,650
Sure thing.

184
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,250
Chin, let's go.

185
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,270
Pat, let's go eat.

186
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,570
See you.

187
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,570
I'm leaving now, see you.

188
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,250
I'm going.

189
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,640
Don't follow me.

190
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,090
Chin.

191
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,510
Chin!

192
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,060
What should we eat today?

193
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,020
Well, anything.

194
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,470
Up to you.

195
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,140
What were you thinking about earlier?

196
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,050
It's about the assignment.

197
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,300
It's nothing.

198
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,950
Assignment?

199
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,530
Chin.

200
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,790
Do you still wants to date me?

201
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,110
What's wrong?

202
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,520
Do you realized that you've been
 taking less and less interest about me?

203
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,930
I think it's the still as usual.

204
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,910
As usual?

205
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,760
You're interested
 about U as usual.

206
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,570
Not about me.

207
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,040
Can you stop 
mentioning about U?

208
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,390
Why? I want to say it.

209
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,320
U, U, U, U!

210
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,210
I said stop!

211
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,220
Excuse me.

212
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,640
Go eat by yourself.

213
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,180
U.

214
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,180
I'm not making
 you uncomfortable, right?

215
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,890
No.

216
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,700
Why do you think that?

217
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,470
Well...

218
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,000
It's about Chin.

219
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,450
You don't have to think too much.

220
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,590
I don't have any
 feelings for Chin anymore.

221
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,260
You know, right?

222
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,750
About how I feel for you.

223
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,710
I do.

224
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,260
You're not being with me...

225
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,560
to forget about Chin, right?

226
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,470
No.

227
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,180
I'm easy to forget things.

228
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,220
Do I even have a chance?

229
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,980
If you want me to answer it now...

230
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,360
I probably can't.

231
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,620
Let's take it slowly.

232
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,880
Sure.

233
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,220
I can wait.

234
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,890
We'll slowly get to know each other.

235
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,640
I'm Jed.

236
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,560
Jed Nipattamthai

237
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,500
I'm here to ask your permission...

238
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,200
to take your
 "daughter" out for the night.

239
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,320
How many days?

240
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,520
Well...

241
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,400
For a start, it'll be for a day.

242
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,530
In the future, it might be more.

243
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,360
What is your relationship with Wa?

244
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,800
I'm...

245
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,790
I'm his boyfriend for a week now.

246
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,710
What day will he go?

247
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,850
This Saturday.

248
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,430
Anwa.

249
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,170
I send you to school to learn.

250
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,450
But you bring home a husband?

251
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,670
And have a family.

252
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,120
Of course.

253
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,860
I'm counting on 
you to take care of him.

254
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,630
I'll entrust him to you for a day.

255
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,890
Thank you!

256
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,700
Mom, thank you.

257
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,470
Thank you, Mom.

258
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,740
Ja.

259
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,590
Get home safely, P'Jed.

260
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,510
Of course.

261
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,110
See you this Saturday, little one.

262
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,690
I'll pack my things tonight, OK?

263
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,150
Absolutely.

264
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,420
I'll let you know when I'm home.

265
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,570
OK.

266
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,400
Bye.

267
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,480
U.

268
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,540
What is it?

269
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,340
Can I ask for something of you?

270
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,660
What is it?

271
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,750
I'm tired.

272
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,150
Can I hug you?

273
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,580
I don't think that's a good idea.

274
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,430
Why?

275
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,070
It's just a hug.

276
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,220
No reason.

277
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,870
But I think it's better not, trust me.

278
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,590
Yeah, I'm sorry.

279
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,460
Did you had a fight with Tisa?

280
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,890
Yeah.

281
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,590
It's gonna be alright, 
don't be stressed.

282
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,230
Things will get better.

283
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,290
Yeah, I'm not stress about it.

284
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,040
But...

285
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,970
you're really not gonna let me hug you?

286
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,400
No!

287
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,990
Are you free today?

288
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,950
Yeah, why?

289
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,070
I want to ask you to a dinner.

290
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,500
Wanna go?

291
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,930
You're gonna have dinner with Tisa...

292
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,270
that you ask me instead?

293
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,500
Well...

294
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,190
I want to eat with you.

295
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,760
Can't I?

296
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,130
You come to have dinner with me
 only when you got in a fight with her?

297
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,740
Come now.

298
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,330
You're free, right?

299
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,550
OK, see you in the evening.

300
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,120
It's already 7 AM.

301
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,870
Why isn't he's here yet?

302
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,400
Cruel P'Tin

303
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,970
If I said to him to stop this, 
will he still pestering me?

304
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,390
Why isn't he pick up?

305
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,830
OK, I'm here.

306
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,160
You're late.

307
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,180
I just got back from handing in
 my assignment to the professor.

308
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,520
You're late, so it's your treat.

309
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,710
Alright, sure Mom.

310
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,170
Alright, Dad.

311
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,360
What are you smiling? Let's go.

312
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,210
Where are you taking me?

313
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,110
Come now, just follow me.

314
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,160
I'm hungry again, P'Jed.

315
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,210
Then, I'll go get 
some strawberries for you.

316
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,190
You can watch the TV while waiting.

317
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,530
OK.

318
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,560
Wa.

319
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,100
Take it.

320
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,650
Thank you.

321
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,440
What are you watching?

322
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,400
A lakorn.

323
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,570
It's all the same thing.

324
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,890
Look, I've changed into
 so many channels already.

325
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,540
They're all like, an auntie
 came to the house or an office.

326
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,880
The cleaners are there
 sweeping and mopping the floor.

327
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,490
Then suddenly something 
very dramatic happened.

328
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,090
Then she tells everybody, 
"I'm the president of the company".

329
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,240
It's been 3 dramas and they're all like this.

330
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,570
Do you have any other 
drama recommendations?

331
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,980
We can guess the plot off all of them.

332
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,170
It should be changed like...

333
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,770
something more chaotic and twisting.

334
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,630
It'd be more interesting.

335
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,470
You think so too, right?

336
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,240
<i>Hello?</i>

337
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,930
Hello, Jed.

338
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,510
Are you with Chin?

339
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,720
<i>I don't know where he is.</i>

340
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,250
<i>I haven't seen him since the noon.</i>

341
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,400
OK, thank you.

342
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,330
Zeemai, are you with Chin?

343
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,360
<i>No.</i>

344
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,440
<i>I haven't seen him since noon.</i>

345
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,880
OK, thank you.

346
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,960
Can you wait for me?

347
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,500
I'll be back ASAP.

348
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,110
Sure thing.

349
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,200
I'll wait here.

350
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,180
Why do you call me?

351
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,870
Where were you?

352
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,040
I was having dinner with U.

353
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,720
Dinner with U?

354
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,590
Then why didn't you pick up your phone?

355
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,580
I didn't hear my phone rings.

356
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,670
You didn't hear...

357
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,790
or pretend not to hear it, I wonder?

358
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,650
So...

359
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,230
why do you call me here?

360
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,970
If I'm not in a fight with my dad,
 you wouldn't come, right?

361
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,300
Chin.

362
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,750
Don't leave me.

363
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,980
Don't leave me like this again.

364
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,050
I promise...

365
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,680
that I won't be demanding again.

366
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,210
U.. what are you doing?

367
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,210
Pat

368
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,700
U

369
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,700
Pat...

370
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,700
Pat

371
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,700
U... what are you doing?

372
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,310
Can you wait for me?

373
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,640
I'll be back ASAP.

374
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,830
U?

375
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,500
Let's go home.

376
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,590
Why did you went there?

377
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,730
I went for dinner.

378
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,910
Alone?

379
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,870
With a friend.

380
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,660
A friend who often
 makes me wait.

381
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,860
A friend who
 always left me alone.

382
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,570
A friend who always makes me sad.

383
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,300
Forget it.

384
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,040
Give me that. I'll dry your hair.

385
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,400
U?

386
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,780
Are you alright?

387
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,760
You're burning up.

388
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,500
Chin.

389
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,240
Thank you for 
dropping me off.

390
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,020
Get home safely.

391
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,950
Hello, U. Are you still there?

392
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,440
U is in my room.

393
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,550
<i>Who are you?</i>

394
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,720
<i>Let me speak to U.</i>

395
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,730
I'm Pat.

396
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,260
<i>U is sick.</i>

397
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,180
Let him wait there.

398
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,640
I'll come and pick him up.

399
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,390
I don't think so.

400
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,460
<i>When he wakes up...</i>

401
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,530
<i>I'll send him home myself.</i>

402
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,600
<i>Also...</i>

403
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,160
don't do that to U again.

404
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,740
If you do...

405
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,720
I won't let it slide.

406
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,110
A guy like you?

407
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,580
What can you do to me?

408
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,060
<i>You'll see.</i>

409
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,440
<i>I...</i>

410
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,540
will take U from you.

411
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:20,290
You coward.

412
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,530
Damn it!
