00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,460
<i>You forgive me?</i>

7
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,250
<i>Yes.</i>

8
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,560
<i>Forget about it.</i>

9
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,690
<i>Just let it pass.</i>

10
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,660
<i>As for...</i>

11
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,510
<i>about me liking you...</i>

12
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,010
<i>don't think about it too much.</i>

13
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,960
I've made up my mind.

14
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,020
I won't have any 
feeling for you anymore.

15
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,830
We'll be friends again.

16
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,040
You're such sweet talker, P'Jed.

17
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,920
It really is sweet.

18
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,450
How can we change our heart
 to love someone else that easy?

19
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,400
But I think you need to
 start changing yourself first.

20
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,880
I don't think Ai'Zo will take any
 interest with you looking like this.

21
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,280
Why? What's wrong with my looks?

22
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,990
It's old-fashion, dull and plain.

23
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,040
It's old-fashion, dull and plain.

24
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,250
Like a plain soup.

25
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,110
Am I have to get my 
eyes hurt many times today?

26
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,430
Thank you, I'll pay you later.

27
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,340
Thanks for using our service.

28
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,310
What did you do to yourself?

29
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,930
You look improved.

30
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,680
I just want to change myself
 so people will take interest in me.

31
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,960
Good, you'll stop...

32
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,280
daydreaming for once.

33
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,410
Let's go.

34
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,190
Let's go do our assignment.

35
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,290
What do you think 
of my change? Is it good?

36
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,720
It's good, I like it.

37
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,480
No, it's the same as before.

38
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,130
I like your hairstyle the most.

39
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,270
Very funny.

40
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,200
Dude.

41
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,430
Do you think this 
line needs to be modified?

42
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,860
Let me see.

43
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,850
I think it would be better 
to change the character.

44
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,280
Zeemai, what do you think?

45
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,640
Take a look.

46
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,230
The third one.

47
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,450
I think it needs to be changed.

48
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,300
Chin, Tisa, what do you think? 
Do you need to change anything?

49
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,380
Yeah, I agree.

50
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,700
I'll go with what
 you guys agreed on.

51
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,120
Give it back.

52
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,480
I just want you to see.

53
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,840
Always bullying me.

54
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,430
Don't.

55
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,680
I can remove it on my own.

56
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,470
Why?

57
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,490
I guess I can't touch your hair now?

58
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,700
You can, but I can remove it on my own.

59
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,280
Why do you like to
 snatch it away from me?

60
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,640
Here, the teacher said 
that it needs to be revised.

61
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,490
Don't write on it, it'll stained.

62
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,790
Sorry.

63
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,930
This first, the one
 teacher said to revised it.

64
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,700
No.

65
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,160
He should send  it like this.

66
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,360
I won't changed it.

67
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,810
Hello, Pat.

68
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,480
I'm downstairs near the library.

69
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,560
Are you looking for me?

70
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,400
OK, see you.

71
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,250
Tisa.

72
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,300
Do you think this location is OK?

73
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,510
Where?

74
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
Here.

75
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,190
OK?

76
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,420
- Here.
- I'm OK but this one is better.

77
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,200
Don't interrupt.

78
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,940
U.

79
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,950
I'm here.

80
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,790
Pat, you're fast.

81
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,050
So, Chin and Jet...

82
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,680
Tisa, wanna grab
 something to eat? I'm hungry.

83
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,200
But didn't you just have a snack?

84
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,430
Let's go.

85
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,730
Why is this scene so familiar?

86
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,870
It gives me the creeps.

87
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,030
I want to eat this.

88
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,610
I want to have steak.

89
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,910
- The restaurant is over there.
- Ai'Zeemai, help me check this out.

90
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,950
Give it here.

91
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,170
Guys...

92
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,870
I'll leave things to you for now.

93
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,010
I want to grab lunch. I'll be back.

94
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,720
OK.

95
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,630
See it by yourself.

96
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,980
Stay there.

97
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,430
Fine.

98
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:16,700
<i>[I miss you again]</i>

99
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:27,170
<i>[I miss you again]</i>

100
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:27,170
<i>[After you finish your 
assignment, come pick me up]</i>

101
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,950
<i>[I miss you again]</i>

102
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,950
<i>[After you finish your
 assignment, come pick me up]</i>

103
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,950
<i>[All right]</i>

104
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,660
Here, your shirt.

105
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,170
I've wash it.

106
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,790
It's smell good.

107
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,630
Thank you.

108
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,390
So...

109
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,320
How much longer
 will  you stay with Chin?

110
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,780
Until the contract expires.

111
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,290
Why?

112
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,590
I just want to say...

113
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,450
if you're feeling uncomfortable...

114
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,160
you can stay in my room.

115
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,450
I'm OK.

116
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,170
Thank you for concerning.

117
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,480
So, are you going
 anywhere this evening?

118
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,380
I'm free lately. Nothing to do.

119
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,960
Do you want to ask 
me to go somewhere?

120
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,590
Wanna watch movie in my room?

121
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,440
Sure, I'm not busy.

122
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,520
Then, we'll watch it after 
we eat grilled pork with rice.

123
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
Sure.

124
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,840
If it's not good, I'll smack you.

125
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,520
Before we go watch the movie...

126
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,070
I have an evening class. 
I'm gonna go back and change first.

127
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,030
Yeah, me too.

128
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,780
- Shall we?
- Yeah, let's go.

129
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,670
Or we'll be late.

130
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,550
Chin.

131
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,490
Do you have anything to tell me?

132
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,380
Nothing, why?

133
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,730
Do you have feelings for U?

134
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,700
Are you guys really just friends?

135
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,340
Do you mean
 friends who hug each other...

136
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,240
kissing each other.

137
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,670
Play guitar and 
sing love song together.

138
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,060
Help me finish the
 food that I don't eat.

139
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,020
If you mean that kind of friends...

140
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,440
I don't want that anymore!

141
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,970
We're friends.

142
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,350
Why...

143
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,990
do you think that?

144
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,370
I don't know.

145
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,790
You know nothing about me.

146
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,870
You don't know what I like...

147
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,600
what I want to eat.

148
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,920
But when it comes to U, 
you remember everything.

149
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,300
Don't say that I'm being silly...

150
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,030
but I really can't let that thing pass by.

151
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,190
Don't be like this, don't overthink.

152
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,910
Me and U really are friends.

153
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,030
He's my roommate, 
that's why I remember.

154
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,910
I'm gonna think 
that way from now then.

155
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,040
Why? Jealous?

156
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,540
Just curious.

157
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,930
Alright, I won't touch.

158
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,760
It's so hot today.

159
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,230
Dropped again.

160
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,420
Let me help.

161
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,440
Zo, you're not with L?

162
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,790
Zeemai?

163
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,330
You changed your looks?

164
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,310
A little.

165
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,230
So, is it good?

166
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,880
I think it's the same.

167
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,760
You are still you.

168
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,870
Zeemai.

169
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,040
What?

170
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,880
Wanna have dinner together?

171
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,870
I'll think about it.

172
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,450
- Your order is ready.
- Thank you.

173
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,410
Please come again.

174
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,490
What will you...

175
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,890
P'.

176
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,780
P'?

177
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,460
P'?

178
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,730
Sorry.

179
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,620
What will you have?

180
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,360
I'll have Korean grilled pork with rice.

181
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,030
Wait a moment.

182
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,610
Wa, where did you go yesterday?

183
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,930
I went for a date with P'Jet.

184
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,200
You only just met him a few days 
and you already went on a date with him?

185
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,510
Yeah, he's nice.

186
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,180
He also takes good care of me.

187
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,440
You can care for yourself.

188
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,460
Why do you want
him to care for you?

189
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,750
What's wrong with you? 
Why are you angry at me?

190
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,070
I'm not.

191
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,940
I just don't like
 you to be too easy.

192
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,680
Isn't that too harsh?

193
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,820
Fine, I'm sorry.

194
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,850
I didn't mean that.

195
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,570
Don't me mad at me, please?

196
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,620
Alright.

197
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,210
Wa!

198
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm here.

199
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,820
P'Jet!

200
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,620
I'm starving.

201
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,040
Then...

202
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,780
shall we go for dinner?

203
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,370
Yes, can I have salmon today?

204
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,370
Sure thing.

205
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,140
Guys...

206
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,650
I'm leaving now.

207
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,780
Bye.

208
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,680
Get home safely.

209
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,010
See you.

210
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,040
I've scrolled all over now...

211
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,860
and haven't meet 
someone right for me.

212
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,990
Handsome guys are all gone.

213
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,400
You're too easy. You let him
 deceived you and went with him!

214
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,410
He's just gonna 
play with for a moment.

215
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,890
What the fuck are 
you talking about, Ai'No!

216
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,710
I didn't mean to be this like this.

217
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,500
Even though you see 
it as only a one night stand...

218
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,070
but I have feelings!

219
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,700
When I love someone,
 I love them for real!

220
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,400
Do I look that pervert?

221
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,600
Yes, I am!

222
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,120
But after that day...

223
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,510
I can't forget about him.

224
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,750
No matter how cruel he was to me,
 you'll never understand!

225
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,720
What's the matter with you?

226
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,280
I was insulting someone else, not you!

227
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,120
Is that so?

228
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,220
Then consider earlier as me
 letting out my frustration to you.

229
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,890
Fine.

230
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,880
Just forget about him already.

231
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,210
Just get back to scrolling
 for a couple you were doing.

232
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,100
I can't no more.

233
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,090
I've reached my limit.

234
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,270
The app restricted me.

235
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,070
You need  to get the VIP access.

236
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,540
No, give me yours.

237
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,140
I'm not giving it to you.

238
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,070
You're not fun.

239
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,020
Thank you for taking me for dinner.

240
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,600
You're welcome.

241
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,690
So, why didn't 
you go out with L today?

242
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,310
Why do you always think
I go out with many people?

243
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,360
No, I'm just asking?

244
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,360
My dorm is here. 
You get home safely.

245
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,550
Zeemai.

246
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,380
If it's not me...

247
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,140
don't go out or 
dinner with anyone, OK?

248
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,300
I'm waiting to eat with you.

249
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,080
I won't eat with anyone else.

250
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,890
Why is he not home yet?

251
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,650
He don't eat vegetables.

252
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,890
Damn.

253
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,590
OK.

254
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,970
What movie are we going to watch?

255
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,930
What about horror movie?

256
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,560
Of course. It's exciting.

257
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,320
You like horror movies?

258
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,890
Actually, I like them all.

259
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,690
OK.

260
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,210
So, horror then?

261
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,580
This one.

262
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,830
You're not shock or afraid?

263
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,960
Well, if the ghost is this cute...

264
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,010
I'm willing to be scared.

265
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,630
You're crazy.

266
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,570
What are you talking about?

267
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,820
No more, I'm not staying. I'm leaving.

268
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,910
Too shy to a point of running home?

269
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,730
Wait, I'll send you off.

270
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,470
Pat, thank you for walking me home.

271
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,890
Why?

272
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,610
I should be the one thanking you
 for watching movie with me tonight.

273
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,140
I'm going up to my dorm now.

274
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,360
See you at school tomorrow.

275
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,370
Get home safely.

276
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,500
Let me know when you're home.

277
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,280
You're not sleep yet?

278
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,740
Where were you?

279
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,970
I just came back from Pat's room.

280
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,640
You two are close.

281
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,430
It's not weird for 
me to be close with anyone.

282
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,500
Why are you come back so late?

283
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,890
We were watching movie.

284
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,510
You can watch it here.

285
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,380
It's not the same.

286
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,200
It's same.

287
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,020
- It's not.
- It is.

288
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,810
I'm not arguing anymore.

289
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,630
Have you eaten?

290
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,610
Yes, I had dinner with...

291
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,700
Tisa.

292
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,370
Good.

293
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,260
I'm gonna take a shower.

294
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,760
He went to Ai'Pat's room?

295
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,490
I'm pissed!

296
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,140
What's your name?

297
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,320
You already asked that in the app.

298
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,250
Why are you asking again?

299
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,410
I'm BB.

300
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,290
I'm Earn.

301
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,300
I knew that. You told me in the app.

302
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,540
Krub.

303
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,770
You're so cute in real life.

304
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,040
I know that.

305
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,890
You too.

306
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,860
It's my treat today. Feel free to order.

307
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,930
I want to go home.

308
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,360
What should I do?

309
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,170
You order, I can eat anything.

310
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,040
Menu, please.

311
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,430
You're so well-mannered. I like it.

312
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,750
You like well-mannered person?

313
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,390
Alright, you'll see.

314
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,620
If I eat disgustingly like this, 
he'll stop liking me for sure.

315
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,110
You look so happy when eating.

316
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,110
I'm eating this disgustingly...

317
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,930
you still like me?

318
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,180
He's fucking crazy.

319
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,030
He's with a new guy.

320
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,740
What a brat.

321
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,520
Do you like ice cream?

322
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,390
I do.

323
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,970
Then, I'll order one for you.

324
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,070
One ice cream, please.

325
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,580
It's messy, let me wipe it off.

326
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,660
Any more?

327
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,710
Darling, what are you doing here?

328
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,430
Who is this?

329
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,510
A lottery ticket seller.

330
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,210
Why did you say that, darling?

331
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,140
My boyfriend is not well.

332
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,700
He always forget that
 he already has a boyfriend.

333
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,440
What's your problem?

334
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,100
Sorry, I'm taking him home.

335
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,260
I can't breathe, let me go.

336
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,450
What are you doing?

337
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,050
- Let me go!
- No!

338
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,180
Why don't you let me go?!

339
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,590
Let you go to go 
on with someone else?

340
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,430
I'm wild, so what?

341
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,220
We're nothing to each other!

342
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,010
I won't let you go.

343
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,440
Why? Jealous?

344
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,440
No.

345
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,460
If you're not and not
 thinking about taking responsibility...

346
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,920
then let me go!

347
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,050
You're ruined my mood.

348
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,390
What am I doing?

349
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,840
What's the matter? 
You look stressed.

350
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,250
I had a fight with my family.

351
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,850
Are you OK?

352
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,170
Was it a big fight?

353
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,850
A little.

354
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,060
Wanna eat something sweet?

355
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,500
So you'll get better mood.

356
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,100
Something sweet?

357
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,130
Do you want?

358
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,770
Chin.

359
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,770
What is it?

360
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,680
Can I spend the night in your room?

361
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,150
I don't want to go home yet.

362
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,180
Guys.

363
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,330
For this presentation,
 Zeemai will shoot the acting.

364
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,550
Me and Jet will do the 
explanation and presentation.

365
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,380
- OK?
- OK.

366
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,470
Will you be OK with it?

367
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,580
Ai'Jet?

368
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,260
What's wrong with you lately?

369
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,290
Why do you seem strangely happy?

370
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,040
Did you secretly
 have someone in heart?

371
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,030
Well...

372
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,750
I...

373
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,770
Your mind is
 somewhere else like always.

374
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,890
Stop it!

375
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,090
Tell me. What's up?

376
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,870
Well...

377
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,500
I have a lover now.

378
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,680
Really?

379
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,930
Yes.

380
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,830
But we're not dating long yet.

381
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,860
That's why I didn't tell you guys.

382
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,330
How is the person? Cute?

383
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,780
Where did you guys meet?

384
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,570
Of course cute.

385
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,500
I first met that person in my car.

386
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,740
It's like love at first sight.

387
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,590
I never thought I was 
going to meet the person again.

388
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,820
I'm so envy of you.

389
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,110
I want to have a lover too.

390
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,750
A guy like you, it would be difficult.

391
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,220
Stop bullying him.

392
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,690
Whenever free, 
bring that person to meet us.

393
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,620
Yeah, I will.

394
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,750
Hurry and finish the assignment.

395
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,260
So many assignment lately.

396
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,680
Yeah.

397
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,500
Very.

398
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,950
So, where will you guys go after this

399
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,780
I think I'm gonna grab
 something to eat then go home.

400
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,440
What about you, Ai'Jet?

401
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,690
I think I'm going 
to meet that person.

402
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,040
How sweet.

403
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,540
Do you know what in love means?

404
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,680
It reeks of love in here, right, Zeemai?

405
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,560
What about you?
 Where will you go?

406
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,450
I'm going to the second building.

407
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,680
Then get home safely, guys.

408
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,180
I'm gonna go eat.

409
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,890
OK, I'm going to see the person.

410
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,040
Don't follow me again.

411
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,130
Keep the things.

412
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,320
Take this with you. 
Don't forget to bring it.

413
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,410
Tisa.

414
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,770
I  think...

415
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,720
you should take it easy.

416
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,820
Shouldn't you talk
 it out with your family?

417
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,780
I can't spend the night with you?

418
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,470
It's not that you can't, but...

419
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,360
Ai'U is living with me.

420
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,890
It's out of respect for him.

421
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,050
Can't you talk to him?

422
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,660
I'm just gonna sleep there.

423
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,030
Don't bother,
 I'll spend the night at Jen's place.

424
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,330
Wait up.

425
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,330
What are you doing sitting here alone?

426
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,710
Just thinking about random things.

427
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,090
To that extend?

428
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,250
Who would have fun all day like you?

429
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,340
You scold me again.

430
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,520
I'm not.

431
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,210
But, it's good to be you.

432
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,840
No need to think about anything.

433
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:02,470
No need to do anything and still
have people love and insterested in you.

434
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:06,240
It's not always.

435
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,590
Actually, I'm not so different than you.

436
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,610
I also have things in my mind...

437
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,680
and things that upsets me.

438
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,770
I just choose not to show it to others.

439
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,640
Listen to me.

440
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,570
People who keep his feeling inside...

441
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,600
doesn't mean he's
 all right in everything.

442
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,500
Where did you get that saying?

443
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,280
No, it's the truth.

444
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,280
What's upsetting you? Wanna tell me?

445
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,540
It's nothing, just lonely and boring.

446
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,900
So I just sit here thinking about things.

447
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,840
How about this?

448
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,750
I'll sing for you.

449
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,530
So you'll feel better.

450
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,860
Sure.

451
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,410

458
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,870
P'Jet.

459
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,820
Can I ask you something?

460
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,100
Yes.

461
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,750
Why do you like me?

462
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,660
I don't know.

463
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,770
I just know that I like you.

464
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,900
I know that I fell in love.

465
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,240
I just know that 
I want you as my boyfriend.

466
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,000
What about you?

467
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,750
It's the same.

468
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,860
But don't you think
 we're being too fast?

469
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,790
Do you think I'm not serious?

470
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:10,230
No.

471
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,590
It's just that, I heard...

472
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:15,700
if people date too fast, 
they'll break up too soon.

473
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,680
I don't want to be like that.

474
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,960
If you meet the right person...

475
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,490
we'd feel like not
 wanting to waste time.

476
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,570
You'd want to talk...

477
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,660
date...

478
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,640
and do everything at the fullest.

479
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,240
What will happen in the future...

480
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,830
don't mind about it.

481
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,640
Then...

482
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,290
let's do this to the fullest, P'Jet.

483
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,520
Absolutely.

484
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,930
By the way, Wa...

485
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,960
Yes?

486
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,500
Are you going 
somewhere this Saturday?

487
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,290
This Saturday...

488
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,010
No.

489
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,330
Are you asking
 to go somewhere?

490
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,880
Wanna sleep in my room?
