<i>Audiences under the age of 13

5
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,480
Can we just be friends like before?

6
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,250
Friends my ass, Ai'Chin!

7
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,780
Do you mean friends
 who hug each other...

8
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,670
kissing each other.

9
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,170
Play guitar and sing love song together.

10
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,440
Help me finish the food that I don't eat.

11
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,410
If you mean that kind of friends...

12
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,890
I don't want anymore!

13
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,960
Yu...

14
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,850
You and I...

15
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,320
can no longer go 
back to the way it was.

16
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,050
Ai'Yu!

17
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,200
What's wrong with you?!

18
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,100
Where are you going?

19
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,710
Can you not go?

20
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,990
Let me go, Ai'Chin.

21
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,690
Am I doing the right thing?

22
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,180
Or, actually...

23
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,420
I have no no 
right to be angry at him?

24
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,440
It hurts my head!

25
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,450
I packed all my things like this..

26
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,050
where am I going to stay?

27
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,210
I'm gonna call Ai'Zeemai

28
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,280
Hello?

29
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,720
What's up, Yu?

30
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,000
<i>Hello, Zeemai. Are you at home?</i>

31
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,530
I am.

32
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,850
Can I go see you? 
I'm having some trouble.

33
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,010
Of course.

34
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,100
<i>OK, see you at your house?</i>

35
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,620
OK, see you.

36
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,350
Is it too little?

37
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,280
I'll add more.

38
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,460
Yu...

39
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,200
What kind of makeup is that?

40
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,680
Speak for yourself.

41
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,490
Why is your face like that?

42
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,980
I'll tell you later.

43
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,660
Let's get inside first.

44
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,030
What makeup is that?

45
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,540
Your makeup look like a singer.

46
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,960
- Is it that bad?
- Yes.

47
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,320
Tell me.

48
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,310
Don't just sit there.

49
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,670
I like Ai'Chin.

50
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,780
And I...

51
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,040
OK. I know everything now.

52
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,570
No need to continue.

53
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,590
You do?

54
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,890
I can tell for some time now.

55
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,520
Yes, that's what it is.

56
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,500
What should I do now?

57
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,810
Seriously, you shouldn't 
run away like this.

58
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,990
Talk to him clearly.

59
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,160
Think about it.

60
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,030
If you're angry at each other but
 see each other at school everyday...

61
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,370
won't that makes you feel awkward?

62
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,010
Yeah, you're right.

63
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,980
I'll clear things up with him later.

64
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,800
Right now, I need to rest.

65
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,980
Last night, I didn't sleep.

66
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,020
OK.

67
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,000
Go rest, 
I'm gonna go wash my face.

68
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,410
E'B, what's wrong?

69
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,270
You've been
 upset for many days now.

70
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,050
I miss that guy.

71
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,530
He never think about calling me?

72
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,520
Go to him,
 forcefully and not holding back.

73
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,690
Do you think it's a good idea?

74
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,950
Absolutely. Trust me, you can do it.

75
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,730
Fight to get him.

76
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,380
Get a grip!

77
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,030
I will regain my pureness back.

78
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,710
Here you go.

79
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,270
Enjoy your meal.

80
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,360
What will you have?

81
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,500
Move away.

82
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,040
Move, I'm in a hurry. Move!

83
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,530
So, what are you
 gonna do about that night?

84
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,800
Let's clear things up.

85
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,920
Don't you feel guilty whatsoever?

86
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,300
Again?!

87
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,950
OK.

88
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,990
I don't know.

89
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,770
Just a moment.

90
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,640
P'Tin.

91
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,320
I miss you.

92
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,220
Let's date.

93
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,550
Alright, wait here for a sec.

94
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,050
He'll be mine for sure.

95
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,250
He's be mine.

96
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,850
I've been lonely for so long.

97
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,790
Eat this and go home.

98
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,300
Again?!

99
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,420
Fine!

100
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,140
You wanna play it that way?

101
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,490
You'll see.

102
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,740
Miss customer.

103
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,390
P'Tin, are you really
not gonna date me?

104
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,560
Why is this again?

105
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,890
Your order is here.

106
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,280
P'Tin...

107
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,430
I miss you.

108
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,100
Let's date.

109
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,860
Wait just a sec.

110
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Again?

111
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,490
Excuse me.

112
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:15,040
P'Tin, how are you gonna
 be responsible for this baby?

113
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,070
Again?!

114
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,790
I can't take this anymore!

115
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,170
Tired from school today?

116
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,590
A little, you?

117
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,020
Not at all.

118
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,790
I'm tired about something else.

119
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,870
What is it?

120
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,930
Tired of missing you.

121
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,260
How sweet.

122
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,420
Are you this sweet to everyone?

123
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,390
No.

124
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,300
Just with you.

125
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,590
I believe you.

126
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,910
So...

127
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,000
are you going anywhere tomorrow?

128
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,120
I'm free tomorrow.

129
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,620
Why?

130
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,530
Let's go for a date?

131
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,710
OK.

132
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,750
Yes!

133
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,500
Then stop being cute.

134
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,290
Go to bed.

135
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,590
OK, see you tomorrow.

136
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,140
Good night.

137
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,320
Good night.

138
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,770
Zeemai.

139
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,500
I've made up my mind.

140
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,440
I think I'm gonna go back.

141
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,630
You miss Chin?

142
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,300
No.

143
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,200
I just remember
 that I paid for the rent.

144
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,750
It would be a 
waste if I don't live there.

145
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,610
I'm leaving.

146
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,990
See you at school tomorrow, Yu.

147
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,770
You forgive me?

148
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,810
Yes. Forget about it.

149
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,810
Just let it pass.

150
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,890
As for...

151
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,400
about me liking you...

152
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,200
don't think about it too much.

153
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,080
I've made up my mind.

154
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,220
I won't have any
 feeling for you anymore.

155
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,040
We'll be friends again.

156
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,790
Alright.

157
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,200
That's good.

158
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,460
You can date Tisa as normal.

159
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,670
I'm gonna take a shower, it's sticky.

160
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,850
P'Jed.

161
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,900
Did you wait long?

162
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,420
No.

163
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,210
What should we
 have for lunch today?

164
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,260
Up to you.

165
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,660
Why so easy on me?

166
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,470
If you think so, then invite me
 for dinner some other times.

167
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,820
But...

168
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,210
I eat a lot, can you handle that?

169
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,190
Absolutely.

170
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,330
So, shall we go lunch?

171
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,430
Yes.

172
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,610
That restaurant?

173
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,050
Sure.

174
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,750
That one?

175
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,650
Did you have fun today?

176
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,480
I had so much today.

177
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,070
Thank you so much.

178
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,280
So...

179
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,500
what day will be our next date?

180
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,330
Next date...

181
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,750
What day do you mean?

182
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,050
The day we'll be boyfriends.

183
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,600
You're such sweet talker, P'Jed.

184
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,660
<i>[ In Thai, smooth tongue is said as "bpahk 
wahn" which translated as "sweet mouth" ]</i>

185
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,050
It really is sweet.

186
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,410
I'm leaving.

187
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,520
Let me know when you're home.

188
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,790
Are you asleep?

189
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,650
Are you alright?

190
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,260
I'm fine.

191
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,790
Really?

192
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,880
Yes.

193
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,200
Then, give me your hand.

194
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,180
I want to give you something.

195
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,170
It's my turn to clean the table today.

196
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,500
But I'm tired.

197
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,820
Please do it for me?

198
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,100
That cute expression again.

199
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,500
Do you think I'm gonna fall for that?

200
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,530
Sure thing, Zo. I'll do it for you.

201
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,580
Then, I'm counting on you.

202
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,820
He doesn't love me and 
on top of that, he tricked me.

203
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,910
Such a terrible guy.

204
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,480
But I'll do it for you.

205
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,790
L.

206
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,020
I have something to give you today.

207
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,430
Really? What is it?

208
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,780
Close your eyes.

209
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,650
You can open them now.

210
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,540
Where is it?

211
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,040
It's this handsome
 face that I want you to see.

212
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,070
Is this it?

213
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,180
Handsome but weird.

214
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,950
I already know you're handsome.

215
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,870
Thank you, God.
 For giving me this handsome face.

216
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,850
Do you like this then?

217
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,430
I knew you have
 something for me for sure.

218
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,810
This. Do you like it?

219
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,920
If you like it, you can photo of it.

220
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,600
Is this it?

221
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,090
OK, I'll take a photo of it.

222
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,930
Again?

223
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,340
- Let's go, Zo.
- Where?

224
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,900
- Just go.
- Have you taken the photo?

225
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,540
Let's just go from here.

226
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,450
- You can keep the photo.
- Let's just go, Zo.

227
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,300
Yu.

228
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,480
How are you?

229
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,860
I'm OK, I'm good.

230
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,310
So, why are you walking alone?

231
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,040
It's Ai'Jed's turn
 to clean the classroom.

232
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,640
And Ai'Zeemai clean the 
classroom in Ai'Zo's place.

233
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,360
So, have you eaten?

234
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,940
No yet, I'm about to.

235
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,720
Me too.

236
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,610
You don't have anything to do?

237
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,380
No, I'm free.

238
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,350
Then let's go eat together.

239
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,220
Eat together?

240
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,770
Well...

241
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,260
Aside from rice and alcohol...

242
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,510
what else do you want to eat?

243
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,040
You're making
 that shocked face again.

244
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,640
Your shocked face is kinda funny.

245
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,750
Let's just go.

246
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,070
Shall we sit here?

247
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,420
It's good.

248
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,870
What?

249
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,500
It's just the chicken.

250
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,860
It's true.

251
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,740
What class you'll 
have in the afternoon?

252
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,980
English class.

253
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,480
The teacher is very good, 
I like him very much.

254
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,840
Chin, why did you took my veggies?

255
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,440
I eat them.

256
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,950
Sorry.

257
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,090
I want that.

258
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,640
Give it back, I want it.

259
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,400
OK, alright.

260
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,750
Pat.

261
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,050
I'll feed you.

262
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,750
You're not eating?

263
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,360
Yes.

264
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,080
Tisa.

265
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,640
You're still hungry yet?

266
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,090
I'll feed you.

267
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,960
What mood are you in now?

268
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,510
It's good.

269
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,720
Another bite.

270
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,680
How's it?

271
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,870
Chin, do it properly.

272
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,400
It's full in your mouth.

273
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,890
Pat, I'm sorry.

274
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,150
Are you alright?

275
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,920
Tisa, I'm sorry.

276
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,610
Do I look that hungry?

277
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,480
It's alright.

278
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,970
I'm OK.

279
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:24,930
Sorry.

280
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,590
Seeing you're feeding me that much...

281
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,280
you don't have much left for you.

282
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,820
Take mine.

283
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,220
I want this.

284
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,470
Can I?

285
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,030
Of course.

286
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,570
I'll give them all to you.

287
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,330
Tisa, where are you going?

288
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,950
I'm not telling.

289
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,890
Wait for me.

290
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,180
More?

291
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,460
No more, it's enough.

292
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,410
Zeemai.

293
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,830
Why are you doing this in Ai'Zo's place.

294
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,720
I don't see any problem with it.

295
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,630
Zo has an errand to do.

296
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,800
Don't you think 
about liking someone else?

297
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,910
How can we change our heart 
to love someone else that easy?

298
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,930
But I think you need to
 start changing yourself first.

299
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,900
I don't think Ai'Zo will take 
any interest with you looking like this.

300
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,110
Why?

301
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,880
What's wrong with my looks?

302
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,960
It's old-fashion, dull and plain.

303
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,310
Like a plain soup.

304
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,170
It's old-fashion, dull and plain.

305
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,660
Like a plain soup.

306
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,120
Ohm

307
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,660
Sawasdee krub, today we'll...

308
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,480
we're shooting the series...

309
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,300
I mean take a photo for posters.

310
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,470
Yes, yes

311
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,290
Let's go again.

312
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,290
Sawasdee krub, we're going to
 take photos for the series posters.

313
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,580
Acting like everything never happened

314
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,220
Right now, they're...

315
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,580
This is Mr. Pairat, the photographer.

316
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,290
Sawasdee krub.

317
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,840
Sawasdee krub.

318
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,590
Oat

319
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,280
How's today?

320
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,680
I'm very nervous.

321
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,100
It's my first job that I have taken.

322
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,100
It's Oat's first filming series

323
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,090
I'll do my best.

324
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,280
Dong

325
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,600
Sawasdee krub,
 I'm here to support N'Ohm.

326
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,420
How are you feeling?

327
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,790
Well, kinda scared.

328
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,540
Because it will be our turn next.

329
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,720
N'Ohm, all the best.

330
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,210
Good.

331
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,210
Look at each others' eyes.

332
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,020
Smile and make it like...

333
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,250
You look down to him.

334
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:20,180
Smile. 1, 2...

335
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,110
Move closer to him.

336
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,210
Sawasdee krub.

337
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,480
How's today. 
What will you do today?

338
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,720
We'll be taking photos.

339
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:47,140
Today, we're changing the
 environment to the studio.

340
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,260
What is your name?

341
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,140
I'm Tee.

342
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,360
Tee, Sawasdee krub.

343
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,280
What will be shooting? 
Is it your first time?

344
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,900
Yes, first time with Cloth Lab.

345
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,040
1, 2, 3. Look here.

346
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,670
1, 2... Smile.

347
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,340
OK, 1, 2, 3.

348
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,080
Do it like... yes.

349
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:38,830
Pie

350
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,830
Thank you.

351
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,780
Tensed?

352
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,920
Come take a photo unexpectedly!

353
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,290
Yes.

354
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,940
The camera is here.

355
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,860
Pray for blessing before performing !

356
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,410
I'm so nervous.

357
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,280
Shy?

358
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,690
Very shy.

359
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,040
First time?

360
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,150
It's not like shooting photo that day.

361
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,820
So I'm bit scared.

362
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,060
Start.

363
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,970
1, 2, start.

364
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,430
Be natural and touch his nose.

365
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,960
1, 2...

366
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:54,950
Cloth Lab Entertainment proudly present...

367
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,650
the behind the scenes of poster 
photo and new photoshoots...

368
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:03,000
for the stars of Restart(ed) 
or Can I Love Again.

369
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,160
What's the atmosphere like?

370
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,220
If you're ready, let's take a look.

371
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,800
Sawasdee krub, 
welcome to the filming site.

372
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:25,860
Today, we're going to take a
 collection of photos of Restart(ed) actors.

373
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,470
Or "Can I Love Again".
