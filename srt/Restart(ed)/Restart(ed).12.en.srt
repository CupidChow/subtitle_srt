00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,360
Hello, P'.

40
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,540
<i>You've been MIA ever since
 you graduated from grade 12.</i>

41
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,590
<i>Not thinking about seeing me?</i>

42
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,810
It's not like that.

43
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,410
<i>Are you coming for my birthday?</i>

44
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,200
Who will go?

45
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,640
<i>The usual gang.</i>

46
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,480
<i>Then there are my junior.</i>

47
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,080
<i>Same grade as you.</i>

48
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,750
Who?

49
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,810
<i>Ai'U and Ai'Jed</i>

50
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,930
Ai'U?

51
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,650
This U guy...

52
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,890
which university is
 he studying, do you know?

53
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,610
<i>It seems to be the 
same university as you.</i>

54
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,930
<i>I noticed he's been looking
 for a dorm and a roommate.</i>

55
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,870
Is that so?

56
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,800
Then...

57
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,870
see you at the party.

58
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,850
I love him.

59
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,080
I really love him.

60
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,300
I don't know what to do anymore.

61
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,980
Right now, 
my dad is forcing to be with Tisa.

62
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,070
If I don't do it, he will cut ties with me.

63
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,430
Now I dare not tell
 him that I am not with Tisa.

64
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,380
Because I want him to get over me.

65
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,510
I still want to be with him.

66
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,460
I want to see him every morning.

67
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,240
I want to always talk to him.

68
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,000
I want to see him smile everyday.

69
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,530
I'm scare.

70
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,370
I'm really not ready to lose him.

71
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:53,470
Let's start over for I've
previously always disappointed you

72
00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:03,330
I'm sorry that I made you
 cried because I've failed

73
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,140
Dude...

74
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,780
What do you think Ai'U's doing?

75
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,620
Oh yeah...

76
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,880
Damn, I'm so worried.

77
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,220
We're worried, right?

78
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,930
Will he come to class today?

79
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,530
I don't think he will.

80
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,570
Do you expect me
to say it again, Ai'Zeemai!

81
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,190
It hurts.

82
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,830
Jed, stop it.

83
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,510
You let me talking to myself for so long!

84
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,840
Don't you ever think about your friends?!

85
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,930
Just spending time 
with your man all the time!

86
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,320
What if something happen to him
 after I gave him a right yesterday...

87
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,170
should I be feeling guilty?!

88
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,750
Jed...

89
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,140
Don't scold him.

90
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,210
I was the one asked
 him to chat with me.

91
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,870
Thanks, dude...

92
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,620
for sending him there.

93
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,280
You're here?

94
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,550
So, what happened to your face?

95
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,670
Chin's father tease me a bit.

96
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,930
Chin's father 
must be very fond of you.

97
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,600
He teased quite harshly.

98
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,760
Do you want to get tease too?

99
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,840
If you bully Zeemai again...

100
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,890
I'll sing to you.

101
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,600
Fine.

102
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,190
I won't bully him anymore.

103
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,130
But don't sing to anyone anymore.

104
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,960
Promise?

105
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,790
Alright, I won't bully him.

106
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,940
Alright, promise.

107
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,210
Who did this to you?

108
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,240
Just look at these two guys.

109
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,890
Dude, are you free today?

110
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,340
Let's go out together.

111
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,210
I already have a date with P'Jed.

112
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,220
Sorry.

113
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,120
Alright, alright, alright.

114
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,910
Next time, OK?

115
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,680
OK.

116
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,670
Guys...

117
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,420
where's E'B today?

118
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,090
I don't know either.

119
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,900
I think...

120
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,020
he's probably with P'Tin.

121
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,770
E'B...

122
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,360
is busy with his man.

123
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,630
E'Wa...

124
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,420
you should be more wary.

125
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,940
Ano, I bought a snack for you.

126
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,040
E'Jeng...

127
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,860
you're acting weird lately.

128
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,940
Can I have some?

129
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,070
No.

130
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,840
Go ask P'Jed to buy for you.

131
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,400
This, I bought for Ano.

132
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,950
If you dare to feed 
the snack to him again...

133
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,490
I'll kill you for sure.

134
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,490
Thank you...

135
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,300
for being my boyfriend.

136
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,000
Zo...

137
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,480
there are so many people here.

138
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,210
You're not shy?

139
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,720
Why should I?

140
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,060
I was just hugging my boyfriend.

141
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,290
Wanna sleep at my house tonight?

142
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,260
Silent like this...

143
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,940
that means you agree.

144
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,330
Glasses!

145
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,750
Can you stop being cute?

146
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,810
Probably can't.

147
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,580
Auntie, you're hurting me.

148
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,380
I don't know what you're doing.

149
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,620
Look at this.

150
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,410
If you want to be my daughter-in law, 
you need to endure this. Understand?!

151
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,410
So irritating!

152
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,410
You're hitting me again.

153
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,220
<i>Fighting!</i>

154
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,960
P'Tin, what does that mean?

155
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,270
Su-su (fighting)!

156
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,550
Fighting.

157
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,260
Fighting!

158
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:33,590
U, wanna go have lunch together?

159
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,240
Yeah.

160
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,650
Go on ahead.

161
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,520
Ai'Chin.

162
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,600
I need to talk to you.

163
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,130
Let U go.

164
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,050
But...

165
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,620
Trust me.

166
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,220
Let's go.

167
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,140
Thank you.

168
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,350
Do you have 
anything to talk to me?

169
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Wait.

170
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,400
Didn't you who 
wanted to talk to me?

171
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,030
Yes, that's true too.

172
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,630
But I think you might
 have more to tell me.

173
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,920
I've decided...

174
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,580
that I...

175
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,470
will make my own decision.

176
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,500
Even though it's difficult.

177
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,010
It doesn't matter if my 
dad doesn't understand me.

178
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,210
I just want U to be with me, that's all.

179
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,910
I don't need anything else.

180
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,190
I think Ai'U...

181
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,510
really is my happiness.

182
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,090
and I won't make him sad again.

183
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,890
Yeah.

184
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,990
Hearing you saying that...

185
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,600
I can rest assured...

186
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,660
that you won't hurt him again.

187
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,340
I'm leaving.

188
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,360
Ai'Chin.

189
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,690
This time...

190
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,530
don't let him go again.

191
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,980
We...

192
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,010
don't always get
 a chance to start over.

193
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,450
Yeah.

194
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,070
See you.

195
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,750
Pat.

196
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,350
I'm here.

197
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,250
What happened to you?

198
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,010
No, it's nothing.

199
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,400
Let's go.

200
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,620
U...

201
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,210
I want to ask you something.

202
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,620
What is it?

203
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,900
Are you free this evening?

204
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,360
Why?

205
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,860
Well, I...

206
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,610
want to ask you to go to this one place.

207
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,970
Can you?

208
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,650
OK.

209
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:59,100
U, I have something to tell you. Meet me
 here this evening. I'll be waiting for you

210
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,880
U?

211
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,340
Let's go.

212
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,120
OK.

213
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,330
Are you doing your best?

214
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,720
That's it?

215
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,080
What kind of daughter--in-law is this, son?

216
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,300
Where did you find him?

217
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,650
Don't cry!

218
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,940
Auntie!

219
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,730
I did my best!

220
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,690
Calm down, do it slowly.

221
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,970
Here, let me teach you.

222
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,950
Am I not doing my best yet?

223
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,440
Today...

224
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,770
your mother isn't home?

225
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,460
No.

226
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,300
It's so happen that she's going outstation.

227
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,240
OK.

228
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,210
P'Jed.

229
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,080
Wait here for a moment.

230
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,160
I'll get something to eat.

231
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,630
OK.

232
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,370
Strawberries are here.

233
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,550
Thank you.

234
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,650
Does it look delicious?

235
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,560
Yes but not as good as you.

236
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,760
Wa...

237
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,990
Look at this series.

238
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,070
The hero is so stupid.

239
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,720
He always go in the rain.

240
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,090
Got him wet all over.

241
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,690
If it were me...

242
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,010
I'd wear a raincoat or use an umbrella.

243
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,850
So I won't get wet.

244
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,540
As for the heroine...

245
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,100
she's so stubborn.

246
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,640
He tells her to wait and she
 did it even when it's raining heavily.

247
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,250
There's a car and even under 
the roof where there's no rain.

248
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,780
But in this series, she's cute.

249
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,630
Her name is Tee or whatever it was.

250
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,090
Small...

251
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,260
and so cute.

252
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,800
But she's just so stubborn.

253
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,650
You'll see...

254
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,460
you'll see how it ends.

255
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,400
Then what do you think...

256
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,330
Pat, what are you doing?

257
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,130
Nothing.

258
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,830
So, where are you taking me?

259
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,480
We'll be there shortly.

260
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,340
Are you tired?

261
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,310
Wanna take a break?

262
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,290
No.

263
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,610
It's comfortable to walk 
while breathe in fresh air.

264
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,760
What should we do now?

265
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,060
Let's take shelter from the rain.

266
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,240
Well...

267
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,170
we'll wait here a moment.

268
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,790
The rain might stop soon.

269
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,520
What's in your mind?

270
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,940
Nothing.

271
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,850
Do you remember
 the first time we meet?

272
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,780
I do.

273
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,270
It was the first time...

274
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,220
that my shirt got spilled...

275
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,590
and it made me happy.

276
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,860
It's the first time
 watching a ghost movie...

277
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,520
but I wasn't afraid of the ghost.

278
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,120
It is the first time I feel like
 I want to take care of someone.

279
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,760
It's the first time 
I've seen someone get hurt...

280
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,370
and I got hurt as well.

281
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,430
But do you know...

282
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,860
I'm happy every time I'm near you.

283
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,210
Whether it's the little things...

284
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,470
that you do for me...

285
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,940
or I did it for you.

286
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,140
But now, I'm not so sure...

287
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,340
that the love born from this...

288
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,990
is it too late?

289
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,290
U...

290
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,910
between us...

291
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,220
will it be possible?

292
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,080
Pat.

293
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,910
You don't have to say anything.

294
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,640
If you feel the same way as I do...

295
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,110
just put your hand on the left...

296
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,800
like this.

297
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,630
But if my love is one-sided...

298
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,790
you raise your right hand.

299
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,180
If it's not too late, 
I want to ask you to love me again

300
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,060
I promise to reassure you

301
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:46,540
That I love, love only you

302
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,660
Pat...

303
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,040
I'm sorry.

304
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,890
It's alright, U.

305
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,070
I'm OK.

306
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,760
Pat.

307
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,250
I have to go now.

308
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,340
U, wait.

309
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,490
Thank you, Pat.

310
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,930
But keep it.

311
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,240
I have to go now.

312
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,010
Mr. Spilled Shirt.

313
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:11,960
<i>♫ Even if it takes a lot of time I will stand here unchanged ♫</i>

00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:16,180

331
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,180
I finally caught you.

332
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,120
U...

333
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,800
listen to me.

334
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,280
I like you.

335
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,590
I love you.

336
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,620
I love you since I met you.

337
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,280
I love your true self.

338
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,050
Everything about you.

339
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,110
No matter how bitter
life was in the past...

340
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,520
as long as I have you...

341
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,580
by my side.

342
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,910
I've been waiting for 
you when I saw you before.

343
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,030
Until I met you again...

344
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,750
at P'Rud's birthday party.

345
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,750
So I want to give myself a chance.

346
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,890
A chance that I...

347
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,960
can regain in this life.

348
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,350
But it was me...

349
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,850
who's an asshole.

350
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,650
I was a coward.

351
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,950
And becasue of my own arrogant...

352
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,390
that got you hurt.

353
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,170
That got you cried all the time.

354
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,250
I don't know if this time...

355
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,220
will be my last...

356
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,970
tobe in your life?

357
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,070
I want to ask you...

358
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,710
can I love you again?

359
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,340
I'll give you 10 more chances.

360
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:39,170
<i>♫ Please, once again, 
can we love each other again? ♫</i>

361
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:51,530
<i>♫ One more time, I want to hold you tight,
 please come back to the way it was ♫</i>

362
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:57,180
<i>♫ One more time, I just want you to look back ♫</i>

363
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:01,960
<i>♫ One more time, I promise from now on ♫</i>

364
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:07,230
<i>♫ I will only love you ♫</i>

365
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:15,140
<i>♫ Because today I just understand how it is without you ♫</i>

366
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:20,040
<i>♫ I just learn the truth in my heart ♫</i>

367
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:25,700
<i>♫ How much I love you ♫</i>

368
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,340
Zeemai...

369
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,010
Wake up...

370
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,780
or you'll be late.

371
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,380
What time is it?

372
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,220
7 AM.

373
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:49,330
I'm sleepy.

374
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,380
Did you sleep well last night?

375
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,310
Did you sleep well?

376
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:41,340
Did I really lose my virginity to you?

377
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,840
Yes.

378
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,340
You did.

379
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,880
Why are you so "delicious"?

380
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,700
You're crazy.

381
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,200
Go take a shower so
 we can go to class together.

382
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,460
I lose my virginity for the first time.

383
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,000
I should tell U about this.

384
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:59,640
Did you have fun today?

385
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,720
Yes, will we go there again?

386
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,870
Next time.

387
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:06,200
But going to so
 many places can be tiring.

388
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,620
I'm tired too.

389
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,950
When will you be free next time?

390
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,030
I'll always free as long as you ask me out.

391
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,620
OK. Next time, 
we'll go meet Ai'U. He wants to see you.

392
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,980
P'U that you told me about?

393
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,570
Yes, he's my best friend.

394
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:31,720
Alright.

395
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,530
So cute.

396
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,800
That's your friend, right?

397
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:47,940
E'Jeng!

398
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,400
Traitorous friend.

399
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,420
You've been toying with me...

400
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,200
like it's meaningless.

401
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,100
Who are you talking to?

402
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,130
No, no, no. I'm closing my ears.

403
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,830
Wa, wait for me!

404
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,120
Dude, I'm here.

405
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,860
You said you're
 gonna wear short pants.

406
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:31,980
It's not short.

407
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,090
It's short!

408
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,430
- It's not short.
- It's short! Go change.

409
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,080
Why are you being too serious?

410
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,330
I don't want people to stare...

411
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,230
at your legs.

412
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,550
Please? Go change?

413
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,560
I'm lazy to go and change.

414
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,590
Just for today, please?

415
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,350
Please?

416
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,920
Please?

417
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,730
Let's go.

418
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:35,240
Mom.

419
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:38,090
OK, Dad.

420
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:13,340
I love you, son

421
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,970
1 Year Later

422
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,260
Nobody knows when it's started.

423
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,120
All we know that it's already started.

424
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:37,700
And we don't know when it will end.

425
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:40,990
Like before, when we realize it again...

426
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,150
it started all over again.

427
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:44,760
Again...

428
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,620
and again.

429
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:49,810
Like we don't know 
when everything will end.

430
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:53,110
Like the relationship 
between the three of us.

431
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,700
The word love has a different 
value in everyone's heart.

432
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,070
Some people choose to give it first.

433
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,620
Some people choose to accept it first.

434
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:06,980
But in the end...

435
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,560
whether you give or accept...

436
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:12,330
we all feel happiness in love.

437
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,440
If you're in pain...

438
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,940
please don't blame love.

439
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:20,870
Love is a beautiful thing.

440
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,940
Although it will be painful...

441
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,460
it will always be in our hearts.

442
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,730
Various memories make
 us aware of starting over.

443
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,960
No matter who you start with...

444
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:35,270
please be happy.

445
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,170
I hope that, one day...

446
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:39,940
those who're looking for love...

447
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:42,100
won't lose hope of looking.

448
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:10,300
P', I'm sorry.

449
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,590
I was talking while walking.
 I didn't mean it.

450
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,760
It spilled all over your shirt.

451
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,760
It's alright.

452
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:22,070
It'll come off when washed.

453
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,410
I feel bad.

454
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,010
Here's the deal, let me wash it for you.

455
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:37,870
You'd do that?

456
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,650
Yes, I'd do it.

457
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:46,540
Just a sec.

458
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,290
Zeenam, focus.

459
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,080
Can I have your phone number?

460
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,440
I'll call you when I finished wash it.

461
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,640
OK.

462
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,160
Give me your phone.

463
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,090
Nong.

464
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,290
What is your name?

465
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:02,900
Yim.

466
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,060
My name is Yim.

467
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,360
It's your fault that 
got me into trouble.

468
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,550
P'U.

469
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,260
Perfect timing.

470
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,110
Wash it for me.

471
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:55,460
You messed it up, 
wash it yourself.

472
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,610
What the heck?

473
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:58,350
We're siblings.

474
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,130
Can you help me out?
