00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,340
Here.

7
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,110
What is this?

8
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,870
A present for you.

9
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,600
For what occasion?

10
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,110
I...

11
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,810
like you.

12
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,550
I like you very much.

13
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,120
I like you for a long time now.

14
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,780
Here.

15
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,380
I don't think I can accept it.

16
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,240
Why?

17
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,840
My parents want me to
 pay attention in my studies.

18
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,340
They want me to
 only focus on studying.

19
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,580
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,000
I can't be in a
 relationship with anyone.

21
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,910
OK.

22
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,940
That's alright.

23
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,110
I'll wait for you.

24
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,930
I'll also support you always.

25
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,700
Zeemai.

26
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,030
I bought you drinks.

27
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,770
Thank you, Zo.

28
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,620
Did you sleep well last night?

29
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,340
I did...

30
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,220
because someone
 wished me goodnight.

31
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,510
You said you don't
 have time to be in a relationship,

32
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,610
you're graduated

33
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,610
until

34
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,610
I will wait

35
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,790
You're Zeemai, right?

36
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,760
Come with me.

37
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,970
What are you with Zo?

38
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,220
How boring...

39
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,840
now I have to face this?

40
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,250
Why quiet?

41
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,940
I asked, what are you with Zo?

42
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,490
Nothing.

43
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,390
What nothing?

44
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,790
I saw you being all soft with him.

45
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,450
I saw Zo touching your hair...

46
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,180
and smile at you.

47
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
No.

48
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,400
I can't be bully like this again.

49
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,650
What should I do?

50
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,480
U and Jed are not here too.

51
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,610
I should be able to 
win if I make a move first.

52
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,320
Why are you quiet? 
I asked, what is your relationship...

53
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,010
Zeemai!

54
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,760
Are you alright?

55
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,220
I'm fine. I'm OK.

56
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,320
Hey, if you bother 
him again, you'll be sorry.

57
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,960
I was just asking him...

58
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,410
what are your 
relationship with each other.

59
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,110
He didn't have to do this.

60
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,080
So I can move on.

61
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,370
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,180
You got hurt
 because of me again.

63
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,140
It's alright.

64
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,730
I'm fine.

65
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,400
If anyone do this to you again...

66
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,090
let me know.

67
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,160
It's not a big deal, I'm fine.

68
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,120
I won't be soft and
 let anyone bully me again.

69
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,990
Because I'm the new Zeemai.

70
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,150
You're still the 
same Zeemai as before.

71
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,180
What do you mean the same?

72
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,000
I've changed myself a lot.

73
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,680
You like the current me, right?

74
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,930
Before this...

75
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,730
I already like you.

76
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,290
The present...

77
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,340
I also like.

78
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,600
You never take interest 
in me when I wore glasses.

79
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,980
You went with other 
people all over the place.

80
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,750
Well, at that time...

81
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,260
I was all over the place.

82
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,470
A player.

83
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,590
I fear I might hurt you.

84
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,840
And I thought to myself
 that you can wait for me.

85
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,120
But when you changed yourself...

86
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,110
I was afraid that 
someone else will court you...

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,970
and you won't take interest in me.

88
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,340
Good...

89
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,520
that you know how it feels when 
playing with someone else' feelings.

90
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,020
I know that now.

91
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,250
Zeemai.

92
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,120
What?

93
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,900
I...

94
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,470
Can I have another chance?

95
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,910
If I don't give you the chance, 
who else am I going to give it to?

96
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,860
I've been having crush on you...

97
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,000
and it's been for a long time now.

98
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,400
Your glasses...

99
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,840
I'll hold on to it...

100
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,580
in case one day, you don't want 
to wear contact lenses anymore.

101
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,920
Thank you.

102
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,780
What should we have for lunch.

103
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,870
You're not going with Tisa?

104
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,790
I rather have it with you.

105
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,830
You've been acting weird lately.

106
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,120
No I'm not.

107
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,160
I want to have 
lunch with you everyday.

108
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,910
It's just you...

109
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,330
who always go with Ai'Pat.

110
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,100
It's more delicious with Ai'Pat.

111
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,990
U.

112
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,210
After the test, 
lest go for an outing together?

113
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,740
Sure, let's go.

114
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,370
Good.

115
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,920
I can invite my boyfriend too.

116
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,380
Zo.

117
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,810
Wanna come?

118
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,690
If you go, then I'll go.

119
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,100
If you go...

120
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,570
I'll go too.

121
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,030
You should go with Tisa.

122
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,620
No.

123
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,990
I want to go with you.

124
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,740
Before we go anywhere...

125
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,780
let's pass the exam first, OK?

126
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,100
I know that. We're going
to study at Zo's house, right?

127
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,670
You two are not fighting anymore?

128
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,510
Then, I'll put things 
back in order first.

129
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,540
Yeah.

130
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,780
Zeemai, where are you going?

131
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,800
Zeemai!

132
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,120
- Packing things up.
- Help your friends here.

133
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,210
He can do that alone.

134
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,120
What time will you finish school?

135
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:14,890
What time will you finish school?

136
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:14,890
3 PM

137
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,230

Alright

Finished?

145
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,240
What should we eat today?

146
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,970
I'm fine with anything.

147
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,850
Wanna eat with me?

148
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,100
Don't.

149
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,820
You guys go on ahead, 
I have something to do.

150
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,290
Yeah, me too.

151
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,780
OK, OK. Take care.

152
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,780
There are only three of us left.

153
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,560
What now?

154
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,740
What should we eat?

155
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,490
What about buffet?

156
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,240
- Interesting.
- 3 plus 1, let's find a cute one
 at the restaurant to join us.

157
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,920
Let's go.

158
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,290
Wait, guys.

159
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,010
Hello.

160
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,470
<i>Where are you?</i>

161
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,640
About to go out for lunch.

162
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,810
<i>Have lunch with me.</i>

163
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,990
I'm about to go with...

164
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,630
<i>Don't let me lose my patience.</i>

165
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,790
I'll be there.

166
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,310
You guys go on.

167
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,750
I'll be there later.

168
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,670
Just the two of us now.

169
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,590
Let's find 2 more 
cuties at the restaurant.

170
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,180
Hello, Pat.

171
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,290
<i>Hello, U.</i>

172
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,480
Wanna go for lunch?

173
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
<i>Sure.</i>

174
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,980
<i>See you downstairs
 in front of the building.</i>

175
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,530
OK.

176
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,310
Alright, you go on. I get it.

177
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,730
Then, I'll go now.

178
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,170
See you later.

179
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,600
That leaves just me.

180
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,950
Chin, shall we go visit 
your father this Saturday?

181
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,280
You haven't been home for weeks, have you?

182
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,930
I don't want to.

183
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,960
Then why don't we go out together?

184
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,990
We haven't done it a long time now.

185
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,340
I have work to do.

186
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,070
You can do it on other day, right?

187
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,850
I already promised my friends.

188
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,620
Chin, you can't in everything.

189
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,240
Tisa.

190
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,210
Everything I did was more than enough.

191
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,640
What more do you want?

192
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,500
You should know why 
I have the right to ask you of that.

193
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,120
Not enough excuse now?
 Then use more excuses.

194
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,600
Anything more excuses?

195
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,870
Fine.

196
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,180
You'll see...

197
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,600
that I won't be only
 threaten you with your father.

198
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,390
I must see you at
 your house on Saturday.

199
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,990
U.

200
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,440
What is it?

201
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,350
Ever since we've been close...

202
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,190
I haven't ask you out on a date yet.

203
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,640
That means you want to
 invite me on a date now?

204
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,570
Yes.

205
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,470
Wanna go?

206
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,380
Of course.

207
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,320
Even to watch movie at your room...

208
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,140
I already went.

209
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,840
Why can't I go on a date with you?

210
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,540
So...

211
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,420
What day is good?

212
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,640
How about Sunday, 
I think it'll be good.

213
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,100
Sure.

214
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,030
Then I'll make the reservation.

215
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,890
Where shall we go?

216
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,800
Where do you want to go?

217
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,970
I can go anywhere.

218
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,650
You're such a
 good at pleasing people.

219
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,600
I'm good at other things too.

220
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,520
Prove it.

221
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,750
I'm kidding.

222
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,280
You're making
 that shock face again.

223
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,510
Let's go. 
I want to have some dessert.

224
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,430
Hello, Tisa.

225
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,890
Hello, U.

226
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,210
Can I talk to you? 
It won't take long.

227
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,820
OK.

228
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,340
Will you be free this Saturday?

229
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,010
I'm free, why?

230
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,500
Chin's father wants to see you.

231
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,710
Why would he?

232
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,270
I don't know.

233
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,540
He probably wants
 to have lunch with you.

234
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,560
But he doesn't dare to tell you
 so he ask me to do it for him.

235
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,280
But don't tell 
Chin that I invited you.

236
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,690
I want to surprise him.

237
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,170
Alright.

238
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,610
OK.

239
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,640
Don't forget, this Saturday.

240
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,810
Sure thing.

241
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,570
Tisa...

242
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,210
called you for what?

243
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,780
Nothing, forget it.

244
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,330
Let's go.

245
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,130
P'.

246
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,270
What's your name?

247
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,430
I'm Tin.

248
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,350
I'm Ice-Cream.

249
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,270
Are you interested in tasting me?

250
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,000
I rather not.

251
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,020
What should I do?

252
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,800
Guys.

253
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,660
There's that bitch 
wants to eat your husband.

254
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,750
I know that. No need to tell me.

255
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,630
Shall we? Let's teach him.

256
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,090
Let him know clearly...

257
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,830
who's the boss around here.

258
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,150
Let's go, guys.

259
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,070
Let's do it.

260
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,410
Do you have a lover yet?

261
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,040
He does.

262
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,750
Guys, circle him.

263
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,010
Cheap.

264
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,030
Shameless.

265
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,680
Over his head.

266
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,180
No self-awareness.

267
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,370
You fag!

268
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,800
You're the fag!

269
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,900
Slut.

270
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,950
Beautiful.

271
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,650
Hold on, E'B.

272
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,790
You're cursing him, 
aren't you? Once again.

273
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,530
Sorry guys.

274
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,120
Ugly!

275
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,680
Disgusting.

276
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,940
Troublesome!

277
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,470
Dumb.

278
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,740
Guys!

279
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,200
That's enough, I'm feeling dizzy.

280
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,460
E'B, you go on ahead.

281
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,530
E'Wa and I will handle things here.

282
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,190
Be safe.

283
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,580
E'Jeng, lock his hands.

284
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,480
What are you going to do to me?

285
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,680
What's wrong?

286
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,360
Why didn't you tell him...

287
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,070
that you already have a boyfriend?

288
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,690
Why are you still standing 
there and letting him caress you?

289
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,840
I already tried to resist.

290
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,790
But he came hugging me on his own.

291
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,350
You still want to keep 
being a playboy, don't you?

292
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,800
No.

293
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,170
What are you doing?

294
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,140
Kiss your cheeks.

295
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,500
You're nuts.

296
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,100
No need to get shy.

297
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,290
We already did more than that.

298
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,240
Don't be a pervert.

299
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,700
By the way, since that night...

300
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,740
I haven't done it
 for a long time now.

301
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,480
Don't.

302
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,180
You need to endure it for a bit.

303
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,490
Can't I have it here?

304
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,640
Drive home first.

305
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,290
How can we do it in the car?

306
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,170
Last time...

307
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,970
my back sore when
 we did it at the counter.

308
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,560
OK.

309
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,160
We'll do it for real this time.

310
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,690
Please?

311
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,950
OK, OK.

312
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,030
Hurry and drive.

313
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,210
I'm itching to death now.

314
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,860
Yes, my wife.

315
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,910
Such an opportunist.

316
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,120
We'll be home soon.

317
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,390
Chin, give me your phone.

318
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,520
What are you going to do with it?

319
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,190
Just give me your phone.

320
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,890
What are you going to do?

321
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,640
Looking at your photos, why?

322
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,420
That's too much, don't you think?

323
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,360
What's this, Chin?

324
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
- Give me the phone.
- No.

325
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,750
No?

326
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,640
I'm happy now.

327
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,240
I'm going home now.

328
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,990
Pat.

329
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,670
You can just send me here. 
My dorm is just up ahead.

330
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,130
I don't want to burden you.

331
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,690
It's fine, U.

332
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,580
I feel like it's become my duty now.

333
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,740
You're being too exaggerate.

334
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,490
When I often do this...

335
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,170
is it making you feel annoying?

336
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,640
Indeed it is.

337
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,700
What is your problem?

338
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,690
Nothing.

339
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,160
You should go 
back to the dorm already.

340
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,600
It's your turn to wash 
the sheets today, isn't it?

341
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,140
I know.

342
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,280
As for you...

343
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,990
you go home now.

344
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,140
You're so annoying.

345
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,350
Pat, I'm going home now.

346
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,500
Let me know when
 you reached home.

347
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,530
Hello, Pat.

348
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,280
<i>U, I'm home now.</i>

349
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,300
That was fast.

350
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,250
<i>I took a motorcycle taxi.</i>

351
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,370
Good, don't forget to eat.

352
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,450
<i>No one is at home now.</i>

353
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,650
<i>Nothing to eat too.</i>

354
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,350
<i>I'll go out later to get something to eat.</i>

355
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,140
<i>When you're done washing, 
wanna have dinner?</i>

356
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,100
Sure thing, but you 
might have to wait long.

357
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,110
It's gonna take awhile.

358
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,800
That's alright, I can wait.

359
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,600
You didn't you were hungry so we 
could go eat before coming back.

360
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,320
<i>I need to feed my dog.</i>

361
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,280
<i>That's why I need to go home first.</i>

362
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,000
OK, alright. I'll call you when I'm done.

363
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,250
<i>OK.</i>

364
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,700
OK.

365
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,490
Dude.

366
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,810
It spilled, sorry.

367
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,640
Chin!

368
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,780
Will this come off?

369
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,860
I don't know.

370
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,640
It might take 2-3 hours to wash it off.

371
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,710
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

372
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,830
I should be able to 
wash it off with a stain remover.

373
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,280
Dude.

374
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,210
Where is my stain remover?

375
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,740
I don't know.

376
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,960
I just realize it wasn't here.

377
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,140
Why is the washing 
machine downstairs broken?

378
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,420
Dude.

379
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,350
Can't I wash it tomorrow?

380
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,190
I need to go out.

381
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,050
You can't.

382
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,450
I...

383
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,400
can't sleep without the bed sheets.

384
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,880
I get skin irritation or even skin allergies

385
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,100
You need to wait it to dry, 
that takes 2-3 days.

386
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,350
You have to sleep without
 the sheet either way, right?

387
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,570
I can endure it for 2-3 days.

388
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,250
But not more than that.

389
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,060
Then I'll buy you a new blanket.

390
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,830
No, I like this one.

391
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,820
Chin...

392
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,100
can't I wash it tomorrow?

393
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,050
You can't.

394
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,510
Hello, Pat.

395
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,480
<i>Hello, U. Are you done?</i>

396
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,450
I...

397
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,390
maybe take a longer time for this, Pat.

398
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,970
<i>That's alright.</i>

399
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,160
<i>We can meet up
 tomorrow at the university.</i>

400
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,890
I'm sorry.

401
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,640
Krub.

402
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:24,210
This is 1.10.

403
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,550
The price is between 3.5 and 6.5.

404
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,230
This is 1.12.

405
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,250
E'B, what happened to you?

406
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,540
I'm gonna take a picture of this.

407
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,370
Turn over here.

408
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,830
Guys, Ano came to school now!

409
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,070
Are you that happy?

410
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,200
I've been waiting 
for you to come to school...

411
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,150
of course I'm happy.

412
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,420
Don't be mad at me anymore, OK?

413
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,250
Yeah, I know.

414
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,600
E'B.

415
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,930
What did you do to yourself?

416
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,610
It was very intense last night.

417
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,600
You need to slow it down.

418
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,500
I already did.

419
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,730
But he...

420
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,180
won't stop.

421
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,080
You're too bitchy.

422
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,420
What the hell?

423
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,550
Do you have to be that scary?

424
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,100
Guys.

425
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,010
After school this afternoon...

426
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,000
wanna come and 
have fun at my house?

427
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,890
Yeah, sure thing.

428
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,140
Dude, I'll go too.

429
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,590
Haven't done
 it for some time now.

430
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,140
B...

431
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,310
Are you coming?

432
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,780
E'Wa, with my current condition...

433
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,900
My face, my hair...

434
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,530
will your mother 
let me enter the house?

435
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,810
I think...

436
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,790
I think you look totally normal.

437
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,820
Come now.

438
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,890
I can even bring my man 
to the house with no problem.

439
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,530
Why can't I have you coming?

440
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,910
OK, OK.

441
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,360
Did you invite Jed?

442
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,260
P'Jed?

443
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,660
Of course, but he'll 
probably come in the evening.

444
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,240
Dude.

445
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,920
Can I invite P'Tin too?

446
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:23,400
Of course, so we can 
get to know each other.

447
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,680
Your boyfriend and mine.

448
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,140
OK, good.

449
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,690
Guys, can I copy your homework?

450
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,200
Yeah me too.

451
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,890
That's funny, E'Jeng.

452
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,900
Can't you do it yourself?

453
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,560
No, take out your homework.

454
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,630
You've been absent 
from school for days.

455
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,460
I'll teach you.

456
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,550
Yes, I know.

457
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,900
This one too?

458
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,380
The teacher also 
asked us where did you go.

459
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,790
You didn't tell your
 friends where you went.

460
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,450
This one, right?

461
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,980
This is 50 Thai iron.

462
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,570
That's how it 
worked out in the end.

463
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,870
Look.

464
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,910
Then do it again.

465
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,550
But you have to remember...

466
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:11,800
about 5 minutes.

467
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,070
You don't understand this one, right?

468
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,060
- Do it. OK?
- Alright.

469
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:36,540
Guys.

470
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,670
Zo is not here today?

471
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,370
I want to discuss with him 
about the date of our study.

472
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,010
He has a music practice at the club.

473
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,950
If Saturday, I'm not free.

474
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,630
What abotu you, U?

475
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,060
I'm not free on Saturday too.

476
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,300
Where you'll go?

477
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,280
But don't tell Chin
 that I'm inviting you.

478
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,950
I want to surprise him.

479
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,990
OK.

480
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,560
Nowhere.

481
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,890
What about Friday?

482
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,050
Yeah, sure.

483
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,550
In that case, 
tell Zo that it will be on Firday.

484
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:15,980
OK.

485
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,920
Guys.

486
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,830
I forgot to tell you.

487
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,150
I'll bring Pat with me too, OK?

488
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,050
Why are you inviting him?

489
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,290
My business.

490
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,530
Again?

491
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,740
Every time Ai'Pat and 
Ai'Chin are at the same time...

492
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,360
we can never study.

493
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,920
We never get to continue our meeting.

494
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,580
Can we even get to study, honestly?

495
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,990
Come now.

496
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,480
OK?

497
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,400
OK?

498
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,430
Fine. Don't pull that cute face on me.

499
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,240
We're going on a date this Sunday.

500
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,730
Let's practice.

501
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,520
I like to go to temples
 to do merits(bhun)...

502
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,030
because I like you(khun).

503
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,170
How cringey.

504
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:31,210
No, no.

505
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,070
Math is hard to understand...

506
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,930
But I like you so much.

507
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,570
Understand?

508
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,160
Seems to be off topic, right?

509
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,860
My book cover...

510
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:06,110
is your face.

511
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,710
Sounds old fashioned.

512
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,630
Let's do it more meaningful.

513
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,020
U...

514
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,520
I like you since 
the first time we meet.

515
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,210
Wanna be my boyfriend?

516
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,500
I won't work.

517
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,350
It's making me wanna puke.

518
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:48,730
U, I like you.

519
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,290
I like you much and it's been
 that way for a long time now.

520
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,220
He already know I like him.

521
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,130
U...

522
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,730
I love you.

523
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,230
What gesture is this?

524
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,070
That's enough. 
I'll think more tomorrow.

525
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,030
Hello, U.

526
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,140
During lunch break...

527
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,240
wanna have lunch together?

528
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,420
<i>Of course.</i>

529
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,140
<i>See you at the cafeteria.</i>

530
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:45,880
See you.

531
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:04,230
We don't have class in the 
afternoon, where will you go next?

532
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,200
I'm going to look
 something to eat at Siam.

533
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,100
Then I can go meet up 
with my boyfriend on the way.

534
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,720
What about you, Zeemai?

535
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,740
I have an errand to do.

536
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,170
Again?

537
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,060
What errand that's so many?

538
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,750
Jed, it's none of your business.

539
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,800
Ai'U, so you...

540
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,400
Aren't you going back 
to the dormitory with me?

541
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:23,160
I already have a date.

542
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,740
I'll se you at the dorm.

543
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:26,760
But today...

544
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,280
it's your turn to 
clean the room, right?

545
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,240
No.

546
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,780
It should be your turn today.

547
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,860
Then, we'll be going now.

548
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,350
See you later.

549
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,830
You're coming with me, let's go.

550
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,600
Pat.

551
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,390
What's wrong with you today? 
You keep smiling.

552
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:28,710
Nothing.

553
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,490
I'm just happy.

554
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,990
We finally get to eat alone.

555
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,390
That happy?

556
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,270
Absolutely.

557
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,780
You're exaggerating.

558
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:50,610
Do you need any drinks? 
I'll buy it for you.

559
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:53,170
That alright.

560
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,600
We'll buy them 
together after we eat.

561
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:04,640
U.

562
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,230
In the evening...

563
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,320
Do you want to 
eat crispy pork belly...

564
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,060
at my house?

565
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:15,010
Damn.

566
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:17,180
You're enticing me
 with the crispy pork?

567
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,440
Do you want to 
invite me to your house?

568
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,460
Wanna come?
