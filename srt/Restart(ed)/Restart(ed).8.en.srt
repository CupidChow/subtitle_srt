5
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,910
Enough, both of you.

6
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,200
Can you stop fighting?

7
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,490
I'm piss off now.

8
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,010
Each of you wipe on each side.

9
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,890
Pat wipe on this side.

10
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,030
You will take this side.

11
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,820
Happy?

12
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,610
If you're happy...

13
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,180
I'm leaving.

14
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,100
Don't follow me.

15
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,850
Both of you.

16
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,510
It's your fault.

17
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,280
Where were you all day?

18
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,640
I was with my friend.

19
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,970
Is it too boring spending time with me?

20
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,150
It's not that.

21
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,790
If you keep on this behavior,
 I'll have bring this to your father.

22
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,810
Why do you have
 bring my father into this?

23
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,110
It seems like you
 forgot your duty, right?

24
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,870
Your duty is to be my boyfriend.

25
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,290
I don't care about 
you're feeling right now.

26
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,590
But your duty is to accept me.

27
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,530
Only care about me.

28
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,420
Don't let me lose 
my patience with you.

29
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,670
Yes, Dad?

30
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,490
<i>What did you do?</i>

31
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,600
Nothing.

32
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,710
<i>Do your duty properly.</i>

33
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,070
<i>Don't let me tell you 
for the second time.</i>

34
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,920
Dad, I don't want...

35
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,280
<i>You have no rights!</i>

36
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,080
Yes, Dad.

37
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,910
How handsome.

38
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,900
Are you alright, cutey?

39
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,300
You called me "cutey"?

40
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,470
Yes.

41
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,740
Cutey.

42
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,380
How sweet.

43
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,040
So, what is your name?

44
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,690
Te, my name is Te.

45
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,420
I'm craving for latte now.

46
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,810
So...

47
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,530
what's your name?

48
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,140
I'm Zee...

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,450
Zeehiao.

50
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,560
His name is Zeehiao.

51
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,490
What are you doing?

52
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,830
Be quiet.

53
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,630
I don't see how he is handsome.

54
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,610
But I think he is handsome.

55
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,120
Shut up.

56
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,570
What were you thinking?

57
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,190
Flirting with a guy.

58
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,760
What so weird about that?

59
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,070
That's a sharp words.

60
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,030
What do you want? Just say it.

61
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,840
No, nothing.

62
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,350
When you stop being stubborn, we'll talk.

63
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,410
Just say that I'm jealous.

64
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,850
What's the problem now?

65
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,960
I'm tired.

66
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,860
Too many things in my mind lately.

67
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,970
About guys?

68
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,430
I'm kidding.

69
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,700
Well...

70
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,150
it's about guys.

71
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,160
How so?

72
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Dude...

73
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,500
between a guy who's nice
 to you and a guy you love...

74
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,560
if it were you, who would you choose?

75
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,070
There is no way to compare what
 you love and what is good to you.

76
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,310
Love is love, nicety is another thing.

77
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,840
There are lot of people doing nice 
thing but doesn't love each other.

78
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,820
There are also those that you
 love but is not a nice guy to you.

79
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,000
I think, give them
 time to prove themselves.

80
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,890
Between a nice
 guy and a guy you love...

81
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,960
who will stay 
with you until the end.

82
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,200
When that time comes,
 you'll choose it yourself.

83
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,800
What should I do now?

84
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,190
You weren't listening to me?

85
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,350
So...

86
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,130
where is Ai'Zeemai?

87
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,440
He probably with his 
own things at the faculty.

88
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,950
You better go rest, you look tired.

89
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,230
Let's go.

90
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,460
I'm going to wash my hands at home.

91
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,800
Why don't you wash them here?

92
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,660
Zeemai.

93
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,420
Zeemai.

94
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,240
Zeemai!

95
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,620
What?!

96
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,280
Why are you calling me?!

97
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,010
Why are you avoiding me? 
Why are you angry?!

98
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,510
I'm not angry!

99
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,350
Then why are you shouting?!

100
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,780
I'm feeling annoying!

101
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,950
Annoyed that you're acting
 normal but in reality, it's not!

102
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,220
Do you know that was my first kiss?!

103
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,280
I gone crazy when I saw you 
go out with someone else!

104
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,320
And you've been 
following around everyday.

105
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,170
But you don't have feelings for me,
 why are you doing this?!

106
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,830
Next time, if you're using me...

107
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,250
I'll tell U and Jed to beat you up.

108
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,150
Do you think you're the only one?

109
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,140
Do you think I don't feel
 anything when I'm following you?

110
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,380
When I want to talk, you avoided me.

111
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,670
I wonder, 
who's been feeling annoying?

112
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,700
You know how much I like you.

113
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,990
But you still give me hope.

114
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,850
I'm tired, Zo!

115
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,670
It's really tiring from
 my one-sided efforts!

116
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,550
What the hell?!

117
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,790
You didn't give me room to talk,
 how are you gonna understand?!

118
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,410
Zeemai.

119
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,410
Why are you home so early?

120
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,340
Something's wrong?

121
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,900
You look unwell.

122
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,890
I finished class early today.

123
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,200
I'm not feeling great either.

124
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,960
You're not having trouble
 with your friends at university?

125
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,000
No.

126
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,190
Have you take some medicine?
 Wanna see a doctor?

127
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,740
Do you want to eat anything? 
I'll go buy it for you.

128
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,010
That's alright, Mom.

129
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,050
Mom...

130
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,470
What is it?

131
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,940
Can I hug you?

132
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,530
What's wrong, I wonder?

133
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,750
Did someone 
prank you at university?

134
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,860
No.

135
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,070
Don't be like this.

136
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,530
Don't cry.

137
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,440
My beautiful son.

138
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,890
My son is so cute.

139
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,970
Who has been cruel to you?

140
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,310
Don't be like this.

141
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,940
It's alright, son.

142
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,920
P'Jed, it's tickled.

143
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,240
What are you playing at?

144
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,890
I just want to play with you.

145
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,320
Did you play around
 like this with everyone?

146
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,370
No.

147
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,750
Just with you.

148
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,820
Fine, I believe you.

149
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,060
So cute.

150
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,360
No.

151
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,540
I'm gonna take this call for sec.

152
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,010
OK.

153
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,710
Hello. What's up, P'Tern?

154
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,880
<i>Dude, I just got heartbroken.</i>

155
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,370
<i>Take me somewhere to get drunk.</i>

156
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,670
I'm with my boyfriend.

157
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,240
<i>Can't you spend one day with me?!</i>

158
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,270
<i>I haven't you bragging 
you in a long time.</i>

159
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,680
<i>Come out with me, please. 
Just for today.</i>

160
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,150
<i>Otherwise,
 I'll break our P'-Nong bond.</i>

161
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,290
Why do you have to threaten me?

162
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,410
Fine.

163
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,020
I'll ask my boyfriend first.

164
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,810
I'll be right with you.

165
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,080
I'm hanging up now.

166
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,890
Can I go out for awhile?

167
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,210
With whom? Where?

168
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,290
With my high school senior.

169
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,030
The Evewean Bar.

170
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,760
Guy or girl?

171
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,090
A guy.

172
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,530
Is he cute?

173
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,250
Not as cute as you.

174
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,850
Alright. Don't be too 
long and hurry back.

175
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,110
Sure thing, you're so adorable.

176
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,250
There are handsome and
 cute guys in this place.

177
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,930
There are a lot of fine and 
sexy ladies in this restaurant.

178
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,960
My husband cheated 
on me from this restaurant.

179
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,700
Never let your husband go to this place.

180
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,710
There are a lot of top "tops" here.

181
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,870
That bad, huh?

182
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,290
This cannot go on.

183
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,020
You'll be sorry when
 you get home, E'Jed!

184
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,210
You're not going for shower?

185
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,000
Later.

186
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,760
Just a moment.

187
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,180
What's wrong?

188
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,680
Nothing.

189
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,350
Have you eaten?

190
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,860
Not yet.

191
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,670
I bought you dinner.

192
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,560
It's on the table, have at it.

193
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,060
You bought it for me?

194
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,840
I just bought with no reason.

195
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,740
Are you worried about me?

196
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,570
No, I just bought more.

197
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,450
Whatever.

198
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,260
I consider it...

199
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,140
as you're worried about me.

200
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,440
Don't deny it.

201
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,390
Thank you, Mom.

202
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,820
Dude.

203
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,110
My face is hurt from you slapping me.

204
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,900
Are you really not care?

205
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,140
You deserve it.

206
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,830
A player like you.

207
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,670
I know.

208
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
Still holding a grudge?

209
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,570
You forgive me?

210
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,500
Only half...

211
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,000
50%.

212
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,900
Having a secret crush is really painful.

213
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,040
What should I do now?

214
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,250
I insulted him a lot.

215
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,450
I also threaten him to 
have my friends beat him up.

216
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,890
No.

217
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,750
But he was mean at you first.

218
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,500
Whatever, I don't care. I better open Twitter 
and see what the people have to say.

219
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,390
Wa.

220
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,960
I'm home.

221
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,360
Why do you have to ask me 
whether you can go out or not?

222
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,580
You don't have to go.

223
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,940
If I said you can go,
 then you have to go for real?

224
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,070
I don't understand why do you have to go a 
place with lots of woman and cute guys.

225
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,990
Even though you 
already have a boyfriend.

226
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,910
You also aware
that you're good-looking.

227
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,300
Don't go to 
a place like that again.

228
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,850
If I were to go smiling and
 act all wild for others to see?

229
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,120
How would you feel?

230
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,940
I pretend to be OK with it
 and you act like it's really OK?

231
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,270
No! No at all!

232
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,140
When you were 
walking out of the room...

233
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,570
my head was smoking hot!

234
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,920
You don't love me, don't you?

235
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,390
I'm home now.

236
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,890
I wasn't with anyone.

237
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,140
Why did you came
 home this late at night?

238
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,080
My senior was heartbroken.

239
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,430
Forgive me, please?

240
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,600
If the review of the place says it has a lot 
of beautiful woman and cute guys, what then?

241
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,150
I only have you.

242
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,240
No one else, cutey.

243
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,890
Nice of you to say that.

244
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,750
Otherwise, how could 
I come back so fast?

245
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,000
Hurry and shower.

246
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,650
I'll give you a reward.

247
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,720
I'm waiting for 
you on the bed, OK?

248
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,100
P'Jed, I'm ready.

249
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,190
This jerk.

250
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,100
So frustrated.

251
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,930
<i>[ Pat's Yuya ]</i>

252
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,970
Hello, U.

253
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,110
Hello, Pat.

254
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,540
What time is your lunch break?

255
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,230
I'll have a break at 11 AM.

256
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,860
I only have classes in the morning,
 I'll have a long break.

257
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,350
I want to take you
 for lunch during your break.

258
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,710
Sure thing, 
see you at the usual place.

259
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,730
But what will you do do until 11 AM?

260
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,980
I'll wait for you in the library.

261
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,530
Sure thing.

262
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,590
OK, see you.

263
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,930
See you.

264
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,400
Hearing him that intensely...

265
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,530
why don't you 
just grab his phone?

266
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,640
Guys...

267
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,400
It's almost the exam,
 shall we find a place to study?

268
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,580
I'm fine with anything.
 I'd fail regardless.

269
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,610
So I'm fine with study or not.

270
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,140
What about you Zeemai?
 What say you?

271
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,070
What say you?

272
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,820
About what?

273
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,900
Are you going to study together?

274
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,880
Absolutely.

275
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,250
Then, can I join you guys?

276
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,050
No, I'm not allowing it.

277
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,680
But I want to.

278
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,070
Stop quarreling.

279
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,030
We can all study together.

280
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,080
Jed!

281
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,030
Stop sulking, look at your dull face.

282
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,390
Whose house are we gonna study?

283
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,090
We can do it at my house. 
My mom won't mind.

284
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,320
OK, deal.

285
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,750
Wanna have lunch together?

286
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,070
No.

287
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,690
Zeemai!

288
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,930
A friend wants to chat 
with you and you ignore him?

289
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,250
Katoon.

290
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,620
I don't think this is the one.

291
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,210
- I'll change it.
- OK.

292
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,900
Pat.

293
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,590
Can I talk to you?

294
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,170
Yes.

295
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,400
Are you dating Yu yet?

296
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,500
Not yet, why?

297
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,570
Can you hurry up?

298
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,380
What do you mean?

299
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,060
I'll be honest, 
I want Yu to be far from Chin.

300
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,350
Help me out.

301
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,530
Before asking me to help...

302
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,310
shouldn't you go tell 
Ai'Chin to stay away from Yu?

303
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,280
If Yu isn't too flirty, 
Chin wouldn't play along, won't he?

304
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,620
I think it's wrong for you to say this.

305
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,440
Even when you're flirty with him...

306
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,580
Chin didn't even play with you.

307
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,960
Watch your mouth.

308
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,310
Say whatever you want.

309
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,220
But don't bother Yu.

310
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,350
Otherwise, I won't let it slide.

311
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,350
Looks like you have 
a lot of confidence with U.

312
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,710
Worry about yourself first,
 be careful.

313
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,490
- Is this it?
- Yes, yes.

314
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,440
Why are you here for lunch too?

315
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,420
Because I wanted too.

316
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,870
Do you have a problem with it?

317
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,890
It ruins my eating mood.

318
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,460
Do you want me to feed you?

319
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,330
Is it good, U?

320
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,350
Yes, I like it.

321
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,260
I eat at this restaurant often.

322
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,720
The auntie likes to give me more.

323
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,540
Next time, I'll ask the auntie to give 
you more food more often. OK?

324
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,820
What about you?

325
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,290
Coming with us for lunch...

326
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,880
not going lunch with Tisa?

327
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,610
No.

328
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,910
I rather have lunch with you.

329
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:40,980
<font size="65">What the fuck is your problem?!!</font>

330
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,230
<font size="65">What the fuck is your problem?!!</font>

331
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,050
<font size="65">Stay away from Yu</font>

332
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,600
<font size="65">He is mine!</font>

333
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,160
<font size="65">What do you mean?</font>

334
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,150
<font size="65">We sleep in a room together!!</font>

335
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,630
<font size="65">He hates you!!</font>

336
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,710
<font size="65">I hate you more!!</font>

337
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,520
E'Jeng.

338
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,300
You got a haircut? So pretty.

339
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,730
Guys.

340
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,800
Do you think 
Ai'No will come to school?

341
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,870
Guys! I'm serious.

342
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,420
I see you waiting for him
here early in the morning.

343
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,760
Until now, not even a 
single hair of E'No is seen.

344
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,330
Guys.

345
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,740
Maybe he committed suicide.

346
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,380
Think as I do.

347
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,600
Continue, I'm listening.

348
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,240
That day...

349
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,820
when you put the sticker on his 
face, what color were those stickers?

350
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,910
I think they were purples.

351
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,610
But as I recall, he likes green.

352
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,190
You're right.

353
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,340
Ai'No does like green.

354
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,880
Then you put some stickers on
 his tie, how many were they?

355
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,740
Probably around 3 - 4.

356
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,790
Why?

357
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,410
And after that...

358
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,260
you tokk him to talk about P'Jed.

359
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,660
When you first talk to him...

360
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,420
did he seems upset?

361
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,090
I don't know.

362
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,810
But I think he was.

363
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,620
I knew it.

364
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,730
That means...

365
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,520
What is it?

366
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,990
Continue, I'm listening.

367
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,160
He dislikes purple stickers!

368
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,050
And the sticker on
 his tie won't come off.

369
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,910
So, his mother hit him.

370
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,800
So he thought 
about committing suicide.

371
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,060
E'B, I'm going to kill you first.

372
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,900
I can't stand listening 
to your bullshit everyday.

373
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,590
I was focus on 
listening to you for so long...

374
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,030
what a waste of time.

375
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,770
Am I right?

376
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:47,340
My assumption
 just now is reasonable.

377
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,060
Enough, it's nonsense.

378
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,660
Stop talking nonsense.

379
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,570
It's quite reasonable.

380
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,400
Ai'No.

381
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,440
You came?

382
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,360
Why were you absent from school?

383
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,860
We were worried.

384
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,000
Wa and I went looking 
for you at your house.

385
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,490
You didn't answer your phone.

386
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,130
Are you guys done talking?

387
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,450
What's wrong with you, Ai'No?

388
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,540
When you will
 stop being too oblivious?

389
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,740
Acting like you don't know anything.

390
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,820
Just tell me what's going on!

391
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,680
How will I know if you don't tell me?

392
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,790
Do I have to tell you?

393
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,050
Yes.

394
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,640
You are my friend.

395
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,560
If you don't tell me anything, 
how will I know?!

396
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,130
E'No, you're not going to class?

397
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,090
Let him go. We go in first.

398
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,700
We talk about him later.

399
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,110
- He came but not 
going to class, that E'No.
- Let's go.

400
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,420
Hurry up.

401
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,790
He didn't answer his phone and
 acting like this whe we meet him.

402
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,820
We'll talk to him slowly.

403
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,000
Ano, E'Wa is sad. Come
 back and talk nicely to him

404
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,000
BB

405
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,810
Ano, E'Wa is sad. Come back and talk nicely to him

406
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,810

407
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,810
Ignore him

408
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,810
Ano

409
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:26,010
Ano, E'Wa is sad. Come back and talk nicely to him

410
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:26,010
Ignore him

411
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:26,010
How can you do that? I know you like
 him but don't be like this, trust me

412
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:26,010
BB

413
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:26,010

414
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:26,010

416
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:37,710
Ignore him

417
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:37,710
How can you do that? I know you like
 him but don't be like this, trust me

418
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:37,710
If he's sad, ask his boyfriend to comfort him. Why me?

419
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:37,710
BB

420
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:37,710

423
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:50,710
Ano, E'Wa is sad. 
Come back and talk nicely to him

424
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:50,710
Ignore him

425
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:50,710
How can you do that? I know you like
 him but don't be like this, trust me

426
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:50,710
If he's sad, ask his boyfriend to comfort him. Why me?

427
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:50,710
Stop acting silly, will you? E'No

428
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:50,710

429
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:50,710

Ano

432
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:50,710
BB

433
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,060
We can't talk nicely, aren't we?

434
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,850
We can, say what you want to say.

435
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,590
I just wanna tell you...

436
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,440
that I'm not dating anyone.

437
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,980
And I wasn't with this and 
that people like you thought I was.

438
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,100
Why are you telling me this?

439
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,200
I just wanna tell you...

440
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,760
that you won't have to
 this unilateral effort anymore.

441
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,410
What do you want to tell me exactly?

442
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,230
I...

443
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,310
I want to hit on you.

444
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,770
My head is still hurts.

445
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,590
I can't hear clearly.

446
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,220
I have to go now.

447
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,920
I'm in a hurry.

448
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,990
Where are you 
going to study for exam?

449
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,520
With my friends at Zo's house.

450
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,850
Good.

451
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,740
Why?

452
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,170
Wanna come?

453
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,040
I want to.

454
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,440
But you have 
different subjects than mine.

455
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,270
I don't want to go for study.

456
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,660
I want to look after you.

457
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,560
Then you can do so.

458
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,590
Then, I'll walk you to the dormitory.

459
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,520
Hello.

460
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,910
<i>Where are you?</i>

461
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,920
On my way to the dormitory.

462
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,220
<i>You won't come to see me all day, will you?</i>

463
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,600
We'll talk tomorrow.

464
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,520
I have homework.

465
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,480
<i>I hope it's work for real.</i>

466
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,680
Bae, do you need to come pick you up?

467
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,680
Jed

468
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:31,060
Jed

469
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:31,060
Anwa

470
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:31,060
No need, I'll go back on my own today

471
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:31,060
Bae, do you need to come pick you up?

472
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:37,390
Jed

473
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:37,390
Jed

474
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:37,390
Anwa

475
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:37,390
Something's wrong?

476
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:37,390
No need, I'll go back on my own today

477
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:37,390
Bae, do you need to come pick you up?

478
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:42,880
Jed

479
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:42,880
Jed

480
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:42,880
Anwa

481
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:42,880
Anwa

482
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:42,880
I need to clear things with Ano

483
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:42,880
Something's wrong?

484
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:42,880
No need, I'll go back on my own today

485
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:42,880
Bae, do you need to come pick you up?

486
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:50,890
Jed

487
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:50,890
Jed

488
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:50,890
Anwa

489
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:50,890
Anwa

490
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:50,890
Jed

491
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:50,890
OK,let me know when you're home

492
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:50,890
I need to clear things with Ano

493
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:50,890
Something's wrong?

494
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:50,890
No need, I'll go back on my own today

495
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:50,890
Bae, do you need to come pick you up?

496
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,580
I'm so worried about him.

497
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,470
E'Wa, don't be sad.

498
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,130
He'll be back.

499
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:22,120
I just want to know what
 Ano's mad at me about?

500
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,300
Dude!

501
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,180
I know where he is.

502
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,820
I'll take you to him.

503
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,020
Really?

504
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,090
Yes, follow me.

505
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,470
Are you tricking me?

506
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,520
Just come, I know.

507
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,740
Come on.

508
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,390
Don't take me to any weird place.

509
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,840
Just follow me, stop complaining.

510
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,520
Let me see.

511
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,610
What's your deal?

512
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,120
What? You can't do this?

513
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,070
You're too close.

514
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,100
I can do it on my own.

515
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,540
Stay away.

516
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,940
Sorry, I can't help myself.

517
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,340
Shy?

518
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,110
I'm your friend, not your wife.

519
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,060
From a friend...

520
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,370
to a wife...

521
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,170
is it impossible?

522
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,260
Don't pull this player trick on me.

523
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,680
Go talk with Tisa.

524
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,100
Hey, you.

525
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,730
What's your name?

526
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,350
Do you think he will answer?

527
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,520
I don't think so.

528
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,410
Look, he doesn't answer.

529
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,100
Guys.

530
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,980
What's that guy's name?

531
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,100
I greet him and he didn't answer.

532
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,380
He's Ano.

533
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,770
Ano, the new kid.

534
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,720
Do you know him?

535
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,450
Ano!

536
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,990
Ano, hurry. Ai'Jeng is pranking me.

537
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,270
Hurry up.

538
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,020
Come on.

539
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,920
Are you mad that much to me?!

540
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,710
I can't be mad now?

541
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,060
What are you mad at me about?!

542
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,440
Forget it.

543
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,880
Stay away from me.

544
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,640
I have to, you're my friend!

545
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:34,370
You didn't answer my calls nor reply
 my LINE. You didn't even go to school.

546
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,520
How can you expect me to not worry?

547
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,490
You like that P' that much?

548
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,920
I like him so much.

549
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,740
I don't know when I'll 
meet someone like this again.

550
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,610
What do you like about him?

551
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,770
Everything.

552
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,060
I like everything he do for me.

553
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,160
I miss him all the time.

554
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,720
Just thinking about
 him makes me happy.

555
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,140
Good then.

556
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,840
I like seeing you smile.

557
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,720
I'm not mad at you anymore.

558
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,490
Really?

559
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,770
You're really not mad
 at me anymore, right?

560
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,300
No.

561
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,090
If you smile...

562
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,840
I accept it.

563
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,810
Ano.

564
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm Anwa.

565
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,190
I'm BB.

566
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,520
I'm Jeng.

567
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,620
Wanna join us for lunch?

568
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,620
I don't think he'll join us.

569
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,570
Let's go.

570
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,520
You're new here?

571
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,090
Just because of your smile...

572
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,250
that makes me...

573
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,090
wants to be your friend until now.

574
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,410
Just hearing you willing to forgive me...

575
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,560
makes me at ease.

576
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,230
It's late.

577
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,700
Let's go home.

578
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,260
There's many mosquitoes here.

579
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,670
You go on ahead.

580
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,910
I think I want to walk
 around here for awhile.

581
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,670
OK.

582
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,790
Then, I'm going home now.

583
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,240
Let me know when you're home.

584
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:34,810
Bye.

585
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,640
Let's go home.

586
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,360
I'm gonna stay with Ano for a bit.

587
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,270
I'm gonna stay with him.

588
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,650
Then, I'm going home now.

589
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,860
Bye.

590
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,660
Are you alright?

591
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,700
Why do you have
 to have feelings for him?

592
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,330
There a lot of
 other people out there.

593
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,390
Don't cry.

594
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,680
But I like him.

595
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,090
It's gonna be alright.

596
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:01,530
Why didn't you tell us about this?

597
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:30,770

00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:30,770
