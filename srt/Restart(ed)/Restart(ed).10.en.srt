<i>Audiences under the age of 13 should

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,160
I can't.

6
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,850
I have homework to do.

7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,460
Sorry.

8
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,280
It's fine.

9
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,920
Fine, it's my turn.

10
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,710
Why do they have to
 eat together everyday?

11
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,710
Will they die not eating for one day?

12
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,890
Hope you choke to death...

13
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,390
Ai'Pat!

14
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,440
I'm so pissed! I'm pissed, 
I'm pissed, I'm pissed!

15
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,290
P'Tin?

16
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,160
What are you doing here?

17
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,670
I'm here to see my boyfriend.

18
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,340
Did you stab me in the back?

19
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,850
You bastard.

20
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,670
You jerk, asshole!

21
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,090
What the hell is your problem?

22
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,310
What did I do wrong?

23
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,640
I'm here to see my boyfriend!

24
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,500
This is my boyfriend's house!

25
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,080
My boyfriend also lives here.

26
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,710
So I came to see him.

27
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,680
P'Jed, you're here?

28
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,480
Wa...

29
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,640
how can you do this to me?

30
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,910
He is my senior, you know.

31
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,710
If you don't love me,
 then why do you deceived me?

32
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,250
P'Jed, hear me out.

33
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,370
What else should I hear now?

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,770
He's clearly here.

35
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,710
P'Tin is here to see...

36
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,500
You bring someone else here too?

37
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,990
Got food poisoning...

38
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,650
is better than hurt 
by someone closest to you.

39
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,530
P'Jed, hear me out.

40
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,460
What else is there 
to be explained?

41
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,100
Since we dated...

42
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,210
the world is getting smaller.

43
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,480
E'Wa...

44
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,000
Is your husband alright?

45
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,890
P'Jed, hear me out first.

46
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,530
No, no, no!

47
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,980
- My ears can't hear anything.
- P'Jed!

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,040
I said, hear me out first!

49
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,870
This is P'Tin.

50
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,360
He's hear to see BB,
 they're together.

51
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,100
Oh, really?

52
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,530
Why didn't you 
tell me from the start?

53
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,660
Because you didn't 
even let me say anything.

54
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,830
I was joking earlier.

55
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
Just kidding.

56
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,180
Let's have a sit.

57
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,290
Did you study too hard?

58
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,570
Kind of.

59
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,020
So, Ai'Jed...

60
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,460
how did you met him?

61
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,490
P'Jed here...

62
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,960
hit on me.

63
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,310
He sit at the cafe and ordered
 10 cups of coffee, right B?

64
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,920
I met him at the 
cafe he's working at.

65
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,680
What about you? 
What did you do...

66
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,860
that got you this kid?

67
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,610
I got spied by someone.

68
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,320
Don't patronize me.

69
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,390
You didn't want me too.

70
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,720
How are U doing?

71
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,480
When you see him, 
he'll tell it to you himself.

72
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,180
It's a long story.

73
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,260
OK.

74
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,350
Don't be sad.

75
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,090
I'll feed you.

76
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,770
Can you not ghosting me, Ai'Jeng?

77
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,250
Are you cleaning or making it dirtier?

78
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,660
I'm tired.

79
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,280
I haven't even eaten yet.

80
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,350
Sit quietly, I'll clean it myself.

81
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,960
Move.

82
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,860
Is that right?

83
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,670
Did you scrub it properly?

84
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,250
Where's the dust? I don't see it.

85
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,110
Are you OK now?

86
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,650
About what?

87
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,370
About E'Wa, of course.

88
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,720
What can I do?

89
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,210
I already love him.

90
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,190
One-sided love...

91
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,250
it's not that bad.

92
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,300
At least...

93
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,630
I get to see the one I like...

94
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,940
be happy.

95
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,070
You can have a one-sided love...

96
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,260
but you have to
 love yourself too, Ano.

97
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,360
Pain takes a long time.

98
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,380
A wound in the heart...

99
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,560
is hard to heal.

100
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,350
Hope your wounds 
get better soon, Ano.

101
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,290
Yeah.

102
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,020
Thanks.

103
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,420
I'm leaving now.

104
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,240
See you at school.

105
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,250
Bye.

106
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,090
P'Tin, I'm hungry.

107
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,310
Then shall we
 have something to eat?

108
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,270
Again? I'm bored of it honestly.

109
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,990
Or you want to eat...

110
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,280
No more.

111
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,740
I can't even walk now.

112
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,250
<i>Today...</i>

113
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,770
<i>I don't want to make love...</i>

114
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,900
<i>just wanna take care of you.</i>

115
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,630
P'Tin, what does that means?

116
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,770
Listen to me.

117
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,670
Today...

118
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,500
I don't want to have sex...

119
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,070
but I want to take 
care of you the best I can.

120
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,960
Are you this nice to others too?

121
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,480
I told you...

122
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,440
I was only a playboy in the past.

123
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,880
But I never knew you before.

124
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,250
Is being a playboy
 that easy to change?

125
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,730
It's not that easy.

126
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,130
But whenever I think of you...

127
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,490
I don't have anymore 
time to think about others.

128
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,060
Because I'm beautiful, right?

129
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,890
<i>You may hold my hand for awhile.</i>

130
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,510
But you hold my heart...

131
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,000
forever.

132
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,430
Yes.

133
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,650
OK.

134
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,570
<i>Thank you.</i>

135
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,380
<i>Saranghaeyo.</i>

136
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,760
Zo.

137
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,300
What?

138
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,170
No.

139
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,160
Don't bother me.

140
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,850
I'll clean it myself.

141
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,440
Come now.

142
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,080
I said, buzz off.

143
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,820
I'll clean it myself, buzz off.

144
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,590
Go away.

145
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,210
What is your problem?

146
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,280
You've been acting weird lately.

147
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,620
What?

148
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,300
You'd better go back to your seat.

149
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,100
Go.

150
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,070
Done?

151
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,430
Will it be finished today?

152
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,730
U.

153
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,140
Pat, you're early.

154
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,430
I finished class early.

155
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,430
I'm not done yet. 
Can you wait there for a moment.

156
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,420
Yeah, sure.

157
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,250
Back to your seat
 of you're not going back.

158
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,710
Clean this part behind me too.

159
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,460
You can't let Zeemai do that.

160
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,390
Help each other out.

161
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,560
What is his problem?

162
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,530
Clean that up.

163
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,420
I know.

164
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,500
Zeemai, are you done?

165
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,800
Yes, I'm done.

166
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,840
Then go home.

167
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,700
Yeah, go.

168
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,840
I'm leaving.

169
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,180
- Let's go.
- Alright.

170
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,810
Dude.

171
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,960
What do you think
 is in Ai'Chin's mind?

172
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,670
I don't know.

173
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,240
But he seems acting
 very weird with U lately.

174
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,930
How should we help U?

175
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,570
Should we just ask 
Chin straightforwardly?

176
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,550
Even if you ask him directly,
 he would tell you the truth.

177
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,380
If Chin really likes U...

178
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,070
back then...

179
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,740
why did he asked 
U to help him hit on Tisa?

180
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,460
That doesn't mean anything.

181
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,520
But don't you think Ai'Chin and Tisa...

182
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,100
like each other too fast?

183
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,850
They rehearse the dance for the
 play and immediately like each other.

184
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,080
Does it confused you?

185
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,850
Yeah, I am.

186
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,000
I think others are as confused as us.

187
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,600
But everything happened so fast.

188
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,870
When Chin dates Tisa...

189
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,640
and sees U with Pat...

190
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,490
he always looks angry.

191
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,790
Then why if he 
doesn't like Tisa that much...

192
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,810
he keeps on dating her?

193
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,750
Or...

194
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,100
Chin has a Korean royal blood.

195
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,030
He wants U to be his concubine...

196
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,070
while Tisa is his queen.

197
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,590
What era are you in?

198
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,580
Are you into history or what?

199
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,360
What is your mind went off to?

200
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,110
I get headache 
every time I talk to you.

201
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,850
Wait for me.

202
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,850
You didn't wait for me.

203
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,890
Wa.

204
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,450
I don't have class this afternoon.

205
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,990
Want me to come
 to you after school?

206
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,650
<i>Of course.</i>

207
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,410
<i>I happen to be free this afternoon.</i>

208
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,990
Where should I pick you up?

209
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,230
<i>I'm at the class building 4, P'Jed.</i>

210
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,320
<i>I'm happen to study there.</i>

211
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,860
OK, see you later.

212
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,960
I'm outta here, see you.

213
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,540
I should go see Zo.

214
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,360
Hello.

215
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,500
<i>You need to come home this Saturday.</i>

216
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,020
I will have a study group for exam.

217
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,190
<i>No need to go.</i>

218
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,730
<i>I'm telling you to come home...</i>

219
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,270
<i>so you must come home.</i>

220
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,000
<i>And you know how to
 behave this Saturday, right?</i>

221
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,140
Yes.

222
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,250
Wanna take a break?

223
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,530
I'll do it for you.

224
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,040
Pat.

225
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,450
The table is clean.

226
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,210
No need to clean it anymore.

227
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,790
What are you doing?

228
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,350
I...

229
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,260
I'm sorry.

230
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,050
When I'm near you...

231
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,420
I can't control myself.

232
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,170
That's alright.

233
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,950
Don't think too much.

234
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,100
Ano...

235
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,890
It stings.

236
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,380
Ano...

237
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,890
It's not that painful.

238
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,490
Ano, can you be more gentle?

239
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,920
It's not that hurt.

240
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,690
Slowly, Ano.

241
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,790
Ano, are you done?

242
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,820
Just a little more.

243
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,060
You're done now, right?

244
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,270
Endure it a bit more.

245
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,730
It's my first time, Ano.

246
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,390
Almost done.

247
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,250
Ano...

248
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,230
What are you doing to my wife...

249
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,970
P'Jed.

250
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,450
What are you guys doing?

251
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,320
Are you blind?

252
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,750
I'm shaving his legs.

253
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,350
Are you old or something?

254
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,300
So...

255
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,150
Why are you shaving?

256
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,260
Didn't you say you
 like clean-shave skin?

257
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,960
So I ask him to pull them out for me.

258
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,390
You can do it in another time.

259
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,580
No need to let this 
monkey face do it for you.

260
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,260
P', that's such a "nice" words.

261
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,850
Enough, both of you!

262
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,510
Come, darling. I'll do it for you.

263
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,660
Sure thing.

264
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,920
Get up!

265
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,580
Ano...

266
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,820
go find E'B and Jeng.

267
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,310
We'll see again later.

268
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,310
OK.

269
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,750
I'm going.

270
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,460
See you in English class.

271
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,890
You can go now.

272
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,960
Monkey face.

273
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,070
Old.

274
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,980
What are you doing, P'Jed?

275
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,670
Look at this, it's all red now.

276
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,920
No, it was because that
 monkey face distracted me.

277
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,100
Instead of paying attention to others, 
pay attention to my leg. It hurts, you know.

278
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:36,190
~ <font face="SF Hallucination">In the days when there's no one<font face="\fn0"> ~</font></font>

279
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:43,890
~ <font face="SF Hallucination">At least I have you by my side<font face="\fn0"> ~</font></font>

280
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,420
Hold this for me.

281
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,270
I'm done.

282
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,420
Are you hungry?

283
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,720
A little.

284
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,270
Then...

285
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,640
wanna have lunch?

286
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,930
- Yeah, OK.
- Let's go

287
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,550
Zeemai.

288
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,520
How's my singing today?

289
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,610
It was amazing.

290
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,560
It got me blushing.

291
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,740
Yes.

292
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,220
You guys look happy.

293
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,190
This guy here...

294
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,530
have a crush on someone 
but didn't get his love return.

295
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,180
Moe on already.

296
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,600
You don't even like or
 want someone beautiful like me.

297
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,500
E'Wa here...

298
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,470
smiling like that...

299
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,230
and not talking to friends.

300
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,650
Acting silly...

301
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,630
pure and innocent.

302
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,210
How pretentious.

303
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,150
Maybe give something 
"delicious" for P'Jed.

304
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,710
E'B...

305
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Always "itchy" 
with no regards to time.

306
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,670
Lose his virginity at a restaurant.

307
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,210
There's a lot of hotels 
but haven't gone to any yet.

308
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,050
But I'm kinda curious...

309
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,070
how can he fall for 
a playboy like P'Tin?

310
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,020
Director...

311
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,400
what are you mad at me about?

312
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,450
Why didn't you wrote me a script
 where I have couples like them?

313
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,930
E'Jeng...

314
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,980
did you have
 something to say to me?

315
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,830
No, nothing.

316
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,930
And you know how to 
behave this Saturday, right?

317
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,210
U...

318
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,500
about the thing at noon...

319
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,320
again, I'm sorry.

320
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,880
It's fine, no need to think too much.

321
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,670
You think too much again.

322
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,420
You two look matched together.

323
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,250
Hurry and date him already, U.

324
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,990
Pat is a very nice guy.

325
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,380
What are you doing here?

326
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,250
I'm Chin's girlfriend.

327
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,840
So I'm waiting for him, 
don't you think?

328
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,090
Then please excuse me.

329
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,280
Pat, we're at my dorm now.

330
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,780
We'll see each other later.

331
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,590
Bye, U.

332
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,510
I'll contact you when I get home.

333
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
How I want to be popular like U.

334
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,130
Having two guys going after him.

335
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,640
Tisa.

336
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,280
Are you afraid of heights?

337
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,690
That's why you're 
doing this low-level stuff.

338
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,350
Where are you going?

339
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,730
You're not going to talk to me, right?

340
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,920
Just say whatever you want.

341
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,710
I just came to remind you...

342
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,350
This Saturday...

343
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,110
I must see you.

344
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,050
Otherwise I can't guarantee...

345
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,520
what will happen.

346
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,630
I've showered.

347
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,890
Have you?

348
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,280
Good.

349
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,450
I am doing homework.

350
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,770
Yeah.

351
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,810
The teacher is a foreigner, so I...

352
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,190
Yeah, all teachings are in English.

353
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,670
But there are so 
many words I can't translate.

354
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,390
OK, then...

355
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,640
It's alright, I can ask Zeemai.

356
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,400
Zeemai might be very good in English.

357
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,820
Pat, we'll talk later.

358
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,720
I need to do my homework.

359
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,720
OK, I'll see you later.

360
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,600
OK, bye.

361
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,920
You're not gonna study with us?

362
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,150
No.

363
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,310
You guys go on ahead.

364
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,080
I'm not coming back here...

365
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,280
today.

366
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,580
Zeemai.

367
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,100
I don't get this question.

368
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,410
Explain it to me.

369
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,950
No.

370
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,340
I'm not going to.

371
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,320
Do it yourself.

372
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,620
Zeemai.

373
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,980
I can't do this question.

374
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,080
Which one?

375
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,560
Let me see.

376
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,350
In this question, 
you must first calculate this first...

377
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,350
to get this number.

378
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,360
Zeemai!

379
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,460
Teach me too.

380
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,360
Jed, didn't you study?

381
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,310
I did!

382
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,980
But I don't understand!

383
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,270
Do you have a problem with that?

384
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,550
I do.

385
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:05,520
Because you didn't pay attention 
in class, that's why you're clueless.

386
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,100
You're bullying my brain too much.

387
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,900
Zeemai.

388
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,340
I can't do this too.

389
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,000
This one.

390
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,190
Come.

391
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,040
Let me do it for you.

392
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,790
I'm sorry...

393
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,350
for being clueless.

394
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,750
And for being not good in studies.

395
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,110
It's alright, Zo.

396
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,140
You can let your brain rest.

397
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:35,360
I'll study and give lecture to you.

398
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,450
Thank you.

399
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,620
Pat.

400
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,660
I ask for a pen not for you to be cute.

401
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,610
Really?

402
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,180
Sorry.

403
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,290
U...

404
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,960
I forgot to ask.

405
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,030
Why is Chin not coming?

406
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,810
I don't know either.

407
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,360
I'll prepare a note for him.

408
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,320
OK.

409
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,920
Just do your duty
 properly would be enough.

410
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,060
You have no right 
to make any decisions.

411
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,550
The one who has the 
right to decide for you life is me.

412
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,250
Remember.

413
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,250
Wait.

414
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,390
Tomorrow, Tisa will come and visit.

415
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,620
Behave properly.

416
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,830
Don't even make any single mistake.

417
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,980
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

418
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,190
Understand?

419
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,320
Krub.

420
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,640
Guys.

421
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,890
I think that's all for today.

422
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,640
I need to rest my brain.

423
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,490
What do you mean rest your brain?

424
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,730
You never use your brain once today.

425
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,420
That's it, come here Glasses!

426
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,360
Calm down.

427
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,970
What about you?

428
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,450
Tired?

429
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,100
A little.

430
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,790
You can lean on me.

431
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,670
No need to act sweet.

432
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:22,290
Let's go home.

433
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,470
Guys...

434
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,020
let's separate for now.

435
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,330
OK.

436
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,220
OK, guys.

437
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,170
Go home safely.

438
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,070
Zeemai.

439
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,190
Let me know 
when you arrived home.

440
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,520
Sure thing.

441
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,060
Alright, let's go.

442
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,010
Go home safely.

443
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,150
Yeah.

444
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,500
Of course.

445
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:27,590
Later...

446
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,410
I'll text you
 when I'm home as usual.

447
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,870
Of course.

448
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,230
Bye.

449
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,700
See you, bye.

450
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,630
Tisa.

451
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,070
Sawasdee kha, Uncle.

452
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,320
Sawasdee.

453
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,930
Next time, you can just come visit.

454
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,190
No need to buy too many stuff.

455
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,570
It's no big deal.

456
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:16,320
I intentionally 
came today to visit you.

457
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,640
Nice as always.

458
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,850
Wait awhile.

459
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,710
Chin will come down in a bit.

460
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,250
Sawasdee krub.
