Hwang-Dong Pictures

2
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:37,688
- Here give it to me!
- No, don't! Don't!

3
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:43,669
Wow, Hyeon-jeong you're so pretty!
Like a celebrity.

4
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,850
- Hyeon-jeong, let's take one together.
- Ok, ok sure.

5
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:49,655
- With the drinks?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,172
Here, give it to me.

7
00:00:57,402 --> 00:00:59,822
My big sis is the best!

8
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:03,571
Say it again! Do that thing I like!

9
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:09,839
Alright, so pretty for the camera!

10
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:13,299
- I love you!
- Me too!

11
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:28,203
MISSING

12
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:38,495
A little bit more...more...more.

13
00:01:43,532 --> 00:01:50,788
Hey you son of a bitch!
Why don't you just jerk off!

14
00:01:53,353 --> 00:01:56,150
You bitch! Where are you going?

15
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,283
Eat this you bastard.

16
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:04,358
You fucking bitch!

17
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:11,400
Keep coming... just a little more.

18
00:02:17,714 --> 00:02:24,535
What the hell is this?
Blocking the road and everything.

19
00:02:36,664 --> 00:02:38,018
What are you staring at?

20
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:39,068
What?

21
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:44,477
Is this the first time you've seen
a coffee delivery girl?

22
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:54,900
Unbelievable...

23
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,986
Hurry up, let's go.

24
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:09,462
- The place is weird and so are the people.
- Why is that?

25
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:11,964
Nothing, let's go.

26
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:21,702
Hello.

27
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:24,974
How come you don't
pick up your phone?

28
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:27,166
Where are you? Who are you with?

29
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:30,866
What? I don't need to know?

30
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:37,121
You leave without telling me
and now I don't need to know?

31
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:45,305
Hyeon-jeong, I'm an adult now too.
I'll do what I want so leave me alone.

32
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:49,514
Is that your sister?

33
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:57,064
Director Hong, I hate to ask you again,
but you really have to help me ok?

34
00:03:57,783 --> 00:04:00,968
Alright, don't worry about it.

35
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,317
She won't pick up her phone again.

36
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:08,080
Just wait until you get home...

37
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:12,171
- Are you done yet?
- This is the last one.

38
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:15,814
Jin-soo, while I'm gone you have
to make everything perfect ok?

39
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:17,714
Yes, don't worry. Have a great trip.

40
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:20,543
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Ok, see you.

41
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:35,095
Let's see how you look.

42
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:41,083
You are damn ugly.

43
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:46,042
Stop complaining,
I don't have a choice.

44
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:54,945
What the hell?

45
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,269
You don't even get phone service here.
How could you take me here?

46
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,231
Just go way down the hill and it will work.
Or you could just use the house phone.

47
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:12,177
No chance of that happening.

48
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:13,964
Why?

49
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,827
Because of the owner.

50
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:18,934
The owner? What are you talking about?

51
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,722
Didn't you see? That old man kept
checking me out. It's disgusting.

52
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:29,895
Regardless of age,
a man is still a man.

53
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:34,094
With sexy legs like these,
he would be crazy not to notice.

54
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:36,286
You're full of it.

55
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,378
- Where are you going?
- Don't know.

56
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,700
I guess it's not like
you know this place anyway.

57
00:05:54,182 --> 00:05:55,900
Director Hong?

58
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:59,397
Yes? What do you need?

59
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:01,262
I need a favor.

60
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,875
Favor? What favor?

61
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:09,154
I just need to get some stuff moved.

62
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,824
I injured my back yesterday.
I guess I'll do it myself.

63
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:20,718
No, it's alright. I need
to kill some time anyway.

64
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,603
You have to give me something
for my labor though.

65
00:06:23,806 --> 00:06:26,307
Alright, I won't charge you for the food.

66
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:29,359
- Really?
- Follow me...

67
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:39,146
Sis, it's me. I'm sorry
I hung up on you earlier.

68
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:45,840
I'm at the outskirts of Seoul with a friend.
We came here to visit a restaurant he likes.

69
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,950
I'll come home soon.

70
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:59,206
I understand how you feel,
so please don't worry.

71
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,411
And sis, I love you.

72
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:12,803
How many should I take?

73
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:14,263
Five at a time.

74
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:15,812
That many?

75
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:18,789
Might as well get it all
done now, with you here.

76
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,218
It feels like you're just using me.

77
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:27,523
You're right, I'm using you.

78
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:32,267
Well, all right then I suppose.

79
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,056
Director Hong?

80
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:39,907
Where did he go?

81
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:43,888
Director Hong?

82
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:47,892
Director Hong?

83
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:57,200
Director Hong, are you over there?

84
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:07,622
Director Hong?

85
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,498
Good job.

86
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:52,758
Do I look weak to you?

87
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,722
Over here boy.

88
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:51,227
Am I scary?

89
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:56,093
Come here.

90
00:12:01,335 --> 00:12:03,675
You won't listen huh?

91
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:08,226
Over here boy.

92
00:12:13,594 --> 00:12:18,465
Should I put him in there with you?

93
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:25,014
Then come here.

94
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:31,756
Be a good girl.

95
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:36,385
Good girl...

96
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:45,413
Give me your hand.

97
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:49,257
Your hand.

98
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:09,308
I saved it for you.

99
00:13:09,717 --> 00:13:11,000
Let's go.

100
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:20,956
How long do I have to
stay here? How long?

101
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:30,000
Please let me go! Let me go!

102
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,353
Let me go! Let me go!

103
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:18,259
Good morning.

104
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:21,634
Oh, you're here?

105
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:23,169
Three cases.

106
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:25,500
Oh, they look great!

107
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,031
They are always that way.

108
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:32,017
What is your secret to
getting such great eggs?

109
00:15:32,217 --> 00:15:33,167
Should I teach you?

110
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,827
Teach me.

111
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:38,500
Then how would I possibly
make a living?

112
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,347
Thanks.

113
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:45,138
He looks to be in
a great mood today.

114
00:15:57,385 --> 00:15:59,531
Is that the new girl?

115
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:01,346
Yes, that's her.

116
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:06,195
Damn, she's hot.

117
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:08,963
Forget about her,
it ain't going to happen.

118
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:12,885
You're right, I don't
even have any money.

119
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:14,150
It's such a problem.

120
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,374
If it wasn't for our cocks, we wouldn't
even think about girls like her.

121
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:27,364
Hey dumbass, it's been a long time.

122
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:29,100
You're drinking again?

123
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:35,400
Nothing else to do in this place.
Sit down and drink with us.

124
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:40,200
I haven't seen you lately
but you look happy.

125
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,783
Did something good happen?

126
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:50,070
Something good? Yes.

127
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:54,214
Did the property value increase?

128
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:55,988
What do you mean?

129
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:59,500
The place Deok-goo lives,
that land belongs to you.

130
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,986
So?

131
00:17:01,526 --> 00:17:06,095
I heard they want to build a road on it.
Doesn't that mean you'll be rich?

132
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:12,350
That's all bullshit. Stuff like that
doesn't happen so easily.

133
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:15,460
I have to go buy something.

134
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,338
They're really building a road there?

135
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:28,258
It's true, he just doesn't
want people to know.

136
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:35,555
Dammit, how could something so
fortunate happen to such a bastard?

137
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,468
I know what you mean.

138
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:40,690
Idiots...

139
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:55,006
Hyeon-jeong, I'm so scared.

140
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,300
No! No!

141
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:30,989
Are you happy to see me?

142
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:37,390
Should I turn off the lights
and leave then?

143
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,574
No, please don't.

144
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:46,750
You pissed here huh?

145
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:50,214
You're just like a dog.

146
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,589
Take off your clothes.

147
00:20:00,636 --> 00:20:03,208
Take them all off and throw
them outside of the cage.

148
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:11,382
Do you want to keep living in there?

149
00:20:13,785 --> 00:20:15,800
Then listen to me.

150
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,571
Feels nice, doesn't it?

151
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:14,161
A dirty girl needs to be washed.

152
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:19,983
Come out and change into
those clothes over there.

153
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:40,200
Come on, blow out the candles.

154
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,914
Come on do it!

155
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:06,041
Clap! Come on, clap!

156
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:20,769
I'm in such a good mood.

157
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:29,700
You see how there is three candles?

158
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,496
You're my third one so far.

159
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:45,556
Don't be scared.
Listen to me and you'll be ok.

160
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,500
Shall we eat it?

161
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,634
Here, eat some.

162
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:01,600
Eat some, it's good.

163
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:09,776
Aren't you hungry? Eat it, it's good.

164
00:25:14,844 --> 00:25:16,835
Isn't it good?

165
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:21,944
Say it.

166
00:25:24,562 --> 00:25:26,000
Yes.

167
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:30,197
Aren't you thankful?

168
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:37,492
I saved you and I gave you food.

169
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:42,032
- Yes.
- Of course you are!

170
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:51,985
Now I'm going to sing you
one of my favorite songs.

171
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:27,878
I might look ugly now but
I used to dream of being a singer.

172
00:26:49,800 --> 00:27:03,104
<i>Look into my dark eyes,
you'll see that I still love you.</i>

173
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:15,000
<i>My feelings are returning
to what they once were.</i>

174
00:27:15,963 --> 00:27:28,652
<i>Teach me how to live without you.</i>

175
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:40,896
<i>My heart continues to beat for your love.</i>

176
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:06,669
You don't like my singing?

177
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,458
No, it's not that.

178
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,698
It's alright. I'm pretty bad aren't I?

179
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,840
No, it's really not that.

180
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,114
The cola got stuck in my throat.

181
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:23,391
Laugh for me.

182
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,249
What?

183
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:28,711
I said laugh for me!

184
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,695
Is that it?

185
00:28:44,637 --> 00:28:48,625
You fucking whore!

186
00:28:54,787 --> 00:28:58,018
That's the best laugh you can do?

187
00:28:58,048 --> 00:28:59,409
Die!

188
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,784
I do all this for you and
that's your best laugh?

189
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:33,928
Bend over.

190
00:29:39,587 --> 00:29:44,146
Bend over like a dog! Now!

191
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,299
Turn your head!

192
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,328
What, you don't think
I can get it up anymore?

193
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:14,729
You feel better than the last one.

194
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:25,812
Sis, I'm in so much pain.

195
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:32,974
Why aren't you investigating?
Isn't that your job?

196
00:34:33,188 --> 00:34:40,130
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's out of this jurisdiction.

197
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:44,150
That's not true. The last time
she called me was from here.

198
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,603
She also had dinner around this area.

199
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:51,840
That doesn't matter, she's not a child.

200
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,350
If we investigated every time
an adult left home for a few days,

201
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,019
there would be no cops
left on the street!

202
00:35:01,077 --> 00:35:02,611
You really can't do anything?

203
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:09,737
If you want us to help you, bring us
some solid evidence next time.

204
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:51,560
Can I help you?

205
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:58,474
I'm sorry about that. I know you came
a long way and we weren't able to help.

206
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:03,168
It's alright, I'll find her on my own.

207
00:36:04,165 --> 00:36:05,714
Wait a minute.

208
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,081
If you need some help, give me a call.

209
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,620
If it's serious, I'll be there right away.

210
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:15,242
Ok, thank you.

211
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:21,530
Shit, I didn't even get her phone number.

212
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:26,285
Get up.

213
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:33,727
I said get up!

214
00:36:49,286 --> 00:36:50,484
Bend over.

215
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:56,507
Please, can we not do it today?

216
00:36:56,695 --> 00:36:57,894
What?

217
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:01,388
I'm in a lot of pain.

218
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:04,459
You're fine, stop arguing.

219
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:10,353
I'm really in a lot of pain.

220
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,693
I don't look nice either.

221
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,789
Please, I'm begging you.

222
00:37:16,932 --> 00:37:19,709
Fine, give me a blowjob then.

223
00:37:26,587 --> 00:37:30,000
Come on. Hurry!

224
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Hurry.

225
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Hurry.

226
00:38:21,703 --> 00:38:22,608
Welcome.

227
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:23,638
Hello.

228
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:26,725
By any chance, have you been
working here for a long time?

229
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:27,610
Yes, I have.

230
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:30,814
- Can I ask you a question?
- What is it?

231
00:38:30,866 --> 00:38:36,833
Have you seen this woman?

232
00:38:40,669 --> 00:38:43,186
A dog bites her owner?

233
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:48,224
If a dog bites her owner once,
she will keep doing it.

234
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,504
So what needs to be done?

235
00:38:53,905 --> 00:38:55,942
You either kill her...

236
00:38:56,847 --> 00:38:59,687
...or you make it so
she can never bite again.

237
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:04,325
Open your mouth, bitch.

238
00:39:08,361 --> 00:39:10,515
Open your mouth.

239
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:33,753
Please let me go.

240
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:35,063
Let you go?

241
00:39:35,688 --> 00:39:39,202
Ok, I will, as soon as
I'm done with this.

242
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:03,953
Hello, is anybody there?

243
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:06,845
Anybody?

244
00:40:09,963 --> 00:40:11,781
One moment please!

245
00:40:14,229 --> 00:40:15,289
Yes?

246
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:16,916
Can I ask you something?

247
00:40:17,364 --> 00:40:19,294
What is it?

248
00:40:19,394 --> 00:40:21,574
Do you know of anybody
here that owns a dog?

249
00:40:22,749 --> 00:40:25,606
Around here, it would be better
to ask who doesn't own a dog.

250
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:28,143
No, I mean like a dog pound.

251
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:32,510
You should have said that from the start.

252
00:40:33,137 --> 00:40:34,651
There is one person like that.

253
00:40:34,978 --> 00:40:36,604
Where would that be?

254
00:40:37,315 --> 00:40:40,498
Do you see that path?

255
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:44,663
Go down that path and
you'll come onto a road.

256
00:40:45,101 --> 00:40:47,752
The first house you see on that road
is the one you're looking for.

257
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:49,739
- Thank you.
- One second!

258
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:52,808
I don't know why you're going there...

259
00:40:53,425 --> 00:40:55,200
...but you need to be careful.

260
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,300
Why?

261
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,296
The owner is more
dangerous than his dogs.

262
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,603
Fuck!

263
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,838
Damn, she's pretty.

264
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,800
Have you seen her?

265
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:40,568
I've never seen her.

266
00:41:40,618 --> 00:41:44,497
A few days ago I think she went by here.

267
00:41:44,497 --> 00:41:49,156
People always come by here
and don't give me a second look.

268
00:41:49,913 --> 00:41:54,347
How do you expect me
to remember them all?

269
00:41:54,527 --> 00:41:55,795
Excuse me, sir.

270
00:41:57,121 --> 00:41:59,770
Do you know of any
restaurant around here?

271
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:05,494
Yeah, there's a place up there.

272
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:07,833
It's been a while since
it's operated though.

273
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:08,968
Really?

274
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:10,514
Thank you.

275
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:23,365
Boy, I'd love to have a piece of her.

276
00:42:42,942 --> 00:42:46,986
Come on, eat it.

277
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:52,395
Do you want to starve to death?

278
00:42:53,743 --> 00:42:58,829
You didn't complain when I saved you,
so why do you do this now?

279
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:04,798
Does it bother you
that your son is happy?

280
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:10,836
No, you can't ever die.

281
00:43:12,146 --> 00:43:16,879
You need to live to see
your son lead a happy life.

282
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,320
Excuse me.

283
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,426
Is anybody there?

284
00:44:09,254 --> 00:44:10,954
Anybody there?

285
00:46:49,699 --> 00:46:50,933
Hello, who are you?

286
00:46:51,384 --> 00:46:54,399
Who are you? I'm the owner here.

287
00:46:54,848 --> 00:46:59,293
Oh I'm sorry, it looks
like I trespassed here.

288
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:02,317
It's alright, that happens sometimes.

289
00:47:02,832 --> 00:47:04,693
But why are you here?

290
00:47:06,173 --> 00:47:08,625
I'm looking for somebody.

291
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:13,785
Have you by any chance
seen this girl?

292
00:47:17,154 --> 00:47:19,199
You've seen her before?

293
00:47:20,747 --> 00:47:23,698
I've never seen her before.

294
00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:26,513
Oh...

295
00:47:27,855 --> 00:47:29,198
Who is she?

296
00:47:30,228 --> 00:47:31,855
She's my younger sister.

297
00:47:35,626 --> 00:47:38,182
Why are you looking for her here?

298
00:47:39,275 --> 00:47:42,400
A few days ago she told me she was
going to have dinner around here...

299
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,966
...I haven't heard from her since.

300
00:47:45,066 --> 00:47:50,413
You came to the wrong place. It's been
a while since we've even been open.

301
00:47:52,572 --> 00:47:54,405
One moment sir!

302
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:59,125
I saw a sign for the restaurant out front.

303
00:47:59,225 --> 00:48:02,483
Aren't there any people that
come here because of the sign?

304
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:09,944
In the past people used to come,
but nobody has been here these days.

305
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:57,912
It's her again.

306
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:00,535
Did you come looking for me?

307
00:49:00,826 --> 00:49:02,034
I have to ask you something.

308
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:04,665
It seems you're around here often so...

309
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:07,474
...have you seen this girl?

310
00:49:08,302 --> 00:49:09,825
She's so pretty!

311
00:49:10,235 --> 00:49:11,627
Have you seen her?

312
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:14,319
No, I don't think so.

313
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,664
I see.

314
00:49:16,864 --> 00:49:18,088
Who is it?

315
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:19,433
My sister.

316
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,376
Why are you looking for her here?

317
00:49:21,476 --> 00:49:24,861
I had a hunch. Thanks anyway.

318
00:49:29,946 --> 00:49:31,224
Wait a second!

319
00:49:32,161 --> 00:49:34,742
Was she together with a guy?

320
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:37,858
I think so.

321
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:41,833
Like a week ago, no 10 days ago?

322
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:42,987
That's right.

323
00:49:43,087 --> 00:49:47,717
Nice car, killer body,
I remember her now!

324
00:49:47,717 --> 00:49:49,028
Where did you see her?

325
00:49:49,295 --> 00:49:53,546
I saw her in front of that guy's house.

326
00:49:53,646 --> 00:49:54,737
Are you sure?

327
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:59,283
I'm sure. They say I'm stupid but
my memory is actually pretty good.

328
00:50:00,072 --> 00:50:02,620
Thank you so much.

329
00:50:06,248 --> 00:50:12,424
I wonder what's going on? Did that
old bastard do something again?

330
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,608
Kidnapping?

331
00:50:17,374 --> 00:50:21,191
What are you talking about?
Do you want to go to jail?

332
00:50:21,698 --> 00:50:26,210
Send me to jail if you want,
but please just listen to me.

333
00:50:27,789 --> 00:50:36,641
Listen, do you have
any idea who Pan-gon is?

334
00:50:37,233 --> 00:50:45,095
He lives only with his mother
and he's kind to everybody.

335
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,250
Sheriff, haven't you
seen the news lately?

336
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,688
Lots of kind people
have been doing bad things.

337
00:50:50,738 --> 00:50:53,300
- So please...
- That's enough!

338
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,781
Stop talking and please leave.

339
00:50:57,781 --> 00:51:03,656
- Sheriff!
- Stop, let's do it like this...

340
00:51:04,903 --> 00:51:07,842
I will go to Pan-gon's house
together with her.

341
00:51:07,892 --> 00:51:08,892
What?

342
00:51:09,292 --> 00:51:15,244
If something bad happens,
I will take responsibility for it.

343
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:25,028
We're going because of you, so
you better take full responsibility.

344
00:51:25,602 --> 00:51:28,051
Don't worry!

345
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:30,439
Dumbass...

346
00:51:31,298 --> 00:51:35,618
Who knows what we're getting ourselves into.

347
00:51:36,278 --> 00:51:38,680
- But Sheriff.
- What?

348
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:43,331
Mr. Pan-gon seems like a normal guy.
Why does he live by himself?

349
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,660
He hasn't always been that way.
It's probably because of women troubles.

350
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,121
What do you mean?

351
00:51:50,261 --> 00:51:53,981
A few years ago, his wife ran off.

352
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:56,240
Really? Why?

353
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:07,768
How the hell am I supposed to know?
It was a pretty big deal at the time.

354
00:52:07,948 --> 00:52:09,089
So did they find her?

355
00:52:09,384 --> 00:52:13,554
If they found her, would he still live alone?

356
00:52:25,923 --> 00:52:31,789
Sir, if there's nothing in the basement,
why can't we search it?

357
00:52:32,164 --> 00:52:41,632
I understand you must not like this, but stop
making a fuss out of something so small.

358
00:52:58,479 --> 00:53:00,930
Wait, Mr. Pan-gon!

359
00:53:09,105 --> 00:53:10,416
You do it.

360
00:53:18,432 --> 00:53:19,632
Mr. Pan-gon!

361
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:26,652
Where the hell did he go?

362
00:53:45,413 --> 00:53:47,000
Is there something in here?

363
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,800
Could there really be a person here?

364
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:55,545
Over here! Over here! Look at this.

365
00:56:15,322 --> 00:56:20,262
What the hell is that?
It smells terrible.

366
00:56:22,022 --> 00:56:25,161
So that's why?

367
00:56:25,586 --> 00:56:27,442
I caught it myself...

368
00:56:28,311 --> 00:56:30,142
...but it's illegal isn't it?

369
00:56:30,242 --> 00:56:36,205
So that's why you
wouldn't give us the key?

370
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:39,143
I was going to use it
to catch wild animals.

371
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:40,448
I'm sorry.

372
00:56:40,702 --> 00:56:47,130
That's alright. This little punk always
thinks the worst of people...

373
00:56:47,828 --> 00:56:50,810
Officer Kim, get out of there now!

374
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:10,791
Aren't you leaving? Is there
something else you want to see?

375
00:57:11,057 --> 00:57:12,353
No, let's go.

376
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:26,020
It's a little old...

377
00:58:34,968 --> 00:58:37,149
...but maybe it will still work.

378
00:59:21,906 --> 00:59:26,959
Hyeon-ah, today I bought you a scarf and I did
your hair for you. What do you have to say?

379
00:59:28,052 --> 00:59:31,687
My sister is the best!

380
01:00:45,001 --> 01:00:50,648
I'm sorry, I'll get it done
by the end of the week.

381
01:00:53,988 --> 01:00:58,011
It's just 200 1-piece suits.
I can get that done easily.

382
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:05,782
I'm coming to Seoul right now, so
let's speak when I arrive. Okay.

383
01:02:06,109 --> 01:02:07,151
Are you alright?

384
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,617
What the fuck!?

385
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:12,080
Mr. Pan-gon!

386
01:02:16,293 --> 01:02:18,559
You're the one from yesterday.

387
01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:22,334
Are you ok? You're not hurt are you?

388
01:02:22,846 --> 01:02:27,235
I'm fine...but my eggs are ruined.

389
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,772
I'm so sorry.

390
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,060
It was partially my fault.

391
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,624
Mr. Pan-gon, please let me
take you to the hospital.

392
01:02:35,674 --> 01:02:37,000
Hospital?

393
01:02:37,822 --> 01:02:40,370
No, it costs too much money.

394
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:44,111
Still, you should get checked out.

395
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:02,520
Hey, did your sister wear a necklace?

396
01:03:02,907 --> 01:03:07,945
You mean a heart-shaped necklace?

397
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,118
That's right, one that looks like that.

398
01:03:10,218 --> 01:03:12,247
What about that necklace?

399
01:03:12,933 --> 01:03:16,238
A few days ago, I found that necklace
outside of the dog keeper's house.

400
01:03:17,851 --> 01:03:19,150
Really?

401
01:03:19,484 --> 01:03:21,376
I was going to tell you
but I forgot about it.

402
01:03:21,699 --> 01:03:24,838
Do you have that necklace
with you right now?

403
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:28,032
No, it's at my house.

404
01:03:28,399 --> 01:03:32,340
Would it be ok if I go
to your house to get it?

405
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:37,511
I guess you could stop by.

406
01:03:37,671 --> 01:03:39,387
Thank you.

407
01:03:40,385 --> 01:03:42,300
- You remember where I live right?
- Yes.

408
01:04:51,649 --> 01:04:53,559
What can I do for you at this late hour?

409
01:04:53,947 --> 01:04:55,363
Where is the sheriff?

410
01:04:55,564 --> 01:04:57,886
He went home already.
I'm on the late shift.

411
01:04:59,257 --> 01:05:00,954
What's this?

412
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:05,017
I came out to buy some medicine for my
mother, but then I thought of you guys.

413
01:05:05,209 --> 01:05:08,892
You don't need to do this for us.
It's such a hassle.

414
01:05:09,203 --> 01:05:12,682
It's no problem, don't worry about it.

415
01:05:13,422 --> 01:05:14,475
I'll see you.

416
01:05:14,475 --> 01:05:15,991
OK, take care.

417
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:23,840
Oh, that woman from yesterday.
Did she find her sister?

418
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,695
I don't know. We haven't had
any contact from her since then.

419
01:05:27,083 --> 01:05:29,042
She must have gone back to Seoul.

420
01:05:29,295 --> 01:05:31,951
Oh, I see.

421
01:05:32,478 --> 01:05:36,204
If she stayed a little longer,
I probably could have helped more.

422
01:05:36,908 --> 01:05:38,918
You must have a crush on her.

423
01:05:39,136 --> 01:05:44,034
What? No way!

424
01:05:47,044 --> 01:05:48,277
Alright, I'll see ya.

425
01:05:49,777 --> 01:05:51,225
Work hard.

426
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:55,548
She was pretty hot.

427
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:58,386
The perfect style for me.

428
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:47,215
Save your strength, you'll only hurt yourself.

429
01:06:49,606 --> 01:06:53,365
I can't have my baby getting hurt...

430
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:03,583
Is this it?

431
01:07:18,011 --> 01:07:20,710
I didn't think it would be so easy.

432
01:07:21,602 --> 01:07:24,604
Aren't you smarter than this?

433
01:07:27,837 --> 01:07:29,460
Do you have something to say?

434
01:07:33,918 --> 01:07:36,237
My sister, where is my sister?

435
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,386
Is she still alive?

436
01:07:43,214 --> 01:07:47,516
This place...isn't it too small
to hold two people?

437
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,107
So then...

438
01:07:50,836 --> 01:07:52,308
I killed her.

439
01:07:52,803 --> 01:07:54,035
What?

440
01:07:58,965 --> 01:08:00,359
You son of a bitch!

441
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:05,632
I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you!

442
01:08:05,861 --> 01:08:09,821
You son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

443
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:12,997
Why are you so loud?

444
01:08:16,611 --> 01:08:18,660
Just shut up already.

445
01:08:20,797 --> 01:08:24,228
I've liked you since I first saw you.

446
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:35,792
So much softer and nicer
than your sister's.

447
01:08:37,733 --> 01:08:43,628
You're sister is young
so she's not that skilled.

448
01:08:44,531 --> 01:08:49,311
Don't worry, I'm a nice guy!

449
01:08:50,643 --> 01:08:52,973
What, you don't like older men?

450
01:08:53,545 --> 01:08:58,046
Stop worrying about it, you'll enjoy it.

451
01:08:59,211 --> 01:09:01,720
Eventually you're going to like me.

452
01:09:44,692 --> 01:09:50,601
Sheriff's office, this is Officer Kim.

453
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:57,689
A silver vehicle?

454
01:09:59,671 --> 01:10:01,568
Are you sure about that? My card?

455
01:10:14,072 --> 01:10:16,174
Ok, I'll be there immediately.

456
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:21,716
- Hello there, sir.
- Oh, who's this?

457
01:10:22,027 --> 01:10:24,650
What a body!

458
01:10:25,063 --> 01:10:26,897
Sir, I need to go to Choonchun.

459
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:28,563
Choonchun? Why?

460
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,489
That woman from Seoul from yesterday...
I guess her car was found there.

461
01:10:35,131 --> 01:10:39,597
So? Why are you going there?

462
01:10:39,956 --> 01:10:45,534
My card was found in the car
so I guess they contacted me.

463
01:10:45,772 --> 01:10:47,140
That's strange...

464
01:10:47,612 --> 01:10:49,597
She wasn't on her way to Choonchun.

465
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:51,086
What do you mean?

466
01:10:51,523 --> 01:10:54,095
Yesterday morning I saw her car...

467
01:10:54,145 --> 01:10:58,068
She wasn't on her way to Choonchun
but the opposite way into our town.

468
01:10:58,168 --> 01:10:59,013
Are you sure?

469
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:00,684
I'm sure.

470
01:11:02,069 --> 01:11:08,948
She must have been in a hurry. I waved to her
but she went right by without noticing.

471
01:11:09,277 --> 01:11:10,408
Really?

472
01:11:11,137 --> 01:11:12,304
Anyway, thanks.

473
01:11:12,884 --> 01:11:14,195
Ok, I'll be going now.

474
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,734
Alright, take care.

475
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,572
Hi there, you came again!

476
01:11:27,811 --> 01:11:30,821
Yes...my daughter really loves this place.

477
01:11:31,148 --> 01:11:33,466
What will it be this time?

478
01:11:34,314 --> 01:11:36,265
Something similar to last time please.

479
01:11:37,182 --> 01:11:39,253
One piece with one seam right?

480
01:11:39,831 --> 01:11:41,343
Wow, you remember that.

481
01:11:41,952 --> 01:11:47,711
Of course. Besides you, nobody in this
small town ever wants something so specific.

482
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:52,784
She says it's nice but...

483
01:11:52,784 --> 01:11:56,664
...could you give me a different color?

484
01:11:57,089 --> 01:11:58,769
What color would you like?

485
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:01,728
Do you have purple?

486
01:12:01,888 --> 01:12:04,070
Purple? Of course.

487
01:12:05,745 --> 01:12:08,517
Could I get it one size smaller too?

488
01:12:09,174 --> 01:12:11,747
Did the last one not fit properly?

489
01:12:11,826 --> 01:12:15,771
No, it's just that she lost some weight.

490
01:12:16,671 --> 01:12:18,800
Then, one size smaller.

491
01:12:25,357 --> 01:12:26,559
Here it is, right here.

492
01:12:27,358 --> 01:12:30,648
Wow, this has really been damaged.

493
01:12:32,665 --> 01:12:35,380
It's just fortunate that the people
driving it weren't killed.

494
01:12:35,737 --> 01:12:41,372
If we can't find the owner fast, there will
be a big issue with the insurance.

495
01:12:42,053 --> 01:12:44,992
Are you sure that the driver was a male?

496
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:48,552
Is it possible that the people
who stole this car were mistaken?

497
01:12:48,652 --> 01:12:54,487
No, if you look at it you can
clearly see it was a man.

498
01:12:55,143 --> 01:13:00,061
The three kids who stole it were drunk and
bragging about what they did last night.

499
01:13:00,887 --> 01:13:03,805
Did those kids remember anything
about the man they stole it from?

500
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:07,900
I don't know if it was because it was dark,
but they can't remember anything.

501
01:13:08,231 --> 01:13:10,089
Is that so...

502
01:13:36,055 --> 01:13:37,481
Hello?

503
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:44,284
- Is anybody home?
- Nobody's here.

504
01:13:46,432 --> 01:13:48,739
Oh, hello there.

505
01:13:50,374 --> 01:13:51,997
How can I help you?

506
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:53,493
We came here to dine.

507
01:13:54,367 --> 01:13:55,757
About that...

508
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,423
We've been closed for a long time.

509
01:13:59,112 --> 01:14:01,172
Oh really? Why is that?

510
01:14:02,029 --> 01:14:03,993
There's nobody left to work...

511
01:14:04,656 --> 01:14:06,504
...since my mother passed away.

512
01:14:07,224 --> 01:14:09,970
Oh no...

513
01:14:10,444 --> 01:14:13,185
When we came three years ago,
business seemed to have been good.

514
01:14:13,322 --> 01:14:14,928
Yes, I know...

515
01:14:15,728 --> 01:14:17,237
I'm sorry that you had to come all this way.

516
01:14:17,456 --> 01:14:19,737
No it's alright, it's our fault.

517
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:23,509
Goodbye.

518
01:14:29,096 --> 01:14:31,577
At least they have good taste...

519
01:14:44,178 --> 01:14:46,273
How are you feeling?

520
01:14:49,595 --> 01:14:53,136
Wow, you haven't even
gone to the bathroom yet.

521
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:56,054
You're tough.

522
01:14:56,598 --> 01:14:58,446
That makes me even hornier.

523
01:15:01,186 --> 01:15:02,794
Have something to say?

524
01:15:05,495 --> 01:15:08,367
Don't be loud like yesterday...

525
01:15:08,618 --> 01:15:11,656
...Or I'm going to be angry.

526
01:15:15,008 --> 01:15:16,854
Speak your mind.

527
01:15:18,237 --> 01:15:22,171
I promise I'll kill you.

528
01:15:26,443 --> 01:15:27,927
Crazy bitch.

529
01:15:28,636 --> 01:15:30,201
You're nothing but a dog.

530
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:33,463
How can a dog kill a human?

531
01:15:36,045 --> 01:15:39,992
Dogs should live as dogs are supposed to.

532
01:15:41,983 --> 01:15:48,771
So stop being so stubborn
and let's live together.

533
01:15:51,902 --> 01:15:54,228
You're starting to stink.

534
01:15:55,385 --> 01:16:00,189
Tomorrow, you can take a shower
and change into some new clothes.

535
01:16:02,606 --> 01:16:12,277
By tomorrow...you will be begging
for me never to leave you.

536
01:16:12,546 --> 01:16:17,900
I told you, I'm a nice guy.

537
01:16:19,982 --> 01:16:23,116
Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.

538
01:16:34,914 --> 01:16:35,941
Tough bitch...

539
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:45,188
I bought you one size smaller
than your sister...

540
01:16:48,828 --> 01:16:55,102
It should fit right?
It's a pretty purple color.

541
01:17:08,768 --> 01:17:11,872
Die you son of a bitch!

542
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:37,456
You can't kill me with weak stuff like this.

543
01:17:41,781 --> 01:17:44,090
I'll show you what an owner does!

544
01:17:45,226 --> 01:17:47,531
I beat you until you die!

545
01:17:58,401 --> 01:18:02,199
These girls just don't understand my feelings.

546
01:18:17,156 --> 01:18:18,387
Hello?

547
01:18:19,672 --> 01:18:22,115
Is anybody there?

548
01:18:44,509 --> 01:18:48,656
These bitches are never grateful...

549
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:02,800
What's this?

550
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:16,505
I killed him.

551
01:19:17,684 --> 01:19:20,449
Are you surprised?

552
01:19:25,456 --> 01:19:27,966
I saw what you are doing in the basement.

553
01:19:28,572 --> 01:19:32,253
You must be having a lot of fun.

554
01:19:33,755 --> 01:19:38,000
I always thought you were retarded
but I guess I was wrong.

555
01:19:41,191 --> 01:19:43,507
You didn't report me to the police?

556
01:19:44,222 --> 01:19:45,315
Report you?

557
01:19:45,789 --> 01:19:49,349
Why would I possibly do that?

558
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:51,824
How did you know about me?

559
01:19:52,593 --> 01:19:54,800
I saw that girl drive her car
here in the morning,

560
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:57,091
and then I saw you
drive it out at night.

561
01:19:57,191 --> 01:19:58,925
Wouldn't that seem weird?

562
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:00,843
What do you want?

563
01:20:03,856 --> 01:20:05,903
You have valuable land.

564
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:07,881
Land?

565
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:10,061
I want just a little...

566
01:20:10,459 --> 01:20:20,015
I brought all the papers necessary.
All you need to do is sign it.

567
01:20:26,326 --> 01:20:27,946
What are you doing?

568
01:20:29,556 --> 01:20:31,200
Give it to me!

569
01:20:32,363 --> 01:20:34,499
This is very valuable.

570
01:20:36,905 --> 01:20:39,091
I can't just give it to you for free.

571
01:20:39,588 --> 01:20:41,241
What is this?

572
01:20:41,815 --> 01:20:44,288
Don't worry, I'll give it you.

573
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,480
But in exchange for it,
you need to help me with my work.

574
01:20:50,092 --> 01:20:51,196
Work?

575
01:20:53,818 --> 01:20:55,688
The bitch in the basement...

576
01:20:57,029 --> 01:20:59,100
...I have to kill her.

577
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,031
Fuck...

578
01:21:01,131 --> 01:21:05,797
You motherfucker. What kind of
a person do you think I am?

579
01:21:07,281 --> 01:21:09,001
That's the deal.

580
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:13,332
Or you could just keep living like shit.

581
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:18,300
You won't?

582
01:21:20,197 --> 01:21:23,836
- I'll do it myself.
- Wait!

583
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:34,891
So how do you want me to help you?

584
01:21:35,453 --> 01:21:37,615
I'll bring out the tools...

585
01:21:39,057 --> 01:21:41,021
You bring out the girl.

586
01:23:17,798 --> 01:23:19,523
Hey, Deok-goo!

587
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:22,782
What's that?

588
01:24:33,265 --> 01:24:35,510
Don't worry, I'll get you out.

589
01:24:44,009 --> 01:24:45,854
Ok, let's get out of here.

590
01:24:46,816 --> 01:24:50,750
No, you have to kill that bastard.

591
01:24:51,284 --> 01:24:53,463
For now, let's just get out of here.

592
01:24:53,528 --> 01:24:55,466
He killed my sister!

593
01:24:59,024 --> 01:25:01,999
Look!

594
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:13,369
Idiot...why did you have to get involved?

595
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:24,469
I'm disappointed.

596
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:27,339
I don't think it's going
to work out between us.

597
01:25:27,921 --> 01:25:29,609
You can die too.

598
01:25:35,302 --> 01:25:36,411
There's no escape.

599
01:25:36,688 --> 01:25:40,170
Nobody has ever escaped this place before.

600
01:26:23,895 --> 01:26:25,863
Where are you?

601
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,900
Where did she go?

602
01:28:11,253 --> 01:28:13,509
Trying to get away...

603
01:28:15,774 --> 01:28:17,453
Crazy bitch.

604
01:28:40,272 --> 01:28:41,988
Little girl!

605
01:28:44,015 --> 01:28:45,824
Where are you?

606
01:28:49,369 --> 01:28:51,700
Come on out now.

607
01:28:52,795 --> 01:28:54,829
I'm here, you son of a bitch.

608
01:29:05,785 --> 01:29:08,126
So there you are.

609
01:29:09,596 --> 01:29:11,945
What are you going to do with that?

610
01:29:12,147 --> 01:29:15,035
Get on your knees.

611
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,811
Or I'll kill you.

612
01:29:18,605 --> 01:29:19,964
Kill me?

613
01:29:21,469 --> 01:29:27,898
Have you ever killed somebody?

614
01:29:28,773 --> 01:29:31,248
Shut up and get on your knees!

615
01:29:32,691 --> 01:29:39,132
I killed my father when I was 16.

616
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,500
I threw his body into the pig pen...

617
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:47,225
and the pigs ate his body.

618
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:51,225
The last thing they ate was his head.

619
01:30:03,767 --> 01:30:05,141
You missed...

620
01:30:19,265 --> 01:30:20,096
Die!

621
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:40,728
Is there a reason why you deserve to live?

622
01:30:41,907 --> 01:30:43,234
Bitch!

623
01:30:59,084 --> 01:31:01,610
You got me good.

624
01:31:08,728 --> 01:31:10,283
You son of a bitch.

625
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:14,866
Tell me...

626
01:31:16,584 --> 01:31:18,436
My sister...

627
01:31:19,639 --> 01:31:21,807
Did you really kill her?

628
01:31:22,016 --> 01:31:23,738
Crazy bitch...

629
01:31:24,038 --> 01:31:26,216
I told you I killed her.

630
01:31:26,785 --> 01:31:28,135
Then...

631
01:31:31,044 --> 01:31:33,828
Where is her body?

632
01:31:34,355 --> 01:31:36,695
Where did you put Hyeon-ah's body!?

633
01:31:37,681 --> 01:31:40,679
What does it matter if she's dead?

634
01:31:41,234 --> 01:31:44,670
Tell me or you're dead!

635
01:31:45,277 --> 01:31:47,864
Sounds good.

636
01:31:51,103 --> 01:31:58,161
I wish somebody would kill me.

637
01:31:59,919 --> 01:32:01,498
Kill me.

638
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:03,531
Kill me.

639
01:32:03,631 --> 01:32:05,121
Tell me now.

640
01:32:06,211 --> 01:32:08,230
My sister.

641
01:32:08,995 --> 01:32:12,450
Where is her body?

642
01:32:15,693 --> 01:32:18,216
That meat grinder over there...

643
01:32:20,914 --> 01:32:25,203
I killed your sister with that.

644
01:32:28,341 --> 01:32:30,156
Don't lie to me!

645
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:33,262
I cut up her whole body.

646
01:32:33,855 --> 01:32:35,894
You crazy bastard.

647
01:32:36,361 --> 01:32:37,425
You're lying!

648
01:32:37,475 --> 01:32:39,500
I'll tell you another thing.

649
01:32:41,328 --> 01:32:42,880
Your sister...

650
01:32:44,153 --> 01:32:46,288
...was alive.

651
01:32:47,990 --> 01:32:53,399
She was alive until you came here.

652
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:58,437
I really liked her.

653
01:32:58,757 --> 01:33:03,895
Maybe I shouldn't have killed her.
It's such a shame.

654
01:33:07,024 --> 01:33:09,028
You killed her.

655
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,584
Your sister.

656
01:33:13,136 --> 01:33:15,201
She died because you came here.

657
01:33:15,251 --> 01:33:17,342
Stupid bitch.

658
01:33:54,046 --> 01:33:55,863
I hope you're doing well.

659
01:33:57,718 --> 01:34:00,855
In a few days you'll be going to court.

660
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:08,533
Ok, let's get this over with quickly.

661
01:34:10,235 --> 01:34:16,482
Hyeon-jeong, you're killing of Pan-gon
can be passed off as self defense.

662
01:34:16,935 --> 01:34:19,400
But the problem is,
the extra activity afterwards.

663
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:23,689
It cannot be passed off as self defense.

664
01:34:24,734 --> 01:34:33,910
In order to avoid jail time,
I believe you must plead insanity.

665
01:34:35,016 --> 01:34:36,575
Do you understand?

666
01:34:41,615 --> 01:34:43,830
What are you talking about?

667
01:34:45,348 --> 01:34:48,868
I'm talking about when you put
Pan-gon's body into the grinder.

668
01:34:49,528 --> 01:34:55,874
Sir, when I killed him
I wasn't thinking clearly.

669
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:01,866
But when I put his body into the grinder,
I was thinking very clearly.

670
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,433
What?

671
01:35:04,433 --> 01:35:13,317
If I ever meet another person like him,
I would gladly do the same.

672
01:35:22,956 --> 01:35:24,246
Hyeon-jeong.

673
01:35:24,824 --> 01:35:26,655
Hyeon-jeong!

674
01:35:31,159 --> 01:35:32,750
Can I ask you something?

675
01:35:33,841 --> 01:35:35,643
Yes, go ahead.

676
01:35:36,355 --> 01:35:39,224
Do you have a daughter?

677
01:35:40,311 --> 01:35:42,008
Yes, I do.

678
01:36:13,490 --> 01:36:14,715
Excuse me, old man!

679
01:36:14,765 --> 01:36:17,025
Could you give us
a ride on your boat?

680
01:36:31,995 --> 01:36:33,914
What, you can't?

681
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:36,613
Get on.

682
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,935
Crazy bitch.
