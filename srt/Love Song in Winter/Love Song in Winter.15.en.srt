[Love Song in Winter]

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,009
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,650
Why're you here?

4
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,580
I knew you'd be here.

5
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,100
I happened to be shooting near the office.

6
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,750
Haven't eaten yet, yeah?

7
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,960
Where are your manager and assistant?

8
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,020
Why are you alone?

9
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,150
I'm not that popular.

10
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,949
It's more convenient

11
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,630
alone.

12
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,820
It's newly opened nearby.

13
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,930
I tried it

14
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,880
last week.

15
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,660
It's quite good.

16
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,829
It is quite good.

17
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,340
By the way,

18
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,300
you said you'd

19
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,550
find me a professional.

20
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,660
How's it going?

21
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,400
There are

22
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,430
two new scripts for you

23
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,530
for the leading role.

24
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,110
Must you do the previous one?

25
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,240
You've sent me

26
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,390
those two scripts.

27
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,750
What's the difference

28
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,710
from my previous roles?

29
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,680
I'm not interested at all.

30
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,270
With your current popularity,

31
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,040
if you spend a few months

32
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,760
to study

33
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,200
and another year to shoot this film,

34
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,670
when you return,

35
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,700
you might not

36
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:55,870
be as popular anymore.

37
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,190
You should know

38
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,670
what I've always wanted.

39
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,160
I just want to play

40
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,950
a role that's memorable.

41
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,030
You said you'd support me.

42
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,030
What's with this attitude?

43
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,610
Alright.

44
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,910
I've gone to Ninghai Police Academy

45
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,930
to consult their principal.

46
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,510
He found you a professor

47
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,400
specializing

48
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,980
in criminal psychology.

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,370
You can start class tomorrow.

50
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,780
Really?

51
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,940
You were teasing me?

52
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,500
Thank you.

53
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,160
I'll go there tomorrow

54
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,790
and learn

55
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:32,390
earnestly.

56
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,750
Hey.

57
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,360
Let's drink.

58
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,750
Okay. Let's celebrate.

59
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,610
Today, I want to thank my boss.

60
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,910
Boss, thank you

61
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,700
for agreeing

62
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,450
to that role for me.

63
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,300
Eat up.

64
00:03:58,329 --> 00:03:59,350
Stop working.

65
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,240
You are

66
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,110
working way too much.

67
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,870
Relax a bit.

68
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,270
Hello?

69
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,930
Are you home?

70
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:29,930
Yeah.

71
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,790
Okay, come downstairs.

72
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,050
Tang Jie and I will be there soon.

73
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,330
For what?

74
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,640
I brought you some daily necessities,

75
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,810
bowls and utensils.

76
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,710
You have nothing.

77
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,510
You'll starve to death.

78
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,470
I don't need those.

79
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,700
What do you mean?

80
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,300
It's all free.

81
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,070
Listen.

82
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,880
This pot is great.

83
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:46,909
It’s from Tang Jie’s client.

84
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,650
We couldn't even bear to use it.

85
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,020
You didn't tell Lu Yan that you came, did you?

86
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,060
Don’t worry. Our lips are sealed.

87
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,200
Cut the crap.

88
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,720
Come down now.

89
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,420
We're almost there.

90
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,560
Okay.

91
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,240
What's up with Jiang Chengyi?

92
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,440
If he wants to protect her,

93
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,510
why must he hide it?

94
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,630
So wishy-washy.

95
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,340
Gosh.

96
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,150
Isn't Lu Yan the same?

97
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:14,930
Hurry up.

98
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,640
Why are you rushing me?

99
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,530
Why don't you help me, huh?

100
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:20,830
What?

101
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,920
You want my wife to help?

102
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,150
My pot's quite heavy.

103
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,310
I'm helping!

104
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,700
Don't tire yourselves out.

105
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,130
Tang Jie, Zhong.

106
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,430
I’ll leave first.

107
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:31,970
Bye.

108
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,640
Who was that?

109
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,750
Who?

110
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,020
It's just us two.

111
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,760
Why are you two here?

112
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,480
We...

113
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,159
Honey.

114
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,380
W-What are we doing here?

115
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,180
We...

116
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,540
We're here for hotpot!

117
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,250
Hotpot?

118
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,800
But I

119
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,250
have a pot at home.

120
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:57,940
Um...

121
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,690
I don't eat the spicy broth.

122
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,740
Half-and-half.

123
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,630
Did you bring the ingredients?

124
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,750
Ingre—

125
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,670
We'll just order it!

126
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,870
It's fresher.

127
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:07,690
Let's go.

128
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,670
I'm starving.

129
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,590
T-Then

130
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,330
why didn't you text me first?

131
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,070
Let me check...

132
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,550
Almost here. Ten minutes left.

133
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,050
Let's plug the pot in later.

134
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,590
I've brought the extension cord.

135
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,300
Okay.

136
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,350
What's wrong?

137
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,320
Sound-controlled lights.

138
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,520
Did she see me?

139
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,720
The slippers are there.

140
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,310
Okay.

141
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,070
Honey, hold this for me.

142
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,430
Okay.

143
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,400
I'll go get changed.

144
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,159
Okay.

145
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,530
I need some water.

146
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,000
Did she see me?

147
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,670
No.

148
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,060
We're eating hotpot.

149
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,040
Want to join?

150
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,330
That's too much.

151
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,750
What are you looking at?

152
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,300
Nothing.

153
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,330
I was admiring

154
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,600
your flowers.

155
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,600
Honey.

156
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,720
Let's raise some too.

157
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,590
No thanks.

158
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,210
You've got a neighbor next door?

159
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,870
Why's the light still on?

160
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,360
I think they're new here.

161
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,660
I haven't met them.

162
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,230
Where's the pot?

163
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,220
Here, here.

164
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,570
Give it to me.

165
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,490
There's some veggies here.

166
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,580
Hotpot's the best.

167
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,020
It's so yummy.

168
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,870
It's because this pot is good.

169
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,750
Right, honey?

170
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,460
Cheers to

171
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,340
this hotpot.

172
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,710
I'm not drinking.

173
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,960
I've to write my thesis later.

174
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,450
Honey, drink with me.

175
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,230
I'll pass too.

176
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,610
Who'll drive if we both drink?

177
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,640
You drink then.

178
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,980
You drink.

179
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,280
Let's toast

180
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:49,840
with water.

181
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,760
Cheers.

182
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,520
Cheers.

183
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,360
Why'd you two...

184
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,110
come to have hotpot with me

185
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,110
so suddenly?

186
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,510
Huh? Why else?

187
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,190
I saw that you've lost weight.

188
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,180
Eat more meat

189
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,040
for energy.

190
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,410
I'm really happy

191
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,440
to have you two here.

192
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,680
Thank you.

193
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,630
How've you been lately?

194
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,800
What are you busy with?

195
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,820
It's been good.

196
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,750
Well...

197
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,370
Go to and from work,

198
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,910
busy with...

199
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,650
with what I should be with.

200
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,380
What about you and Jiang?

201
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,800
You're drunk.

202
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,460
I just...

203
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,310
I haven't even had a sip.

204
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,220
Why'd you open the window?

205
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,530
It's so cold.

206
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:54,880
Honey.

207
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,910
Didn't you say I was drunk?

208
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,810
I need some fresh air.

209
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,790
Let's just eat. Ignore him.

210
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,840
Here, I'll get you more.

211
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,600
A quail egg.

212
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,680
I like quail eggs.

213
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,820
Ignore him.

214
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,540
Okay.

215
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,820
There's an egg here.

216
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,800
Here.

217
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,090
Thanks.

218
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,340
Lu Yan.

219
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,880
I don't really

220
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,590
have a right to

221
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,790
meddle in your business.

222
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,360
But today,

223
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,310
as Jiang Chengyi's longtime buddy,

224
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,500
I've to ask you this.

225
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,710
Do you want

226
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,950
to be with Jiang or not?

227
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,350
Actually, I know

228
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,940
he's always been in your heart,

229
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,250
just like how you've always been in his!

230
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,650
I know.

231
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,430
Lu Yan.

232
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,740
I know you're sad.

233
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,450
But for many things,

234
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,830
he's really not at fault.

235
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,640
I know.

236
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,470
Then why're you ignoring him?

237
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,110
Do you know

238
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,620
he moved

239
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,030
next door for you?

240
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,950
Moved next door?

241
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,720
H-Honey.

242
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,630
D-Do you understand

243
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,940
what I just said?

244
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,250
That is,

245
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,780
she's annoyed with Jiang!

246
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,830
So Jiang can't see her,

247
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,100
but he's worried about her,

248
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,890
s-so...

249
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,910
His heart...

250
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,490
lives next door to Lu Yan.

251
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,980
His heart moved in next door.

252
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,580
I...

253
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,030
You don't have to explain.

254
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,910
I understand.

255
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,690
I get it.

256
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,320
Actually,

257
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,350
I know...

258
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,040
it's not his fault.

259
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,910
I don't blame him either.

260
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,220
It's just that...

261
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,380
seeing him reminds me of the past.

262
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,280
I'm worried

263
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,280
my negativity will

264
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,840
get to him too.

265
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,270
We can't be together like normal.

266
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,970
So it's better not to see each other.

267
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,380
I...

268
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,190
I need some time too.

269
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,010
Yes.

270
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,110
She needs some time!

271
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,760
She needs time!

272
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,240
It's okay! Take your time!

273
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,900
I...

274
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,250
I can hear you!

275
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,530
Well, the window's open.

276
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,190
I thought

277
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,590
the wind might be too loud.

278
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,590
I'll close the window.

279
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,420
No, no!

280
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,310
No, I’m drunk.

281
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,430
-I need fresh air.
-Ventilation...

282
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,360
Or your place will reek.

283
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,060
You don't have to

284
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,550
bear so many things alone.

285
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,190
You can just tell him.

286
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,190
Maybe he is

287
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,430
willing to bear them with you.

288
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,160
You can't blame yourself

289
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,270
for every mistake.

290
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,470
Got it?

291
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,450
Go easy on yourself

292
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,110
and on Jiang Chengyi.

293
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,830
Don't punish yourself

294
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,670
for the past.

295
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,830
But actually...

296
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,070
I've made progress.

297
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,430
Lately, I've been

298
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,970
trying to change.

299
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,080
Don't worry.

300
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,130
I...

301
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,510
I'll be fine soon.

302
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,240
I'm really happy to hear that.

303
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,150
Lu Yan.

304
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,280
As long as you

305
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,340
don't forget that

306
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,430
Jiang's never stopped

307
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,350
loving you.

308
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,890
Here.

309
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,890
For Jiang,

310
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:27,750
a toast to you.

311
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,090
Cheers.

312
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:32,870
Cheers!

313
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,930
Toasting the air?

314
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,430
It's the thought that counts.

315
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,790
-I'll drink the air!
-Cheers to us too.

316
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,290
Thank you, guys.

317
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,450
You’re back.

318
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,430
Captain Jiang.

319
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,300
Captain Jiang.

320
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,150
The technical department

321
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,680
is sorting out Wang Qiang's case

322
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,310
for

323
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:26,960
submission.

324
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,620
But something new cropped up.

325
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,590
This user

326
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,850
[Reply when you're free!]
[Where are you!]
[Reply!]

327
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,070
has been contacting him

328
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,200
since three days ago,

329
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,800
initially asking about his day

330
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,710
and for him to reply.

331
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,030
Our tech thought they were

332
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,720
just friends.

333
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,290
But since last night,

334
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,920
they've been looking for Wang Qiang

335
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,030
anxiously.

336
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,440
Did you find out who this is?

337
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,350
Yes.

338
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,600
From the back-end data,

339
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,550
this person is Liu Yujie.

340
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,000
Liu Yujie?

341
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,150
What? You know them?

342
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,730
Did you ask Wang Qiang about it?

343
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,320
I asked,

344
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,350
but he wouldn't cooperate,

345
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,860
saying he has no idea.

346
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,430
Find a way to ask them out.

347
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,200
Got it.

348
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,430
Jiang Chengyi.

349
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,610
[Ding Jing]

350
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,430
Our families are having dinner

351
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,530
the day after tomorrow.

352
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,130
Can you come pick me up?

353
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,310
Sorry.

354
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,270
It's not on the way.

355
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,240
Jing!

356
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,190
Okay.

357
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,310
See you there directly then.

358
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,990
Jing.

359
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:31,780
Look.

360
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,650
How about these two?

361
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,080
I think they really suit you.

362
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,200
And they're new designs.

363
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,950
Not bad, Liu Yujie.

364
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,020
Your taste has improved.

365
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,690
It's not about my taste.

366
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,090
It's because you're pretty,

367
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,350
so you look good in everything.

368
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,110
Our Jing is so beautiful.

369
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,710
Jiang Chengyi

370
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,310
will fall head over heels for you.

371
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:51,760
Okay.

372
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,420
I'll take these two you picked.

373
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,430
Any other new designs

374
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,320
I can check out?

375
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,720
Sure.

376
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,270
I'll bring them all to you.

377
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,880
Jing.

378
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,079
Why don't I tell Jiang Chengyi

379
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,510
about you being stalked?

380
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,170
You're in danger now.

381
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,990
He'll come to protect you.

382
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,040
Talk nonsense to Jiang Chengyi

383
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,109
and I’ll rip your mouth off.

384
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,540
Okay, I won't.

385
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,640
Why are you so mad?

386
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,510
Mad?

387
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,800
Have you done what I asked you to do?

388
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,800
Where's Wang Qiang?

389
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,470
Where's the stun gun?

390
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,000
Um,

391
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,760
I've sent him many texts,

392
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,910
but he hasn't replied.

393
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,590
Don't you have legs?

394
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,550
Can't you go to his house to find him?

395
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,520
Liu Yujie.

396
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,820
Do you know how much money

397
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,990
Wang Qiang took from me?

398
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,080
A-A-A lot?

399
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,870
100,000,

400
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,220
and I'm being conservative.

401
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,810
S-So much?

402
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,070
Tell Wang Qiang

403
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,080
I didn't pay him for nothing.

404
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,470
Rush him to hold up

405
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,890
his end of the deal.

406
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,350
Don’t worry.

407
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,510
Yujie.

408
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,810
You too.

409
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,550
Let's meet tonight.

410
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,520
In serial murders,

411
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,060
the murderer is usually a power junkie,

412
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,320
that is someone power hungry.

413
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,950
These people

414
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,310
are obsessed with power.

415
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,150
In order to control

416
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,310
people around them,

417
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,000
they often hide

418
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,990
important info

419
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,320
to gain the upper hand

420
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,330
and attention

421
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,310
to satisfy

422
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,840
their distorted sense of authority.

423
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:49,900
Also,

424
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,990
they have another

425
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,670
typical characteristic.

426
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,480
That is,

427
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,460
being the manipulator.

428
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,140
Manipulation.

429
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,230
They'll repeatedly pretend

430
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,530
to be vulnerable

431
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,580
and helpless,

432
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,170
and even pretend to please others.

433
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,110
Ms. Yu

434
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,390
is our criminal psychology expert

435
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,750
in the Police Academy.

436
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,310
Serial killers of

437
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,030
civilized societies

438
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,710
usually have such characteristics.

439
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,510
They're very confusing.

440
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,820
She was involved

441
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,350
in many major cases.

442
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,230
Manipulating others.

443
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,150
They even

444
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,990
misguide people

445
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,990
around them

446
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,230
to believe they're kind.

447
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,200
So, as I was...

448
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,070
What's the rush?

449
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,730
Next week,

450
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,670
submit a reflection

451
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,270
on this class.

452
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,260
No copying others.

453
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,270
My eyes have in-built plagiarism detectors.

454
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,910
Class is over.

455
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,810
The best part about classes is when they're over.

456
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,940
Goodbye, Ms. Yu.

457
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,150
Ms. Yu.

458
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,750
Let me introduce someone new.

459
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,000
Do you remember the actor

460
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,870
I mentioned?

461
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,990
Hello, Ms. Yu.

462
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,330
Hello, Yu Bofeng.

463
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,710
We've met before.

464
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,250
That's good.

465
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,440
You're not strangers then.

466
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,030
Mr. Yu is taking on

467
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,150
a crime film soon.

468
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,330
Since

469
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,890
you're an expert in this field,

470
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,980
he wants you

471
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,110
to be his consultant

472
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,890
and help him with the role.

473
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,570
Ms. Yu.

474
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,440
Privately,

475
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,350
just teach him

476
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,620
when you're free.

477
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,520
Director Li.

478
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,350
I told you already.

479
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,190
I'm researching

480
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,060
[Serial Murder Case]

481
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,260
a new topic.

482
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,800
I doubt I have time.

483
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,670
Ms. Yu.

484
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,420
He...

485
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,350
His boss, Mr. Wen,

486
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,580
funded a lab

487
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,670
in our school.

488
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,310
Can't you

489
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,390
carve out some time?

490
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,030
Okay?

491
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,270
The principal owes him.

492
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,780
Let him pay it back himself.

493
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,050
What do I have to do with it?

494
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,830
Besides,

495
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,750
I teach here and at a school.

496
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,550
You know that.

497
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,710
I'm swamped.

498
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,750
I can't deal

499
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,710
with a superstar.

500
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,370
No.

501
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,030
Ms. Yu.

502
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,760
Ms. Yu.

503
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,510
I came here

504
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,350
because I really need to learn.

505
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,110
How about this?

506
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,480
I'll just attend

507
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,690
your classes like everyone.

508
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:04,920
By the way,

509
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,240
this is my first day here.

510
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,870
This is a gift for you.

511
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,030
-No, no, I can’t accept it.
-Don’t worry.

512
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,770
It's not money.

513
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,990
I know you have rules.

514
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,030
This is my...

515
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,590
autographed photo.

516
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,690
Take a look.

517
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,810
It's a souvenir.

518
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,120
I'm not into celebrities. Thanks.

519
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,950
Ms. Yu!

520
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,910
Professor Yu!

521
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,300
I know...

522
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,580
that when you came to my agency

523
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,760
to ask about Wang Qianqian,

524
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,130
I left a bad impression.

525
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,030
But now I have

526
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,510
a role I really want.

527
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,110
I need your professional

528
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,800
help.

529
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,030
Why won't you

530
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,950
teach me?

531
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,040
That's a different matter.

532
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,030
Let's put aside

533
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,990
my impression of you.

534
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,870
I know a bit

535
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,270
about your line of work.

536
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,570
It's just a photo opportunity

537
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,640
so your agency

538
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,910
can promote you

539
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,000
as a hardworking actor,

540
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,760
right?

541
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,110
My classes

542
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,390
are quite serious.

543
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,590
To put it bluntly,

544
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,880
I have no time to

545
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,790
put on a show with you.

546
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,300
-Hello, Ms. Yu.
-Hello, Ms. Yu.

547
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,770
Didn't I tell you?

548
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,470
Knock before entering.

549
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,500
I'll knock next time.

550
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,030
Wait,

551
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:52,800
shouldn't you

552
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,870
be at the class now?

553
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,730
Don't mention that.

554
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,750
All I got was

555
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,650
a verbal bashing.

556
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,830
Wait.

557
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,360
Did you do it on purpose?

558
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,030
What did I do?

559
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,630
Do you know

560
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,110
who the teacher you found for me was?

561
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,170
It's the female cop

562
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,920
who interrogated me here.

563
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,380
Really? What a coincidence.

564
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,630
I really didn't know.

565
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,300
So,

566
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:21,990
you might as well

567
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,110
just listen to me

568
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,630
and shoot those two idol dramas.

569
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,610
No way.

570
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:26,670
Listen.

571
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,970
I must get that role.

572
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,350
I'll do everything

573
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,590
to make her teach me.

574
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,100
[Crayfish]

575
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,350
I'm here. Where are you?

576
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,340
Jiang Chengyi?

577
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,880
Why are you here?

578
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,870
What a coincidence.

579
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,940
Want some food?

580
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,420
I want to ask you something.

581
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,520
Do you know Wang Qiang?

582
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:28,970
Who?

583
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,900
I... I don't think I know him.

584
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,010
I’m just here for dinner.

585
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,460
Liu Yujie.

586
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,540
Don't take any chances.

587
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,980
Since we're here,

588
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,250
it means we have enough

589
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,140
evidence.

590
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,810
You’d better tell the truth.

591
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,000
Wang Qiang?

592
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,490
I remember now.

593
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,080
He was a classmate...

594
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,880
in middle school.

595
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,800
But he dropped out early.

596
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,660
Since I went to university,

597
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,060
we haven't been in touch.

598
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,940
We've arrested Wang Qiang.

599
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,660
It’s a huge case.

600
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,590
He said he's been in touch with you.

601
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,850
What's that about?

602
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,630
I-I... I don't know.

603
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,760
I didn't do it.

604
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,720
I really don't know anything!

605
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,510
Ding Jing

606
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,590
asked me to contact him.

607
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,410
Ding Jing?

608
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,060
Why did Ding Jing ask you

609
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,800
to contact him?

610
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,250
I... I-I don't know.

611
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,740
Want to talk at the station?

612
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,550
No.

613
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,060
Well,

614
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,730
Wang Qiang and I were classmates.

615
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,580
After he got out of jail,

616
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,050
I-I just...

617
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,580
found a few jobs for him,

618
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,890
but they never lasted.

619
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,810
So I complained

620
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,100
to Jing about this.

621
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,040
Then Jing asked me

622
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,230
to contact him

623
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,410
to ask him for a favor.

624
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,160
Ding Jing asked Wang Qiang for a favor?

625
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
What favor?

626
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,040
I really

627
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,230
wasn't aware.

628
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,730
But one time,

629
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,280
when Ding Jing got drunk,

630
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,620
she told me

631
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,210
she...

632
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,150
asked Wang Qiang

633
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,590
to secretly take photos of Lu Yan.

634
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,390
She wants to destroy Lu Yan.

635
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,420
So Ding Jing wants to destroy Lu Yan,

636
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,760
and you helped her find Wang Qiang

637
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,870
to secretly take photos of Lu Yan,

638
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,470
right?

639
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,350
No.

640
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,880
I really don't know anything!

641
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,390
If I knew it was illegal,

642
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,000
how could I've helped her?

643
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,920
Who can prove

644
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,630
your innocence?

645
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,680
Then...

646
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,950
I’ll show you all

650

00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,630

656
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,990
Wang Qiang's been arrested.

658
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,250
want to help us

659
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,160

660
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,240
Yes.

661
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,320
I'll cooperate fully.

662
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,820

tell you what to do later.

664

Okay.

One more thing.

666
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,420
Did Ding Jing hire someone to disguise

667
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,050
as Deng Man?

668
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,670
I don't know.

669
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,290
Ding Jing never mentioned that.

670
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,700
Okay.

671
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,840

No, not yet.

Go ahead without me.

778
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,170
Okay, then.

00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,260

00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,790

all the way here just to send me an invitation.

785
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,460
What if I say I did?

786
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,080
I'm just kidding.

787
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,920
I read a script recently.

788
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,460
The male lead said this.

789
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,560

00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,410

to have dinner with Dr. Han.

794
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,040
I'm getting help from his manpower,

Go along then.

your script is done,

799
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,910
you can show it to me.

800
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,570
Okay.

just texted him.

00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,830
that far.

881
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,909

This is called going back to the basics.

886
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
Has Wang Qiang fessed up?

887
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,199
He's still insisting

888
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,159
he's acting

890
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,440
And the other?

891
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,610
I just questioned Qin Yue.

892
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,350
He said Ding Jing

hasn't called Liu Yujie.

894
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,350
Okay.

895
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,030
Keep an eye on it.

896
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:49,590
Yes.

897
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,280
Okay.

919
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,030
All right.

920
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,550
Our families are all seated.

921
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,700

922
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,550
dig in.

923

From now on,

-Eat more.

00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,150
Yeah, I’ll do it myself.

939
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,550
Try it.

940
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,830
I ordered all your favorite dishes.

00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,260
Mom, eat more.

00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,700
I know you like it.

945

948
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,120
I'd like to

949
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,150
invite you two to guide me.

950
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,560
That is youngsters' stuff.

951
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,720
We're too old.

952
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,040
We won't get involved.

953
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,350
We can't understand it anyway.

954
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,470
Who said you're old?

955
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,760
Ask a stranger.

956
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,090
If I didn't know you,

957
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,910
I'd assume you were around...

959
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,220
Look at her.

960
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,210
Such a sweet talker.

961
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,160
Your invitation.

962
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:06,940
Here, here.

963
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,320
That made you really happy, huh?

964
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,080
Auntie.

965
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,920
You must come.

966
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,390
Thank you.

967
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,190
I'll be there.

968
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,980

00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,390
Stop playing tricks.

1161
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,840
What do you know?

1162
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,120
If you really know,

1163
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,230
just call the police.

1164
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,870
Why're you following me?

1165
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,150
I have evidence.

1166
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,840
I’ll ask Jiang Chengyi

1167
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,960
to see if these can prove

1168
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,000
you killed Deng Man.

1169
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,870
Don't talk nonsense

1170
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:10,960
to Jiang Chengyi!

1171
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,040
Lu Yan, stop!

1172
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,030
Evidence?

1173
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,290
Evidence?

1174
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,080
I asked you to get the evidence...

1175
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:21,280
Evidence, right?

1176
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,880
Evidence! Evidence!

1177
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,630
You want evidence, right?

1178
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:27,720
Stop looking.

1179
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,470
Don't waste time.

1180
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,830
I'll just tell you.

1181
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,170
I bullied her.

1182
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:33,300
What's wrong?

1183
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,540
She washed my clothes

1184
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,110
and shoes

1185
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,230
and even knelt down to me!

1186
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,000
That's because she's timid,

1187
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:38,700
useless,

1188
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,590
and weak!

1189
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:40,640
It's not my fault.

1190
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,070
I'll ask you one last time.

1191
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,440
Did you

1192
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,780
force Deng Man to her death?

1193
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,700
Let me tell you one last time too.

1194
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,050
Her death has nothing to do with me.

1195
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,870
She asked for it.

1196
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:04,910
Lu Yan.

1197
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:06,560
Have you ever

1198
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,050
considered that you're a jinx?

1199
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,030
Why does everyone

1200
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,750
around you have a tragic ending?

1201
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,340
I think

1202
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,230
if it were up to me,

1203
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,330
your death would solve everything.

1204
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,770
Wen.

1205
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,820
About the art mixer,

1206
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,310
I'm going.

1207
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:04,940
[Professor Yu]

1208
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,500
What’s wrong, Captain Jiang?

1209
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,290
Professor Yu.

1210
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,820
Are you free tomorrow?

1211
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,090
I need to talk to you.

1212
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,230
Okay, see you tomorrow.
