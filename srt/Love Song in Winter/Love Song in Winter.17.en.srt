00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,200
Come on, get up.

7
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,670
Are you okay?

8
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,100
What's wrong?

9
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,510
It's Ding Jing.

10
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,700
What?

11
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,430
It's Ding Jing.

12
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,530
Okay.

13
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,910
Are you hurt anywhere?

14
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,380
I-I twisted my ankle.

15
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,600
I'll take you out first.

16
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,670

Are your hands cold?

21
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,740
I'm fine.

22
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,790
I'm still scared.

23
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,529
You know...

24
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,580
If I'd been a bit later...

25
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,820
Sorry.

26
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,560
Thank you…

27
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,770
for protecting me.

28
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,020
Hello?

29
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,040
Captain Jiang.

30
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,510
I checked the surveillance.

31
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,360
It was someone

32
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,630
in a dark gray hoodie

33
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,630
who pushed Dr. Lu.

34
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,890
But their face wasn't clear.

35
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,630
Lu Yan said

36
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,800
she saw the face.

37
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,750
It should be Ding Jing.

38
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,400
Look into Ding Jing.

39
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,590
Got it.

40
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:01,650
Alright.

41
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,030
Ding Jing...

42

43
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,510
But I think

44
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,310
she might still try something.

45
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,550
So,

46
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,330
you need to be careful these days.

47
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,890
At night,

48
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,010
make sure to close all the doors and windows.

49
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,710
If you're going to work,

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,540
try to stick to a fixed route.

51
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,090
Avoid places with few people.

52
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,690
It's dangerous.

53
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,230
Or maybe…

54
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:38,890
Never mind.

55
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,620
I'll stay here with you.

sleep outside.

58
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
This way, I can be less worried.

59
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,990
That's really unnecessary.

60
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,730
You live right next door, don't you?

61
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,680
If something happens,

62
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,030
I'll just call out for you.

68
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,500
Not checking up.

69
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,960
Maybe it's just a call.

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,960
can we talk about something?

74
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,010
can you let me know first?

75

Even Dalu wasn't there.

I was left all alone.

Don't complain.

79
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,440
I only asked him to help out.

80
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,490
With what?

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,370
None of your business.

It's women's stuff.

83

You took my employees away,

84

and I'm the one paying their salaries.

85
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,490
Of course it's my business.

86

What's yours is mine,

90
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,610
and what's mine is still mine.

197
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,230
and stopped following me.

198
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,090
Maybe I'm just overthinking.

199
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,850
Never mind.

200
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,340
Still, since you feel that way,

201
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,160
it's better to stay cautious

202
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,230
to be on the safe side.

203
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,570
How about this?

204
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,150
Don't go running today.

205
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,520
I'll teach you some

206
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,500
self-defense moves instead.

207
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,220
Grab like this.

208
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,310
Hold him directly,

209
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,510
pull his arm,

210
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,110
and push him down.

211
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,830
If you can't pin him down,

212
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,320
and he's really strong

213
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,070
and gets up,

214
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,220
pull his arm away,

215
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,530
and lock his neck.

216
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,160
Got it?

217
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,560
You feel it?

218
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,110
Yeah.

219
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,990
Really?

220
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,210
Ouch, ouch!

221
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,490
Push his hand down,

222
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,250
press it,

223
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,850
then circle around,

224
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,710
and lock his neck from behind.

225
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,500
Then slowly,

226
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,190
tighten your arm.

227
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,850
You feel it?

228
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,550
Give it a try.

229
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,240
Just like that.

230
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,140
If he holds you,

231
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,180
what do you do?

232
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,470
What do you do?

233
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,330
What... what do I do?

234
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,580
Step out with your foot.

235
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,590
If someone grabs you from behind,

236
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,470
first, shift your body

237
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,720
to create some space.

238
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,400
Then grab his legs and toss him away.

239
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,910
Use both hands to grab my legs

240
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,560
and toss me away.

241
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,560
Hold my legs and toss me!

242
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,240
Toss, toss, toss!

243

Got it?

244
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,610
Yeah,

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,550
I got it.

Really?

If you don't, I can't hold on any longer.

that I can't move anymore.

Don't move. I'll help you.

Yeah.

all this?

since I was little.

Not at all.

Yu Bofeng.

392
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,520
Yes, Yu Bofeng.

Yu Bofeng?

394
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,210
Captain Jiang,

00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,070
you really don't see me

396
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,790
as an outsider, huh?

397
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,850
Yes,

398
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,290
he did come to me earlier,

399
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,730
saying he wanted to attend my class,

400
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,600
but I've already

401
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,910
turned him down.

402
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,370
Alright, alright.

403
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,420
I'll give it a try.

Hello, Professor Yu,

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,320
you finally picked up my call.

442
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,130
Come to the teaching building

444

in 20 minutes?

451
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,320
Are you kidding? 20 minutes?

452
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,940
It's not far,

453
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,950
about five kilometers or so.

454
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,990
But if you go now,

455
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,110
you'll be stuck in traffic for at least an hour.

I have to get there first.

How dare she push you?

00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,860

514
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,110
After coming to Ninghai,

515
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,430
you got signed by an agency.

516
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,750
Not bad.

517
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,230
You're luckier

518
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,310
than most artists.

519
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:37,820
I do

520
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,710
consider myself lucky.

521
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,310
I've never

522
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,360
formally studied acting.

523
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,990
I just happened to gain some attention.

524
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,580
But if I keep filming like this,

525
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,990
I'll eventually be eliminated.

526
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:48,870
So, I want to

527
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,830
become a good actor.

528
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,410
To become a good actor,

529
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,310
you should go to an acting coach.

530
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,050
At most, I can only teach you

531
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,890
basic theoretical knowledge.

532
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,290
Will that help with

533
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,450
your acting?

534
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,240
The thing is, I've recently

535
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,430
got an audition opportunity.

536
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,220
I'll audition for

537
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,540
a psychopathic serial killer.

538
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,230
I really love that role.

539
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,030
Besides, yesterday, I ended collaboration

540
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,150
with a new brand on my own.

541
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,700
If I don't land this role,

542
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,700
my agency

543
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,110
won't let me off the hook easily.

544
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,160
So I need your help,

545
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,850
Professor.

546
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,110
Ending collaboration on your own?

547
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,370
You've got quite the temper.

548
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,840
What brand?

549
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,750
They just let you off?

550
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:26,870

00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,110

Its owner keeps calling me,

553
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,180
but I'm not answering.

554
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,110
I think

555
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,190
her character is questionable.

556
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,740
I don't want to work with her.

557
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,060
You're pretty straightforward.

558
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:42,640
So,

559
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,750
Professor Yu, when can you

560
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,540
start teaching me?

561
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,070
This course

562
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,040
might be a bit different

563
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,270
from what you expect.

564
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,470
Here's the presentation of my lesson plan.

565
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,370

566
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,710
After you're done, write me

567
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,150
a five-thousand-word reflection on it.

568
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,000
Handwritten.

569
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:08,390
Any problem?

570
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,290
No problem.

571
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:06,670
Feeling better?

572
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,460
Does it still hurt that much?

573
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,150
Much better.

574
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,160
Careful.

575
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,100
Why are you staying at my place?

576
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,210
Don't get me wrong.

577
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,530
I'm just worried you're hungry,

578
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,650
so I'll cook for you.

579
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,320

777
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,370
We visited all the small inns

778
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,350
around Jifu Village.

779
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,400
In the village,

780
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,970
we went door to door searching as well.

781
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,940
No sign of her.

782
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,220
What about nearby transport hubs?

783
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,580
Long-distance buses or anything like that?

784
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,560
I've asked

785
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,820
the local drivers

786
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,600
and ticket sellers.

787
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,390
None of them have seen Ding Jing.

788
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,110
The area around Jifu Village

789
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,430
is mostly farmland.

790
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,160
The few roads there

791
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,020
don't have surveillance cameras.

792
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,870
It's really hard to track her.

793
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,310
Judging from the map,

794
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,830
the transportation around Jifu Village

795
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,150
isn't very developed.

796
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,650
She shouldn't have gotten very far.

797
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,270
Send a few more people,

798
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,870
expand the search area,

799
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,010
and search again.

800
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,500
I don't believe she could have gotten away.

Let's go.

804
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,080
This one…

805
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,370
I haven't seen her before.

806
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,860
This one looks familiar,

807
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,340
but I forgot which day it was.

808
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,540
She booked a room

809
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,230
but left

810
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,020
without checking in.

811
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,070
No records about her.

812
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,720
Nothing at all?

813
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,230
Nothing.

814
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,230
Alright.

815
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,290
Copy all the surveillance footage

816
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,630
and take it back.

817
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,880
See if there are any useful clues.

818
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:15,960
Okay.

823
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,510
we skip the registration process.

824

826
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,290
Either she felt this place wasn't safe,

827
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,670
or she wanted to leave some clues

828
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,870
to deliberately mislead us.

829
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:42,080
Here's the plan:

830
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,340
have the team put in a bit more effort,

831
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,830
expand the search area,

832
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,470
and cover the entire outskirts.

833
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,680
