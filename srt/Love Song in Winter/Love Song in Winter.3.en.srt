[Episode 3]

3
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,289
[Thank you for witnessing our wedding.]

4
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,810
Not bad, Dalu.

5
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,170
VP of a company?

6
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,360
Don't mess with me.

7
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,430
What VP?

8
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,020
I'm just Zhong's minion.

9
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,920
Who said that?

10
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,270
Under Dalu's leadership,

11
00:01:59,289 --> 00:01:59,910
our company

12
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,070
has been flourishing.

13
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,760
Come visit

14
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,270
when you have time.

15
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,190
Come on!

16
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,480
Welcome to my wedding!

17
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,120
Come on!

18
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,600
Here.

19
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,360
Happy wedding!

20
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,639
Um, sorry,

21
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,270
this seat's taken.

22
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,030
Oh, it's taken?

23
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,580
Yes.

24
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,650
I'm so sorry.

25
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,880
You should see how

26
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,800
Ding Jing's acting,

27
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,360
like she's going to devour Jiang Chengyi.

28
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,470
Don't you care?

29
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,400
Let her.

30
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,570
What does it have to do with me?

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,840
Look at you.

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,370
There's a seat there. Go there.

33
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,870
Okay.

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,060
Chengyi.

35
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,579
Can I sit here?

36
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,260
Lu Yan.

37
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,150
Sit here.

38
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,640
What are you waiting for?

39
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,400
-Sit.
-Sit.

40
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:54,950
Sure.

41
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,350
I'll sit with those from my department.

42
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,470
Honey.

43
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,230
Long time no see.

44
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:03,950
How've you been?

45
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,040
I've been good.

46
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,060
What about you?

47
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,470
Want some chocolate?

48
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,910
Thank you.

49
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,640
Wen is such a nice senior.

50
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,940
He specially kept one for Lu Yan.

51
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,620
Wen has always been nice.

52
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,530
He's nice to everyone,

53
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:20,980
right?

54
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,560
Considerate and caring.

55
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,540
Why do you only have water?

56
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,140
I can't drink.

57
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,190
That's too bad.

58
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,650
I wanted to drink with you.

59
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,120
Come on!

60
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,460
-Thank you! Come on!
-Come on!

61
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,250
Happy wedding!

62
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,470
-Have a baby soon!
-Thank you.

63
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:36,930
Thank you.

64
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,050
I like what I'm hearing.

65
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,520
You guys hurry too.

66
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,560
Fight for it.

67
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,820
Wen.

68
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,400
You are

69
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,530
running a talent agency.

70
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,550
Are all your artists

71
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,260
stunning beauties?

72
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:46,880
Yeah.

73
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,950
Maybe it's a force of habit

74
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,050
from when I was a doctor,

75
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,410
but everyone looks the same to me.

76
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,130
No way.

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,450
Then don't you

78
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,650
have anyone you like?

79
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,210
Have you never been in a relationship?

80
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,610
Not yet.

81
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,020
I'll let you know

82
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,930
if I'm dating anyone.

83
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,940
So mysterious.

84
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,730
I see. I see.

85
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,090
Is the food okay?

86
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:09,980
It's good.

87
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,470
Very good.

88
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,800
It's not cheap.

89
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,020
I know, I know.

90
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,930
We'll make a toast at that table.

91
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,430
Go ahead and eat.

92
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,920
Okay.

93
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,050
Come on!

94
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,110
Thank you so much for today.

95
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,050
Happy wedding.

96
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,680
Thank you!

97
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,269
Always be happy!

98
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:20,630
Thank you!

99
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,790
Thank you, guys!

100
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,080
Do you know

101
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,980
a celebrity called

102
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,990
Yu...

103
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,610
Bo...

104
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,570
-Yu Bofeng?
-Feng?

105
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,350
Yes, yes.

106
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,530
It's hard to pronounce.

107
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,930
He's under our agency.

108
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,100
He is?

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,730
Let me show you his photos.

110
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,770
It's not that I like him.

111
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,970
It's...

112
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,150
I have a friend,

113
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,770
a close friend,

114
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,650
who's a huge fan.

115
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,100
She wants a, what's that called,

116
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,450
an autographed...

117
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,560
an autographed photo?

118
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,210
With your friend's name on it?

119
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,120
Yes, yes.

120
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,710
No problem!

121
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,430
With her name on it.

122
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,909
Let me show you his photos.

123
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,020
Yes, that's him.

124
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,260
This is from a recent photoshoot.

125
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,760
Do you prefer any?

126
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,300
I'll get him to autograph it

127
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,200
with your friend's name.

128
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,250
Let me see.

129
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,010
Why do I feel like

130
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:01,950
you've changed

131
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,090
in the past two years?

132
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,170
I haven't.

133
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,250
Maybe it's because

134
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,010
you're working for

135
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,260
the government now?

136
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,310
You're different from your uni days.

137
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,790
You...

138
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,410
want to drink?

139
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,060
Didn't you say you can't drink?

140
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,780
Dalu!

141
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,650
Have a drink with Ding Jing.

142
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,550
I can't drink.

143
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,380
No, wait,

144
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,820
I don't have to drink.

145
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,550
Princess Ding.

146
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,240
He doesn't drink.

147
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,020
The whole basketball team's here.

148
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,470
We'll drink with you.

149
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,740
Excel in your career?

150
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,830
Can he write that much?

151
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,370
Of course!

152
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,710
How about we get her

153
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,550
a bigger photo?

154
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,440
Sure, sure.

155
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,430
Thank you.

156
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,790
Give me my glass.

157
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,710
Have a drink.

158
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,830
I'll text you her name.

159
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,400
After

160
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,570
he's autographed it,

161
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,370
I'll send it to you.

162
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,210
That's great!

163
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,860
She is...

164
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,550
Her name is Wang Qianqian.

165
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,430
She loves him

166
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,300
so much.

167
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,050
What are you looking at?

168
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,990
Nothing, just spacing out.

169
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,230
Ex-girlfriend?

170
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,070
Rekindled love?

171
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,540
Cut it out.

172
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,820
It was so long ago.

173
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,560
Long forgotten.

174
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,930
Do you remember that basketball game in uni?

175
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,660
Which game?

176
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,230
The one where you vomited?

177
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,230
Can you not embarrass me like that?

178
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,160
When our School of Engineering

179
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,740
played against their School of Medicine.

180
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,110
I remember.

181
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,070
Do you want to watch it?

182
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,970
I still have the video.

183
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,670
You still have it?

184
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,990
Of course I want to want it.

185
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,340
I was so cool in that game.

186
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:32,909
Wait, no.

187
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,280
Zhong was the coolest.

188
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,270
Oh, come on.

189
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,900
Who's cooler than Jiang Chengyi?

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,720
Honey.

191
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,740
Of course,

192
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,090
my hubby's up there too.

193
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,860
Give me the remote control.

194
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,190
I'll play it now.

195
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,480
[May 13, 1998
7:40 p.m.]

Look at that guy. He's so funny.

401
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,580
♫My dear stranger♫

402
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,870
W-What are you looking at?

403
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,380
Nothing.

404
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,890
Are you sure?

405
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,310
Nothing, really.

406
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,690
I saw everything.

407
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,690
Deng Man.

408
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,660
Do you see me as a friend?

409
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,820
I like Jiang Chengyi.

410
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,740
Yan!

411
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,460
Can you

412
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,430
give me a chance?

413
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,590
If you really like him that much,

414
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,300
tell him yourself.

415
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,110
I won't break up with him.

416
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,540
Have you seen Man?

417
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,220
No.

418
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,180
She's not answering my calls.

419
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,450
I'll try calling her.

420
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,410
Sorry.

421
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,990
The subscriber's phone is switched off.

422
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,710
Switched off?

423

Please try again later.

Hello, is this Lu Yan?

00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:22,880
Yes.

427
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,900
Is Deng Man from your dorm?

428
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,830
Yes.

434
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,490
Why do you want to break up?

435
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,190
Say something.

436
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,380
We are...

437
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,200
not a good match.

438
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,590
Not a good match?

439
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,550
I clearly deleted it.

440
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,230
She did.

441
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,830
How is it?

442
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,740
I just asked the hotel manager.

443
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,050
They said there were too many guests

444
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,530
and they didn't notice anyone suspicious.

445
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,290
What happened then?

446
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,080
I saw Zhen delete it

447
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,140
with my own two eyes.

448
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,010
How did it show up?

449
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,590
I deleted it as soon as you told me to.

450
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,940
Honey, don't worry.

451
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,110
Maybe Zhen was too busy

452
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:06,970
and didn't delete it properly.

453
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,730
It's all my fault.

454
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,670
I hope Lu Yan

455
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,560
is okay.

456
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,350
No,

457
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:13,870
it's my fault.

458
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,070
I should've

459
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,250
checked one last time.

460
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,250
What a way to ruin

461
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,030
our wedding.

462
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,320
Let's get married again.

463
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,160
Forget it.

464
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,810
It's okay.

465
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,600
Guys, go home.

466
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,560
You've been busy all day.

467
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,470
You guys should go back too.

468
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,240
Thank you for today.

469
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,640
We'll be off then.

470
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,950
See you, Sister-in-law.

471
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:31,670
See you, Sister-in-law.

472
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,510
Thank you.

473
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,320
Thank you.

474
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:52,780
Jiang.

475
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,520
Zhong.

476
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,610
Did you find out who did it?

477
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,480
Dalu asked the manager on duty.

478
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,970
There were too many guests today.

479
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:59,920
Even I can't remember

480
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:00,920
everyone who came.

481
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:01,850
Okay.

482
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,870
Leave my number

483
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,230
with the manager.

484
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,280
Get him to call me if he remembers anything.

485
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,300
Okay.

486
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,490
Tang Jie.

487
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,610
Please spend more time with Lu Yan

488
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,700
for the time being.

489
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,390
I'm worried about her.

490
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,270
Don't worry.

491
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,790
I know what to do.

492
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,490
Let me apologize to you two.

493
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,220
I'm really sorry about today.

494
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,590
I'll stay all the way the next time.

495
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,330
Okay, come next time.

497
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,850
I'm hanging up.

498
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,530
With whom next time?

499
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,920
Next time...

500
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,070
His surname's Zhong too.

501
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,630
Don't overthink it.

502
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,890
Let's go home and rest.

503
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,640
You must be exhausted.

00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,980
Jing!

505
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,460
Why did you

506
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,680
drink so much today?

507
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,980
Here, have some water.

508
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,970
Why did

509
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,270
Deng Man's photo

510
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,790
appear suddenly?

You...

514
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,430
Wait a minute.

515
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,740
Get me some tissues.

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,020

Was that Wen?

523
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,840
I heard

524
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,600
that he runs

525
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,180
a talent agency now.

526
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,210

00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,800
You finally answered.

531
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,430
What's wrong?

532
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,070
Get to the hospital now.

533

00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,430
What's wrong?

00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,950

-No, no.
-Why are you covered in sweat?

call you here late at night again?

00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,750
Stop typing.

Let's eat. Let's go.

578
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,270
No need. I'm not hungry.

579

What do you mean? Hurry.

Can I speak to you for a minute?

590
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,220
Is it about a patient?

591
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,350
Yes.

592
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,380
Well,

You two can go together.

Aren't we eating together?

597

I can't go with you.

What happened...

to your hand?

The alley in my neighborhood

608

was too dark.

609
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,270
I bumped into someone

610

and got scratched.

611

I'm fine.
