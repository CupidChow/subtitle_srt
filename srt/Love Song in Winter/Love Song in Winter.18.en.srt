[Ninghai Anshan People's Hospital]

4
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:56,729
Does it hurt?

5
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,710
No.

6
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,790
Wen.

7
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,070
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,460
I scared you.

9
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,570
When I was six,

10
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,680
my mom left my dad.

11
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,510
My dad's... very stubborn.

12
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,320
He is

13
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,980
very extreme.

14
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,579
Since

15
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,520
I was a kid, my mom and I

16
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,190
lived in misery.

17
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:36,770
If my mom added

18
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,230
too much salt in the food,

19
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,300
or if I woke up one minute late,

20
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:41,430
or even

21
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,310
if I just put the cup

22
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,340
on the table too hard,

23
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,260
he would...

24
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,950
insult me harshly

25
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,990
and slap me.

26
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,270
When that man said

27
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,950
he could abuse

28
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,590
his child as he wished,

29
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,470
it really triggered me.

30
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,040
Because that was

31
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,190
how I spent my childhood.

32
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:30,910
What are you doing?

33
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,660
Where did you get the money?

34
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,070
Where did you steal it from?

35
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,030
I'm asking you!

36
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,030
Where did you steal it from?

37
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,390
I didn't steal it.

38
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,270
Then how did you get it?

39
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,310
I saved it.

40
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,460
You saved it?

41
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,560
Why did you save so much money?

42
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,560
Tell me.

43
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,740
Come here.

44
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,720
Who said you can go?

45
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,270
Are you going to buy tickets

46
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,340
to look for your mom?

47
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,400
Come here.

48
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,490
You're just like your mom!

49
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,460
Ungrateful.

50
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,040
So later,

51
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,290
my mom left.

52
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,580
I didn't blame her.

53
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,600
But

54
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,110
my dad was even harsher to me.

55
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,480
He said

56
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,790
I was the way I am

57
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,830
because my mom spoiled me.

58
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,290
Now that

59
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,340
no one's protecting me,

60
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,990
of course he became worse.

61
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,230
What happened after?

62
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,070
Have you

63
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,230
seen your mom after that?

64
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,150
Yes.

65
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,350
One time, I couldn't take it anymore.

66
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,120
I took all my pocket money

67
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,870
to find her.

68
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,470
But near her home,

69
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,140
I saw her

70
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,320
bringing

71
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,980
a boy about my age home.

72
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,250
Just in time.

73
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,510
Granny can persuade my dad.

74
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,260
Are you that eager to go to the police academy?

75
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,910
That boy

76
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,610
is the child of her current husband.

77
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,350
They were carrying the same bag,

78
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,230
talking and laughing.

79
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,680
When they

80
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,850
were about to go upstairs,

81
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,990
my mom suddenly turned around

82
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,950
and saw me.

83
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,909
I was so happy, I...

84
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,000
I wanted to rush up

85
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,940
to let her hug me.

86
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:54,530
But...

87
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,030
she didn't recognize me.

88
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,870
Her eyes...

89
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,720
just slipped past me,

90
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,330
not even stopping for a second.

91
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,750
Wen.

92
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,430
I'm fine. I...

93
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:41,470
I'm fine.

94
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,270
It was

95
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,210
a long time ago.

96
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,120
It's been a while since I thought about it.

97
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,580
If...

98
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,110
you need any help,

99
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,659
you can look for me.

100
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:57,990
Okay.

101
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,500
Wen.

102
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,670
The police needs you for mediation

103
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,640
in the meeting room.

104
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,370
Yan.

105
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,830
You're a witness, so you must go too.

106
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,750
I'll go with you.

107
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,390
Let's go.

108
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,220
It's all clear now.

109
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,760
First,

110
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,060
you hurt your child.

111
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,330
You were angry

112
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,050
and hit him first.

113
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,930
Then you also hurt him.

114
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,020
He beat me

115
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,030
senseless.

116
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,020
I don't know.

117
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,740
I just took something by me.

118
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,610
Besides, officer,

119
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,250
this is also a kind

120
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,810
of self-defense, no?

121
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,480
According to

122
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,260
the child protection law,

123
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,760
when the legal rights

124
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,830
of a minor is violated,

125
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,830
any organization or individual

126
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,030
has the right to intervene

127
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,880
or file a report

128
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,300
to the relevant agencies.

129
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,890
Mr. Wen's behavior

130
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,060
was indeed overboard.

131
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,790
But Mr. Lin,

132
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,720
you're also responsible.

133
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,750
Responsible?

134
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,990
For what?

135
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:55,710
I spent a fortune

136
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,370
for his operation,

137
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,450
but he wouldn't listen!

138
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,260
Also, who doesn't beat their kids?

139
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,240
What's wrong with me beating

140
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,720
my own kid?

141
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,350
Enough!

142
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,200
Domestic violence is illegal.

143
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,630
Let me tell you.

144
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,910
Behave or there's no more negotiation.

145
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,260
I'll pay for the child's operation.

146
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,660
I'll take care of the post-op medication

147
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,860
and treatment too.

148
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,950
Also,

149
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,830
I'm warning you.

150
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,050
If you hit your son again,

151
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,510
I will make you pay.

152
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,160
What do you mean?

153
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:27,940
Is that a threat?

154
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,230
You don't deserve

155
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,780
to be a father.

156
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,390
Mr. Wen.

157
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,830
Look.

158
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,679
The kid is waiting for the operation.

159
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,049
Why don't we talk it out

160
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,130
and settle?

161
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,190
Is something on your mind?

162
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,870
No.

163
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,580
Something happened in the hospital today.

164
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,340
Wen Peng got into a fight

165
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,870
with a patient's family.

166
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,170
Why?

167
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,350
The patient is a little boy.

168
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,280
And

169
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,450
the boy's dad beat him.

170
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,790
When I was

171
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,260
trying to stop him,

172
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,850
Wen Peng rushed over

173
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,720
and they started fighting.

174
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,950
Wen even got injured.

175
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,280
He isn't usually so rash.

176
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,070
I only found out later

177
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,260
that it's because

178
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,110
his dad beat him up as a kid,

179
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,820
and his mom didn't protect him.

180
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,960
He may be traumatized

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,790
in this aspect.

182
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,080
When he saw that,

183
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,900
he was reminded of his childhood.

184
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,030
He was always beaten up as a kid?

185
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,550
Poor thing.

186
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,080
I didn't expect his background

187
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,910
to be like this.

188
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,250
Does your heart ache?

189
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,830
What heartache?

190
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,530
I'm just sympathizing with him.

191
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,000
What about you?

192
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,920
Have you found Ding Jing?

193
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,990
Not yet.

194
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,170
It's okay.

195
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,720
Take your time.

196
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,230
You will find her.

197
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,020
If I can't catch her,

198
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,950
I can't let it go.

199
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,690
Anyway, I’m quite relieved now.

200
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,500
With Captain Jiang's protection,

201
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,560
I'm the safest person

202
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,680
in the world.

203
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,040
You're glib.

204
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,390
It's safe. I'll protect you.

205
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,330
Never be scared.

206
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,150
Bye.

207
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,440
I'll see you off.

208
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,190
Just two steps?

209
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,620
I'm here.

210
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,880
Go inside and warm yourself up.

211
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,790
My place is too cold.

212
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,890
There's no heater.

213
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,570
What place did you rent?

214
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,030
How's there no heater?

215
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,550
Yeah.

216
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,460
It's shabby and cold.

217
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,340
It's miserable.

218
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,910
I'll go take a look.

219
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,910
What... What's there to see?

220
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,830
I'll see how

221
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,930
shabby and cold it is.

222
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,560
You...

223
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,200
How can you live like that?

224
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,980
I just sleep here.

225
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,660
Is there a water heater?

226
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,680
It isn't installed yet.

227
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,570
Then how do you shower?

228
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,120
I just... use cold water.

229
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,550
Showering

230
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,790
with cold water in winter?

231
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,000
What about your leg?

232
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,190
Aren't you injured?

233
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,100
How did you know?

234
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,990
You've been spying on me,

235
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,650
huh?

236
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,600
No.

237
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,900
I...

238
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,220
I'm a doctor.

239
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,420
I can tell...

240
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,820
just by looking.

241
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,410
You can see it through my pants?

242
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,550
So you've been looking.

243
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,390
Go, go, go.

244
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,580
Already? Want to sit for a while?

245
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,230
Sit?

246
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,020
Sit where?

247
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,450
I'll take you to buy stuff.

248
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:44,920
Let's go.

249
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,450
Take me to buy stuff?

250
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,030
9.9 yuan for two.

251
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,910
What's the use of this bowl?

252
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,010
This bowl's for...

253
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,970
for soup.

254
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,400
These are

255
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,130
forks and spoons.

256
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,470
Buy this gray one.

257
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,520
This one.

258
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,440
I'll buy you a set.

259
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,340
Do I need so many?

260
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,790
It's a set.

261
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,210
How can you eat instant noodles every day?

262
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,980
I'll buy one more set.

263
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,770
Will you entertain the guests?

264
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,190
Yes, you.

265
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,100
I'm not going to your house.

266
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,200
I think

267
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,460
this is enough.

268
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,760
The tableware's enough.

269
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,870
Jiang Chengyi.

270
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,680
Have you ever sat on

271
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,250
a beanbag?

272
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,290
It's really comfy.

273
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,910
Don't

274
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,550
doctors say not to sit on these

275
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,400
because it's bad for your spine?

276
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,760
It's okay sometimes.

277
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,390
Try it.

278
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,250
Right?

279
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,880
Then I'll buy one.

280
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,230
This...

281
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,160
How much is it?

282
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,770
[Price: 1,888 yuan]

283
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,000
1,888 yuan?

284
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,300
It's too expensive.

285
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,960
After I buy it,

286
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,610
I'll add a label for you:

287
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,170
"Only for Dr. Lu."

288
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,840
And

289
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,920
you can come use it whenever.

290
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,580
Then I'll...

291
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,710
invest in it.

292
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,520
Write down the product code later.

293
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:27,820
Let's go.

294
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,720
Let's go.

295
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,720
It's hard to get up.

296
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,320
Give me a hand.

297
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,610
Why are you here?

298
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,840
What do you think?

299
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,110
Are you getting up?

300
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,970
People are watching.

301
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,220
Get up now.

302
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,100
Give me another hand.

303
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,150
What?

304
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:55,790
Let's go.

305
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,670
Today,

306
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,990
I want to tell you

307
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,580
about one of the most

308
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,600
famous

309
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,390
and controversial experiments

310
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,120
in psychology,

311
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,170
the Stanford prison experiment.

312
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,230
The design experiment in this prison

313
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,390
is quite simple.

314
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,230
A basement was designed

315
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,200
into a prison.

316
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,990
They recruited

317
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,390
24 male college students,

318
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,030
who were randomly assigned

319
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:26,040
to the role of prisoner or prison guard.

320
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,650
Prison guards patrolled eight hours a day,

321
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,230
while prisoners were imprisoned

322
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,480
for 24 hours.

323
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,150
-Yu Bofeng's the most handsome!

-Yu Bofeng's the most handsome!
-Yu Bofeng's the most handsome!

329
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,550
Everything was normal

330
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,570
on the first day of the experiment.

331
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,530
From the next day,

332
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,590
the guards started to assault the prisoners,

333
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,080
[Stanford Prison Experiment]

334
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,070
and the prisoners started to show

335
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,270
abnormal emotional reactions.

336
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,410
In the next few days,

337
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,770
the assaults got

338
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,230
more violent and cruel.

339
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,010
What happened to the prisoners?

340
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,330
[Stanford Prison Experiment]

341
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,870
Their sense of self

342
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,950
started to wane with time.

343
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,120
Yu Bofeng!

344
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:08,950
So the whole experiment

345
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,100
headed towards chaos.

346
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,510
Yu Bofeng!

347
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,390
Yu Bofeng?

348
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,590
Yu Bofeng!

349
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,510
I'll give you five minutes

350
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,730
to deal with the situation outside.

351
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,890
Don't come back if you can't.

-Yu Bofeng's the most handsome!

360
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,100
Sorry, Professor Yu.

361
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,440
In the future,

362
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,860
I'll ask my management team

363
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,510
to guard the door.

364
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,630
Then no one can affect

365
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,230
the classes.

366
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,550
Management team?

367
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,720
Isn't it

368
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,710
chaotic enough with you alone?

369
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,440
Let me tell you.

370
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,400
This is the first

371
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,390
and the last time.

372
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,090
If you can't settle it,

373
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,210
don't come to class anymore.

374
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,430
Okay.

375
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,150
I got it, Professor Yu.

376
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,210
I promise.

377
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,220
Today, I talked about

378
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,640
the Stanford prison experiment.

379
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,780
Were you listening?

380
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,599
Of course.

381
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,150
I was focused throughout.

382
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,730
Then tell me

383
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,560
why kind college students

384
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,420
became assaulters?

385
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,510
That's because...

386
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,510
the amount of power

387
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,710
and environment

388
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,270
have a strong influence

389
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,589
on a person's behavior.

390
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,900
Don't recite the text.

391
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,369
Tell me how you feel.

392
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:28,760
This way,

393
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,330
it'll help you sculpt

394
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,490
your character.

395
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,490
Is it because those people

396
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,360
stayed in the basement

397
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,150
without the sun for long,

398
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,160
so they were...

399
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,100
in a bad mood?

400
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,060
Right?

401
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,850
Yes.

402
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,130
Really?

403
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,390
So sunbathing's useful?

404
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,790
Professor Yu, I got it.

405
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,500
Maybe it's not just because

406
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,430
of sunlight.

407
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,030
Maybe it's because of the space.

408
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,100
It's too narrow.

409
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,760
So the people inside

410
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,400
were

411
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,730
driven crazy.

412
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,460
It could also be the food.

413
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:15,920
What you eat—

414
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,750
Yu Bofeng.

415
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,710
I don't mean

416
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,010
to hurt you.

417
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,140
I think

418
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,100
hard work is important.

419
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,010
But the direction of your efforts

420
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,070
is more important.

421
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,270
To be honest,

422
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,510
I think you're suitable to be

423
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,790
an actor with a strong fanbase.

424
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,020
While you still have fans,

425
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,110
make more money.

426
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,520
Then find a good woman,

427
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,880
get married, and have kids.

428
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,980
Live a cozy life.

429
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,830
Isn't that great?

430
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,580
Right?

431
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,550
But Ms. Yu,

432
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,870
what you said

433
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,230
isn't the life I want.

434
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,040
I'm not a performance teacher,

435
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,000
but

436
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,110
I can responsibly

437
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,010
tell you...

438
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,200
that you can't act as

439
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,680
a serial killer.

440
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,350
Ms. Yu.

441
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,970
I know I'm not gifted.

442
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,870
I'm far from mastering that role.

443
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,440
But I believe

444
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,510
I can get what I want

445
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,050
through my efforts.

446
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,500
I won't give up no matter what.

447
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,530
It's not about giving up or not.

448
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,190
It's about a person's IQ,

449
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,160
mind,

450
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,430
logical thinking, understanding—

451
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,270
But I admire this attitude

452
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,030
of yours.

453
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,440
How about this, Yu Bofeng?

454
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,300
You've taken

455
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,950
quite a few

456
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,070
classes so far.

457
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,870
Go back and digest the content

458
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,870
and prepare for

459
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,930
your audition.

460
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,550
You should stop

461
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,950
taking my classes.

462
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,460
Good luck for your audition.

463
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,610
Thank you.

464
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,540
Thank you, Ms. Yu.

465
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,940
I've checked Yu Bofeng.

466
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,140
I don't think he's questionable.

467
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,220
Okay.

468
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,440
Jiang.

469
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,190
I found something.

470
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,910
What's wrong?

471
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,150
Hao and I

472
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,950
checked the surveillance footage

473
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,670
an hour before Ding Jing disappeared.

474
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,350
We found someone.

475
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,180
Take a look.

476
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,880
This?

477
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,110
At the beginning,

478
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,430
we invested all our energy

479
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,190
on the suspect, Ding Jing.

480
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,550
But Hao and I rewatched this

481
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,900
over the past two days.

482
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,900
We realized this person

483
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,160
has been following Lu Yan and Ding Jing.

484
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,580
The surveillance shows that

485
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,750
since Lu Yan entered the subway station,

486
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,610
they've been watching at the back.

487
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,270
After Ding Jing pushed Lu Yan into the subway track,

488
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,530
she fled quickly,

489
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,530
and this person went after Ding Jing

490
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,610
out of the station.

491
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,500
They're great at covering their tracks.

492
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,190
First...

493
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,030
through

494
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,030
another entrance,

495
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,020
they entered the alley

496
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,100
Ding Jing entered.

497
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,040
Then, they waited two hours after Ding Jing left

498
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,040
before they left.

499
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,870
We compared the surveillance footage.

500
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,460
I think this person's back

501
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,610
is quite similar to the murderer

502
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,630
of Wang Qianqian.

503
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,060
More importantly,

504
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,070
I found that this person's physique

is very similar to the one

507
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,580
who pretended to be Deng Man.

508
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,370
Indeed.

509
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,650
[Anshan Criminal Investigation]

510
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,100
Great timing.

511
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,600
Check her movements

512
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,700
to see if she went

513
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,790
to Jifu Village.

514
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,500
Okay.

515
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,780
Can you say something?

516
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,640
Why did you

517
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,510
kidnap me here?

518
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,580

520
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,360

00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,240

530
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,400
I'll pay you double.

538
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,880
Okay?

539
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,210
Fine.

00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,160
Fine.

No.

00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,060
Okay.

579
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,400
I come to see him

580
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,100
after I'm done with work.

581
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,460
Xiaoman's mom can also

582
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,270
get some rest.

583
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,130
By the way,

584
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,520
I heard his operation

585
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,320
was postponed to the day after tomorrow.

586
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,850
Yes.

587
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,850
After what happened yesterday,

588
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,680
all his pre-operation prep

589
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,390
and tests

590
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,470
have to be redone.

591
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,790
I'm going on a business trip then.

592
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:10,470
I'm worried...

593
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:10,990
Wen.

594
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:11,950
Don't worry.

595
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,950
I'm here.

596
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,280
I heard from Xiaoman's mom that

597
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,630
you paid for all the fees

598
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,110
for his post-op treatment

599
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,960
and follow-up checkups.

600
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,060
You've done a lot for him.

601
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,720
Compared to the pain he suffered,

602
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,040
this is nothing.

603
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,540
Actually,

604
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,390
you've helped him a lot too.

605
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,960
Logically,

606
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,960
you didn't have to

607
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,000
interfere yesterday.

608
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,110
What are you talking about?

609
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,570
As long as he's my patient,

610
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,590
it's my business.

611
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,240
But really,

612
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,190
I need to thank you

613
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,070
on behalf of Xiaoman.

614
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:43,880
It's no problem.

615
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,630
I'm actually helping myself too.

616
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,780
Are you free tonight?

617
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,970
Let's eat together.

618
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:55,600
Okay.

619
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,770
Lu Yan.

620
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,530
Are you busy?

621
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,150
Why are you here?

622
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,050
Well...

623
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,140
Yes.

624
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,060
I need to talk to you about something.

625
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,510
What is it?

626
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:08,890
Are you free?

627
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,170
I...

628
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,500
Yes.

629
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,950
Go ahead.

630
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,930
I can spend more time with Xiaoman.

631
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:17,990
Let's meet another day.

632
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,350
He cares a lot

633
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,110
about that kid.

634
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,060
Let's go.

635
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,250
I've checked some surveillance footage these days.

636
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,120
There's someone weird.

637
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,810
Have you seen them?

638
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,740
No.

639
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,270
Where was this?

640
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,470
This is the day Ding Jing pushed you

641
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,190
at the subway station.

642
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:49,830
They were there too.

643
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,660
I don't remember.

644
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,900
It's too blurry.

645
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:53,880
It's okay.

646
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,830
Stay alert.

647
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:55,780
Tell me if you meet

648
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,560
this person.

649
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,210
Did you drive today?

650
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:00,830
Yes.

651
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,570
What's wrong?

652
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,190
If you aren't busy,

653
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,060
can you take me somewhere?

654
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,090
I want to buy something.

655
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,770
Sure.

656
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,480
Let's go.

657
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,280
It's here.

658
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,680
Which one?

659
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,960
I don't know how to choose.

660
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,870
You know this, right?

661
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,600
It's not about hardness.

00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,680
Is it?

665
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,700
Yeah, you can pump it.

666
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,160
This one...

667
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,310
Do you think this looks good

668
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,030
or

669
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,030
this one?

670
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,550
This one.

671
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,110
This one?

672
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,250
Okay, I'll listen to you.

673
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,960
Xiaoman said,

674
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,880
once he's discharged,

675
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,450
he wanted to learn basketball the most.

676
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,430
That kid likes basketball?

677
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,550
He thinks

678
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,840
the tallest and strongest in their class

679
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,160
all play basketball.

680
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,830
So he wants to be like them.

681
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,590
He wants to protect his mom.

686
00:29:59,390 --> 00:29:59,670
Yeah.

I've always been pure.

688
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,510
I just want to protect

Look.

00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,620
It's dressed like me.

Yeah.

you didn't have

00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:15,760
A girl?

773
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,070
Yes.

774
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,840
Wearing a cap

775
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:17,560
and a mask.

776
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:18,780
A girl.

777
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,710
She's wearing a cap and a mask

778
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,389
so others can't see her face.

779
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,760
Think about it.

780
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:27,230
I remember.

781
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,040
Yeah?

782
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,429
Last night,

783
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,500
I was about to close.

784
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,929
A girl came in.

785
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,340
So I'd to serve her.

786
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,219
Miss, what do you want to buy?

787
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,830
She didn't say a word.

788
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,739
She took a few bottles of water

789
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,060
and some bread

790
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,780
and left after leaving 100 yuan.

791
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,679
She left?

792
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,060
Do you know where she went?

793
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,080
No.

794
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,810
I went after her.

795
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:52,449
Miss, your money!

796
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,960
Your change!

797
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,800
She didn't look back.

798
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,870
She ran so fast

799
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:56,719
towards north.

800
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:57,400
To the north?

801
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,580
Sir.

802
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,310
Is there any village in the north?

803
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,910
Village? No.

804
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,880
A long time ago,

805
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,000
there was an industrial park.

806
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,230
It's deserted now.

807
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,090
It's quite far from here.

808
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:12,810
Okay.

809
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,480
Thank you.

810
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,280
No problem.

811
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,170
Keep these photos.

812
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,390
Our contact info's on it.

813
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,280
If you see them again,

814
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,280
contact us immediately.

815
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,790
Okay.

816
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,430
Thank you, sir.

817
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,340
The oranges are so sweet.

818
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,240
We'll come again.

819
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,040
Okay!

820
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,030
Okay, thank you.

821
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:24,430
Bye.

822
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,350
Okay.

823
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,480
Let's go to the industrial park.

824
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,030
Getting stuff?

825
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,110
Coming, coming.

826
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,600
Yue.

827
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,350
This should be the abandoned factory

828
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,180
he mentioned.

829
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,950
Nobody passes by and no surveillance cameras.

830
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,390
It's suitable for criminals to hide.

831
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,750
Yue.

832
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,310
These tire marks are new.

833
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,070
Notify Captain Jiang.

834
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,780
Is it good?

835
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,000
Yes.

836
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,250
It's really good.

837
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:54,980
How'd you make it?

838
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,250
I followed a recipe.

839
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,650
Try it.

840
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,730
Eat it. It's all for you.

841
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,070
Hello?

842
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,620
Captain Jiang.

843
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,500
We've got a clue.

844
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,770
Text me the address.

845
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,120
I'll be right there.

846
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,360
Sorry.

847
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,010
We have

848
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,080
a mission.

849
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,080
I can't eat with you.

850
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,350
B-Be careful.

851
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,270
Bye.

852
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,580
Be careful.

853
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,910
[Ninghai Anshan People's Hospital]

854
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,800
Qiao Rui is in a relationship

855
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,740
with Huang Wei.

856
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,760
Really?

857
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,140
Yan.

858
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,660
An ER patient came.

859
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,210
They said it's the officer Liu Hao

860
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,350
who's always

861
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,030
with Captain Jiang.

862
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,460
Liu Hao?

863
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,760
What’s wrong with him?

864
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,080
I heard he got stabbed

865
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,020
during a mission.

866
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,400
But don't worry.

867
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,800
He's fine now.

868
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,570
Which room?

869
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,520
Room 305.

870
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,720
Dr. Lu.

871
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,760
Please tell your higher-up to let me

872
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,370
be discharged.

873
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,510
I'm really fine.

874
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,270
What?

875
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,430
Just lie down.

876
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,280
I just asked a surgeon.

877
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,230
The stab was just one cm away from your spleen.

878
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,490
It's too dangerous.

879
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,880
Injuries are inevitable

880
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,150
during missions.

881
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,710
I just regret not catching them.

882
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,220
Don't think about that now,

883
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:33,870
okay?

884
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,310
You must rest well.

885
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,560
Prioritize your health.

886
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,160
Okay, thank you.

887
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,670
Did you

888
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,410
go on the mission with Captain Jiang?

889
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,260
Yes.

890
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,400
I was with Captain Jiang.

891
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,380
Qin Yue.

892
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,160
Jiang.

893
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,150
What happened?

894
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,440
We came here

895
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,400
according to the interviewees.

896
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:05,950
This park was

897
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,990
abandoned for a long time.

898
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,080
No one usually comes.

899
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,920
But when we got here,

900
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,230
we found new tire marks at the door.

901
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,840
I'm guessing this is

902
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,120
where criminals hide.

903
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:13,930
Captain Jiang.

904
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,360
This is the map of the factory.

905
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,680
There are four doors in the four directions

906
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,590
and many small doors.

907
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,690
The structure inside is very complex.

908
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,570
Well,

909
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,910
we'll each lead a team

910
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:24,640
and split up.

911
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,640
Understood.

912
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,030
Jiang.

913
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:26,880
Don't think I'm superstitious,

914
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,090
but my right eye kept twitching since I woke up.

915
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,940
Be careful.

916
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,200
Everyone, be careful.

917
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:30,800
Let's go.

918
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,710
Don't jinx it!

919
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,510
Be careful!

920
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,000
Let's go.

921
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,580
Go!

922
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,300
Let's go.

923
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,540
Where is it?

924
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,660
As long as you let me go,

925
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,810
I will give it to you.

926
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,670
Where is it?

927
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,260
Tell him again.

928
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,060
If he lets me go,

929
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,010
I'll leave the country

930
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,330
and never come back.

931
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,550
I promise I'll give it to you.

932
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,890
I didn't back it up.

933
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,240
I'll never come back.

934
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,160
Call him

935
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,840
and talk to him again.

936
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,150
Isn't this good for

937
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,920
both of us?

938
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,190
This way.

939
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,670
Hello?

940
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,760
Not yet.

941
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,340
Got it.

942
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,570
Help!

943
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,890
Is anyone there?

944
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,040
Hao!

945
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:55,520
Hao!

946
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,080
Hurry.

947
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:57,950
Go.

948
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,310
Yes.

949
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:58,710
Go.

950
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,070
Hao.

951
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,640
Press onto it.

952
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:04,800
Press onto it.

953
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,490
Call an ambulance to the factory.

954
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,690
Someone's injured.

955
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,230
Liu Hao!

956
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:10,840
Captain Jiang.

957
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,260
What happened?

958
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,160
Captain Jiang.

959
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,070
I was careless.

960
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:14,950
They ran away.

961
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,270
Did you call an ambulance?

962
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:17,710
Yes.

963
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:19,560
How are you?

964
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,360
I’m fine.

965
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:21,910
Captain Jiang.

966
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,770
I’m here.

967
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,300
There's a situation here.

968
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,400
I'll be right there.

969
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,310
Watch him.

970
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:26,750
Okay.

971
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:28,810
Hang in there.

972
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:29,980
The ambulance will be here soon.

973
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,330
Did he get hurt?

974
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,030
After I got hurt,

975
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,310
I was sent to the hospital.

976
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,700
I don't know what happened later.

977
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:41,970
Okay.

978
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,030
Anyway, have a good rest.

979
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,430
Okay.

980
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:46,200
Thank you.

981
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,730
I'll get going.

982
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,820
The murderer deliberately let water out before they ran.

983
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,400
The traces were washed away.

984
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:31,420
Did you catch them?

985
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,760
Get Forensics here.

986
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,480
Inform the trace inspection officers to get here.

987
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,420
Protect the scene.
