00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,950
for someone like my father,

113
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,190
who has severe sick sinus syndrome

114
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,670
and history of cerebral hemorrhage,

115
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,909
what is the risk of anesthesia and surgery?

116
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,610
There is indeed a risk.

117
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,870
But sick sinus syndrome and cerebral hemorrhage are not

118
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,960
absolute contraindications

119
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,550
for surgery and anesthesia.

120
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,350
We can only conclude

121
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,590
that compared to other patients,

122
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,030
the risk is higher for this surgery.

123
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,740
Yes.

124
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,250
In other words,

125
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,220
while being under anesthesia,

126
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,870
his blood pressure may fluctuate

127
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,350
and cause cerebral hemorrhage.

128
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,470
This will affect his life,

129
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:10,870
right?

130
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,300
Yes.

131
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,230

132
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,120
his past medical history.

133
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,920
So I will be very careful

134
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,110
when it comes to this operation.

135
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,160
Even so,

136
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,520
the risk still exists.

137
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,390

138
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,680
