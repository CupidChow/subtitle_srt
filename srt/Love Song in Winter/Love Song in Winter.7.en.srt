Just stay here.

102
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,110
I don't mind.

103
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,110
Besides,

This is just an excuse.

123
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,950
Tell me.

125

Who is he?

126
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,970
I am

127
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,250
really curious.

128

129
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,370
is he like?

130
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,420
Why are you

132
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,230

I'm really curious—

134
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,590
Enough, enough.

I... I...

144
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,390
I told you everything about

145
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,270
everyone I dated;

146
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,470
their names and how they look.

147
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:08,880
But you?

148

I don't even know his name!

149
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,430
I don't care.

150
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,030
You must tell me

151
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,390
everything today.

152
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,230
Okay, okay.

153
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,340
I'll tell you.

154
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,830
But no one

155
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,150
outside of my uni knows.

156
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,400
I swear

157
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,750
I will never

158
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,910
tell anyone.

What was that?

162
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,120
Wait...

163
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,210
Isn't that

164
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,950
the super tall cop?

165
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,870
I really never sensed

166
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,010
anything!

167
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,820
Wow,

168
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,000
Matron Qiao is amazing.

169
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,280
No wonder she's always—

170
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,500
You guys are too gossipy.

171
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,730
No.

172
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,610
We talked...

173
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:56,830
Wait.

174
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,909
Then why did you two break up?

175
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,340
Okay, okay.

176
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,640
Forget

177
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,790
that I asked.

178
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,460
Let's eat.

179
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,370
No wonder you told me

180
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,020
he's a nice person

181
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,320
and asked me to ask him myself.

182
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,200
Actually, I should've realized,

183
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:17,880
yeah?

184
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,550
Eat the chicken feet.

185
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,040
This one.

186
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,790
You have it.

187
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,350
It's good luck.

188
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,030
You have it.

189
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,040
Yan, I just have one question.

190
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,110
Just one. Just one.

191
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,100
J-Just one.

192
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,640
Just one then.

193
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,320
Shoot.

194
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,840
Do you still like him?

195
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,710
Does he still like you?

196
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,630
Will you ever get back together?

197
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,890
Was that one question?

392
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,710
it's your first day at work.

393
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,430
You must be tired.

394
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,800
Why don't you go home?

395
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,400
The two of us will stay here.

396
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,330
What's wrong with you?

397
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,780
Get lost.

398
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,390
What's wrong with you?

399
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:30,880
No, I...

400
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,660
Get lost!

401
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,830
Jiang.

402
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,490
You had a tough day,

403
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,110
but at night,

404
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,560
please keep working hard with us

405
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,740
for night duty.

406
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,780
Alright, cut the crap.

407
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,560
I'll keep watch.

408
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,490
Go eat something.

409
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,580
Wait, Captain Jiang,

410
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,770
is it appropriate?

411
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,150
Wait.

412
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,070
We'll take over after eating.

413
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,830
It's Captain Jiang's first day.

414
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,260
Are you on night duty too?

415
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,550
You...

416
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,310
H-Have you eaten?

417
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,400
No, but

418
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,550
I'm no longer hungry.

419
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:09,690
Then...

420
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,740
You should get some rest.

421
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,510
The medical staff are here.

422
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,500
Don't worry.

423
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,750
I'll check on other patients.

424
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,590
Go ahead.

425
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,960
♫As the city flickers♫

426
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,080
♫It's as gentle as wind wrapping around rain♫

427
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,660

00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,600
Jiang.

429

[Emergency]

430
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,610
We're here to take over.

431
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,130
♫Always offering your happiness to me first♫

432
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,910

♫The humor of time♫

434
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,440
♫No one to blame for breaking the promise♫

435
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:11,260
♫It's because we met too soon that we missed each other♫

436
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,270
♫We're stranded at sunset♫

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,230

♫I miss you missing me♫

464
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,830
You should get some sleep.

465
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,810
Coming.

466
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,200
So Liu Yuming

467
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,330
was so obsessed with explosives engineering

468
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,950
that he developed schizophrenia

469
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,350
and became paranoid.

470
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,090
After he hit the victim with his car,

471
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,670
he tied a bomb to him.

472
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,190
In my opinion,

473
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,040
Captain Jiang's really the best.

474
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,360
Decisive and efficient—

475
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,550
Cut the crap.

476
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,150
Excuse me,

477
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,790
are those our noodles?

478
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,310
Coming.

479
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:33,680
Hurry.

480
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,240
Stuff his mouth.

481
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,150
Coming.

482
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,430
Director Xing first.

483
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,010
Here.

484
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,560
Okay.

485
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,320
Careful, it’s hot.

486
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,490
Jiang,

487
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,240
not bad.

488
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,050
It's your

489
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,600
first case here

490
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,870
and you already aced it.

491
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,020
You've brought good luck to Anshan's

492
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,510
Criminal Investigation Unit.

493
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,210
Director.

494
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,480
It's all thanks to everyone.

495
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,900
I didn't do it alone.

496
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,080
Yue.

497
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,190
Speak up for us.

498
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,130
Director Xing,

499
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,290
it was a team effort.

500
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,020
We also need commendation.

501
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,820
We also need praise.

502
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,640
Yes, that's right.

503
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,040
We played a part too.

504
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,130
Fine, fine.

505
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,530
All of you,

506
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,210
well done!

507
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,030
Everyone

508
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,450
did superb this time.

509
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,120
As usual,

510
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,020
let's have a gathering sometime.

511
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:10,830
Barbecue,

512
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,620
my treat.

513
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,340
-Okay?
-Nice.

514
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:12,960
Nice.

515
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,430
Nice.

516
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,090
Director Xing.

517
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,470
Can we bring

518
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,500
our family?

519
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,280
Sure.

520
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,370
But only one family member each.

521
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,280
That's enough.

522
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,830
Captain Jiang

523
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,030
only has Dr. Lu anyway.

524
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,750
Dr. Lu?

525
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,480
Dr. Lu?

526
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,200
Jiang,

527
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,070
what’s going on?

528
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,510
Is Lu your girlfriend?

529
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,590
No.

530
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,320
No,

531
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,330
it's more than that.

532
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,970
Sooner or later, she'll be his girl.

533
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,590
You...

534
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,130
Wait, Yue,

535
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,070
I'm a bit confused.

536
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,640
More than a girlfriend?

537
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,590
So are they

538
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,730
a thing or not?

539
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,940
Care to explain, Captain Jiang?

540
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,480
It doesn’t matter.

541
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,610
Anyway,

542
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,030
every time Captain Jiang

543
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,340
returns from seeing Dr. Lu,

544
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,130
he becomes very gentle in the way

545
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,500
he speaks and acts.

546
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,990
Back in the police academy,

547
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,310
he was so fierce to me, you know?

548
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,270
Shut your mouth with this.

549
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,070
Have some spicy food

550
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,050
to tame the gossip in your mouth.

551
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,210
Sure thing.

552
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,170
We're a family, aren't we?

553
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,390
Director Xing's here too.

554
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,210
Just be honest with us.

555
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,750
Come on.

556
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,960
Yes, Jiang.

557
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,870
Tell us.

558
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,170
I'm also quite curious.

559
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,410
Well...

560
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,990
Dr. Lu and I...

561
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,380
when we were in university,

562
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,630
we were classmates.

563
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,330
Classmates.

564
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,250
And then?

565
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,750
That's all. Just classmates.

566
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,720
Let's eat.

567
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,400
Alright, eat up.

568
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:40,950
Eat up.

569
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,370
So spicy!

570
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,650
Is it?

571
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,580
Have some soup.

572
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,330
How do you feel back at work?

573
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,920
It's been bad.

574
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,640
I can't handle it.

575
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,240
It's so overwhelming.

576
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,710
You haven't used up your annual leave.

577
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,280
Take a few more days off.

578
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,170
I can't.

579
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,860
The nurses' station is so swamped.

580
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,750
If it weren't for the matter with Zhang Xiaohui,

581
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,780
Matron Qiao

582
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,500
would've cursed me out.

583
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,070
Did Zhang Xiaohui

584
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,230
really get arrested?

585
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,240
Did I not tell you?

586
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,590
Actually,

587
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,130
his ex-girlfriend didn't cheat.

588
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,230
It was also because he was

589
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,870
too controlling

590
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:30,970
that they broke up.

591
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,450
And he even

592
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,590
stalked her for half a year.

593
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,490
And now,

594
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,370
he's locked up.

595
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,270
Serves him right.

596
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,540
Sorry about that.

597
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,090
I'll give you a huge drumstick.

598
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,280
You have it.

599
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,810
Your surgeries are so taxing.

600
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,770
You need the energy.

601
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,870
Eat more.

602
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,660
Okay, okay.

603
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,470
Lu Yan.

604
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,180
Captain Jiang, why are you...

605
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,890
You must be here for Yan.

606
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,880
How's your case going?

607
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,630
Pretty good.

608
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,630
I just ate noodles.

609
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,550
They were good,

610
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,640
so I brought you some.

611
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,380
Try it.

612
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,030
Captain Jiang, you're so nice.

613
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,690
Here.

614
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,080
Thank you.

615
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,340
You too.

616
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,040
Yes.

617
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,970
Thank you.

618
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,540
And intestines too?

619
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,020
Oh, right.

620
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,250
Captain Jiang.

621
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,920
Are you free tonight?

622
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,920
What's up?

623
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,250
I just moved to a new place.

624
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,490
I want to invite

625
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,340
everyone to dinner tonight.

626
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,760
Yan's coming too.

627
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,900
Care to join?

628
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,540
I may have

629
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,640
work to do.

630
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,790
I'll check first, okay?

631
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,010
They're all people you know,

632
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,640
like Matron Qiao,

633
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,660
Dr. Huang,

634
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,630
Yilin,

635
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,620
and...

636
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,780
Tang Jie and her husband.

637
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,880
You know them too.

638
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,180
How do you know them?

639
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,060
I needed to fix my teeth.

640
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,670
So Yan

641
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,100
gave me her contact.

642
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,950
Tang Jie

643
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,940
is really nice.

644
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,310
I haven't had the chance to thank her.

645
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,130
So I thought

646
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,530
I'll do it together this time.

647
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,040
I also heard

648
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,200
her husband

649
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,330
runs a film company.

650
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,780
So I thought

651
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,010
he could introduce

652
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,330
some hotties to me.

653
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,360
Still boy-crazy?

654
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,250
How is it? Is it good?

655
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,840
Yeah.

656
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,740
H-Have you had your fill?

657
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,090
Yes, I have.

658
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,990
By the way,

659
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,660
Wen Peng's coming too.

660
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,890
You know him too.

661
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,600
You know Wen Peng too?

662
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,070
Yes, he's my senior.

663
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,570
And he found

664
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,060
my apartment for me.

665
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,210
You guys hung out with him often?

666
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,030
Yes.

667
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,950
Well, since they're

668
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,070
all people you know,

669
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,040
you should join us.

670
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,880
Okay, I'll check my workload.

671
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,950
If I get off work early,

672
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,870
I'll try my best to make it.

673
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,590
Okay.

674
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,680
If you're coming,

675
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,950
contact Yan.

676
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:54,610
Okay.

677
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,440
We're not done yet!

678
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,370
You...

679
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,950
Wait,

680
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,950
what about selfies?

681
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:23,870
Just food photos?

682
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,400
Right.

683
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:24,830
Yes, yes.

684
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,590
Let's take a group photo.

685
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:25,990
Let me.

686
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,040
This angle's good.

687
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:28,950
Thank you.

688
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,430
Women love taking photos.

689
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,070
Make sure we're all

690
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:31,880
in the frame.

691
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,740
Matron Qiao, squeeze in more.

692
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,680
Okay.

693
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,910
Three, two, one.

694
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,950
Cheese!

695
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,830
Cheese!

696
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,340
Cheers.

697
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,770
Let me see.

698
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:44,910
Let me check.

699
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:45,570
Let me see.

700
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,300
This part's all blurred.

701
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,890
Yeah.

702
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,710
Send it to the group chat.

703
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,810
-Send it to the group chat.
-We can edit it.

704
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,600
It can be edited.

705
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,750
Director Sun,

706
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,720
why isn't your husband here?

707
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,400
He has an operation tonight.

708
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,030
He works at a large hospital.

709
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,110
It's not as idle as

710
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,070
our district hospital.

711
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,110
To be honest,

712
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,570
we haven't seen each other for a long time.

713
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,030
Thank god

714
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,420
my parents are watching our kid.

715
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,880
That's why

716
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,290
doctors shouldn't get married.

717
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,120
That's right.

718
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,370
Really?

719
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,070
I think it's quite nice.

720
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,210
And you'll

721
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,570
understand each other better.

722
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,080
But don't you think doctors

723
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,180
are a good match

724
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,380
with cops?

725
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,280
Right?

726
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,810
Aren't you talking about Yan

727
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,960
and Captain Jiang?

728
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,620
Qianqian, you're so smart!

729
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,440
I think they're a good match too.

730
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,650
But to be honest,

731
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,030
if they got married,

732
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,740
they won't be able to see each other.

733
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:33,900
Why?

734
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,710
No.

735
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,260
It's fine as long as their hearts are one.

736
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,060
That's right.

737
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,300
A loving relationship.

738
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,580
Who

739
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,040
wants drinks?

740
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,200
Coke Zero.

741
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,930
-Me, me!
-Yes, yes!

742
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,630
You?

743
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,650
No, thanks.

744
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,900
Don't drink too much soda.

745
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,510
Thank you.

746
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,060
Thank you!

747
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:50,910
It's bad for you.

748
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,330
Wen, you're so sweet.

749
00:28:58,910 --> 00:28:59,710
Lu Yan!

750
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,450
W-Weren't you not coming?

751
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,270
Yes.

752
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,330
Let me help you.

753
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,600
I happened to be done with my work

754
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,300
and...

755
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,800
It's a rare gathering.

756
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,190
The more, the merrier.

757
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:16,480
Let's go.

758
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,030
Let's go.

759
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,800
Lu Yan!

760
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:22,840
Wen.

761
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,130
Everyone's waiting for you.

762
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,700
We meet again.

763
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,770
I didn't expect you to come.

764
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,700
I was invited.

765
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,700
Let's go.

766
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:32,990
Let's go.

767
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,060
I'm starving.

768
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,260
Qianqian.

769
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,100
Qianqian.

770
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:43,590
They're here.

771
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,590
Yan, you're here!

772
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,270
Jiang, why are you here?

773
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,210
Captain Jiang, you're here too!

774
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,510
Lu Yan and I bought you gifts.

775
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,350
Oh my god, thank you.

776
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,230
Why's Captain Jiang

777
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,110
carrying

778
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,680
Dr. Lu's stuff?

779
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,470
I just helped her.

780
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,460
Lu Yan.

781
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,680
I saved this seat for you.

782
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,970
Then...

783
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,630
It's okay.

784
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,550
I'll get another chair.

785
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:00,880
Here.

786
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,510
Okay.

787
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,480
Sit here.

788
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,760
Lu Yan.

789
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,650
Want to sit next to your bestie?

790
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:06,980
Sure.

791
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,430
Here.

792
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,090
Yan, sit here.

793
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,510
Is it cramped?

794
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:09,920
Sit.

795
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,580
I...

796
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,320
It's okay.

797
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,520
Is it cramped there?

798
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,660
I-It's okay.

799
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,210
I'll make space for her.

800
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,120
I'll move this way.

801
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,940
Okay.

802
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,910
Is it good now?

803
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,170
Yes.

804
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,010
Alright, everyone's here.

805
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,070
Fill your glasses.

806
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:33,750
I will

807
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,230
give a speech soon!

808
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,660
-Come on!
-Come on!

809
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,340
Lu Yan.

810
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,300
Do you want some?

811
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,430
I don't drink anymore.

812
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,710
It's a celebration.

813
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,460
She can't drink.

814
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,450
Doctors are

815
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,240
like cops.

816
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,380
We shouldn't drink casually.

817
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,190
Right?

818
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,070
Orange juice?

819
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:49,720
Okay.

820
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,360
Here.

821
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,030
Okay.

822
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,270
Pour some for me.

823
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,150
I'll drink with you.

824
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,860
Come on.

825
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,670
You're drunk. Stop drinking.

826
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,460
I'm having fun. I'll take tomorrow off.

827
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,400
Fill it up!

828
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,820
Here.

829
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,780
Dr. Lu.

830
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,170
Are you

831
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,860
and Captain Jiang...

832
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,340
We...

833
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,830
We were university classmates.

834
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,050
Uni classmates?

835
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,550
Classmates...

836
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,510
Did you two come together

837
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,660
or...

838
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,180
I ran into her at the door.

839
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,570
Coincidentally?

840
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,550
Yeah.

841
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,410
It must be fate.

842
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,680
-So fated.
-So fated.

843
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,780
Not only that.

844
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,030
They were dating

845
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,790
in university—

846
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,400
Honey!

847
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,710
What's wrong with you?

848
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,360
Why's he so drunk?

849
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,150
What's wrong?

850
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:37,740
Qianqian!

851
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,360
Your speech. We all have our drinks.

852
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,900
Thank you for gracing the occasion

853
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:43,950
with your presence.

854
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,420
I'm truly honored.

855
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:45,890
Come on!

856
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,210
Cheers to everyone!

857
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,680
Here.

858
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,460
Congrats.

859
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,740
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

860
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,850
Thank you!

861
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,110
-Together.
-Congrats.

862
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,440
Enjoy the food and drinks. Don't waste it.

863
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,630
My second toast

864
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,030
is to thank Lu Yan.

865
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,590
My dear Yan, thank you

866
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,830
for taking care of me

867
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,640
and protecting me

868
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,480
all this time,

869
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,500
and even taking me in.

870
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,720
I'm willing to exchange all my fat

871
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,610
for endless luck in love for you!

872
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,460
Is Lu Yan dating someone?

873
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,310
Who is it?

874
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,510
He's right under our noses.

875
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,430
You two made up?

876
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,270
My goodness.

877
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,620
Can you just shut up?

878
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,150
He's drunk.

879
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,180
Don't listen to Zhong.

880
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,490
I-I-It's...

881
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:32,830
Say something.

882
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,590
I...

883
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,540
Right.

884
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,650
No more drinking.

885
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,110
We were uni classmates.

886
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,600
In university, we were...

887
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,030
often together...

888
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,490
Together?

889
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,400
Running.

890
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,630
Is that so, Yan?

891
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,560
Yes, running.

892
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,780
Yes.

893
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,310
Look at how our junior

894
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,150
Lu Yan's running.

895
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,370
She's like a zombie.

896
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,480
It must've been hard on her

897
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,510
to catch the thief.

898
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,800
You know her?

899
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,130
Not really.

900
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,940
Do you know

901
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,980
she's a cheerleader?

902
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:18,990
I saw her cheerleading

903
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,070
by chance.

904
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,790
Zero coordination.

905
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,810
She has such poor motor skills.

906
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,610
Is there something wrong with her brain?

907
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,720
Was that funny?

908
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,030
Cut it out.

909
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,520
Oh my god.

910
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,160
Jie.

911
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,610
I'm done, Tang Jie.

912
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,850
I was long done.

913
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,610
Yan.

914
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,820
You're on your own.

915
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,340
Yan, go for it.

916
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,390
Go for it.

917
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,659
Your running posture's wrong,

918
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,800
so it's more tiring.

919
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,300
Swing your arms up,

920
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,639
forward and back.

921
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,340
Keep breathing.

922
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,530
Lift up your calves with your thighs.

923
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,030
Good.

924
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:27,860
Come on.

925
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,370
Lean forward a bit.

926
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,830
Come, run with me.

927
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:35,659
Keep up.

928
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,550
What do we have there?

929
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,100
Jiang Chengyi's running with Yan!

930
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,280
♫When we're hand in hand, even the equator possesses♫

931
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,139
♫Beauty like the aurora and white snow♫

00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,370

♫I want to weave a beautiful dream for you♫

936
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,730
♫What we lack is not just time♫

00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,070
♫Losing sight of the world and our default end point♫
