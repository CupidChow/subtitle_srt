[Episode 5]

3
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
I remember the first time

4
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,950
I saw you.

5
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,170
You were running on the court,

6
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,009
and I couldn't help but think,

7
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,430
how could someone

8
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,870
run so badly?

9
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,690
It was truly awful.

10
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,660
Yan.

11
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,050
Are you okay?

12
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,220
I'm so tired.

13
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,660
Just go ahead and run; don't mind me.

14
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,690
Are you exhausted?

15
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,860
No way.

16
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,100
Hurry up.

17
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,630
Yan.

18
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,200
Why do you look like a zombie?

19
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,470
Do I?

20
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,690
I don't think so.

21
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,310
Awesome.

22
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,110
Not bad.

23
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,630
I can't keep going.

24
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,590
I really can't.

25
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,450
What's wrong with you?

26
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,150
Yan.

27
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,410
There were two game-winning plays today.

28
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,020
Are you okay?

29
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:53,790
What's wrong?

30
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,410
Excuse me,

31
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,950
young lady.

32
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,310
You can't sit down right away after a long run.

33
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,200
Get up quickly.

34
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,430
It's fine, sir.

35
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,500
She only ran one lap.

36
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,990
Have a little respect for me.

37
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,440
I was just tying my shoelaces.

38
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,730
Only one lap?

39
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,750
Finish tying them quickly and keep running.

40
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,790
Come on, just one more lap.

41
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,870
Let's go.

42
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,410
I'll help you up.

43
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,810
My girlfriend.

44
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,020
Which one?

45
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,490
The one in purple.

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,150
They're all wearing purple.

47
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,990
Hang in there.

48
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,310
Actually, back in high school,

49
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,820
I wanted to apply to the police academy.

50
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,230
But my parents didn't agree,

51
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,390
so I went to Ninghai University

52
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,190
to study engineering instead.

53
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,760
But I'm not interested

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,710
in engineering.

55
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,450
Every day feels like a struggle,

56
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,770
just going through the motions,

57
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,510
trying to get by.

58
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,470
Until one day,

59
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,210
I found out you were going after a thief.

60
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,990
Someone who threw up after running just one lap

61
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,820
around the basketball court was about to catch a thief.

62
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,550
How brave...

63
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,830
is that!

64
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,150
How

65
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,230
utterly overconfident!

66
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,110
Are you praising me?

67
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Kind of.

68
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,740
I've bought the beef noodles.

69
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,550
Anything else?

70
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,640
Thanks, bro.

71
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,510
I'll be your servant when you come back.

72
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,750
Wait, just make sure

73
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,610
you hold on tight on your way back.

74
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,230
Don't spill it.

75
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,070
I know.

76
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,150
That soup is the essence.

77
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,060
Move aside!

78
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,909
Catch the thief!

79
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,070
Thief!

80
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,570
Move aside!

81
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,120
Stop there!

82
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,560
Stop there!

83
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,370
Move aside!

84
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,370
Move aside!

85
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,080
Give me the bag!

86
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,360
Go away!

87
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,290
Go away!

88
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,560
Go away!

89
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,820
Go away!

90
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,180
Go away!

91
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,950
Handcuff him.

92
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,480
Come on, let me handle it.

93
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,560
It's him.

94
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,840
He's the one who stole my bag.

95
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:54,470
Check

96
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,510
if anything's missing.

97
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,480
Nothing's missing.

98
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,890
Thank you, officer.

99
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,200
Thank you both.

100
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,990
You're welcome.

101
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,490
Take him in.

102
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,430
Is it not your bag?

103
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,850
No.

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,300
I thought it was your bag.

105
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,670
You're being a good Samaritan, huh?

106
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,150
Quite brave.

107
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,390
I'm Jiang Chengyi.

108
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,790
My name is...

109
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,070
I'm…

110
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,170
Sorry,

111
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,980
I'm really out of shape.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,870
I know.

113
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,150
You ran a lap around the basketball court

114
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,550
and collapsed, didn't you?

115
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,230
Today, you've really outdone yourself.

116
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,550
How do you know?

117
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,909
I was playing basketball that day.

118
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,510
Are we from the same school?

119
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,990
Yes.

120
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:41,670
I thought

121
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,270
you were from the police academy next door.

122
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,700
I don't look like someone from the police academy at all.

123
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,550
But that move you made earlier,

124
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,830
it really

125
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:48,909
looked like it—

126
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,000
like a real cop.

127
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,290
Thank you.

128
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:52,750
Well...

129
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,300
Thank you.

130
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,480
You're welcome.

131
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,710
I'm leaving.

132
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,840
What's your name?

133
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,420
I'm... I'm Lu Yan.

134
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,470
I major in Anesthesiology, Class of '14.

135
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,790
Solid or liquid...

136
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,110
Solid or liquid...

137
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,230
Solid or liquid...

138
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,150
Entering...

139
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,310
Entering...

140
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,730
Solid and liquid

141
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,870
substances...

142
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,630
Solid or...

143
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,370
Solid or...

144
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,830
Solid or liquid...

145
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,030
Solid or...

146
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,560
Substances entering the lower respiratory tract...

147
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,430
Solid or...

148
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,080
Solid...

149
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,870
Solid or liquid...

150
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,909
Solid or liquid...

151
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,500
From that day on, I realized

152
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,490
I shouldn't keep drifting along like this.

153
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,990
Even though I hadn't joined the police academy yet,

154
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,870
I was already

155
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,390
holding myself

156
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,670
to a police officer's standard.

157
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,390
So every day, I would go to the playground

158
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,340
for physical training.

159
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,110
No wonder, back then,

160
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,270
I could see you every morning

161
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,690
running laps on the playground.

162
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,299
I ran

163
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,429
ten laps,

164
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,350
and you were still memorizing the same passage.

165
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:40,960
I...

166
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,220
I really wasn't good at memorizing

167
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,390
back then.

168
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,220
I ran for a whole week,

169
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,520
and you still hadn't finished the first chapter.

170
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,390
That's enough.

171
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,640
Later, after a semester,

172
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,160
my fitness level met the standard.

173
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,720
You failed your course, right?

174
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,580
Don't bring it up.

175
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,610
Did you retake the exam?

176
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,470
Jiang Chengyi.

177
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,940
You're off work now, right?

178
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,480
Let me take you home.

179
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,700
[Huiting Complex]

180
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,450
Senior.

181
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,310
Qin Yue.

182
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,200
Is it done?

183
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,210
Yes.

184
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Scan the QR code,

185
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,030
and you can use it once you're connected.

186
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,050
Okay.

187
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,290
This is my junior, Qin Yue.

188
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,190
He's also a criminal police officer

189
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,470
from Anshan District.

190
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:02,880
Lei Yiming,

191
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,560
from our criminal police team.

192
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,070
Hello, Senior.

193
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,510
Hello.

194
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,540
I asked them to help

195
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,040
install a video doorbell for you.

196

00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,110
do something extreme.

389
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,390
You have to break up with him.

390
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,230
I'm not joking.

391
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:39,640
Do you understand?

392
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,510
I understand.

393
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,390
I actually wanted to

394
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,350
break up with him a long time ago.

395
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,740
But,

396
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,580
he knows where I work

397
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,410
and where my parents live.

398
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,750
I'm so scared that

399
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,970
if he gets emotional,

400
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,110
he'll show up at my door.

401
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,270
Then, you should talk to a police officer.

402
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,480
Ask for advice,

403
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,630
or get some sort of

404
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,270
personal safety protection order.

405
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,109
Captain Jiang is a police officer, isn't he?

406
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,589
Could you ask him for me?

407
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:08,869
I...

408
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,349
He...

409
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,510
Go ask him yourself.

410
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,050
After all, I don't know much

411
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,079
about what's going on between you two.

412
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,310
He's a really nice person;

413
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,589
you can ask him anything.

414
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,109
How do you know?

415
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,030
I...

416
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,550
Just read it from his expression.

417
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,450
I'm going to prepare for the surgery now.

418
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,900
Let's grab something tasty tonight.

419
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,270
Could you stay with me a little longer?

420
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,140
Just one more minute,

421
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,030
okay?

422
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,800
Can you help me open it?

423
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,800
I can't do it.

424
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,720
Wen,

425
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,120
how about the autograph

426
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,430
I asked you

427
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,100
to help me get last time?

428
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,520
The autograph?

429
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh, do you have time tonight?

430
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,390
Tonight?

431
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,980
Are you meeting Dr. Han?

432
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,400
It's a surprise.

433
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,550
A surprise?

434
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,740
Really?

435
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,790
That's great!

436
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,320
Alright then,

437
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,950
Wen, see you tonight.

438
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,530
Let me know when you're off work,

439
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,370
and I'll come pick you up.

440
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,190
Sure.

441
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,420
Well,

442
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,510
Captain Jiang,

443
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,830
what should I do

444
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,960
about my situation now?

445
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,120
For this kind of matter,

446
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,670
honestly, I'd still suggest you

447
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,340
call the police first.

448
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,910
But if you're really worried that

449
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,430
calling the police might provoke him,

450
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,710
try to choose

451
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,890
a crowded place

452
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,470
to talk about breaking up.

453
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,730
A public place—

454
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,050
like a busy intersection

455
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,490
with traffic police around.

456
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,850
That way,

457
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,150
if there's any danger,

458
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,320
someone can step in

459
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,430
to protect you right away.

460
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,510
How about this?

461
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,270
I'll give you my junior's phone number.

462
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,590
He happens to be

463
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,340
at the Anshan Police Station.

464
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,310
If you need anything,

465
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,850
you can contact him right away.

466
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,390
You're still living

467
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,070
with your boyfriend, right?

468
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,150
Yes.

469
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,370
We are

470
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,770
renting a place together.

471
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,670
When you go back to pack your things,

472
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,860
take someone with you.

473
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,580
Alright,

474
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,820
I'll ask Lu Yan to go with me.

475
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,510
I'll also leave you

476
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,030
my number.

477
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,490
If you need anything,

478
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,960
you can contact me too.

479
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,510
Really?

480
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,960
Yes.

481
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,750
Captain Jiang,

482
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,950
you're such a good person.

483
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,150
I think

484
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,710
whoever becomes your girlfriend

485
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:34,910
[Edit Contact] [Jiang Cheng]

486
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,190
will really be lucky.

[Refuse] [Answer]

488
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,250
[Lu Yan]

489
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,390
Phone call.

490
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,260
Sorry.

491
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,480
Hello, Yan. What's up?

492
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,440
Qianqian,

493
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,560
do you

494
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,590
have plans tonight?

495
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,150
Where are we going?

496
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,310
Come with me to a place tonight.

497
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,670
What's it for?

498
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,090
If you don't explain it clearly, I'm not going.

499
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,970
Come with me...

500
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,160
Come with me on a date.

501
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,370
Go on a date with you?

502
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,390
Sure!

503
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,410
Which one?

504
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,600
Is it the 185 guy?

505
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,950
Or the Leo?

506
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,600
Or the one

507
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,620
who does rock climbing?

508
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,510
Alright.

509
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,150
You...

510
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,530
You have the password to my house, don't you?

511
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,540
Go change into

512
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,350
a nice outfit first.

513
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,060
Dress up beautifully.

514
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,340
I'll pick you up later tonight.

515
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:16,910
Okay.

516
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,340
See you later.

517
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,620
Tonight,

518
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,310
are you going out to have fun?

519
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,010
Yeah.

520
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,190
Whether Lu Yan can stop being single

521
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,470
depends on tonight.

522
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,190
It's that important?

523
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,010
Captain Jiang,

524
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,300
thank you so much.

525
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,940
I'll get going then.

526
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,200
Go ahead.

527
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,010
You look nice.

528
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,230
Why aren't you wearing a skirt?

529
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,230
Isn't this your date?

530
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,530
You're the one who should wear the skirt.

531
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,000
What?

532
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,510
There he is.

533
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,910
Is your date

534
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,790
Wen?

535
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,590
No.

536
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,410
Then who is it?

537
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,420
You'll know when we get there.

538
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,540
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

539
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,670
Thanks

540
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,510
for coming all the way here.

541
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,460
Don't mention it.

542
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,630
It's cold—hurry up and get in the car.

543
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,640
Hurry, get in.

544
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,670
Leo...

545
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,910
Leo...

546
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,460
She doesn't like that one either.

547
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,850
Nice shot!

548
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,230
Nice shot!

549
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,930
Impressive.

550
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:47,540
Dad.

551
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,950
Calm down. Be careful not to strain yourself.

552
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,890
There are still a few.

553
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,750
Rock climber...

554
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,700
Rock climbing?

555
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,540
Rock climbing—

556
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,120
this suggests that the suspect

557
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,230
has very good physical fitness.

558
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,910
Maybe they're into sports.

559
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,460
What cases are you all

560
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,540
working on right now?

561
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,160
Well,

562
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,210
emotional disputes.

563
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,340
You're even handling

564
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,710
emotional disputes now?

565
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,430
A crime of passion.

566
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,540
A crime of passion.

567
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,230
Let me tell you.

568
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,300
Crimes of passion

may seem simple on the surface,

570
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,310
but the clues are actually quite complex.

571
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,910
You understand, right?

572
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,910
Goal, Dad.

573
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,700
Goal.

574
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,470
Let me tell you.

575
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,990
I came across a crime of passion a few years ago.

576
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:01,550

577
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,680
Stop it.

579
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,350
Hello, Mr. Wen.

580
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,450
Such an impressive place.

581

What is this?

582
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,220
Hello, please come in.

583
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:42,800
Let's go.

584
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:47,970
Oh my!

585
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,640
This place is really big.

586
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,460
So much wine.

587
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,230
Hurry up.

588
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,140
Thank you, Wen.

589
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,640
Wen.

590
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,340
Your clubhouse is really beautiful.

591
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,420
Did you design it yourself?

592
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,290
No.

593
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,440
I hired a designer

594
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,650
from abroad to design it.

595
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,480
Have a seat.

596
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,660
No, thanks.

597
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,530
I still have work calls to make.

598
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,640
Please take a look at the menu first.

599
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,160
Alright.

600
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,410
Order whatever you like; don't be shy.

601
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,230
Okay.

602
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:30,750
Yan.

603
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,450
This fried lamb chop

604
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,520
costs 432 yuan.

605
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,450
[Main Course Series]

606
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,710
So expensive!

607
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,540
Are you stupid? Look closely.

608
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,220
This is the calorie count.

609
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,100
They really have strict management for celebrities.

610
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:44,910
Seeing the calorie count,

611
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,890
I don't even want to eat it.

612
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,110
You're not a celebrity.

613
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,150
Just eat it.

614
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,280
I'm going to the restroom.

615
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,220
You're right.

616
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,460
Can I join you for a meal?

617
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,800
There's someone here.

618
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,340
Would you like to share the table with us?

619
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,290
You...

620
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,040
Are you Yu Bofeng?

621
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,250
Hello.

622
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,880
Hello.

623
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,110
This is the first time I've seen you in person.

624
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,230
I really like you.

625
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:25,940
Really.

626
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:29,850
Can I sit down?

627
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,550
Sure.

628
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,410
Please have a seat.

629
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,040
Oh my.

630
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,700
I must be dreaming.

631
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,180
Aren't you sitting down?

632
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,870
I'll sit down.

633
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,710
I heard from Mr. Wen

634
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,000
that you're also my fan, right?

635
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,130
Yes.

636
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,860
Ever since I debuted...

637
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,150
No.

638
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,740
I've liked you

639
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,090
since your debut.

640
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,750
Really.

641
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:57,730
Thank you.

642
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,950
Your face looks so small in person.

643
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,430
And you're really tall.

644
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,560
Your skin is so fair.

645
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,490
I also think you are beautiful.

646
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,700
And I heard from Mr. Wen

647
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,660
that your name is

648
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,310
Wang...

649
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,270
Qianqian.

650
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,550
Yes!

651
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,740
I'm Wang Qianqian.

652
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,200
Yes.

653
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,500
I didn't expect

654
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,840
you to know my name.

655
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,410
Of course I remember.

656
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,910
Because I think

657
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:26,790
this name sounds really nice.

658
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,920
You two started chatting already?

659
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,100
Are you happy?

660
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,080
Yan...

661
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,520
Did you arrange this for me?

662
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,100
Yes.

663
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,710
Oh my god.

664
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,150
Quick,

665
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,190
feel my heartbeat.

666
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,840
Are you happy?

667
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,510
I feel like

668
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,070
I can't breathe anymore.

669
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,510
Hello.

670
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:38,950
Hello.

671
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:39,750
Oh yeah.

672
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,390
Mr. Wen just told me that

673
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,610
he has a conference call to attend.

674
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,540
He asked us not to wait for him

675
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,390
and to eat first.

676
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,650
He really went to a meeting.

677
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,870
Are you going to eat with us?

678
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,030
You have to eat too, right?

679
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:48,990
I'm a human too,

680
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,230
of course I have to eat.

681
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,130
I've cut up my steak for you.

682
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,370
You can have mine.

683
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:11,990
Let's swap our portions.

684
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,110
I...

685
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,420
What's wrong? Why aren't you eating?

686
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,910
You...

687
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,320
Why are you staring at me?

688
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,020
Or,

689
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,030
is there anything else

690
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,870
you need help with?

691
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,710
No way.

692
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,920
I need to go out and calm down.

693
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,360
You...

694
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,570
I'm full.

695
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,430
You...

696
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,730
You're done?

697
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,160
I often skip dinner at night

698
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,360
to stay in shape.

699
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,590
It's fine. Tonight,

700
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,550
I'm just really happy

701
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,390
to be eating with you two.

702
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,190
Should I

703
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,830
cut your steak for you?

704
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,840
No need.

705
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,520
I'm more professional with the knife than you.

706
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,850
Thank you for today.

707
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,870
You're welcome.

708
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,440
Lu Yan!

709
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,790
Forget about how inappropriately

710
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,750
you're dressed,

711
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,480
but now you're meeting another man?

712
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,290
I'm not...

713
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,130
I'm not sick.

714
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,030
You know that.

715
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,350
You went with me to see the doctor.

716
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,290
Don't you remember?

717
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,250
Lu Yan!

718
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,060
Lu Yan.

719
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,250
It's you again.

720
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,150
You corrupted

721
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,250
my Qianqian.

722
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,190
Look,

723
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,630
I've been looking for her for so long.

724
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,090
You stalked her?

725
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,840
Do you know that's illegal?

726
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,060
Illegal?

727
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,670
She's mine.

728
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,580
I can do whatever I want with her.

729
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,220
Call the police.

730
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,180
Call the police!

731
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:47,770
Don't go.

732
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,550
You came here

733
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,730
to meet him, didn't you?

734
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,190
You, don't go!

735
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,370
What are you doing?

736
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,470
Don't go!

737
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,760
Lu Yan.

738
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,380
Is it illegal now?

739
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,380
I'll kill you.

740
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,900
If you kill her, you won't survive either.

741
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,960
Anyway, you don't want me anymore.

742
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,640
Go away!

743
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,580
Zhang Xiaohui!

744
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,320
Put down the knife.

745
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,300
I promise you that

746
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,510
I will never break up with you.

747
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:18,990
Okay?

748
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,040
Do you think

749
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,530
I still trust you guys now?

750
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,960
Really. Trust me.

751
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,730
I'm begging you, Zhang Xiaohui.

752
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,630
Let Lu Yan go first,

753
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,300
okay?

754
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,440
I'll do whatever you say.

755
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,590
I'll resign.

756
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,290
I'll resign, okay?

757
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,590
I'll stay at home with you.

758
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,470
I'll quit everything

759
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,590
and do whatever you say.

760
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,930
Please let Lu Yan go, okay?

761
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,450
They say women are cheap and shameless!

762
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,910
Shut up!

763
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,990
Qianqian and I will never be apart.

764
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,910
Yan.

765
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,200
Freeze! Police!

766
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,520
Put down the knife!

767
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,580
Don't move!

768
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,830
Are you okay?

769
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,750
Tell me

770
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,270
what exactly happened.

771
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,920
I'm the person in charge here.

772
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:23,980
Let me explain it

773
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,920
to you.

774
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,110
The wound isn't deep,

775
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,020
but make sure it stays dry

776
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,960
and avoid stretching it.

777
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,750
Thank you for today,

778
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:48,910
Wen.

779
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,670
Are you okay?

780
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,740
After all,

781
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,830
it's all my fault.

782
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,630
If I hadn't

783
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,790
asked you to come...

784
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,670
We're the ones causing you trouble.

785
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,900
I really didn't expect

786
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,860
that he'd install a tracker in her phone.

787
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,240
You see, he followed us all the way here.

788
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,480
It's also my fault for not thinking things through.

789
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,780
I can't believe such a thing happened

790
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,910
in my clubhouse.

791
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:20,950
Zhang Xiaohui

792
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,000
has been arrested by the police,

793
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,150
but we don't know how many days he'll be locked up.

794
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,710
Maybe we should talk to Dr. Han,

795
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,680
so you can study somewhere else

796
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,590
for a while.

797
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,640
No need.

798
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,030
I can't avoid it.

799
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,790
Qianqian and I will just be more careful.

800
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,580
Yan.

801
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,510
I've already explained everything clearly

802
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,390
to the police.

803
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,480
Wen,

804
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,590
I'm really sorry

805
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,550
for causing you trouble today.

806
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:45,750
It's okay.

807
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,720
As long as you're alright.

808
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,610
Well...

809
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,520
Yan, let's go home.

810
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,740
I'll give you a ride.

811
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,110
No need, Wen.

812
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,620
I've called a taxi.

813
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,170
We're leaving now.

814
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,270
Remember, don't let it get wet.

815
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,230
Don't lift heavy things.

816
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,650
Are you okay?

817
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,700
I'm fine.

818
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,380
Check on Zhang Xiaohui for me.

819
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,380
See if he has a criminal record.

820
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,290
I want him in prison—

821
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,700
the longer, the better.

822
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,370
Yes, Mr. Wen.

823
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:28,100
[Ninghai Anshan People's Hospital]

824
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,690
Here, I brought coffee for everyone.

825
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,510
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

826
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,550
-Thank you, Mr. Wen.
-Thank you, Wen.

827
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,390
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

828
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,180
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

829
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,750
You should visit Dr. Han more often.

830
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,550
He always says he misses you.

831
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,800
[Nurse Station]

832
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,200
Yeah,

833
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,870
I came this time

834
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,630
just to see Dr. Han

835
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,160
and everyone here.

836
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,670
Is it good?

837
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:41,980
Dr. Lu,

838
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,640
Mr. Wen is treating everyone to coffee.

839
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,620
Have you finished your work?

840
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,070
This smells really good.

841
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,870
How come you have time to come over today?

842
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,890
Thank you.

843
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:51,920
Have you eaten yet?

844
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,510
Not yet, I'm about to go now.

845
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:54,790
That's perfect.

846
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,440
I can use your meal card

847
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,690
since they've all finished eating.

848
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,130
Sure, I'll just drop off my things.

849
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,750
Okay.

850
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,140
Does your hand still hurt?

851
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,700
It doesn't hurt anymore.

852
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,530
It's much better.

853
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,520
I still really miss

854
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,450
the smell of the hospital.

855
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,350
Right?

856
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,950
Did you sleep well last night?

857
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,550
I was fine, actually.

858
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,100
It's just that Qianqian was really scared.

859
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
She needs to rest for a few days.

860
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,360
I've helped her take leave.

861
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,070
I've already asked someone

862
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,740
to help her look for a new place.

863
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,730
If they find one,

864
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,830
just have her move in as soon as possible.

865
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,440
Why trouble yourself with this?

866
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,550
I'll handle it for her.

867
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,890
I already feel guilty

868
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,090
about what happened yesterday.

869
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,520
Let me do something for her.

870
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,230
Okay.

871
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,310
But don't find her a place that's too expensive.

872
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,750
Don't worry, I understand.

873
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,220
By the way,

874
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,870
I still have to thank you.

875
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,230
Qianqian was so happy

876
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,650
to see her Prince Charming yesterday.

877
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,630
She was excited all night.

878
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,670
You're talking about

879
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,510
Yu Bofeng, right?

880
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,080
Yes.

881
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,500
Do you think he's handsome?

882
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,430
I think he's

883
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,330
okay,

884
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,670
but he's not really

885
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,650
my type.

886
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,429
What's your type?

887
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,880
I like them

888
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:14,830
taller,

889
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,050
more muscular—

890
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,199
the manly type.

891
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,850
It feels more comfortable being with them.

892
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,429
So you're talking about Logger Vick, right?

893
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,590
Logger Vick?

894
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,480
Logger Vick

895
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,469
is very responsible.

896
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,130
Logger Vick is so funny.

897
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:31,560
So who do you prefer, Briar or Bramble?

898
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,199
I prefer Bramble.

899
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,530
He seems a bit silly.

900
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,340
The dishes today are really good.

901
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,080
Here, have some braised pork.

902
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,739
Alright.

903
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,310
It looks good.

904
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:43,850
How is it?

905
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:44,900
Tasty.

906
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:45,750
Is it tender?

907
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,880
Not bad.

908
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,750
Mom, try some.

909
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,030
This.

910
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,340
Can you guys eat outside?

911
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,840
What's wrong?

912
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,690
Are you craving our food now?

913
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,000
I'll eat it so you can hear how amazing it is.

914
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,590
This braised pork is incredible.

915
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,270
The timing is absolutely perfect.

916
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,450
The skin is soft, tender, and pleasantly chewy.

917
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,400
The fatty meat practically melts in my mouth.

918
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,840
The lean meat isn't dry either.

919
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,270
It's salty and sweet, perfectly balanced.

920
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,710
Clearly, the perfect dish for rice.

921
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,300
Why is it so good?

922
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,440
It's incredible with rice,

923
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,780
and just as amazing on its own.

924
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,690
What's going on?

925
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:58,440
[Dr. Lu, your uncle is feeling a bit unwell. Can you come take a look?]

where it hurts?

939
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,640
Where exactly does it hurt?

940
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,990
I... I can't really say.

941
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,560
It would be best if Dr. Lu

942
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,610

948

If you do, then be quiet.

Sorry, Wen.

00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:42,910
Auntie,

964
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,850
how about I call

965
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,580
Uncle's attending physician over?

966
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,540
No need.

967
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,980
Just check on him yourself.

968
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,100
Has his blood pressure been measured?

969
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,420
It was checked this morning—normal.

970
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,470
Let me test it again.

971
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,010
It's a little high,

972
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,290
but still within the normal range.

973
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,250
It's high?

974
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,220
Let me take a look.

975
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,320
I asked Dr. Han this morning.

976
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,510
If his blood pressure is normal,

977
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,720
he can be discharged.

978
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,920
I can be discharged?

979
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,920
So soon?

980
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,420
What's the rush?

981
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,390
His blood pressure

982
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,390
is high.

983
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,790
What do you mean by "a little high"?

984
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,560
Exactly.

985
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,170
Besides, the wound on your neck hasn't healed yet.

986
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,300
Don't let it get worse.

987
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,760

Well,

991
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,630
I want to ask you something.

992
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,660
I heard from

993
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,230

I went on a date.

1000
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,190
Was it with your boyfriend?

1001
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,010
What does he do for a living?

1002
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,800
You need to ask everything clearly.

1003
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,240
You need to know his background inside and out.

1004
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,570
There are so many bad people out there

1005
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,480

1006
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,360

1008
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,010
you must be careful, understand?

1009
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,560
What does his family do?

1010
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,950
You need to know the details.

1011
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,030
Don't just dive into

1012
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,460

1013
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,390
alright?

1014
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,270
You'd better find someone

1015
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,130

1016
