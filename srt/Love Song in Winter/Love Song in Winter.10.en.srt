[Episode 10]

3
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,509
Nice shots,

4
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,110
Wang Qiang.

5
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,370
Wang Qiang!

6
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,390
Stop there!

7
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,000
Stop there!

8
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,530
Stop there!

9
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,470
Don't move!

10
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,630
Get down!

11
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,120
Let go of me!

12
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,150
-Get down!
-Let go of me!

13
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,160
Don't move!

14
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,280
Don't move!

15
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,070
Handcuff him and take him to the car.

16
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,390
Don't move!

17
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,590
Sure enough, at this critical moment,

18
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,390
it has to be Professor Yu who steps in.

19
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,690
How did you know it was him?

20
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,070
When I was touching up my makeup earlier,

21
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,270
I observed everyone.

22
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,670
What if he wasn't even

23
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,260
in this cafe?

24
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,440
That's possible too.

25
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,150
But

26
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,630
when I walked into the cafe,

27
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,030
everyone looked at me

28
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,240
except for him.

29
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,340
Alright.

30
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,170
You have a way with it.

31
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,930
Humans are visual animals,

32
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,180
especially men.

33
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,950
Men are more likely to choose younger,

34
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,770
healthy,

35
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,810
and energetic individuals as partners.

36
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,350
So men are more easily attracted to

37
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,460
beautiful and sexy appearances.

38
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,840
This is the nature of men.

39
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,150
Got it.

40
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,780
But this time,

41
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,150
really,

42
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,630
thank you so much

43
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,590
for helping us.

44
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,670
Professor Yu.

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,780
Captain Jiang.

46
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,740
What brings you here?

47
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,920
Not busy, huh?

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,960
The class just ended.

49
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,780
Is something wrong?

50
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,820
Yes, I have a small favor to ask.

51
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,490
What is it?

52
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,280
What do you mean by "us"?

53
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,190
I'm just helping you, Jiang Chengyi.

54
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,530
Here you go again.

55
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,000
Forget it.

56
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,870
I was just kidding.

57
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,110
I just wanted to see

58
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,400
if you're still thinking about

59
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,740
your ex-girlfriend.

60
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,269
I'll go take the guy back first.

61
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,529
Let's grab a meal sometime.

62
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,070
I don't have time to eat with you.

63
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,590
But if you have any psychological issues,

64
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,470
you can reach out to me.

65
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,720
Thanks.

66
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,750
Bye. See you.

67
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,470
Sir,

68
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,830
what have I done

69
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,740
to get arrested?

70
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,630
You're not admitting it, huh?

71
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,830
Admit what?

72
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,390
See for yourself.

73
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,940
It's too dark to see clearly.

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,940
Can't see clearly?

75
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,940
Here, look at this.

76
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,470
I can't even see the face...

77
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,770
Did you look carefully? And still, you say you can't see it?

78
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,470
I can't even see the face clearly.

79
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,710
How could it be me?

80
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,030
What about this one?

81
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,830
This is the one you bought, right?

82
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,010
Wang Qiang,

83
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,050
why did you follow that girl?

84
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,000
Which girl?

85
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,900
I don't understand what you're saying.

86
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,159
I'm talking to you properly now.

87
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,080
You'd better tell me everything you can.

88
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,280
Why were you following the girl

89
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,310
in the photo on your phone?

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,730
Was anyone directing you?

91
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,650
No one directed me.

92
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,280
I've never done

93
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,190
anything you're talking about.

94
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,000
We found a large amount of evidence

95
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,910
on your computer and phone.

96
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,710
There are numerous photos of women you've secretly taken,

97
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,350
records of trafficking,

98
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,040
and banned drugs

99
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,070
you've purchased.

100
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,390
How many years do you want to be sentenced to?

101
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,750
Let me ask you again.

102
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,420
Why were you

103
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,030
following that female doctor?

104
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,660
When I saw attractive girls,

105
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,640
I'd casually take their photos,

106
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,080
then edit their faces

107
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,550
onto explicit images

108
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,330
and

109
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,470
sell them online for money.

110
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,670
That day,

111
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,210
I happened to run into that female doctor.

112
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,600
I thought she looked good,

113
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,140
so I casually took a few photos of her.

114
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:43,990
But I haven't had the chance

115
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,110
to edit the photos yet.

116
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,530
They're still on my phone.

117
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,390
You can check them if you want,

118
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,040
sir.

119
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,010
I saw them.

120
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,550
So you were the one

121
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,390
in the alley that day.

122
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,110
Right?

123
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,880
What were you planning to do that day?

124
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,290
I saw that

125
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,390
no one was in the alley,

126
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,130
so I... I just wanted to…

127
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,510
take advantage of her.

128
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,430
Do you know her?

129
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,610
I don't know her.

130
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
I take so many photos every day.

131
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,280
How would I know who she is?

132
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,250
You don't know her.

133
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,190
Why did you repeatedly follow her?

134
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,100
I just thought she was attractive.

135

[Ninghai Anshan People's Hospital]

136
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,270
Yan.

137
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,610
This place is crowded.

138
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,400
I don't want to eat at the cafeteria.

139
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,350
Wen.

140
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,490
What brings you here?

141
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,870
I came to bring you

142
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,550
movie tickets.

143
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,600
What movie?

144
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,540
It's a movie produced by our company.

145
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,590
Tomorrow night at 7:30.

146
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,670
I'd like to have my friends over

147
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,670
to watch and critique the movie.

148
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,310
Wasn't this movie

149
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,970
awarded at a film festival before?

150
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,500
It was just a small award.

151
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,040
You're being too modest.

152
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,170
Will Feng be coming?

153
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,630
He's filming, so he probably can't make it.

154
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,340
Okay.

155
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,640
What do you think? Are you free?

156
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,480
Tomorrow, we're on the day shift,

157
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,060
so we should be able to go.

158
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,100
Great, then.

159
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,940
I'd like to thank you in advance

160
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,040
for coming.

161
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,070
I'll ask the driver

162
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,550
to pick you up tomorrow.

163
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,230
No need.

164
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,510
We'll just take the subway.

165
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:26,790
The subway?

166
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,070
Has the person been caught?

167
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,340
I believe

168
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,669
Captain Jiang will catch him.

169
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,110
Are you two

171
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,669
Nonsense.

172
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,720
Alright.

173
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,780
See you tomorrow.

174
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,909
Thank you.

175
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:44,580
You're welcome.

176
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,860
Bye.

Why don't you

178
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,470
ask Captain Jiang

179
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,430
to go with you?

180
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,340

182
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,590

aren't you?

186
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,190
What nonsense is that?

187
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,430
It's a great opportunity for you

188
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,510
to watch a movie together.

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,960
Don't you want to watch it?

190

Didn't we agree

191
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,790
to watch it together?

192
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,870
But Feng isn't involved in this.

193
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,710

I'm a true fan.

195
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,580
If I go to see other handsome guys,

196
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,470
I'll feel guilty.

197
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,140
I'll hit you. Believe it or not.

198
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,230
Can't you watch with me?

199
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,530
You've gone crazy chasing stars.

200
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,690
I'm not!

201
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:42,950
I want to eat this.

202
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,860
You can have all of it.

203
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,620
It is indeed unrequited love on my part.

204
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,510
But...

205
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,390
But you're different from me.

206
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,330
Mutual affection—

207
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,640
how rare it is.

208
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,150
You should cherish it

209
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,030
and create more chances to be alone together.

210

No.

The thing is...

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,390
I don't know

214
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,240
how the other person feels about me.

215
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,110
So,

216
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,620
that's even more reason to go watch the movie.

217
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,910
Watching a movie

218
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,260
is basically a date.

219

If he agrees to go with you,

220
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,720
what does it mean?

221
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,510
It means

222

he still has feelings for you.

What's wrong?

Didn't you watch movies

231
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,560
when you were together?

232
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,920
Really.

You know that, right?

238
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,860
You're a doctor,

00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,430
and he's a police officer.

240
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,070
At every moment,

241
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,750
we face numerous dangers

245

what the result is,

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,350

in this case.

275
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,790

I've got to live up

388
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,610
to my reputation as the king of gossip.

389
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,690
My goodness.

390
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,400
I'm speechless.

391
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,350
Do you know

392
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,250
why Matron Qiao

393
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,710
always ignores you?

394
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,990
Why?

395
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,230
Because

396
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,300
you talk too much!

397
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,870

Purse your lips.

401
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,160
Take a look.

402
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:05,760
Not bad.

I think it looks good.

404
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,540
It's quite natural.

What do you think?

406
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:08,819
Is it too red?

407
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,599
I personally think it's a bit too red.

408
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,550
The eye makeup

409
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,630
could be more intense.

410
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,270
As for the blush, it's actually unnecessary...

411
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,109
Why are you asking him?

412
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:17,750

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,990
I got the exchange spot.

577
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,130
I can go study abroad now.

578
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,770
You, study abroad?

579
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,610
You're just like your mom, a real handful.

580
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,230
My mom has always been good to you.

581
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,600
Has your mom been good to me?

582
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,550
Hasn't your mom been good to you too?

583
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,500
She's good to you,

584
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,730
so why doesn't she want you anymore?

585
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,790
She's good to you,

586
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,560
so why did she leave with someone else?

587
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,850
Remember,

588
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,950
I've been taking care of you

589
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,390
since you were little

590
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,750
and have raised you to this point.

591
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,950
I put you through college,

592
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,450
and now you want to leave me?

593
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,800
Listen.

594
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,700
You're not going anywhere.

595
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,640
If one day I don't want to live anymore,

596
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,440
you'll have to die with me!

597
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,430
Do you understand?

598
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,130
Get lost!

602
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,550
What are you doing?

603
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,640
Wen.

604
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,750
The sign over there says:

605
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,440
"Dangerous Water Depth."

606
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,380
You...

607
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,730
What's wrong with you?

608
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,380
Can you hold my umbrella?

609
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,110
I'll perform something for you.

610
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:16,990
Hold this for me.

611
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,170
Do you know how to skip stones?

612
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,740
Let me show you.

[Dangerous Water Depth, No Swimming]

614
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,160
I'm not good at it either,

615
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,790
but I just managed to hit two skips.

616
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,810
Did you see that?

617
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,910
Let me share

618
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,290
a little story with you.

619
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,920
Actually, I've been pretty dumb

620
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,960
all my life.

621
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,040
Like, really dumb.

622
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,670
How dumb was I?

623
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,640
Well,

624
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,630
I couldn't even memorize

625
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,550
the multiplication table.

626
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,710
My mom was so angry

627
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,710
that she chased me around to hit me.

628
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,870
But it didn't work.

629
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,970
I was still that dumb.

630
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,190
But later,

631
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,640
I learned a saying:

632
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,390
"A slow sparrow should make an early start."

633
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,570
I was willing to be that slow sparrow,

634
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,030
so I studied quietly and in secret.

635
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,120
And in the end,

636
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,420
I was the one

637
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,690
who got into Ninghai University.

638
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,310
I was so proud of myself.

639
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,440
But then, when I came to this school,

640
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,390
I found out that everyone around me

641
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,640
was better than me.

642
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,430
There were academic stars everywhere,

643
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,750
just like you.

644
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,990
Do you know what they call you

645
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:27,910
in our class?

646
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,830
They call you a genius.

647
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,070
Even Teacher Han is totally smitten by you.

648
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,790
He praises you every day at school—

649
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,930
both in class

650
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,950
and outside of class.

651
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,710
Your exercise book

652
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,350
has even been circulated among our batch.

653
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,750
I might not be as amazing

654
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,430
as you think.

655
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:44,840
You're being modest.

656
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,990
I know,

657
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,600
smart people like you,

658
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,990
born to be excellent,

659
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,970
are just like that.

660
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,000
You can't even see

661
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,110
how great the shine is

662
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,450
within you.

663
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,440
Are you feeling a bit happier now?

664
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,370
Look,

665
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,030
I'm so dumb,

666
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,460
but I still live happily.

667
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,540
Don't be upset, okay?

668
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,640
Let me secretly tell you

669
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,470
a little secret.

670
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,980
Actually,

671
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,760
a lot of people see you

672
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,160
as their target to catch up with.

673
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,720
Feeling a bit happier now?

674
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,690
Wen,

675
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,370
you're amazing.

676
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,350
Don't be unhappy.

677
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,440
I'm off to evening self-study now.

678
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,620
See you.

679
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,150

680
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,100

684
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,610
What are you thinking about?

685
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,790
Nothing much.

686
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,910
Just...

687
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,410
Zoning out, throwing little stones.

688
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,740
Do you like lakes?

689
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,790
I feel that looking at a lake

690
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,830
can make the heart very peaceful.

691
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,310
I really want to visit

692
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,750
Lake Baikal.

693
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,320
I've heard it's called

694
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,790
the "Pearl of Siberia."

695
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,390
Coincidentally, Teacher Han and I

696
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,820
are going to Russia for an academic conference

697

00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,370
If I have time,

699
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,900
I can go take a look at it for you.

700
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,380
Really?

701
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,450
Then take my eyes with you.

702
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,520

Welcome, everyone.

Thank you.

Good evening, everyone.

743
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,210
I'm very glad you could come and watch the film.

744
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,500
Actually, we should have the director speak first.

745
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,170
Director, please go ahead.

746
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,010
No.

747
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,900
What I want to say is,

748
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,690
first of all, thank you all for your support.

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,090

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,570
Mr. Wen's own story.

752
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,490
I think it should be Mr. Wen who shares it.

753
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,550
Don't you all agree?

754
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,950
Yes.

[Premiere in Ninghai]

756
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,390
Yes, Mr. Wen.

757
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,320
And as we saw

758
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,190
just now

759
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,470
in the film,

760
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,430
the male lead has a segment about

761
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,910
the bittersweet memories of his first love.

762
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,270
The kind of regret from a love that couldn't be realized

763
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,620
was very sincere,

764
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,530
especially in the scene where the girl gave him an umbrella.

765
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,000
I believe many of you here

766
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,670
are as curious

as I am,

768
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,570
and I'd like to ask Mr. Wen,

769
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,990
was this scene

770
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,560
based on

771
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,620
your own real experience?

772
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:54,870
Yes.

773
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,390
Okay.

774
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,980
In the heavy rain,

775
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,220
the girl gave the boy

776
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,230
an umbrella,

777
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,910
and her radiant smile

778
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,110
became something

779
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,270
the boy would remember for a lifetime.

780
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,030
I remember this shot

781
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,460
was handled very beautifully.

782
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,930
So, I'd like to ask Mr. Wen,

783
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,760
is there anything else

784
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,110
you would like to share with us?

785
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,060
In my university days,

786
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,280
there was

787
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,990
once a girl who,

788
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,430
on a rainy day,

789
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,940
unknowingly

790
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,190
appeared in front of me

791
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,930
and gave me warmth.

792
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,970
Is this girl

793
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,990
your life partner now?

794
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,740
Not yet,

795
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,260
but I will work hard for it.

796
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:38,750
Alright.

797
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,340
Let's wish Mr. Wen the best of luck,

798
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,790
and let's give a round of applause

799
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,630
for the success of the new film,

800
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,940
hoping it achieves even more

801
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,560
in domestic awards.

802
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,130
Would you like to go to the bathroom?

803
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,190
No.

804
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,270
Then wait for me.

805
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:00,700
Okay.

806
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,750
Yan.

807
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,190
How's the date

808
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:09,960
with Officer?

809
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,440
You're so busy that you don't even have time to reply to me.

810
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,790
You must be really happy, huh?

811
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,830
We were watching a movie,

812
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,510
okay?

813
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,900
How was I supposed to reply to you?

814
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:25,990
You're here too.

815
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,570
The movie was really good

816
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,420
It was enjoyable.

817
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,740
Thank you.

818
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,790
If you like it,

819
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,550
please help us

820
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,270
promote the movie to others.

821
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,310
Sure.

822
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,020
I'll go first.

823
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:45,870
I'm done.

824
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,370
I'm thinking of

825
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,880
saying goodbye to Wen.

826
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,190
-Tell him we're leaving first.
-Sure.

827
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,270
Wen, we're heading out now.

828
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,320
Everything went smoothly today.

829
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,190
Congratulations.

830
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,240
Are you hungry?

831
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:00,450
I'm not hungry,

832
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,180
but I feel like going for a walk.

833
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,220
Did you drive?

834
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:04,950
We can walk;

835
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,040
it's not far.

836
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,800
Let's walk.

["Half Love"]

838
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,790
What do you think of

839
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,390
today's movie?

840
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,880
I think it was really good.

841
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,560
It felt like he put a lot of effort into it.

842
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,690
He really did.

843
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,140
All those years ago,

844
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,770
a girl gave him an umbrella,

845
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,110
and he still remembers it,

846
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,280
even turning it into a film.

[Wang Qianqian] [Answer] [Decline]

848
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,430
Is there someone

849
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,340
who you've been thinking about for so many years?

850
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:03,920
Yes.

851
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,310
Have you been alone

852
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,060
all these years?

853
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,310
What about you?

854
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,160
Me?

855
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,110
I've pretty much been the same,

856
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,380
around the same.

857
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,580
[Wang Qianqian] [Answer] [Decline]

858
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,950
Fine.

859
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,220
You'd dated so many after me?

860
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,550
Things seem to be going well for everyone.

861
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,060
You must've had many suitors too.

862
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,270
Of course.

863
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,160
They'd have to line up from here

864
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,670
to all the way over there.

865
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,310
What are you doing?

866
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:55,600
Lining up.

867
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,550
As I can see,

868
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,060
there's no one here today.

869
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,490
Can you let me cut in line?

870
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,470
I still have to work tomorrow.

871
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,670
Stop messing around.

872
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,830
I'm going upstairs.

873
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,560
I'm heading back now.

874
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,330
Lu Yan.

875
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,340
Is the CCTV

876
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,490
running low on battery?

877
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,290
Let me check for you.

878
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:20,820
You...

879
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,700
You can sit down.

880
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:23,920
Should I put your things here?

881
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,480
Okay.

882
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,380
Why are you standing there?

883
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,820
Do you want something to drink?

884
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,100
What do you have?

885
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,910
Water.

886
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,600
Let me see.

887
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,400
Water.

888
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,480
Your place has a nice view.

889
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,700
Not bad, right?

890
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,080
Whenever

891
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,380
I'm feeling down,

892
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,110
I just stand there and look outside.

893
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,470
Lu Yan,

894
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,820
I want to tell you something.

895
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,600
Actually,

896
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,730
all these years,

897
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,130
other than you,

898
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,700
I've never loved anyone else.

899
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,770
What you just said,

900
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,010
about one, two, three, four, five, six—

901
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,590
weren't they people?

902
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,280
Then what you just said,

903
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,670
about the whole street lining up,

904
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,190
is that true?

905
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,110
All these years,

♫As the city flickers♫

angry,

911
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:47,480

♫And you, who loves to smile♫

913
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,170

that you don't want to see me at all.

923
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,250
