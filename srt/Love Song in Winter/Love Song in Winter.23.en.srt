[Episode 23]

3
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,789
Dr. Lu,

4
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:52,930
thank you for today.

5
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,870
Will it delay your work?

6
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,590
No.

7
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,240
I'm off today.

8
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,590
I haven't skated for a long time.

9
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,250
Just think of it as Xiaoman playing with me.

10
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,660
Thank you so much.

11
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,390
Listen to Dr. Lu later,

12
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:02,870
understand?

13
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,470
Okay.

14
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,060
Xiaoman.

15
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,870
Are you ready?

16
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,790
Yes.

17
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,350
Let's go.

18
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,039
Go.

19
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,890
Keep going.

20
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,600
Keep going and you're halfway there.

21
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,630
Just skate a bit more. You'll get it.

22
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,550
Xiaoman.

23
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,470
Mr. Wen!

24
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,160
Why are you here?

25
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,790
I'm sorry, Xiaoman.

26
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,470
I was too busy yesterday,

27
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,400
but I took

28
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,670
the earliest flight today.

29
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,550
Are you angry?

30
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,240
No.

31
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:23,920
Ms. Lu

32
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,230
played with me for a long time.

33
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,880
Mr. Wen,

34
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,230
can you skate too?

35
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,980
I'm not good at skating.

36
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,660
Can you...

37
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,800
Can you hold my hand?

38
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,829
Sure.

39
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,190
All three of us can skate together.

40
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,440
Thank you.

41
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,030
It's okay.

42
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,070
Let them play.

43
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,070
Mr. Wen, look, I can skate!

44
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,550
Yes.

45
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,360
You're skating fast.

46
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,630
Yes.

47
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,090
You're really fast now.

48
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,140
Are you happy today?

49
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,070
Yes.

50
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,150
I saw a kid

51
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,950
who was amazing.

52
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,550
He kept spinning inside.

53
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,160
Come.

54
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,790
Say thank you.

55
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,580
Thank Ms. Lu

56
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,260
and Mr. Wen.

57
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,240
Thank you, Ms. Lu.

58
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,230
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

59
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,520
Thank you for today.

60
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,840
Ms. Lu, Mr. Wen,

61
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,310
can we

62
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,760
play again in the future?

63
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,510
Xiaoman.

64
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,540
If you go back and listen to your mom

65
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,980
to eat well, exercise well,

66
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,110
and do check-ups,

67
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,940
Ms. Lu and I

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,880
will take you out.

69
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,720
Okay?

70
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,310
Really,

71
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,270
Ms. Lu?

72
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,120
I'm in the hospital.

73
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,450
When you go for a check-up,

74
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,360
I'll wait for you in the hospital.

75
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay?

76
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,910
Sure.

77
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,870
Alright.

78
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,830
It's almost time.

79
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,790
We're leaving.

80
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:34,950
-Thank you.
-I’ll get someone to give you a ride.

81
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,680
No need.

82
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,900
We can go back by ourselves.

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,680
It's okay, miss.

84
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,930
Mr. Wen has arranged everything.

85
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,800
Let me see you off.

86
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,120
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,970
Thank you.

88
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,600
Bye.

89
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,300
-Bye.
-Bye.

90
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,020
Bye.

91
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,950
I'm going home too.

92
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,570
Lu Yan.

93
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,909
It's still early.

94
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,800
Let's have dinner together.

95
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,400
I agreed to go home and eat with Jiang Chengyi.

96
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,360
See you.

97
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,380
Lu Yan.

98
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:05,990
Actually,

99
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,310
I have a question for you.

100
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,770
Jiang Chengyi and I are the same age.

101
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,270
Why don't you call him

102
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,420
your senior?

103
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,560
I never thought about this.

104
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,340
Maybe I'm used to it.

105
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,480
Do you know

106
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,790
how long we've known each other for?

107
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,470
A long time.

108
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,270
Ten years and three months.

109
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,230
We met each other during the Mid-Autumn Festival

110
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,790
in 2014.

111
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,550
I knew you

112
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,270
before Jiang Chengyi knew you.

113
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,530
We were from the same department.

114
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:55,990
We graduated under

115
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,790
the same mentor.

116
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,870
Jiang Chengyi left you

117
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,000
for eight years.

118
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,560
You lost contact,

119
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,540
while we met often.

120
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,990
We should be

121
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,790
more familiar with

122
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,070
and know each other better, right?

123
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,670
Senior.

124
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,680
Perhaps

125
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,750
you don't have to

126
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,750
call me senior.

127
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,910
I...

128
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,790
I...

129
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,390
I don't understand what you mean.

130
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,080
But

131
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,650
I've always

132
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,270
viewed you as my senior.

133
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,710
Lu Yan.

134
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,740
There's something

135
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,950
I forgot to tell you.

136
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,960
Jiang Chengyi and I have officially made up.

137
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,260
I'm leaving.

138
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,760
The cunning rabbit has three caves.

139
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,720
Li Ruonan has this den too.

140
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,470
Yue.

141
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,370
What's going on?

142
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,600
It's where Li Ruonan lived,

143
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,550
but

144
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,950
besides these daily necessities,

145
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,580
there are not many valuable clues.

146
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,409
What about the phone?

147
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,230
No.

148
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,740
There's only one power bank.

149
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,549
We're too late.

150
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,910
Here, tracing team.

151
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,830
Please work hard

152
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,140
and search this place again.

153
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,480
Let's focus on

154
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,630
all traces from people

155
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,430
other than Li Ruonan.

156
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,030
Okay?

157
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,790
Come on.

158
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,830
Okay.

159
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,150
[Anshan, Ninghai Public Security
Criminal Investigation Unit]

160
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,850
It seems that

161
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,160
someone came

162
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,310
before us.

163
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,510
What should we do, Senior?

164
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,230
Next...

165
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,590
Since they

166
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,460
dared to take the phone,

167
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,670
that means there's someone

168
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,670
behind Li Ruonan.

169
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,590
Let them come back first.

170
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,830
It's okay.

171
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,820
All of them?

172
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,900
All of them.

173
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,750
Captain Jiang,

174
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,400
this is the file from Deng Man's case that you wanted.

175
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,390
Okay, thank you.

176
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,030
Deng Man?

177
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,070
Jiang Chengyi,

178
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,720
I want to tell you something.

179
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,590
What is it?

180
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,180
Well,

181
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,440
didn't I take Xiaoman

182
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,080
skating today?

183
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,230
Then,

184
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,120
Wen Peng said he wouldn't go,

185
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,390
but he ended up going.

186
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,310
He asked you out on purpose.

187
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,870
I thought he was taking Xiaoman.

188
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,120
But he asked you out instead.

189
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,390
Right?

190
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,360
So, then what?

191
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,190
What do you want to say?

192
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,140
Then...

193
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,630
Then he just told me

194
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,910
some

195
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,230
ambiguous things.

196
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,670
I think he was

197
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,730
a little emotional.

198
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,590
Emotional?

199
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,790
What ambiguous things?

200
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,830
He just said

201
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,200
he wanted to take me out for dinner.

202
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,740
What's wrong with that?

203
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,740
What else?

204
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,630
What else did he say

205
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,510
that felt ambiguous?

206
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,560
He said

207
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,340
not to call him senior.

208
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,670
What should you call him then?

209
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,470
Pengpeng?

210
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,040
Pengpeng?

211
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,280
Call him Wen Peng.

212
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,320
I'll call him by his full name.

213
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,390
I think it's suitable.

214
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,340
I think it's better

215
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,550
to use his full name.

216
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,610
Alright.

217
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,850
And then I told him immediately

218
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,630
that we've made up.

219
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,880
Then I turned around and left.

220
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,840
Really?

221
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,020
So decisive.

222
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,170
I never looked back.

223
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,560
And then?

224
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,070
Nothing else happened.

225
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:14,990
I didn't even look back.

226
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,340
He called my name, but I didn't look back.

227
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,350
You should know

228
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,570
what he meant, right?

229
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,080
I know now.

230
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,080
Then, do you know what to do

231
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,660
in the future?

232
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,630
I know.

233
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,110
Give me a hug.

234
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,950
Give me a hug.

235
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,650
Go back first.

236
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,590
We'll talk about it later.

237
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,500
Jiang Chengyi and I have officially made up.

238
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,790
Come in.

239
00:11:59,310 --> 00:11:59,970
Mr. Wen,

240
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,190
someone named Yu Zheng…

241
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:01,950
Mr. Wen.

242
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,650
Mr. Wen,

243
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,680
I’m sorry

244
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,890
for disturbing you so late.

245
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,710
No,

246
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,670
it's just a small thing.

247
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,660
Have a seat.

248
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,790
Okay.

249
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,600
What brings you here

250
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,190
at this hour?

251
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,440
I'm here

252
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,750
for Yu Bofeng.

253
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,210
You know,

254
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,550
as a superstar,

255
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,470
he attracts

256
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,860
too much attention in school.

257
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,220
Our students

258
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,270
all got in

259
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,630
with their own abilities.

260
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,480
As an artist,

261
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,750
I think Yu Bofeng

262
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,990
has privileged treatment.

263
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,750
He can simply come and go

264
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,910
as he pleases.

265
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,160
This makes it seem

266
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,330
a bit unfair

267
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,020
to the other students.

268
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,740
The interview is over anyway.

269
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,470
About

270
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,460
Yu Bofeng

271
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,400
attending classes…

272
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,590
I understand what you mean.

273
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,390
I'll tell him then.

274
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,670
Sorry

275
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,740
for the trouble.

276
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,870
It's okay.

277
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,430
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

278
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,740
Professor Yu, are you here

279
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,600
for personal

280
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,670
or business matters?

281
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,150
Is there any difference?

282
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,150
You came last time

283
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,960
because of Wang Qianqian's case.

284
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,560
Because

285
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,200
businessmen like us

286
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,470
are particularly afraid of troubles.

287
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,240
It seems that you

288
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,650
have a prejudice

289
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,790
against the police.

290
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,010
No, no.

291
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,950
That's not so.

292
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,910
It's just that

293
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,330
it's better safe than sorry.

294
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,390
Please understand.

295
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,510
I think that you

296
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,710
worry too much.

297
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,710
I'm here today

298
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,030
to talk to you about

299
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,470
Yu Bofeng's suspension.

300
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,440
Speaking of Yu Bofeng,

301
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,870
he surprised me.

302
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,990
During this period,

303
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,070
not only has he worked hard

304
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,470
but also made some progress.

305
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,830
In the recent practice questions,

306
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,040
there was a very difficult

307
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,510
criminal psychology question.

308
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,990
He actually got it right.

309
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,590
I even joked with him

310
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,790
that those who can answer this question

311
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,220
either learned criminal psychology before

312
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,070
or

313
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,750
actually are

314
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,950
serial killers.

315
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,170
Actually,

316
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,590
I answered that question for him.

317
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,980
To be honest,

318
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,240
when I was in college,

319
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,190
I took a criminal psychology class,

320
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,880
but I was not gifted,

321
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,030
so I gave up.

322
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,740
That question

323
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,510
left a deep impression.

324
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,120
What a coincidence, Mr. Wen.

325
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,840
The mental state of a researcher

326
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,670
also helps me

327
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,940
manage my artists.

328
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,000
As you know,

329
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,040
we have to manage people in this industry

330
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,190
and people are the hardest to manage.

331
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,790
So, learning more

332
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,440
is good

333
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,860
for both me and my company.

334
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,970
Yes.

335
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,110
Your industry

336
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,290
must be very stressful.

337
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,810
You have to meet a lot of people

338
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,100
and talk about many things.

339
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,300
Reading more psychology books

340
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:14,890
is good.

341
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,850
It's very helpful toward stabilizing

342
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,200
one's emotions.

343
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,800
You're right, Professor Yu.

344
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,850
I won't disturb you further.

345
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,550
In the future,

346
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,350
if you need

347
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,360
my help,

348
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,400
contact me any time.

349
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:35,710
Okay.

350
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,480
Sorry for the trouble.

351
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,470
No need to see me out.

352
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,310
Bye.

353
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,190
Bye.

354
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,950
No, no, no.

355
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,710
Yue.

356
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,710
Look who's back.

357
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,360
Who is this?

358
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,870
Who is back?

359
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,450
[Anshan Criminal Investigation]

360
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,340
Quickly put me down!

361
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,030
Our hero is back.

362
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:11,990
Professor Yu, Captain Jiang.

363
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:12,780
How is your recovery?

364
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,380
I'm fine.

365
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,410
I can work anytime.

366
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,670
You can work anytime?

367
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,780
Stop messing with him.

368
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,960
No hurry.

369
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,440
Everyone,

370
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,270
put your work aside.

371
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,700
It's mealtime.

372
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,870
Let's eat together.

373
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,230
Great!

374
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:25,870
Okay, Captain Jiang.

375
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,810
[Anshan Criminal Investigation]

376
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,700
Thank you, Captain Jiang.

377
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,510
If you didn’t get stabbed,

378
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,310
we wouldn't have

379
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,030
this meal.

380
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,510
Let's go.

381
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,230
By the way,

382
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,360
I have something to ask you.

383
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,430
What's wrong?

384
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,350
Wen Peng

385
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,830
is your college classmate, right?

386
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,510
We are

387
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,670
schoolmates.

388
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,240
We weren't in the same department.

389
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,910
What's wrong?

390
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,110
I don't think he's simple.

391
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,110
Why not?

392
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,030
Do you have time

405

there's no need to review the contract.

Indeed.

00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,540
Their food

586
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,800
is very delicious.

587
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,870
I used to come here at least once

588
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,890
every week.

589
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,620
I always came at closing

590
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,910
when no one was around.

591
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,510
This way, you wouldn't

592
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,470
get spotted by fans easily,

593
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,200
right?

594
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,040
It's not easy for you actors.

595
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,870
Have a seat.

596
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,990
Sir,

597
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,490
can you

598
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,640
be a bit faster today?

599
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,360
So slow.

600
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,750
Coming.

601
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,190
Sorry.

602
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,310
Thank you.

603
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,070
Sorry.

604
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,640
Thank you.

605
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,790
Enjoy your meal.

606
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,330
I thought I could eat and drink

607
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,280
something good

608
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,310
with a superstar.

609
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,320
You just brought me to eat noodles?

610
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,550
Their noodles are really delicious.

611
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,030
The owner used to run a street stall,

612
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,550
but now he has such a big storefront.

613
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,460
There must be a reason why.

614
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,380
More importantly, his noodles

615
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,270
are like what my mom made.

616
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,400
When I was little,

617
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,470
she always gave me

618
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,110
her egg.

619
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,540
So spicy.

620
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,400
You can't eat spicy food?

621
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,710
I can. I can.

622
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,910
Next time, I'll tell the owner

623
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,110
not to put peppers.

624
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,990
But, seriously,

625
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,380
his noodles

626
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,980
taste different from other restaurants.

627
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,030
Of course.

628
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:50,960
When I was young,

629
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,830
my family was poor

630
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,570
and we didn't have air conditioning.

631
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,140
My mom

632
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,240
would make cold noodles

633
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,020
in the summer

634
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,030
to cool me down.

635
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,330
I told my mom,

636
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,550
"When I grow up,

637
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,510
I'll definitely make a fortune.

638
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,940
By then,

639
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,520
I'll buy a big house

640
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,330
with air conditioning in the summer

641
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,270
and underfloor heating in the winter."

642
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,650
Then, you could

643
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,110
have cold noodles happily.

644
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,310
That's great.

645
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,970
You can't eat spicy food.

646
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:20,940
Add some vinegar.

647
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,980
More.

648
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,200
You like vinegar this much?

649
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,010
Girls love vinegar.

650
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,910
Hello, what’s wrong?

651
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,520
Mr. Wen,

652
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,230
the PR department just contacted me.

653
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,920
Bofeng was photographed

654
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,030
with a woman

655
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,790
this afternoon.

656
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,230
The photos have already

657
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,290
spread on the Internet.

658
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,700
Send me the photos.

659
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,830
[Assistant Ze]

660
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,820
Have the PR company come to work immediately.

661
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,950
Within half an hour,

662
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,710
all the photos

663
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,810
must be taken down.

664
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,470
And then check

665
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,540
the source of the photos.

666
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,600
Ask them

667
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,350
how much they want and pay them.

668
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,070
Okay, Mr. Wen.

669
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,130
[Outpatient]

670
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,110
Check this information

671
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,960
later.

672
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,510
I think you should check on

673
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,290
Bed 19 more.

674
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,940
Make sure he changes the dressing promptly.

675
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,550
Take a look.

676
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,040
Okay.

677
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,910
I'll confirm it.

678
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,550
Yes.

679
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,530
He just got the anesthesia.

680
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,020
Check on him more.

681
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:10,670
Okay.

682
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,600
Lu Yan.

683
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,070
Are you free?

684
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,700
I have something to tell you.

685
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,080
Sure.

686
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,790
You resigned?

687
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,210
I plan to

688
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,000
leave Ninghai.

689
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,470
Is it

690
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,110
because of Ding Jing?

691
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,740
No.

692
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,150
Actually, Uncle and Auntie

693
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,070
are willing to help us.

694
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,850
But I don't want to live

695
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,230
by receiving favors anymore.

696
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,670
Actually, I've followed

697
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,390
Ding Jing since college

698
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,800
because she could give me

699
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,790
a lot of benefits.

700
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,540
She even found me my job.

701
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,600
But

702
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,390
I thought about it.

703
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,840
It seems that I've never tried

704
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,070
to venture out on my own.

705
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,830
Maybe I'll be better than before.

706
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,430
I believe you.

707
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,270
You'll be better than now.

708
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,630
Lu Yan,

709
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,820
there is something

710
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,950
I've been hesitant

711
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,830
to tell you.

712
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,710
But I thought that

713
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,710
since I’m leaving,

714
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,390
I'll tell you

715
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,390
everything now.

716
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,400
Actually, back then,

717
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,220
I knew a little about

718
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,550
Ding Jing and Deng Man back then.

719
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:15,670
I knew

720
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,130
you're sensible.

721
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,550
It's good.

722
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,920
Don't worry.

723
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,140
Once this is done,

724
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,430
I will destroy all the videos

725
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,910
in front of you.

726
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,880
What do you want me to do?

727
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,960
It's very simple.

728
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,120
If you have time,

729
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,380
go to the basketball court more often.

730
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,100
Watch Jiang Chengyi play basketball

731
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,920
and slowly alienate Lu Yan.

732
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,340
Find a chance

733
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,410
and have her give Jiang Chengyi to you.

734
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,120
If Lu Yan

735
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,270
is shameless and refuses,

736
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,530
you should confess to Jiang Chengyi.

737
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,020
Do you understand?

738
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,970
What do you want for dinner?

739
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,370
I'll treat you to something expensive.

740
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,920
What made you

741
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,310
so happy?

742
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,710
By the way,

743
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,300
what were you two talking about?

744
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,520
Isn't she Lu Yan's good friend?

745
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,670
Good friend?

746
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,870
Then Lu Yan's good days

747
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,170
are coming to an end.

748
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,370
Why?

749
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,760
Because she and Jiang Chengyi

750
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,300
are about to break up.

751
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,660
What do you mean?

752
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,310
Did you think of

753
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,430
a good idea?

754
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,050
I won't have to do anything this time.

755
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,650
She'll handle it for me.

756
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,440
She...

757
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,330
You mean

758
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,190
Deng Man?

759
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,240
Why her?

760
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,170
Because...

761
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,680
she has an unspeakable secret.

762
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:05,850
Come on.

763
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,970
What are you waiting for?

764
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,660
Jing.

765
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,690
Do you know what happened?

766
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,130
How would I know?

767
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,800
Just say it.

768
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,520
Deng Man

769
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,610
committed suicide.

770
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,000
What do you mean?

771
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,230
Deng Man committed suicide!

772
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:25,870
She...

773
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,920
She... She's dead.

774
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:30,920
Dead?

775
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,470
Jing.

776
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,260
Did you say something

777
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,340
to her that day?

778
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,710
I saw you talking to her.

779
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:35,510
Why would I

780
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,660
talk to her?

781
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,670
I'm warning you. Don't talk nonsense.

782
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,380
Jing, where are you going?

783
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,290
Jing.

784
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,980
Hello, Dad.

785
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,560
Pick me up!

786
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,530
Actually, I heard

787
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,930
what they said.

788
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,470
But I didn't dare to tell Ding Jing.

789
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,600
Later,

790
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,440
I didn't dare to tell you either.

791
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,790
Why?

792
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,380
When we were at school,

793
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,320
at the beginning,

794
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,330
Ding Jing forced me

795
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,540
to bully Deng Man.

796
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,060
But later,

797
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,050
to make Ding Jing happy,

798
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,910
I also took the initiative

799
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,190
to bully Deng Man.

800
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,110
Clean it up.

801
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,580
Okay.

802
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,590
I really hate

803
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,790
how I was.

804
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:33,830
So,

805
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,350
I decided to make this secret

806
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,030
rot inside me.

807
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,800
But you saved me.

808
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,320
I know

809
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,800
you really want to know

810
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,780
the truth of Deng Man's suicide.

811
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,870
If I

812
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,520
had a good friend like you,

813
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,070
that would be great.

814
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,000
Friends

815
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,150
cherish each other.

816
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,790
Anything else?

817
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,139
Tell me everything.

818
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,590
What was in the video?

819
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,670
What secret?

820
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,510
I really don't know

821
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,960
anything else.

822
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,510
If Ding Jing didn't want to tell me,

823
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,570
I wouldn't take the initiative to ask either.

824
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,110
I didn't want to get myself involved.

825
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:27,780
What about Ding Jing?

826
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,830
What else did she know?

827
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,150
I don't think she knew anything else.

828
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,960
Ding Jing has died.

829
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,429
I have nothing

830
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,510
to hide now.

831
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,150
Lu Yan.

832
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,159
I'm sorry.

833
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,240
Senior.

834
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:11,830
You're back.

835
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,470
You’re back.

836
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,940
Captain Jiang.

837
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:13,520
Captain Jiang.

838
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,390
Captain Jiang.

839
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,260
Captain Jiang.

840
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,050
You’re back at the right time.

841
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,930
Look at this.

842
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,770
What's wrong?

843
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,510
We just checked

844
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,190
Ding Jing's call records again.

845
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,560
We discovered that before,

846
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,800
we always put our attention

847
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,960
in the three days before

848
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,950
and after her murder.

849
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,190
Just now,

850
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,150
Liu Hao expanded the range

851
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,810
and found a number

852
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,040
that Ding Jing also contacted.

853
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:40,460
[Zhou Zhicheng]

854
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,220
Coach Zhou.

855
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,240
So Ding Jing

856
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,310
used a video

857
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,350
to threaten Deng Man.

858
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,070
Video. Want water?

859
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,230
Do you know

860
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,150
what the content was?

861
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,790
No.

862
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,630
Liu Yujie doesn’t know

863
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,680
what it is either.

864
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:54,870
According to

865
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,870
our previous experience,

866
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,230
female college students

867
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,140
are usually threatened

868
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,020
by sexual videos.

869
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,820
But did Deng Man

870
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,950
have this problem?

871
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,750
Or,

872
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,350
could Deng Man have been

873
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,750
threatened with anything else?

874
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,760
Do you know?

875
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,110
I can't think of anything

876
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,870
even if you ask me to.

877
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,410
I have a question.

878
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,070
Have you been in touch with Coach Zhou lately?

879
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,340
Coach Zhou?

880
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,110
I looked for him once before.

881
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,430
When?

882
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,240
Well...

883
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,630
When we quarreled

884
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,820
at the library.

885
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,150
After reading "Hiroshima Mon Amour,"

886
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,510
I thought

887
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,630
to ask him about Deng Man.

888
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,590
In the end...

889
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,080
What did he say?

890
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,280
He said

891
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,760
Deng Man confessed to you before.

892
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,060
Deng Man confessed to me?

893
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,790
Why didn't I know?

894
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,520
That's what he told me.

895
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,710
Deng Man and I

896
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,390
only met a few times before.

897
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,550
Once, she came to find me

898
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,520
when I

899
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,790
returned to the dorm.

900
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,630
Jiang Chengyi.

901
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,180
What are you doing here?

902
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,610
I need to talk to you.

903
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,550
Go ahead.

904
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,010
Tell me.

905
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,000
Are you looking for Lu Yan?

906
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,110
I don't want to see her.

907
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,470
Did you two fight?

908
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,260
What happened then?

909
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,630
Well...

910
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,070
Come on. I'll walk you back.

911
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,470
Let's go.

912
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,490
No need.

913
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,200
Go back.

914
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,160
By the way,

915
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,510
don't tell her

916
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,080
I came to you today.

917
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,110
But she didn't manage

918
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,190
to say anything.

919
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,250
Then what do you mean?

920
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,350
Do you think

921
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,470
Coach Zhou is lying?

922
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,230
I don't know either.

923
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,810
I'll find a chance to ask him.

I didn't expect

929
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,990
things would be so serious.

930

932
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,400
I'll apologize.

933
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,030
I'll bear the loss

934

to the company.

935
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,660

936

942
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,670
may have some losses.

950

00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,550
Let me ask you something.

974
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,630
Did you work

975
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,870
in the tumor department

976
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:47,660
for a while?

977
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,170
Yes.

978
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,470
They sent me there to learn

979
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,840
for more than half a year.

980
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:54,920
What's wrong?

981
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,480
Can you check a case for me?

982
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,660
The patient's name is Zhou Zhicheng.

983
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,320
I found him.

984
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,420
This patient is quite rich.

985
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,210
They're all imported medicines.

986
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,480
Yes.

987
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:24,010
[Three times a day] [Twice a day]

988
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,120
You can't afford this without

989
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,990
a few hundred thousand a year.
