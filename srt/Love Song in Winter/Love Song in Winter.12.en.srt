it could be a coincidence.

Wang Qianqian was probably already dead.

366
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,670
It's impossible for her to send the message at that moment.

367
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,930
If the murderer

377
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,790
then his motive is clear.

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,330
Is there any other possibility?

384
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,010
This is also just speculation.

404
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,230

Matron Qiao.

579
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,860
Why are you here?

580
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,150
Did something happen at the hospital?

581
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,830
Everything is fine at the hospital.

585
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,960
You wrote it, right?

586
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,410
I found this

587
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,150
while tidying Qianqian's cabinet.

588
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,150
I think

589
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,940
you should keep it.

590
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,600
You know what?

591
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,610
Before Qianqian was assigned to our department,

592
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,900
the operating room wanted to keep her, too,

593
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,710
but she insisted on

594
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,260
becoming an anesthesia nurse.

595
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,300
Do you know why?

596
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,100
It was because of you.

597
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,230

Matron Qiao.

599
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,590
I want to stay in the anesthesiology department.

600
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,490
Can I?

601
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,780
Of course.

602
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,530
But…

603
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,720
I heard that Director Wang of the operating room

604
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,790
wants you, too.

605
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,190
Don't you want to think more about it?

606
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,580
To be honest,

607
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,910
nurses in the operating room

608
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,240
have more opportunities to learn

609
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,990
and more space to grow.

610
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,860
I know,

611
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,140
but

612
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,000
I've thought about it

613
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,790
very clearly.

614
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,480
May I ask why?

615
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,920
Because during my clinical rotations

616
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,040
in the anesthesiology department,

617
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,730
the people I've met the most

618
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,690
were you and Dr. Lu.

619
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,370
During those three months,

620
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,420
Dr. Lu

621
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,150
not only taught me

622
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,430
how to manage postoperative care

623
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,610
for patients

624
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,630
but also taught me

625
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,790
how to communicate with patients

626
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,680
and comfort the patients.

627
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,540
I always remember

628
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,590
the thing she told me.

629
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,020
She said

630
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,390
without anesthesia,

631
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,170
there wouldn't have been the development of surgeries.

632
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,310
The greatest meaning of anesthesia

633
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,750
is to do our best

634
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,260
to reduce the pain of the patients

635
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,470
so that we can cure more diseases.

636
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,860

637
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,170
Matron Qiao,

638
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,580
I want to be a member of

639

640
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,170
It was your words

641
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,620
that made her find her direction.

642
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,560
