[Episode 13]

3
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,900
Why are you sighing?

4
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,110
What?

5
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,050
You don't want your son to leave?

6
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,780
Everything is fine,

7
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,260
but he's suddenly moving out.

8
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,240
What?

9
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,180
He doesn't want to live with me?

10
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,150
He thinks I meddle too much,

11
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,710
doesn't he?

12
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,020
Don't overthink.

13
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,400
He's an adult now.

14
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,400
Didn't he live by himself

15
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,630
in Jinzhou?

16
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,200
He's used to it.

17
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,000
Judging from your tone,

18
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,560
you know why he's moving,

19
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,500
right?

20
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,670
Tell me.

21
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,270
Nothing really escapes

22
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,040
Officer Jiang's sharp eyes.

23
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,860
Of course.

24
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,230
I'm an experienced criminal police officer.

25
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,410
If I tell you,

26
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,470
you can't tell our son

27
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,510
I told you.

28
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,150
Here's the thing.

29
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,080
Dr. Lu has been

30
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,950
in a little bit of trouble lately.

31
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,770
So our son

32
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,040
wants to move

33
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,210
near her

34
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,490
so they can take care of each other.

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,720
That's good.

36
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,270
Yeah.

37
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,990
He should.

38
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,400
They say,

39
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,780
"A grown daughter's hard to keep."

40
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,070
But look at my son.

41
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,970
Now that he's in love,

42
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,490
he just bolts off faster than a rabbit.

43
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,680
Can't rely on him at all.

44
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,030
Alright. I'll go wash the dishes.

45
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,260
You're just saying that.

46
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:29,420
You secretly love it!

47
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,900
Going out so early?

48
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,480
Is she going to work?

49
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,960
Hey.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,770
Chengyi.

51
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,940
I've sent you Deng Man's case files.

52
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,140
Okay.

53
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,850
Thank you, Director Xing.

54
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,440
Yesterday, Sihan and I

55
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,029
checked the surveillance footage.

56
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,520
The murderer definitely scoped out

57
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,670
the route beforehand.

58
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,960
He found a blind spot,

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,430
stuffed Wang Qianqian into the trunk,

60
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,750
and then got right onto the ring road.

61
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,420
The ring road?

62
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,080
At that time,

63
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,490
there must have been hundreds of cars passing by.

64
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,270
It's impossible to find him.

65
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,990
Exactly.

66
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,400
Filtering all that data

67
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,590
will take at least a month.

68
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,300
How's it going on your side?

69
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,460
Don't even mention it.

70

To find the person

pretending to be Deng Man,

72
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,530
I went all the way to the suburbs,

73
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,280
but since

74
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,740
it was too long ago,

75
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:48,480
the security footage was overwritten,

76
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,340
and the trail went cold.

77
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,390
Dr. Lu?

78
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,050
Dr. Lu?

79
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,040
Why are you here?

00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,400

Are you here for Captain Jiang?

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,280
No, no.

What brought you here today?

Deng Man and Wang Qianqian

91
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,850

what your relationship

102

with Deng Man was.

103
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,340
She was

my best friend.

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,270
Well,

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,320
something similar

their deaths are related?

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,460
you've met Deng Man recently, right?

112
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:15,850
Yes.

113

I…

114
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,450
I've met her twice.

115
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,740

the same clothes and hairpin

117

she's not Deng Man.

Yes.

The case of Deng Man

122
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,150
was closed eight years ago.

123
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,960
So we don't know much

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,880

There was no one else.

135
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,340
Did she have friends

136
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,900

Director Xing called me just now.

141
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,470
He said you want to know

142
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,470
about Deng Man's case.

143
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:37,350
Yes.

144
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,060
I've been investigating a case recently.

145
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,830
I think it might be related

146
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,960
to Deng Man's case.

147
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,030
You handled

148
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,420
Deng Man's case back then.

149
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,780
So I want to talk to you.

150
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,590
You know Deng Man?

151
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,050
We went to the same college.

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,460
Mr. Yang.

153
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,370
Did Deng Man

154
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,710
take her own life back then?

155
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,159
Deng Man was drowned.

156
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,800
When we

157
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,520
found her body,

158
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,470
there were no obvious injuries on her body.

159
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,810
There was a suicide note

160
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,270
beside her.

161
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,670
The analysis of the handwriting

162
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,330
confirmed that

163
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,440
she wrote it.

164
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,340
At that time,

165
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,190
we conducted an investigation

166
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,680
and found that

167
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,510
before Deng Man died,

168
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,280
she had big mood swings.

169
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,310
So,

170
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,030
we decided

171
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,400
she committed suicide.

172
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,780
Looking at it now,

173
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,890
it was very simple.

174
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,270
The evidence

175
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,659
was interconnected,

176
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,039
forming a perfect loop

177
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,409
with no room for doubt.

178
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:43,990
By the way,

179
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,530
five years after Deng Man's death,

180
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,350
we

181
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,330
received an anonymous letter.

182
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,360
According to this letter,

183
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,790
Deng Man didn't commit suicide.

184
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,130
The writer asked us to reinvestigate

185
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,130
the cause of her death.

186
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,610
Mr. Yang,

187
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,810
the source of that anonymous letter...

188
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,870
That anonymous letter was printed.

189
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,560
We checked

190
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,350
the sender's information.

191
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,550
It was all fake.

192
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,750
We did some further investigation,

193
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,790
but we didn't find any new clues.

194
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,870
Therefore,

195
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,560
the conclusion remains suicide.

196
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,410
Did this letter mention

197
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,340
why Deng Man

198
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,680
didn't commit suicide?

199
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,290
Did it offer any clues or evidence?

200
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,740
There was just this letter.

201
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,340
Nothing else.

202
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,840
So we thought

203
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,490
it might be

204
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,440
from a friend of Deng Man

205
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,240
who wouldn't accept her suicide.

206
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,750
Mr. Yang.

207
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,070
Did Deng Man mention

208
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,080
why she took her own life

209
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,380
on the suicide note?

210
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,310
No.

211
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,610
Besides,

212
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,740
her suicide note

213
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,470
was written in a messy way

214
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,280
with many incoherent sentences.

215
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,600
We all thought

216
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,320
it should have been

217
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,910
a relationship problem.

218
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,190
Then I retired,

219
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,930
[Friends] [Emotional problems]

220
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,580
and the case

221
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,070
became a burden on my heart.

222
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,150
As a former police officer,

223
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,150
I really don't want

224
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,230
to have any regrets.

225
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:19,900
You understand?

226
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,060
Since you're here to

227
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,550
ask about Deng Man's case,

228
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,500
you must want to look into it.

229
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,480
How about this?

230
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,450
No matter what the result is,

231
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,960
you must tell me.

232
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,730
Don't worry.

233
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,910
I'll do my best.

234
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,730
Okay.

235
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,730
Who's it?

236
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,680
Zhong.

237
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,420
It's me.

238
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,560
What a surprise. You miss me?

239
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,410
I need to ask you something.

240
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,190
This is my colleague.

241
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,050
Nice to meet you.

242
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,780
Where is Tang Jie?

243
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,390
In the bedroom.

244
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,690
Honey, Jiang is here.

245
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,310
Tang Jie.

246
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,750
-Come here. I have something to ask you.
-Captain Jiang.

247
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,350
Okay.

248
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,340
Something to drink?

249
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,490
Whatever you have.

250
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,450
What happened? What's the rush?

251
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,450
Hello.

252
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,100
Hello.

253
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,150
It's about Deng Man.

254
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,750
Well,

255
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,430
do you know why she committed suicide

256
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,230
back then?

257
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,740
No.

258
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,280
I just remember

259
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,150
she went out with Lu Yan,

260
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,670
and Lu Yan came back alone.

261
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,910
Did you ask Lu Yan

262
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,330
why she came back alone?

263
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,440
No.

264
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,170
Did you read her suicide note?

265
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,590
No.

266
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,800
When it happened, both Lu Yan and I

267
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,190
took extended leave to go home.

268
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,430
When we came back,

269
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,390
all of Man's stuff

270
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,740
had been taken away

271
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,740
from our dorm.

272
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,060
Was she dating someone

273
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,240
in college?

274
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,310
Did she have a boyfriend?

275
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,880
No way.

276
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,390
She never mentioned it.

277
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,680
She…

278
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,620
You know,

279
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,990
she was quite a loner.

280
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,370
No online dating

281
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,020
either?

282
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,180
No one she was interested in?

283
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,950
Online dating?

284
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,780
I don't think so.

285
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,910
She was always on a scholarship,

286
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,270
living very frugally.

287
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,350
It wasn't until sophomore year

288
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,190
that she saved up enough to buy a smartphone.

289
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,830
Besides me and Lu Yan,

290
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,220
she didn't really have any other friends.

291
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,580
Finished asking her?

292
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,020
Is it my turn?

293
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,400
Why would they ask you?

294
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,610
You were not even close with Man.

295
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,520
Honey, who are you looking down on?

296
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,410
Back in college,

297
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,810
a guy from the dorm next door

298
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,850
liked Deng Man.

299
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,690
Did you two know that?

300
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,960
Who?

301
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,430
The guy next door,

302
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,470
studying engineering.

303
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,540
Later became a director.

304
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,480
Named Wu Qiang.

305
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,560
Well,

306
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,290
he… he knew we were dating

307
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,080
and insisted I help him

308
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,540
ask Deng Man for her number.

309
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,690
I actually went

310
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,890
and asked her,

311
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,950
but Deng Man refused.

312
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,960
Why didn't you mention this before?

313
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,160
I did.

314
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,720
You said all my friends were bad influences

315
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,230
and called him

316
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,580
a toad lusting after a swan.

317
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,210
Are you still in touch with this person?

318
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,330
Yes.

319
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,120
I even reached out to him a while ago

320
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,280
to help me direct a play.

321
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,870
But for sure, her death

322
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,940
had nothing to do with him.

323
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,160
When Deng Man died,

324
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,870
he was studying abroad on an exchange program.

325
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,350
He came back later

326
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,610
and got a girlfriend.

327
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,310
He probably forgot about Deng Man a long time ago.

328
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,190
Then why are you saying these things?

329
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,080
I haven't mentioned the key point yet.

330
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,840
I went to ask for her number

331
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,010
for him, right?

332
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,510
I went to the library to find Deng Man.

333
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,220
At the time, it seemed like

334
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,150
she was waiting for someone.

335
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,910
I knew you'd come.

336
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,270
Hey,

337
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,170
it's me,

338
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,860
Tang Jie's boyfriend, Zhong.

339
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,750
You remember, right?

340
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,310
One of my buddies likes you.

341
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,680
Can I get your contact info?

342
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,440
Sorry,

343
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,840
I'm not looking to make friends.

344
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,820
I'll get going.

345
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,810
Wait, you…

346
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,220
It might not be someone she liked.

347
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,690
Maybe she was waiting for a friend.

348
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,760
Wait.

349
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,880
Back then, wasn't she

350
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,830
pretty close to you?

351
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,400
She always went to watch you play basketball.

352
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,320
Nonsense.

353
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,340
She wasn't there for me.

354
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,670
Then who was she there for?

355
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,840
Deng Man comes every day.

356
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,380
Who is she here for?

357
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,010
Me.

358
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,920
Shut up.

359
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,910
Get over yourself.

360
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,160
I think she's here for Jiang.

361
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,340
Shut up.

362
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,390
She's a good friend of Lu Yan.

363
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,300
Don't talk nonsense.

364
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,110
Who was she there for?

365
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,350
Wait.

366
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,080
Aren't you curious

367
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,550
who she was waiting for in the library?

368
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:24,840
[Anshan Criminal Investigation]

369
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,600
Come on, guys.

370
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,670
Here's the information we've got.

371
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,240
Captain Jiang and I just met

372
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,670
the police officer in charge of Deng Man's case back then

373
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,710
to learn more about her death.

374
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,150
He said that after Deng Man died,

375
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,170
someone sent an anonymous letter to the police station,

376
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,930
requesting to reopen the case.

377
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,000
Although we can't

378
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,200
link Wang Qianqian's case

379
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,030
to Deng Man's case now,

380
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,230
we can

381
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,000
first go over

382
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,950
Deng Man's case

383
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,270
to see if we can find

384
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,230
any useful clues.

385
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,730

386
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,930
Have you got Deng Man's

387
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,880
suicide note?

388
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,130

For what?

443

We asked her

449
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,560
if Deng Man had

450
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,540
other social relationships.

451

Not bad.

We were really worried about her.

she can handle it

457
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,130

00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,660
What do you want to ask?

772
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,350
Coach Zhou, do you still remember

773
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,590
Deng Man?

774
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,270
I do.

775
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,960
A pretty introverted girl.

776
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,090
She was in Medicine like you, right?

777
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:57,960
Yes.

778
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,350
D-Do you remember if she signed up

779
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,630
for your volleyball class?

780
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,840
The police came

781
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,220
to ask me about her.

782
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,800
I remember.

783
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,580
Then,

784
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,970
do you recall

785
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,920
if she had anyone

786
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,910
in class

787
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,680
she was particularly close to

788
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,390
or good friends with?

789
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,590
I don't know about that.

790
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,080
I only know she had a crush on someone.

791
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,020
A crush?

792
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,080
At first,

793
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,880
she often came to the basketball court

794
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,950
to watch us train.

795
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,510
But you know those boys,

796
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,200
they couldn't focus when there was a girl

797
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,490
sitting on the sidelines.

798
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,340
One time, I talked with her,

799
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,590
telling her not to interfere

800
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,380
with our training.

801
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,940
Deng Man,

802
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,830
you keep coming here,

803
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,110
and it's affecting our training.

804
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,070
Please don't come again.

805
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,790
Later,

806
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,350
I ran into her on campus.

807
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,170
She seemed to be in a bad mood.

808
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,840
I was just about to comfort her

809
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,870
when I saw Jiang Chengyi coming over.

810
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,500
Jiang Chengyi.

811
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:30,870
[Ninghai University]

812
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,670
What are you doing here?

813
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,030
I need to talk to you.

814
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,860
Go ahead.

815
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,860
Alright, if you need anything,

816
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,100
just let me know.

817
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:42,670
I'm leaving.

818
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,420
I didn't hear clearly

819
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,930
what they talked about.

820
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,740
Jiang Chengyi left soon.

821
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,830
Deng Man stayed there alone

822
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,000
and cried for a long time.

823
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,730
I think maybe…

824
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,960
she confessed to Jiang Chengyi

825
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,990
and got rejected.

826
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,240
Of course,

827
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,590
this is just my guess.

828
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,000
No real basis.

829
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,020
It's all in the past.

830
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,270
Give me a minute.

831
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,400
It's okay, Coach Zhou.

832
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,630
I should get going.

833
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,010
I'll be off now.

834
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,330
Thanks for talking with me.

835
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,440
Take care. You can see yourself out.

836
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:34,790
Here.

837
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,230
It's cooled down enough.

838
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,150
Here.

839
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,750
I've already

840
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,690
done what you said.

841
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,910
Have you made it home?

842
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,040
Wen Peng.

843
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,110
Lu Yan,

844
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,230
what are you doing here?

845
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,880
I don't have much going on today,

846
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,080
so I came back to campus for a walk.

847
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,340
What about you?

848
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,600
Principal Chen asked me to give a lecture.

849
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,430
It just ended.

850
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,170
I was thinking of visiting Coach Zhou,

851
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,220
but he said he's taking care of his wife

852
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,440
and suggested leaving it for another day.

853
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,380
What's wrong?

854
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,720
You're in a bad mood?

855
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,700
No.

856
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,460
Then how about we grab a meal together?

857
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,350
I'm good.

858
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,160
I'm not feeling

859
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,150
very hungry.

860
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,830
Let me give you a ride back, then.

861
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,090
My car's over there.

862
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,360
It's hard to find a taxi now.

863
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,560
It's on my way anyway.

864
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,580
Thanks.

865
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,870
Actually, these past few days,

866
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,820
I've been hesitating

867
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,190
whether to visit you or not.

868
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,190
I called you a few times,

869
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,100
but you didn't answer.

870
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,810
I know…

871
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,110
you're still upset

872
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,990
about Qianqian.

873
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,280
I've been in touch with

874
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,280
Dr. Han,

875
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,230
Tang Jie, and Zhong,

876
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,110
getting updates

877
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,110
on how you're doing.

878
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,130
I think staying with them

879
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,670
would…

880
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,790
would be better for you.

881
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,780
I'm home.

882
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,870
I'll head in.

883
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,460
Lu Yan.

884
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,450
Do you know

885
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,550
what kind of impression

886
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,070
you left on me during college?

887
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,130
What was it called again?

888
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,000
A...

889
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,730
rookie studyholic.

890
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,750
Roo... rookie studyholic?

891
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,320
Although in many ways she was pretty average,

892
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,250
she was always very hardworking,

893
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:55,880
very brave,

894
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,690
and kept pushing herself.

895
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,480
I don't think

896
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,160
fate can defeat

897
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,210
a rookie studyholic.

898
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,760
I believe you can

899
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,520
let go of the past

900
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,330
and start fresh.

901
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,870
I know,

902
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,370
but I think

903
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,620
it'll take time.

904
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,160
Because that night,

905
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,490
Qianqian kept calling me,

906
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,750
but I didn't pick up. I...

907
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,700
I feel so guilty about it.

908
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:24,780
You don't understand.

909
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,790
I do.

910
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,970
Really, I really do.

911
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,030
Because that night,

912
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,330
she called me too.

913
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,490
She apologized to me,

914
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,470
saying sorry

915
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,820
for not attending my premiere.

916
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,910
I've been thinking these past few days,

917
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,670
that if I had

918
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,800
given her more tickets that day,

919
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,570
or…

920
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,160
talked to her longer

921
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:44,990
when she called,

922
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:45,740
maybe it would...

923
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,070
maybe this wouldn't

924
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:47,800
have happened.

925
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,460
I feel just like you. I...

926
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,940
I feel so guilty, so full of regret.

927
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,940
You're right.

928
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,640
Someone who hasn't experienced

929
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,050
something like this

930
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,360
wouldn't understand.

931
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,030
So I understand you.

932
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,300
Lu Yan.

933
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,550
What happened can change us,

934
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,670
but we can't change what happened.

935
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,300
Let the past stay in the past.

936
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,230
If you're feeling upset

937
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,840
or need help,

938
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,020
come to me.

939
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:41,930
I'm always here.

940
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,580
Okay.

941
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,440
I'll head back now.
