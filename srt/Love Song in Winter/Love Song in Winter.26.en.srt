[Episode 26]

3
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,039
Mrs. Lu,

4
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,330
how'd your check-up go?

5
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,759
Not bad.

6
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,870
I booked a restaurant.

7
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,990
Let's go have dinner.

8
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:04,930
Don't bother.

9
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,390
I just ate

10
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,630
in the hospital.

11
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:09,960
Okay.

12
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,680
Well, then,

13
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,210
let's go back first.

14
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,070
Jiang.

15
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,470
Do you police

16
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,950
get any vacation time?

17
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,910
If there are no special missions,

18
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,030
we usually get regular time off.

19
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,870
If your wife

20
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,640
is pregnant and in labor,

21
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,250
do you have paternity leave?

22
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,870
We get

23
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,570
all the usual time off

24
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,390
so long as we're not on a mission.

25
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,190
Then is it dangerous

26
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,590
during the mission?

27
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,420
It's much better now.

28
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,350
But it may be

29
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,230
a little bit dangerous.

30
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,590
Since it's dangerous,

31
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,510
have you considered

32
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:57,829
changing your job,

33
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,020
like, switching careers?

34
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,240
Mom,

35
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,840
what are you talking about?

36
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,360
Why would he change his job?

37
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,550
Isn't it good to be a policeman?

38
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,630
He's responsible

39
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,990
and reliable.

40
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,280
I like police.

41
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,400
Mrs. Lu,

42
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,990
do you have a problem

43
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,910
with us criminal police?

44
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,290
Mom,

45
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,590
didn't you always want to

46
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,920
go to Songshan?

47
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,520
I'll take leave tomorrow.

48
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,829
Let's go have fun there, okay?

49
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,590
Jiang Chengyi.

50
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,990
Are you free tomorrow?

51
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,700
Let's go together?

52
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,360
OK.

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,880
I'll

54
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,960
book the accommodation and restaurants over there.

55
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,130
Is it good?

56
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,040
Don't bother.

57
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,860
I'll head back home tomorrow.

58
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,000
She might be in a bad mood after the check-up.

59
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,310
You can go back and rest.

60
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,950
Okay.

61
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,350
Take this.

62
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,500

63
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,900
Yan?

64
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,670
Mom, you're still up?

65
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,310
Tell me.

66
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,790
Do you really like

67
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,070
Jiang Chengyi that much?

68
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,720
Mom,

69
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,790
do you not like him?

70
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,560
I neither like

71
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,750
nor dislike him, actually.

72
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,390
He's a righteous

73
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,990
and nice guy.

74
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,130
If he were my son,

75
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,480
I'd love him for sure.

76
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,030
That's it.

77
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,400
But Yan...

78
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,110

I...

81
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,600
I really,

82
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,230
really like Jiang Chengyi.

83
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,909
And we’ve been apart

84
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,909
for years.

85
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,480
This time, we've thought it through

86
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,430
before deciding to get back together.

87
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,710
I don't want to be separated from him again.

88
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,870
As for realistic issues,

89
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,540
I think we will

90
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,040
sort them out smoothly.

91
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,430
But I wish

92
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,790
I can have your support.

93
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,670
Okay.

94
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,800
I respect your thoughts.

95
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,130
I support you

as long as you feel

97
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,750
it's the right decision.

98
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,220
Okay.

99
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,890
Don't stay up too late.

100
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,550
Sleep early.

I'm going to the operating room.

106

You're so into your food.

Let me help.

165
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:49,970
Mrs. Lu,

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,830
what do you want to tell me?

167
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,480
Yan has always been

168
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,760
an independent girl.

169
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,640
She's never made me

170
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,390
worry about anything

171
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,000
since she was a child,

172
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,410
and never has she ever asked me for anything.

173
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,650
Because she knows

174
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,230
it's not easy for me to raise her alone.

175
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,400
There's no child

176
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,840
who doesn't wanna

177
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,790
be spoiled by their parents, right?

178
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,740
But I

179
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,700
couldn't give her a complete home.

180
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,960
I feel guilty.

181
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,960
And she can tell I'm sad.

182
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,670
So she

183
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,850
tells me good news only, never the bad.

184
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,250
I know

185
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,680
she doesn't want me to worry.

186
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,150
I

187
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,800
just do as she wishes,

188
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,070
traveling around the country.

189
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,700
I just want her to know

190
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,040
that her mom

191
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,870
is leading a delightful and fulfilling life.

192
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,990
So she can rest assured.

193
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,170
This is also a special way

194
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,860
for us to get along as mother and daughter.

195
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,950
No news means good news.

196
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,350

If he's really

580
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,880
been controlled by someone,

581
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,550
he's already complicit in the crime.

582
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,210
He won't tell the truth.

583
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,950
It's okay.

584
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,440
Don't be discouraged.

585
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,270
It's easy to deal with Zhou Zhicheng.

586
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,550
Check his phone first.

587
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,550
See who he's contacted.

588
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,820
Let's interrogate him after we find the clues.

589
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,180
He can't hold on for long.

590
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,830
And don't forget

591
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,050
about the truck driver.

592
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,260
Since he's a habitual offender,

593
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,270
let's investigate him with his records

594
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,550
and see who's recruited him.

595
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,190
Got it.

597
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,110
Let's get to work.

598
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,870

599

600
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,470
Got it.

[Who's this old hag? She's nowhere near good enough for our idol.]

[Is she insane? How shameless!]

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,430
[Who is this teacher? She doesn't deserve our Feng! Doesn't she know how old she is?]

00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,570
Hello,

606
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,640
Sorry...

607
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,010
Hao, I gotta go.

608
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,240
Bofeng,

609
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,400
Mr. Wen specifically asked me

610
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,730
to keep an eye on you.

611
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,770
Please don't make it hard for me.

612
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,510
Bofeng,

613
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,790
didn’t Mr. Wen

614
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,790
already send the PR staff

615
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,470
to sign the agreement with Professor Yu?

616
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,890
They won't push her for sure.

617
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,140
What agreement?

618
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,150
Just ask her to help

619
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,430
record a clarification video.

620
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,210
A clarification video?

621
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,510
Didn't Mr. Wen say

622
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,470
they'd pay the PR company

623
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,230
to remove the photos directly?

624
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,210
Yes!

625
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,270
But like always,

626
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,060
we must make her

627
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,010
sign an agreement.

628
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,990
Aren't we always

629
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,110
handling it in this way?

630
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,820
I'm speechless.

631
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,000
She's different from others.

632
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:53,990
Bofeng...

633
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,110
Just let me out.

634
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:56,670
I promise

635
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,830
I'll be back before twelve.

636
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,190
I won't cause any trouble.

637
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,220
Don't tell Mr. Wen.

638
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,070
I knew you'd be here.

639
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,430
Why are you here again?

640
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,110
Well,

641
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,830
I came

642
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,520
to see if you're okay.

643
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,070
I just want to

644
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,110
apologize to you in person.

645
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,950
I'm sorry.

646
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,270
Professor Yu,

647
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,790
I heard that a PR team

648
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,830
contacted you, right?

649
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,230
They even asked you to record

650
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,820
a clarification video.

651
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,590
But I refused.

652
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,110
I'm sorry.

653
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,150
I caused you so much trouble.

654
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,460
Alright...

655
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,950
No more bows.

656
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,130
Your boss has apologized to me.

657
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,310
Have you

658
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,390
been on Weibo these days?

659
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:48,790
Yep.

660
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,830
I've checked all the major social media.

661
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,750
These fans

662
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,950
are quite interesting.

663
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,130
They're so creative in cursing.

664
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,670
It's way beyond my imagination.

665
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,110
I really shouldn't have

666
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,350
taken you there.

667
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,340
It's all my fault.

668
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,400
No, I-I'm sorry...

669
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,350
Stop bowing.

670
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,750
You've bowed three times.

671
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,030
It's almost like at my funeral.

672
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:13,810
Are you

673
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,900
not angry?

674
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,130
I'm not.

675
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,110
Don't you mind

676
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,050
their cursing at you?

677
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,820
I'm not a kid.

678
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,350
Everyone can say something

679
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,990
on the Internet.

680
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,070
This drama will end in a few days.

681
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,550
Then, Professor Yu,

682
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,190
can you add me again

683
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,990
on WeChat?

684
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,680
No.

685
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,750
I never add back any contact I delete.

686
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,230
OK.

687
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,820
Forget about WeChat for now.

688
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,200
Do you have anything to eat?

689
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,090
I've been worried about you these days.

690
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:45,670
Not until I saw you

691
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,900
did I remember I didn't eat anything.

692
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,950
I suddenly got hungry.

693
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,900
I've got this only.

694
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,830
Finish it and leave.

695
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,850
Gosh.

696
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,070
Since Mr. Wen

697
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,250
brought me to the show business,

698
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,630
I've never had any instant noodles.

699
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,880
This is the first bowl.

700
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,440
Are you close to Mr. Wen?

701
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,090
We're on really, really good terms.

702
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,830
Were it not for Mr. Wen,

703
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,870
I wouldn't be where I am today.

704
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,570
How did you know each other?

705
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,760
At that time,

706
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,470
I was handing out

707
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,730
leaflets at the mall entrance.

708
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,120
Then he came to me and asked

709
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,630
if I wanted to change my job.

710
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,070
That's it.

711
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,230
So he really

712
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,350
signed you on the street?

713
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,230
Yep.

714
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,790
He's got a good taste.

715
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,200
Professor Yu,

716
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,690
are you praising me for being handsome?

717
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,100
Have you finished?

718
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,630
Actually, Mr. Wen

719
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,590
is really nice to me.

720
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,670
See? I got

721
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,290
into such a big trouble.

722
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,350
The company suffered a huge financial loss.

723
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,840
Yet he didn't scold me even once.

724
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,520
Then why did you still come to me?

725
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,440
I was worried

726
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,610
something might happen to you.

727
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,970
I could feel relieved at the sight of you.

728
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,050
By the way,

729
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,130
did anyone know

730
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,580
you came to meet me that day?

731
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,310
No.

732
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,820
I didn't tell anyone when I came out.

733
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,260
Only my assistant knew it.

734
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,820
I've been curious.

735
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,230
You came to me that day,

736
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,560
and we went out for dinner

737
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,230
all on a whim.

738
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,230
How could we get caught

739
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,550
on camera as soon as we sat down?

740
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,470
Could it be that

741
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,540
the man had been following us

742
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,630
from the school?

743
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,530
No.

744
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,320

00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,470
we have professional habits.

746

Whenever we go out,

747
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,470
we'll check if anyone's

748
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,350
following us.

749
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,630
I also checked that day.

750
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,230
No followers.

751
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,790
That's weird.

752
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,750
Who could it be?

753
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,550

00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,120
50,000 yuan.

770
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,310
50,000?

771
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,180
Are you short of money?

772
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,670
I told you

773
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,360
if you were

774
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,110
cash-strapped,

775
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:51,910
you must tell me

776
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,750
and turn to me.

777
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,590
Sorry, Mr. Wen. I'm so sorry.

778
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,470
Alright.

779
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,530
Go meet HR for the final paycheck.

780
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,650
Mr. Wen, you're such a nice guy.

781
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,710
He caused such a big trouble.

782
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,490
You finally found the reason,

783
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,160
yet you just fired him

784
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,190
without claiming compensation.

785
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,190
A little assistant

786
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,320
earns only a few thousand yuan a month.

787
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,900
How much can he compensate?

788
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,120
Mr. Wen,

789
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,150
are you always this chill?

790
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,220
No wonder you can succeed in your career.

791
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,590
What?

792
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,970
You wanna see me scolding my subordinate?

793
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,630
Not really.

794
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,950
But some people are calm

795
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,010
for real.

796
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,310
And some

797
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,270
are trying their best

798
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,650
to suppress their emotions.

799
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,560
Just like the children

800
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,990
we analyzed in the past cases.

801
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,910
They might have suffered

802
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,390
a lot of traumas in childhood.

803
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,510
So when they grow up,

804
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,710
they're seldom open

805
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,630
about their feelings.

806
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,470
Of course,

807
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,690
I’m not referring to you, Mr. Wen.

808
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,600
Professor Yu,

809
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,920
is your occupational habit kicking in?

810
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,910
Anyway,

811
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,820
it's my fault.

812
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,190
I didn't manage my subordinates well,

813
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,680
who caused you trouble.

814
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,030
I'm really sorry.

815
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,740
You don't have to apologize.

816
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,510
Yu Bofeng

817
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,140
seems quite concerned about his assistant.

818
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,830
You should spend some time

819
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,190
comforting him.

820
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,270
Didn't you

821
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,630
already comfort him?

822
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,130
We were just chatting.

823
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,230
I believe you.

824
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,700
But now,

825
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,080
at this critical time,

826
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,870
I hope you can

827
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,460
keep a distance from him

828
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,710
Don't go see him

829
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,330
or let him come to see you.

830
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,470
We're adults.

831
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,320
No one wants to cause anyone trouble.

832
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,490
No worries, Mr. Wen.

833
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,670
Peng,

834
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,880
I-I'm feeling really down.

835
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:37,870
I know.

836
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,540
So I came to drink with you.

837
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,260
Because of Hao.

838
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,380
I fired him.

839
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,430
I must

840
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,900
do this for the company.

841
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,360
But don't worry.

842
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,020
I gave him some money

843
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,750
which could

844
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,980
last him a while.

845
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,390
After all, he's been with you for three years.

846
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,100
Thank you, Peng.

847
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,520
You know

848
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,870
I don't have many friends.

849
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,600
So I think...

850
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,320
So,

851
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,590
you value your friends

852
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,910
and are afraid of being hurt by them.

853
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,190
Bofeng,

854
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,880
as I told you before,

855
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,500
you can only

856
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,350
trust yourself in this world,

857
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,460
Your family may abandon you.

858
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,410
Your friends may set you up.

859
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,470
One day,

860
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,780
even your beloved one

861
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,910
may betray you.

862
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,630
But I don't think so.

863
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,750
I think the person I love

864
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,310
will never betray me.

865
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,790
Of course, you won't betray me either,

866
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:54,330
Peng.

867
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:56,870
I've seen you

868
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,510
as my closest friend from the very beginning.

869
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,250
Bofeng,

870
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,470
I'm sorry.

871
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,390
As your brother,

872
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,270
I didn't protect you well.

873
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,150
You don't have to apologize to me.

874
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,580
I'm the only one to blame

875
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,790
for the whole mess.

876
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,320
It has nothing to do with you.

877
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,160
I remember a saying.

878
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,270
God sees everything.

879
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,260
Does God really know

880
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,190
what people are thinking

881
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,390
and what they are doing?

882
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,150
Maybe

883
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,360
even God can't see through it sometimes.

884
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,070
Peng,

885
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,190
this question's way too deep.

886
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,550
I've never thought about it before.

887
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:01,910
Morning.

888
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,640
How did I get back yesterday, Peng?

889
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,180
How?

890
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,450
I carried you back, of course.

891
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,120
What are you cooking?

892
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,040
Smells so good.

893
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,040
Some soup

894
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,190
to sober you up.

895
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,380
My boss is so nice to me.

896
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,870
He carried me back at night

897
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,140
and made me food in the morning.

898
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,150
Hello, what’s up?

899
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,020
Mr. Wen, we're in trouble.

900
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,110
Check your Weibo.

901
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,850
Ask the PR company to work immediately

902
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,120
and keep things under control in the media.

903
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:03,830
[Can't believe the police forced a person to death! How dare they?]

904
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:03,830
[The exposure of Yu Bofeng's real identity! His adoptive mother was wrongly accused as a thief.]

905
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:04,960
No way.

906
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,030
What?

907
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,110
They say my Aunt Wang was a thief?

908
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,870
Aunt Wang could never

909
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:10,380
be a thief.

910
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,140
There's no way she could've been one!

911
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,590
Calm down.

912
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,680
How can I calm down?

913
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,830
See what they're saying!

914
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:17,830
Calm down a bit

915
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,200
and recall

916
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,070
how your family

917
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,190
told you about Aunt Wang's death.

918
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,190
My hometown fellows said

919
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,270
Aunt Wang had a heart attack

920
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,070
and suddenly passed away.

921
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,190
When I went back,

922
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,180
she was already gone.

923
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,240
Why don't you make a call

924
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,030
to confirm it?

925
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,470
Aunt Wang has no other relatives.

926
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,550
Who can I ask?

927
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,550
Where are you going?

928
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,940
I'm going to ask Jiang Chengyi.

929
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,420
You can't go.

930
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,030
Why can't I?

931
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:46,910
Don't you know how much

932
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,030
Aunt Wang matters to me?

933
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,480
Were it not for her, I would have died long ago!

934
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:51,510
Aunt Wang could never

935
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,570
be a thief.

936
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:53,950
The police must

937
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:54,750
have framed her!

938
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,270
I understand how you feel.

939
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:56,790
But now,

940
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,050
you can't go anywhere.

941
00:43:58,930 --> 00:43:59,790
Do you know how many people

942
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:00,710
are watching you out there?

943
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,290
Give me some time

944
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,430
to deal with this,

945
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:04,960
OK?

946
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,750
Then what should I do?

947
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,170
Sit and wait at home?

948
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,190
Let them talk nonsense online?

949
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,550
Bofeng.

950
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:12,590
Quiet.

951
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,490
Calm down.

952
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:14,790
Stay sober.

953
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,090
Take a deep breath.

954
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,030
Take a deep breath.

955
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:18,590
Take a deep breath.

956
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,010
Listen to me now.

957
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,620
Don't go anywhere.

958
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,440
Just stay at home

959
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,990
and don't contact anyone.

960

Yeah, poor little thing.

1078
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:41,670
I don't think she's acting.

thoroughly investigated it.

It was a complete accident.

00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,670
Both of you did nothing wrong.

1083
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:50,510
So don't put

1084
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:51,680
too much pressure on yourselves.

1089
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:57,430
has one request.

1090
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:58,570
That is

1091
00:49:58,670 --> 00:49:59,510
to keep it on the down low.

1092
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,390
She's already gone, after all.

1093
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:02,920
Being suspected as a thief

1094
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:03,910
would add to the disgrace.

1095
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:06,590
No one expected you

1096
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,970

Captain Jia,

1103
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:18,910
I feel that I might

1104
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,310
not be suitable for frontline work.

1105
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,400
I request to leave the frontline temporarily.

1106
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:35,040
Hope you can approve.
