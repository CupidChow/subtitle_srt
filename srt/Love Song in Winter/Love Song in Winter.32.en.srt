238

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,440

The doctor said...

391
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,550
she will make it through.

392
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,770
She definitely will.

393
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,450
I'm sorry.

394
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,910
I failed to protect your mom...

395
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,110
and failed to protect you.

396
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,170
If I...

397
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,610
If I didn't come back,

398
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,870
would all this have

399
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,100
been prevented?

400
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,010
I've always just wanted to protect you.

401
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,500
But I've never

402
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,070
protected you even once.

403
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,240
You've been hurt so much.

404
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,580
And today...

405
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,360
Auntie is also lying here.

406
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,400
It's all my fault.

407
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,710
I'm so useless.

408
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,770
Sorry, Lu Yan.

409
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,740
Now, I...

410
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,950
Now I understand why you did

411
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,790
what you did

412
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,750
eight years ago.

413
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,860
Jiang Chengyi.

414
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,670
Can you...

415
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,830
Can you hug me?

416
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,990
Police! Freeze!

417
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,900
Stop!

418
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,930
Stop!

419
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,010
Stop!

420
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,750
Let go of me!

421
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,510
Handcuff him!

422
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,370
Let go!

423
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,310
Buddy.

424
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,430
We've met before.

425
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,680
We're old friends then.

426
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,400
I was just joking with her

427
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,990
to scare her.

428
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,240
If I'm your buddy,

429
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,550
why'd you ask your men

430
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,710
to beat me with bats?

431
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,360
You locked her in the car

432
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,390
all tied up

433
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,590
and wanted to poison her with a gas can.

434
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,470
You call this a joke?

435
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,650
I admit

436
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,390
I locked her

437
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,720
in the car.

438
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,190
But she kept following me.

439
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,910
I was worried she was

440
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,830
up to no good,

441
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,030
or would even

442
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,310
try to physically hurt me.

443
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,990
That's why I did that.

444
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,560
Strictly speaking,

445
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,350
shouldn't this

446
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,470
be justifiable self-defense?

447
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,190
And the gas can you mentioned.

448
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,370
I don't know where it came from.

449
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,950
Is... Is there someone

450
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,630
trying to frame me?

451
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,430
Also,

452
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,890
my men beat you up?

453
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,190
Get me out of here,

454
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,110
and I'll teach them

455
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,870
a lesson for you.

456
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,750
Wang Yifan.

457
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,070
You're very familiar with this, huh?

458
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,390
It's fine if

459
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,470
you don't admit to this.

460
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,750
But what you've done before

461
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:42,950
is enough to warrant

462
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,670
a life sentence.

463
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,670
What do you mean?

464
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,060
You murdered Yan Mei,

465
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,880
threatened Wen Peng to hide the body

466
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,450
and blackmailed him,

467
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,570
and assaulted his employee, Yu Bofeng.

468
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,390
Yu Bofeng

469
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,400
is a superstar.

470
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,550
How could you do that?

471
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,240
Now, you'll have to compensate him

472
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,350
on top of going to jail.

473
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,170
Can you afford it?

474
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,430
Wait,

475
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,030
are you mistaken?

476
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,030
I don't know any

477
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,430
of those people. I...

478
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,930
W-Who did I kill?

479
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,810
I-I... blackmailed who?

480
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,630
I'll be frank with you.

481
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:20,870
We've recovered

482
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,370
your chat history with Wen Peng.

483
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,710
After you were arrested,

484
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,910
Wen Peng sent another text.

485
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,970
This is his statement.

486
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,180
He revealed it all.

487
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,160
I'll read it to you.

488
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,600
Two years ago,

489
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,060
after funeral home worker Wang Yifan

490
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,870
started plotting after seeing Yan Mei

491
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,670
in the hospital,

492
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,060
he kidnapped Yan Mei

493
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,960
and then murdered her.

494
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:45,590
He...

495
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,390
He's talking nonsense!

496
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,070
He's... He's framing me!

497
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,630
You...

498
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,820
You can't believe

499
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,950
what he said.

500
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,710
Yan Mei's caretaker

501
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,860
Ma Cheng said the same thing.

502
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,790
Both Wen Peng and Ma Cheng

503
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,630
said you did it.

504
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,980
He must've paid off

505
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,470
that Ma Cheng.

506
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,830
He always uses his wealth.

507
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,660
He... He always does this!

508
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,880
Wang Yifan.

509
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,110
This is a

510
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,310
legal procedure.

511
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,490
It's about evidence.

512
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,390
Now all the evidence

513
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,180
points at you.

514
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,310
You killed Yan Mei

515
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,320
two years ago!

516
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,930
He came to me two years ago!

517
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,470
About two years ago,

518
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,570
he came to the funeral home

519
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,910
and asked me to get rid of

520
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,590
a body for him

521
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,910
without documenting it.

522
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,550
As you know,

523
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:35,990
I'm just an employee

524
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,750
at a funeral home.

525
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,190
How'd I dare to do that?

526
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,820
Besides,

527
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,030
all the procedures

528
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,450
in the funeral home

529
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,110
must be carefully reviewed.

530
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,030
It's super strict.

531
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,310
But...

532
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,100
But later he said

533
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,150
he'd pay me

534
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,360
300,000 yuan.

535
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,770
I... I...

536
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,150
I couldn't resist.

537
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,970
Who did he ask you to cremate?

538
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,800
I don't know.

539
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:00,870
Maybe...

540
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,590
it might be that person

541
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,760
you just mentioned.

542
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,810
I just know it's an old lady.

543
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,820
She was so skinny.

544
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,070
She obviously died of illness.

545
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:10,880
How old was she?

546
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,440
About 60 years old, I think.

547
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,460
But I didn't look at her carefully.

548
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,930
I don't dare to speculate.

549
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,350
After the old lady was sent to me,

550
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,230
it felt like she's been dead for a long time.

551
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,390
Her body already

552
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,590
started decomposing.

553
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,660
And then?

554
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,680
Getting rid of the body and info

555
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,190
in a funeral home

556
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,020
is basically impossible.

557
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,120
So I...

558
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,500
I secretly

559
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,910
transported the body away

560
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,910
and buried it.

561
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,030
Where?

562
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,730
On the North Mountain of Chengzhou,

563
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,910
at the pavilion of the ecological park.

564
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,580
Officer.

565
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,230
I've told you everything.

566
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,960
Will it help with today's matter?

567
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,390
It depends on your performance.

568
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,590
[Ninghai Anshan People's Hospital]

569
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,470
Here.

570
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:13,910
Here.

571
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,440
What happened?

572
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,670
How did the car accident happen?

573
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,600
A truck crashed into her

574
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,430
when she was crossing the road.

575
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,660
She's still in the critical stage.

576
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,390
Did you find the driver?

577
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,060
Yes.

578
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,840
There were no traces of braking at the scene.

579
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,810
I suspect it was intentional.

580
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,470
Intentional?

581
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,820
Could it be Wen Peng?

582
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,690

Last night,

We're interrogating him.

589
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,750
Based on the current evidence,

are linked.

593
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,270
It's Wen Peng's assistant, Wu Di.

594
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,350
We've also heard back

595
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,230
from Cyber Investigation.

596
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,740
He spread the rumors about you

597

and Professor Yu too.

And Wang Yifan?

599
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,980
He admitted that

600
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,960
Wen Peng instigated him.

Hello. Excuse me.

607
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,150

This time, it's Lu Yan's mother.

626
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,650

636

first disguised as a cleaner

637
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,010
to evade our stakeout

638
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,050
and walked away.

639
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,920
He then boarded bus no. 39

640
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,860
and got off at the suburb station.

641
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,340
Then he disappeared.

658
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,390
I think based on Wen Peng's

659
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,190
usual approach,

660
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,630
he should still be in Ninghai.

661
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:55,830

it's a citywide search.

669

Your confession

777
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,680
doesn't matter to us anymore.

778
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,260
We have the evidence

779
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,320
that Wen Peng hired you as a killer.

780
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,440
I'm here today

781
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,390
to tell you everything

782
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,560
so that you can be prepared.

783
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,030
That's it.

784
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,290
Take her back.

785
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,820
Don't touch me.

786
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:58,660
I'll talk.

787
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,600
About two years ago,

788
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,030
my mom's illness was getting worse.

789
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,540
I couldn't afford the medical fees.

790
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,590
So I went to his film crew

791
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,660
as a stunt double.

792
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,070
Every penny counts,

793
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:21,760
I thought.

794
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,570
You're quite a fighter.

795
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,580
You want me to pay?

796
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,380
I'm broke.

797
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,140
They deducted my pay.

798
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,230
They deserved it.

799
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,930
Are you short of money?

800
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,070
500 a day for a stunt double

801
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,160
is quite low indeed.

802
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,790
Why don't you work for me?

803
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,830
Name your price.

804
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,390
What do you need me to do?

805
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,570
I haven't decided yet.

806
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,190
I'll tell you after I've made up my mind.

807
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,590
But can you tell me

808
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,010
why you're so short of money?

809
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,080
My mother's sick.

810
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,500
I need money for her treatment.

811
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,260
Then how about this?

812
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,530
Just work for me from now on.

813
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,610
I'll cover your mother's

814
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,760
medical expenses.

815
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,660
Everything?

816
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,090
Do you know how much I need?

817
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,510
Give me your account number.

818
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:47,780
[Transfer]

819
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,960
[Transfer 300,000 yuan]

820
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,820
[Your account ending with 9172 has received 300,000 yuan from the account ending with 3393]

821
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,660
If you don't agree,

822
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,220
take this 300,000 as a gift.

823
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,520
If you agree,

824
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,050
contact me with this phone.

825
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,780
But there's a price.

826
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,350
All your identification info

827
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,310
is under my control.

828
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,570
You can't question

829
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,350
what I ask you to do.

830
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,300
Okay?

831
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:27,950
I agree.

832
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,260
Later,

833
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:33,910
he sent my mom

834
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,650
to the best hospital

835
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,020
with the best medicine

836
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,150
and hired a caretaker for her.

837
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,530
So I started to work for him.

838
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,900
What exactly did you do?

839
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,750
At first,

840
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,060
I just threatened

841
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,230
his competitors

842
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,090
and stalked some people.

843
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,330
Later,

844
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,790
he asked me to disguise as Deng Man.

845
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,290
After that,

846
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,950
it was murder.

847
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,480
Remember,

848
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,960
just let her see it.

849
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,320
Don't hurt her.

850
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,050
Got it.

851
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,240
Do it as planned tonight.

852
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,220
Remember,

853
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,830
you must throw Wang Qianqian

854
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,080
into the artificial lake.

855
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,240
Why is it you?

856
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,540
You're the boss she was talking about?

857
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,800
Are you crazy?

858
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,020
Why did you kidnap me?

859
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,090
Over the phone that day,

860
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,870
I couldn't hear clearly.

861
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,880
So,

862
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,270
I personally came to ask you.

863
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,260
Did you warn me about

864
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,780
my involvement with

865
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:48,960
Deng Man's death?

866
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,570
I just said it out of spite.

867
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,860
You just happened

868
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,300
to call me

869
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,820
when I was fuming.

870
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,090
But I wasn't targeting you.

871
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,990
We've known each other for years.

872
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,230
Do you have to kidnap me

873
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,770
here for this?

874
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:12,910
Did you

875
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,320
not understand what I just said?

876
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:15,930
I'll say it again.

877
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,310
Did you tell me

878
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,670
on the phone that...

879
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,630
I'm also part of

880
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:25,870
Deng Man's death?

881
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,280
If anything happens to me,

882
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:32,710
no one can live.

883
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,630
I did say that.

884
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,070
But that's because

885
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,530
you forced me into it.

886
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,670
You blamed me as soon as you called.

887
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,240
Besides, you were the one

888
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,400
who came up with that idea.

889
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,630
So...

890
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,750
you have evidence?

891
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,230
Before cooperating,

892
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,190
I told you that

893
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,830
we'll each take what we need.

894
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,060
It was this way in the past,

895
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,880
and it still is now.

896
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,450
But this time,

897
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,470
you've crossed the line.

898
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,170
I've been trying

899
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,590
to find a chance to explain

900
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,270
this to you.

901
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,030
I was wrong for this.

902
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,470
I know you love Lu Yan.

903
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,630
I pushed her down.

904
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,280
I went too far.

905
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,380
But from my point of view,

906
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,240
think about it.

907
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,510
She really went too far.

908
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,430
All these years,

909
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,390
I've never touched

910
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:38,990
even a hair of hers.

911
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,350
But what'd she do?

912
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,430
She gathered so many people

913
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,730
to mess with me at my big event.

914
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:46,330
Now my career and life are gone.

915
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,510
I-If it were you,

916
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,610
wouldn't you be furious too?

917
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,210
You wouldn't have just let it go.

918
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,390
So why'd you kidnap me?

919
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,570
What do you want me to do?

920
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:00,510
Tell me.

921
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,760
Give me the evidence.

922
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,290
I'll find a way to send you abroad.

923
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,380
I can give you the evidence.

924
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,110
But you have to send me abroad first.

925
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,100
Ding Jing.

926
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,770
Do you know what

927
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,750
I hate the most?

928
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,680
Disobedience.

929
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,230
People...

930
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:35,390
who...

931
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,490
disobey!

932
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,760
I'll behave.

933
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:49,550
What do you mean?

934
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,110
I've searched

935
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,440
Ding Jing's home and company.

936
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,640
I didn't find anything.

937
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:55,880
Could it be that

938
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,950
she doesn't have evidence?

939
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:58,300
Can you guarantee that?

940
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,040
I'm sorry.

941
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,770
If you still want to see her,

942
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,710
you know what to do.

943
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,180
Don't worry.

944
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:09,920
I will find it.

945
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:15,000
I really had no choice.

946
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,710
There's no other way I could

947
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,750
get enough money for her kidney transplant.

948
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,220
I didn't expect

949
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,930
him to break his promise.

950
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:30,760
Do you have

951
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,630
any records of your liaison

952
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,000
with him?

953
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,810
Apart from transferring money to me

954
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,070
with his phone

955
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,230
when we first met,

956
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,320
he always

957
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:45,940
called me.

958
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,760
He gave me a phone.

959
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,560
When you caught me,

960
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,150
I destroyed it.

961
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,290
When you later

962
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,870
went to Ding Jing's home,

963
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,660
what were you looking for?

964
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,340
Ding Jing said...

965
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:08,890
she had evidence

966
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,450
of Wen Peng

967
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:14,230
killing Deng Man with her.

968
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:17,890
I think it's a USB.

969
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:32,200
Li Ruonan.

970
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,630
I don't think

971
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:36,830
we'd ever

972
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,230
meet again.

973
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:42,410
Tell me.

974
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,810
Is there anything you want

975
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,240
to say or do?

976
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:49,550
Tell me.

977
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,160
If I can make it happen,

978
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:53,590
I'll help you.

979
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:55,390
Thank you.

980
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,230
If...

981
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,470
If...

982
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,230
If it's possible...

983
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,600
I think when I die,

984
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,080
I'd like to be buried with my mom.

985
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:25,490
Okay?
