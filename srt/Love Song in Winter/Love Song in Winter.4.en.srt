767
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,160
Do you know why I

768
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,190
became a police officer then?

769
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,360
Of course I knew.

770
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,390
It's because of

771
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,670
your dad.

772
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,390
There was some influence

773
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,230
from my dad.

774
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,840
But...

775
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,880
the most fundamental reason

776
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,390
is actually you.

777
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,560
♫Hand in hand, we can even possess the equator♫

778
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,350
♫The beauty of the aurora and white snow in harmony♫

779
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,030
What else do you want to do

780
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,890
after you've become a policeman?

781
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,890
♫You close your eyes and make a wish, completely defenseless♫

782
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,830
Catch the bad guys.

783
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:40,470
♫I kiss your face secretly♫

784
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,980
I'll catch all of them.

785
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,600
I hope

786
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,600
♫I long to hold your hands and weave beautiful dreams for you♫

787
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,860
there will be no one

788
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,830
committing crimes in this world.

789
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,710
♫What we lack is not just time♫

790
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,920
But more importantly,

791
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,050
♫We lost track of time and the planned destination♫

792
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,920
I want to protect you.

793
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,300
♫Every page of handwritten love letter♫

794
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,520
Okay.

795
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,830
♫How should I express my love perfectly, my dear?♫

796
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,520
♫Romance is every scene that includes you♫

797
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,350
Then, you must protect me well.

798
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,560
What does the future mean?

799
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,770
♫Sweetly, just like family♫

800
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,470
♫How should I express my love perfectly, my dear?♫
