164
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,059
I did something similar

165
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,909
when I was younger too.

166
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,580
In your first year of high school,

167
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,270
I caught a kid;

16 years old.

169
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,600
After middle school,

170
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,710
he began working at a factory.

171
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,360
One day,

172
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,390
he had a dispute with the foreman

173
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,430
and hit him.

174
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,890
He's a big kid.

175
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,470
His punches caused

176
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,750
serious injury.

177
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,040
He should've been indicted

178
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,770
for assault.

179
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,210
After I detained him,

180
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,470
he was very apologetic.

181
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,100
He looked

182
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,410
to be around your age

183
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,670
and was obedient.

184
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,510
So I got soft-hearted.

185
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,670
I went to his parents

186
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,430
and suggested paying compensation

187
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,150
to try to get a lighter sentence.

188
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,670
His parents told me

189
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,470
they have no money

190
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,010
and we can deal with him

191
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:31,870
however.

192
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,520
My goodness.

193
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,870
So

194
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,140
I went to persuade

195
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,070
the victim

196
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,680
and got a letter of forgiveness.

197
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,910
I even personally

198
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,010
vouched for him

199
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,960
and applied for a lighter sentence

200
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,070
to the court.

201
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,010
Back then,

202
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,150
our former captain

203
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,060
told me to stay out of it.

204
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,220
He said that

205
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,580
if that kid violated the law

206
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,530
again,

207
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,050
everything I was doing

208
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,170
would be in vain.

209
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,880
I chose not to believe it.

210
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,480
In the end,

211
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,240
he was imprisoned for two years.

212
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,250
When he came out,

213
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,270
he was 18.

214
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,550
He was so young

215
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,150
with such a long way to go

216
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,220
in the future.

217
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,530
So I quickly

218
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,390
asked around to get him a job

219
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,110
so that he can integrate

220
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,350
into the society soon.

221
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,260
But not long after,

222
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,780
he killed someone.

223
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,240
The reason for the murder

224
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,360
was very simple.

225
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,710
It was because

226
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,430
of some minor arguments.

227
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,950
This time, my former captain

228
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,590
didn't let me go.

229
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,350
After my colleague detained him,

230
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,520
he told me that

231
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,980
that kid

232
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,370
was so apologetic.

233
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,080
He thought

234
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,000
he'd meet another

235
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,960
soft-hearted person like me

236
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,270
who'd help him suppress it.

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,550
When I wanted to join the police academy,

238
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,870
you were very supportive.

239
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,610
Then you suddenly changed your mind,

240
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,260
insisting that I go to a regular school.

241
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,710
Is it also related to this?

242
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,190
Yes.

243
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,570
I was worried

244
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,190
you'd encounter what you're going through now.

245
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,450
You know,

246
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,230
if you want to be a good cop,

247
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,630
you have to be really tough

248
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,200
mentally.

249
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,800
Do you regret helping him?

250
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,820
I regret being

251
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,270
so self-righteous.

252
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,670
That kid

253
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,800
receiving his due punishment

254
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,690
was the right way to help him

255
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,870
and protect him.

256
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,470
Son.

257
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,030
Since you've chosen

258
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:47,980
this path,

259
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,830
you must stick to

260
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,830
your principles.

261
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,720
Step by step,

262
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,040
advance honestly.

263
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
Failure to protect others

264
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,150
and excessive bias

265
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,980
are all taboos.

266
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,390
Remember this.

267
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,930
Understood.

268
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,620
Really?

269
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,470
Yes.

270
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,130
Jiang.

271
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,190
Jiang!

272
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,800
Wrong door.

273
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,960
He's injured

274
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,750
and resting at home.

275
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,480
Jiang!

276
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,340
Jiang!

277
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,110
-Jiang!
-Stop ringing.

278
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:32,850
What's up?

279
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,450
Where'd you go?

280
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,760
I just came up.

281
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,110
Is your back okay?

282
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,050
Almost.

283
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,890
Why are you two here?

284
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,160
We have something to discuss with you.

285
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,540
We looked into Mr. Ke.

286
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,490
He's not even

287
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,390
in our field.

288
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,860
We also heard that he was

289
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,760
imprisoned

290
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,990
for six years for fraud.

291
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,030
There must be something off.

292
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,510
Jiang.

293
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,830
Tell me. What should I do?

294
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,260
Reviewing this contract

295
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,030
isn't within my capabilities.

296
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,800
Get a commercial lawyer

297
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,510
to help you.

298
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,990
I did.

299
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,260
They said as per the contract,

300
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,190
there's no way out.

301
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,290
No way out?

302
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,230
Well then,

303
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,430
it'd be tough

304
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,410
to dispute this contract

305
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,080
legally.

306
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,280
Wait, c-can I

307
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,130
sue Mr. Ke

308
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,580
for fraud?

309
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,090
How will you sue him?

310
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,570
Because he has a criminal record?

311
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,720
You signed this contract voluntarily, right?

312
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,650
You signed it and stamped your fingerprint

313
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,990
after reading it, right?

314
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,490
So how's it fraud?

315
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,900
You signed it yourself.

316
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:37,860
Then...

317
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,980
What should we do?

318
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,070
Just leave it be?

319
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,920
We're trapped

320
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,040
by this project.

321
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,630
Zhong.

322
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,160
You've

323
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,300
never once suffered a loss,

324
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,000
so you've always been careless.

325
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,070
A contract stipulates

326
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,190
restrictive conditions on both parties'

327
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,040
actions.

328
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,560
And what's written in this?

329
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,110
You're giving him money

330
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,180
but he's restricting you.

331
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,710
No restrictions against him.

332
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,530
And you transferred

333
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,240
all the money in one go.

334
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,280
How'll you get it back?

335
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,770
Then... Then what should I do?

336
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,290
With this matter...

337
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,750
I think you can only discuss this with them.

338
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,430
Do your accounts

339
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,090
and see what's your limit.

340
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,940
Just try to minimize losses.

341
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,680
Discuss with whom?

342
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Wen Peng?

343
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,060
Him?

344
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,650
He gave us all sorts of excuses.

345
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,610
Wen Peng said

346
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,060
even if we withdraw now,

347
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,230
we won't get a penny.

348
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,050
It's my fault for trusting him

349
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,070
back then.

350
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,910
Since we're old friends,

351
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,230
I just got Dalu to skim through it

352
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,130
and signed it.

353
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,320
Now,

354
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,670
what I don't understand the most

355
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,190
is that

356
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,600
shouldn't Wen Peng have run a background check

357
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,920
on Mr. Ke

358
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,870
before cooperating with him?

359
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,090
Even I could find out his criminal record.

360
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,810
There's no way Wen Peng couldn't.

361
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,020
Well, his criminal record

362
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,650
doesn't affect

363
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,840
their cooperation.

364
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,310
But...

365
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,500
I now suspect

366
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,680
they're in cahoots!

367
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,900
What does Wen Peng get from this?

368
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,760
He invested money in it too.

369
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,030
To suffer losses with me?

370
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,720
What for?

371
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,230
Read the contract carefully.

372
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,270
You invested your money

373
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,590
into their project.

374
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,050
How he'll use the money

375
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,120
is up to him.

376
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,470
You have no say.

377
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,830
When did you start

378
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,550
working with him?

379
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,410
It was...

380
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,210
On the day you made up with Lu Yan.

381
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,980
Weren't we having hotpot?

382
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,090
I went to his office

383
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,670
in the afternoon

384
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,780
with two bottles of good wine.

385
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,100
I told him

386
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,040
you made up with Lu Yan

387
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,450
and Tang Jie's pregnant.

388
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,280
So I asked if I could

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Pseudonym...

583
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,200
No wonder

584
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,030
we couldn't find her

585
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:18,760
in the credits.

586
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,940
Keep playing it.

587
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,570
[Ninghai Runying Pictures Co., Ltd.]

588
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,890
Wen Peng's company?

589
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,210
Qin Yue.

590
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,020
Go check up on

591
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,250
martial arts director...

592
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,760
What’s his name... Liu Lin.

593
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,750
Find out where he is.

594
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,780
If you find him,

595
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,850
ask him about

596
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,660
Li Ruonan.

597
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,340
Okay.

598
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,100
Let's go.

599
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,770
Hao,

600
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,330
stay to help Jiang.

601
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,310
How'd you figure out

602
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,190
that Li Ruonan

603
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,550
is linked to Wen Peng?

604
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,400
Because of something Yu Bofeng said.

605
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,740
You're all birds of a feather.

606
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,200
You framed Aunt Wang back then.

607
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,430
Would you let me go now?

608
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,550
Through the mouths

609
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,520
of the police,

610
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,120
I can't even imagine

611
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,180
what a deplorable villain I'd become.

612
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,990
What do you mean?

613
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,900
Didn't you say it yourself?

614
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,890
Regardless if Aunt Wang was a thief or not,

615
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,730
to protect yourselves,

616
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,670
you'd classify her as one.

617
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,470
After thinking about it,

618
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,270
I'm sure I've never said that.

619
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,390
So you mean...

620
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,410
Wen Peng

621
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,480
twisted your words?

622
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,670
Think about it.

623
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,690
As the head

624
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,260
of a talent agency,

625
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,990
he just wants me

626
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,000
to stop seeing Yu Bofeng.

627
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,710
But I've agreed to that.

628
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,340
So why did he go one step further?

629
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,740
Let's assume that Wen Peng

630
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,120
is the mastermind.

631
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,120
Then he must be in contact

632
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,450
with Li Ruonan.

633
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,130
Li Ruonan came to Ninghai City after

634
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,540
graduating from martial arts school.

635
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,900
It's most likely that

636
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,950
she'd be a stunt double for films and series.

637
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,400
If we could

638
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,310
find Li Ruonan

639
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,610
in Wen Peng's works,

640
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,750
doesn't it prove that

641
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,940
the two of them

642
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,600
are more or less associated?

643
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,610
Should we look for Wen Peng?

644
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,260
It's not the time yet.

645
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:13,940
Let's wait a bit more.

646
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,970
Director, you see,

647
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,020
we're here

648
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,250
to ask you about something.

649
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,850
Do you know her?

650
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,140
I heard she was

651
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,900
a stunt double in your film.

652
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,360
I know her.

653
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,820
She's Xiao Wei.

654
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,860
Xiao Wei?

655
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,190
Are you close?

656
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,740
Not really.

657
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,680
I just know her through work.

658
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,630
How did you know each other?

659
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,940
We were shooting "Love On a Sunny Day."

660
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,500
The female lead's stunt double was injured

661
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,300
and we needed a replacement.

662
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,390
So the assistant director

663
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,550
introduced a stuntwoman.

664
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,750
I checked her out

665
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,280
and her skills and basics

666
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,640
were all decent.

667
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,050
So she stayed on.

668
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,490
Was there anyone from the crew

669
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,950
who was close to her

670
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,540
or interacted a lot with her?

671
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,720
Well, Xiao Wei

672
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,260
was very unsociable.

673
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,730
She rarely spoke.

674
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,460
At the set, she just

675
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,370
worked,

676
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,030
got her pay, and left.

677
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,940
Did your boss, Mr. Wen,

678
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,750
interact with

679
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,510
Xiao Wei?

680
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,550
Mr. Wen?

681
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,540
I doubt it.

682
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,120
Investors seldom

683
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,290
come on set.

684
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,760
Right, I remember.

685
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,800
It was when

686
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,740
we were about to wrap.

687
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,510
On set,

688
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,710
Xiao Wei got into a fight with

689
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,570
the assistant director.

690
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,390
I think

691
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,180
Mr. Wen was there that day.

692
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,910
Why did they fight?

693
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,270
I don't know why

694
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,400
specifically.

695
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,820
It was probably...

696
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,840
about money.

697
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,440
Because though Xiao Wei

698
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,480
rarely spoke,

699
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,030
I could sense that

700
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,570
she cared about money.

701
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,240
Since Mr. Wen was there,

702
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,670
how did he handle that?

703
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,750
It was such a big deal.

704
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,640
The assistant director

705
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,900
was seriously injured

706
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,250
and insisted on calling the cops.

707
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,060
Mr. Wen stepped up and suppressed it.

708
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,380
I think Mr. Wen had to

709
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,520
compensate him.

710
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,600
Director.

711
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,760
Don't mind me asking this,

712
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,670
but based on your

713
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,710
understanding of Mr. Wen,

714
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,290
if he spent so much money

715
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,730
to settle something for a girl,

716
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,670
do you think they

717
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,900
could've taken things

718
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,190
a step further or something?

719
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,900
No, I doubt that happened.

720
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,410
I don't think so.

721
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,680
I don't know the details.

722
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:18,810
Okay.

723
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,620
I'm just kidding.

724
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,400
Sorry for troubling you.

725
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:20,950
No problem.

726
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,350
Thanks, director.

727
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,440
Sorry for taking your time.

728
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,200
Okay, okay.

729
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:23,670
Thanks, guys.

730
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:24,830
Okay, bye.

731
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,350
Bye.

732
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,490
[Police]

733
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,130
If that's the case,

734
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,550
we can link

735
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,350
all of them with Wen Peng.

736
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,470
Deng Man,

737
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,250
Yu Bofeng,

738
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,000
Zhou Zhicheng, Ding Jing, Wang Qianqian,

739
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,270
and even Jiang,

740
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,040
you too.

741
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,900
As long as Wen Peng's involved,

742
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,250
everyone can be linked together.

743
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,690
But with every incident,

744
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,100
Wen Peng had

745
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,030
a verified alibi.

746
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,140
We haven't figured out his motive either.

747
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,860
So we can't summon him now.

748
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,180
Yes.

749
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,160
Wen Peng has always kept

750
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,470
his own hands clean.

751
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,550
He also has verified

752
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,430
alibis.

753
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,060
So the question now is

754
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,170
that if Li Ruonan is his hands,

755
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,780
how's he controlling her?

756
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,360
With Li Ruonan's mother.

757
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,030
Any news from

758
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,760
Chengzhou?

759
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,240
Bits and pieces were sent back,

760
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,510
but they're all worthless.

761
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,780
Nothing about the whereabouts

762
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,230
of Li Ruonan's mother.

763
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,970
They're too slow.

764
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,150
How about I go there?

765
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,070
Sure.

766
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:38,980
Liu Hao.

767
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,120
Yes.

768
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,610
Go with Professor Yu.

769
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,200
At Chengzhou,

770
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,280
figure out everything about

771
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,480
Li Ruonan

772
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,100
and the whereabouts

773
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,560
of her mother.

774
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,570

00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,510
Why?

969
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,460
Chengyi.

970
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,840
Is Wen Peng

971
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,750
related to the case you're

972
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,430
investigating?

973
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,720
A probable suspect.

974
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,830
Is it because you're

975
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,070
worried about your mom,

976
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,200
so you...

977
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,600
I wanted to see

978
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,550
whether she could accept it.

979
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,320
I wanted to see her reaction.

980
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,540
But I ended up...

981
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,520
Remember,

982
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,930
you're a police officer.

983
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,450
Do what you should do.

984
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,580
Your mom will understand.

985
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,480
You shouldn't have come, Wen.

986
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,070
I don't want you to

987
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,910
see me like this.

988
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,960
Because of my incompetence,

989
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,750
you're suffering.

990
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,320
Don't say that.

991
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:29,990
You've done more than

992
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:30,890
enough for me.

993
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,500
I’ve always wanted to

994
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,050
reconcile this with Jiang Chengyi.

995
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,180
But he

996
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,990
really wouldn't yield.

997
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,520
Originally,

998
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,420
this matter

999
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,550
isn't that serious.

1000
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,310
As long as he forgives you,

1001
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,730
it'll blow over.

1002
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,520
But he...

1003
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,950
I don't want his forgiveness.

1004
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,320
Let him destroy me.

1005
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,510
It's not his

1006
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,510
first time anyway.

1007
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,020
How about this?

1008
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:04,810
For the next few days,

1009
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,520
Be good while you're inside

1010
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,310
and calm yourself down.

1011
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,180
We'll talk after you get out.

1012
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,070
Wait for me, Wen.

1013
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,280
I'll wait for you.

1014
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,000
But I promise this matter

1015
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,810
won't just end like this.

1016
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,250
You're back.

1017
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,250
Yes, I'm back.

1018
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,420
What's wrong?

1019
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,360
Why are you sighing so much?

1020
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,400
I discovered something,

1021
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,150
but I don't know how to talk about it.

1022
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,970
What is it?

1023
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,840
Wen Peng's...

1024
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,950
biological mother

1025
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,880
is my mother.

1026
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,600
Are you kidding?

1027
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,340
It's true.

1028
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,370
All these years,

1029
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,630
Wen Peng hasn't contacted her.

1030
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,530
She couldn't find Wen Peng either.

1031
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,230
But Wen Peng was in

1032
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,030

1034
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,170
No wonder he was

1035
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,790
always so

1036
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,870

Hello, Coach.

1048
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,310
I want to join the basketball team.

1049
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:06,940
Kid.

1050
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,010
This is the school team.

1051
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,850
You need to pass the tryouts.

If you want to play,

1053
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,960
you can join your department team first.

1054
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,900
Do they play in the department competition too?

1055
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,630
Yes.

you can ask your department's captain.

1061
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:30,390
Thank you, Coach.

1062
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,140
What a coincidence,

1063
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:40,950
really.

1064
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,340
He...

1065
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,040
He was always so hostile to you because

1066
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,310
he transferred

1067
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,590
his hatred onto you?

1068
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,010
Like you said,

1069
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,340
his dad beat him up as a kid

1070
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,420
and his mother abandoned him,

1071
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,720
so he might hate me.

1072
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,970
But what does this

1073
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:05,910
have to do with me?

1074
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,930
I was abandoned by my own mother too.

1075
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,670
No, it's...

1076
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,500
So...

1077
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,130
I was wondering why

1078
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,900
you asked me about Wen Peng.

1079
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,410
Are you investigating him?

1080
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,370
I've been investigating something,

1081
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,610
and I think something's off

1082
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:32,710
with Wen Peng.
