I want to ask you something.

Have you read this book?

Why are you reading this book?

10
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,270
Have you fallen in love with someone

Don't make fun of me.

13
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,710
It's just

14
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,380
I've been investigating a case,

15
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,770
and there's been no clue.

16
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,950
But recently, I found that

17
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,380
the girl involved

18
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,430
had been

19
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,910
borrowing this book

20
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,840
from the school library when she was in college.

21
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,840
She borrowed it many times

22
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,390
and never returned it in the end.

[Hiroshima Mon Amour]

24
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,750
I was thinking,

25
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,530
if a college girl

26
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,030
reads this book every day...

27
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,760
I don't know.

28
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,570
Can you analyze this girl's

psychological state

30
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,670
from this perspective?

31
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,230
"Hiroshima Mon Amour"

32
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,220
is mainly about how

33
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,310
the heroine fell in love uncontrollably

34
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,430
with the male lead under the background of war.

35
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,810
Besides, both of them had their own families,

36
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,880
and the male lead

37
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,990
was even an invader.

38
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,230
At that time,

39
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,510
it was against common ethics

40
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,650
and even despised by the world.

41
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,840
If the victim

42
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,720
projected so much emotion

43
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,500
on this book,

44
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,550
it's very likely that

45
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,280
she also fell in love with

46
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,310
someone she shouldn't have.

47
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,020
The other person

48
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,010
might have major differences

49
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,800
from her

50
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,390
in terms of status, class, and stance.

51
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,080
Or

52
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,590
their relationship

53
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,300
could not be known to outsiders

54
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,270
or accepted by the world.

55
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,240
That's my speculation.

56
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,320
It's just speculation.

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,960
So what kind of person

58
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,670
do you think this college girl

59
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,470
could have fallen in love with?

60
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,970
There are many possibilities.

67

If the police received the anonymous letter,

68
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,350
they would definitely contact the school.

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,600
You can leave right now.

193
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,720
I'm waiting for my dad to come back

194
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,780
so I can ask him for money.

195
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,390
I want to see

196
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,620
where he spent all his money.

197
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,740
We're having dinner with Jiang Chengyi's parents this weekend.

198
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,430
Don't give my dad dirty looks

199
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,390
during dinner.

200
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,290
What is this? So ugly.

201
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,800
[To Ding Jing]

202
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,120
[To Ding Jing]

203
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,770
No problem.

204
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,650
Then leave this one to me.

205
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,540
I'll take it.

206
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,790
Not today.

207
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,160
I don't have enough time today.

208
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,000
How about tomorrow?

209
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,210
I'll go see you tomorrow.

210
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,480
Sure.

211
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,500
I know what you did

212
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,360
to Deng Man.

213
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,010
Close the door.

214
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,730
I said, close the door.

215
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,680
Let me show you something.

216
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,020
Why do you have this video?

217
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,050
Stay away from me.

218
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,980
Making so much noise.

219
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,080
Aren't you worried the whole school will know about this?

220
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,280
Miss.

221
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,830
10 yuan for parking.

222
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,180
You scared me!

223
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,280
Jing.

224
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,250
Did you crawl here? Why so slow?

225
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,020
Dear princess.

226
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,290
I'm not like you, okay?

227
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,170
I have to work.

228
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,470
I had to sneak out

229
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,910
in advance to be here.

230
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,650
What's wrong?

231
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,590
Are you in a bad mood?

232
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,360
Someone followed me

233
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,210
and sent me an anonymous letter

234
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,190
to threaten me.

235
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,770
Someone followed you?

236
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,280
Who was it?

237
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,490
Did you call the police?

238
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,850
Enough! You're so annoying.

239
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,120
How would I know who it was?

240
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,470
I called you here today

241
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,140
to ask you for a favor.

242
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,180
Help me contact Wang Qiang

243
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,590
and ask him for something.

244
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,270
What is it?

245
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,300
Pepper spray,

246
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,740
an alarm,

247
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,790
or a taser.

248
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,430
A stun gun would work too.

249
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,460
A stun gun?

250
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,980
But it's illegal.

251
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,120
Wang Qiang can get it.

252
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,870
All you need to do is go find him.

253
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,600
Also, help me ask him

254
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,350
how the thing I asked him to do is going.

255
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,910
Jing.

256
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,620
How about you

257
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,350
contact him directly in the future?

258
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,140
I'm worried it might be

259
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,350
inconvenient sometimes if you keep contacting him through me.

260
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,190
Jing.

261
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,200
Don't get me wrong.

262
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,530
That's not what I meant.

263
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,300
I mean,

264
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,100
I don't know very well

265
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,540
about what's going on between you two.

266
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,420
Sometimes,

267
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,790
the message you convey to me

268
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,030
is just a few words.

269
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,230
I... I'm worried if I can't explain it clearly,

270
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,980
I'll waste your time.

271
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,080
You're worried you'd waste your own time, right?

272
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,670
Liu Yujie.

273
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,140
I think I need to remind you.

274
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,570
Your dad,

275
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,420
your mom,

276
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,980
and you.

277
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,550
I'm providing for your whole family.

278
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,320
Without me,

279
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,000
your family would have gone bankrupt

280
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,230
10,000 times, okay?

281
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,010
Jing.

282
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,340
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,980
I was rude just now.

284
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,900
Please don't be angry, Jing.

285
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,930
Remember,

286
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,440
just do

287
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,390
as I say.

288
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,610
Contact Wang Qiang

289
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,770
and get me the thing and the photos I want as soon as possible.

290
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,390
You know

291
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,580
how impatient I am.

292
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,000
I know.

293
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,050
Jing, where are you going?

294
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,910
Liu Yujie...

295
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,810
Are you following me?

296
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,760
So it's you who's been following me!

297
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,990
I wondered who put it there.

298
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,080
It was you, wasn't it?

299
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,950
I don't even know what you're talking about!

300
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,590
You don't know?

301
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,910
Don't you know what this is?

302
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,560
I don't know.

303
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,480
You don't know?

304
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,990
Only you know things about me.

305
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,680
You don't know?

306
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,360
It wasn't me!

307
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,230
Jing, let go of me!

308
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,550
Only you know I'd be here.

309
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,530
Excuse me, Miss.

310
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,120
Please...

311
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,860
Please do not disturb

312
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,870
other customers' dining.

313
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,800
Surveillance camera.

314
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,590
Show me the surveillance footage.

315
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,610
I want to see the surveillance footage.

316
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,500
-As for the surveillance footage,
-Let go of me!

317
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,730
only the police can check it.

318
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,410
I'm sorry.

319
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,870
No. I have to check it today!

320
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,250
I lost something here!

321
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,500
If you keep doing this,

322
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,570
I'll have to call the police.

323
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,610
Let go!

324
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,480
What are you looking at?

325
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,230
Move!

326
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,790
Sorry about that.

327
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,690
Sorry.

328
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,720
Sorry.

329
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,080
What's wrong with you!

330
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,750
Sorry about that. Sorry.

331
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,720
You're stalking me, huh?

332
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,260
You want to mess with me?

333
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,960
Aren't you worried

334
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,349
I'd expose all the things you did back then?

335
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,780
It wasn't you?

336
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,280
Who else could it be?

337
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:30,960
Is there a third person

338
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,360
who knows about this?

339
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,020
Then go ahead and investigate.

340
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,470
Go find out who's playing these tricks

341
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,730
behind my back.

342
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,040
Anyway, I'm telling you,

343
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,470
if this kind of thing

344
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,500
happens again,

345
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,680
I'll expose

346
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,630
all those things you've done!

347
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,760
I'll drag you to hell with me!

348
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,550
What the hell is this!

349
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,830
If it wasn't her,

350
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,670
who else could it be?

351
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,230
Could it be...

352
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,110
[Public Security]

353
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,320
According to the clues we found,

354
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,310
we've compared

355
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,930
the information of

356
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,200
all women aged 18 to 35

357
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,790
with a medical background

358
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,550
in this city.

359
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,110
We've ruled out

360
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,840
the possibility of the murderer

361
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,160
having a medical background.

362
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:26,790
Yiming.

363
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,870
How's it going on your side?

364
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,590
Not very well.

365
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,640
The portraits have been distributed

366
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,430
to the local police stations.

367
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,280
But according to the feedback,

368
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,680
there were only few valuable clues.

369
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,550
I just contacted

370
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,230
the traffic police battalion, too.

371
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,870
They said

372
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,760
they've never seen this person.

373
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,350
She disappeared just like that?

374
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,400
That seems impossible.

375
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,560
It's okay.

376
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,760
Notify all departments

377
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,710
and ask them to keep watching.

378
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,540
She won't be able to escape.

379
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,350
Okay.

380
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:48,750
Got it.

381
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,550

00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,580
your father's friends, after all.

574
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,030
Don't say that.

575
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,380
We are different.

576
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,430
So you wouldn't do business with me

577
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,740
if it weren't for my dad?

578
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,780
That's nonsense.

579
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,880
Your porcelain

580
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,750
is of such high quality.

581
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,280
It’s really worth collecting.

582
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,810
Han, am I right?

583
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:58,630
Yes.

584
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,190
It's really worth collecting.

585
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,330
Jing.

586
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,200
We should communicate more in the future.

587
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:03,970
Sure.

588
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,030
Come on.

589
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,850
Let's propose a toast to Jing together.

590
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,440
Alright. Alright.

591
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:07,710
Come on.

592
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,150
Come on.

593
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:08,590
You're too kind.

594
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,340
A toast to you.

595
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,900
Pour me wine.

596
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,830
This is really great.

597
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,640
I forgot.

598
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:16,640
Yeah.

599
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:17,750
Come on, Jing.

600
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,030
Come on.

601
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:18,960
-Be my guest.
-Come on, Jing.

602
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,580
Come on.

603
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,410
You can really hold your liquor, Jing.

604
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,340
Good for you.

605
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,480
I specially prepared some gifts

606
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,420
for you today.

607
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,030
I thought you could bring them back

608
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,850
to your families.

609
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,790
You're too kind.

610
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:29,910
It's nothing.

611
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:30,430
You're too kind.

612
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,150
It's nothing.

613
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,100
It's not necessary.

614
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,220
We should keep the goodies within the group, right?

615
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,020
Seriously.

616
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,030
Thank you. Thank you.

617
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,730
Be careful.

618
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,780
Thank you.

619
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,090
Uncle Huang, take a look.

620
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,780
Such a big gift.

621
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,290
Uncle Han, this is yours.

622
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,990
I picked all these

623
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,310
myself.

624
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:46,830
Really?

625
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,430
That's really nice of you.

626
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,110
So nice.

627
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,930
Let me take a look.

628
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,160
Let me see my gift.

629
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,710
The quality of these porcelains

630
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,820
are really great.

631
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,290
So nice of you.

632
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,630
Good stuff. Good stuff.

633
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,560
Nice quality.

634
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,400
See? It's done just like that.

635
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,630
I'm sure you'll make it.

636
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,910
You have great taste.

637
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,410
These old men.

638
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,480
This...

639

642
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,310
to Deng Man?

643
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,190
You'll die a horrible death?

644
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,340
You killed Deng Man, right?

645
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,740

on all their cards.

What should we do?

00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,780
What's going on, Jing?

656
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,870
Ding Jing.

657
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,740
You have only one choice now.

658
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,200
Admit on Weibo

659
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,880
what you did to Deng Man back then.

660
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,030
Otherwise, you'll suffer the consequences.

A-Are we

663
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,070
being followed, Jing?

664
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,110
Should we call the police?

Wait.

Why are you

672
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,470
dressed like this?

673
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,020
I just...

674
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,740
Have something to do.

675
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,980
Why are you here?

676
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,580
To see me?

677
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:10,890
Yes.

678
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,690
Because

679
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,830
you haven't replied to my WeChat messages the past couple of days.

680
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,750
I was a little worried,

681
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,780
so I came to check on you.

682
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,150
I...

683
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,790
There's no need to worry about me.

684
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,710
It's just

685
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,990
I've been busy lately.

686
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,870
Have you been working overtime at the hospital?

687
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,420
I'm off.

688
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,860
Lu Yan!

Lu Yan.

691
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,060
I know

692
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,880
you don't want to see me now.

693
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,590
We don't have to meet.

694
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,950
But please,

695
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,550
at least reply to my messages,

696
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,380
okay?

697
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,520
I...

698
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,250
Okay.

[Huiting Complex]

700
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,580
Morning, Lu.

701
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,070
Morning.

702
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,050
Why are you here?

703
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,040
I want to know if you're free today.

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,000
What's the matter?

705
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,870
That medical drama I'm working on

706
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,900
is a bit tight in schedule.

707
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,590
The scriptwriter wants you to be his consultant.

708
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,840
I remember

709
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,910
I have no surgery this afternoon.

710
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,860
I think I can get off work on time.

711
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,160
That's great.

712
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,140
Text me after work.

713
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:35,910
I'll come pick you up.

714
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,710
It's no trouble at all.

715
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,310
Don't make it so grand.

716
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,610
I can go by myself.

717
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,100
I invited you to be my consultant.

718
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,850
Of course I have to show you my respect.

719
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,780
In the future,

720
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,670
I'll count on you on this project, Dr. Lu.

Let me give you a ride.

724
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,220
No need.

725
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,250
There's a traffic jam at this hour.

726
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,540
Riding a bike is faster.

727
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,700
Take the breakfast then.

728
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,280
Eat it at the hospital.

00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,100
Okay, I'm leaving.

Bye.

[Huiting Complex]

732
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,070
After reading the whole script,

733
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,800
I suggest

734
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,440
you change

735
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,990
the title "anesthetist" throughout the whole script

736
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,750
to "anesthesiologist".

737
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,380
Because we anesthesiologists

738
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,370
are the same as

739
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,050
physicians and surgeons.

740
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,090
We all need to pass

741
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,000
the examination for the qualifications of medical practitioners.

742
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,620
To put it simply,

743
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,750
many anesthetists

744
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,580
were nurses before.

745
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,670
So they're different

746
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,400
from us anesthesiologists.

747
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,310
For example, in the hospital,

748
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,670
if you

749
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,870
call us anesthesiologists "anesthetists,"

750
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,420
we'll correct you seriously

751
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,730
that you should call us anesthesiologists.

752
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:57,450
Indeed.

753
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,360
Back in school, our teacher said

754
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,190
anesthesiologists are the most knowledgeable.

755
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,360
Whether it's internal medicine

756
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,230
or surgery,

757
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,470
anesthesiologists can manage both.

758
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,860
Well,

759
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,940
this is still a bit exaggerated,

760
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,750
After all, everyone is a master in his own special field.

761
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,900
And this part.

00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,440
a patient wakes up,

766
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,430
what we care about more is

767
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,320
the patient's vitals,

768
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,100
and if he or she has really waken up.

769
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,610
But I can understand what you want to express.

770
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,760
You want to write it as a false alarm.

771
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,000
I think you can change it to

772
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,800
the patient waking up repeatedly.

773
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,040
Wake up repeatedly?

774
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,280
Is that okay?

775
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,000
Yes.

776
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,210
It really happened.

777
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,200
Once after a surgery,

778
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,310
I woke up the patient.

779
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,530
He asked me

780
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,560
what time it was,

781
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,230
and whether he could eat.

782
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:45,950
I told him

783
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,110
it was only 3 p.m.

784
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,150
He said,

785
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,390
I'll sleep for a bit longer then.

786
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,560
And he fell asleep.

787
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,710
I repeatedly

788
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,480
tried to wake him up

789
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,440
five times

790
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,030
before he finally woke up.

791
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,330
So it was actually...

792
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,760
Quite scary.

793
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,650
That's kind of crazy.

794
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,170
Are you off work?

795
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,110
Can we talk

796
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,330
if you have time?

797
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,250
Do you have work to do?

798
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,000
How about I drive you back to the hospital?

799
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,570
It's okay.

800
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,920
Let's finish

801
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,550
the script first.

802
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,540
Dr. Lu.

803
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,430
Please help me check

804
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,020
the third scene of Episode 16.

805
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,480
Does my wording make sense?

806
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,270
Sorry,

807
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,790
the subscriber you dialed

808
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,170
cannot be connected at the moment.

809
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,560
Please redial later.

810
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,110
Sorry...

811
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:36,620
[Entrecote]

812
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,030
Let me give you a ride.

813
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,900
No need. The car I called has arrived.

814
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,460
You helped me all night.

815
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,370
I'm a little embarrassed

816
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,430
that I couldn't treat you to dinner.

817
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,340
It's okay.

818
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,590
You still have a chance.

819
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,230
Really?

820
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,480
We still have a chance?

821
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,710
Don't get me wrong.

822
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,640
I mean,

823
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,960
don't tell me you don't have time

824
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,600
when I want to treat you to dinner next time.

825
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,140
I won't.

826
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,440
I’m leaving then.

827
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,240
Be careful.

828
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,420
Text me when you get home.

829
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,510
We definitely have a chance.

830
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:32,010
[Sure.]

831
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:32,010
[Are you off work? Can we talk?]

832
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,620
Sure.
