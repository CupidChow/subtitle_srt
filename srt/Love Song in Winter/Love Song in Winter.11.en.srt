00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,070
Lu.

197
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,340
I told you to rest at home.

198
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,230
Why are you here?

199
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,350
I have patients.

200
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,310
I'm going to do my rounds.

201
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:58,910
Dr. Han.

202
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,110
Should we force Lu

203
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,350
to rest?

204
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,750
Yeah.

205
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,230
How can she work like this?

206
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,230
Here.

207
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,190
Stop her surgeries

208
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,870
for these days.

209
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,110
You and Huang replace her.

210
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:15,950
Okay.

211
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,430
Matron Qiao,

212
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,030
keep an eye on her.

213
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,710
See if she can

214
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,030
complete her rounds

215
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,070
and pre-surgery visits.

216
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,470
If possible,

217
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,630
let her work

218
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,750
without doing surgeries.

219
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,670
Got it.

220
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,430
Under such circumstances,

221
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,550
leaving her alone at home

222
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,190
would be worrisome too.

223
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,120
Hello.

224
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,270
Captain Jiang.

225
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:45,630
Okay.

226
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,710
Okay.

227
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,710
Then see you

228
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,320
in the third-floor conference room.

229
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,670
The police are here.

230
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,260
Get ready.

231
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,430
Go to the conference room.

232
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,670
Yesterday, Qianqian

233
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,870
got off work earlier than me,

234
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,310
but she

235
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,150
helped me take

236
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,960
an emergency patient.

237
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,910
After she left the hospital,

238
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,960
we didn't contact each other.

239
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,030
Yes.

240
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,270
Wang Qianqian and Huang Wei

241
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,430
came to the emergency room to help.

242
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,550
It was around

243
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,590
10 P.M.

244
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,270
Because I sent her

245
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,990
a WeChat message

246
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,550
and told her

247
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,790
the patient has been stabilized.

248
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,430
She replied to me.

249
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,990
Around 10 P.M.?

250
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:21,910
When exactly

251
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,900
did she leave?

252
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,790
I think she left

253
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,990
around 8:30 at night.

254
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,470
Oh,

255
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,870
she left with Qiao Rui.

256
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:30,910
Yes.

257
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,910
Wang Qianqian and I

258
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,310
took the bus to get off work.

259
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,140
We both took route 396.

260
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,630
It's at the hospital entrance.

261
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,670
But I didn't pay attention

262
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,510
to the exact time.

263
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,110
I only remember

264
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,590
she always got off at Xincheng Garden.

265
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,430
I got off at Linhe Intersection,

266
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,270
three stops before her.

267
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,270
I'm here.

268
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,110
Bye. Bye.

269
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,550
See you tomorrow.

270
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,830
Bye.

271
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,110
Matron Qiao,

272
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,750
did Wang Qianqian

273
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,430
have any emotional changes

274
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,000
recently

275
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,150
or

276
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,510
did something happen?

277
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,550
Or did she

278
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,750
have any conflicts in the hospital?

279
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,550
Absolutely not.

280
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,990
Qianqian was quite cheerful.

281
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,430
She was a bit clumsy,

282
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,750
but everyone could tolerate her.

283
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,590
Matron Qiao

284
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,350
was the one who trained her,

285
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,510
so she occasionally critiqued her,

286
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,870
but it was for her own good.

287
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,350
She

288
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,310
rarely had conflicts with patients.

289
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,830
But her boyfriend

290
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,830
is a jerk.

291
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,310
He's controlling.

292
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,430
Once,

293
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,350
I saw them

294
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,430
arguing at the door.

295
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,190
Lu Yan protected her.

296
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:45,950
Yes.

297
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,070
Lu Yan knows

298
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,150
Wang Qianqian the best.

299
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,030
We all know

300
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,150
their relationship

301
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,270
was very close.

302
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,950
Lu Yan is in the hospital now.

303
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,430
But her condition

304
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,350
is very bad.

305
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,430
She might not be able to

306
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,790
answer your questions.

307
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,030
We've stopped her surgeries,

308
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,070
but we still let her work.

309
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,630
We want to distract her.

310
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,070
I'm afraid she'll take it too hard.

311
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,190
Should I call her over?

312
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,910
Yes.

313
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,140
Dr. Lu, you...

314
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,630
Are you okay?

315
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,270

316

Here is the thing.

00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,380
We want to ask you

318
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,830
about Wang Qianqian.

319
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,310
Is that okay?

320
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,390
Yes.

We

322
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,990
saw Wang Qianqian's call log.

323
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,030
The last call

324
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,990
was to you.

325
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,590
Right?

326
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,550
Actually,

327
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,150
this phone didn't connect.

328
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,030
Why didn't you answer?

329
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,350
My phone

330
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,830

see the missed call?

"Lu Yan, help me."

960

961
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,870
And then...

962

Nothing.
