00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,440
You just want to defeat Jiang Chengyi.

197
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,060
From beginning to end,

198
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,720
you only hate yourself.

199
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,130
Shut up! What do you know?

200
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,030
You kill people

201
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,790
to make up for your fear

202
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,520
and your childhood trauma.

203
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,030
Wen Peng, don't be silly.

204
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,740
Do you think doing this

205
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,430
will make someone love you?

206
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,870
In that case,

207
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,320
let me tell you.

208
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,330
Deng Man...

209
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,280
was also killed by me.

210
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,260
Jiang Chengyi!

211
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,530
Happy birthday.

212
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,490
Thank you.

213
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,750
I knitted it myself.

214
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,530
Look.

215
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,970
It's my first time doing such a thing.

216
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,330
Give me a chance.

217
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,220
I like you.

218
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,910
I really like you!

219
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,200
It's you?

220
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,360
What's up?

221
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,760
Why are you so mysterious?

222
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,870
You dared to come without knowing who it was?

223
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,740
You're quite brave.

224
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,430
Cut the crap.

225
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,800
Just say it.

226
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,840
What?

227
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,330
How much do you want?

228
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,120
I'm giving it for free.

229
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,810
Do whatever you want.

230
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,130
For free?

231
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,870
Are you that kind?

232
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,650
Why?

233
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,110
Because

234
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,950
we have the same goal.

235
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,790
Fine.

236
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,490
Wait for my good news.

237
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,550
You...

238
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,310
Don't take it too hard.

239
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,980
I really have no choice.

240
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,420
I don't want to hurt anyone.

241
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,870
How could Ding Jing

242
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,790
do such a thing?

243
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,150
I can't let Coach Zhou

244
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,220
lose his reputation.

245
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,480
What should I do?

246
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,190
What should I do?

247
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,430
Wen,

248
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,840
do you have any ideas?

249
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,600
I have an idea.

250
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,050
We can put on a show

251
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,840
to scare Ding Jing.

252
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,740
Have you made up your mind?

253
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,440
Yes.

254
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,090
You're right.

255
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,650
As long as Ding Jing thinks I'm dead,

256
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,410
she will be scared.

257
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,830
She won't dare to do anything again.

258
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,430
But I still hurt Lu Yan.

259
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,810
It's okay.

260
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,640
When everything is over,

261
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,430
you can

262
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,430
explain it to her.

263
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,700
Wen.

264
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,400
If Lu Yan thinks

265
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,470
I'm really dead,

266
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,400
will she think

267
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,550
she forced me to die?

268
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:41,740
No.

269
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,180
I will always be with her.

270
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,700
When the time is right,

271
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,640
I'll tell her the truth.

272
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,650
When the time is right?

273
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,750
If Lu Yan and Tang Jie

274
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,750
know in advance,

275
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,990
we'll definitely be exposed.

276
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,040
So,

277
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,180
we have to fool everyone

278
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,700
before we can fool Ding Jing.

279
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,070
I see.

280
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,970
After the video recording,

281
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,290
go hide in a hotel for a few days.

282
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,240
I'll give the video to Ding Jing

283
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,450
and tell her

284
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,200
she forced you to die.

285
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,190
I'll make her

286
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,700
hand over the video of you and Coach Zhou.

287
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,640
If she doesn't,

288
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,100
I'll tell the police.

289
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,020
Wen,

290
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,570
I'll leave the rest

291
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,850
to you then.

292
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,850
Please take care of Lu Yan for me.

293
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,420
She must not have anything happen to her.

294
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,380
Don't worry.

295
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,590
Is the will ready?

296
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,730
It's in my bag.

297
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,990
Per your instructions,

298
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,640
I didn't write Ding Jing's name.

299
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,150
The content is vague too.

300
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,530
Otherwise,

301
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,320
if the police see the suicide note,

302
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,030
they'll go to Ding Jing first.

303
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,390
Then the video will be wasted.

304
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,790
Wen,

305
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,230
you're really thoughtful.

306
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,510
Thank you for doing so much for me.

307
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,420
Are you ready?

308
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,310
Yes.

309
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,210
Let's start.

310
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,970
Ding Jing.

311
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,950
I'm desperate because of you.

312
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,480
I won't let you have your way.

313
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,940
Since you're forcing me,

314
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,850
I'll kill myself.

315
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,670
I want you to remember your entire life

316
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,310
that I died

317
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,570
because of you!

318
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,790
Deng Man.

319
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,200
Deng Man.

320
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,970
Wen!

321
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,630
Is it enough?

322
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,050
Yes, it's enough.

323
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,400
Come up now.

324
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,220
Help me!

325
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,230
Deng Man, grab the branch!

326
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,360
Hurry, grab the branch!

327
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,300
Help me!

328
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,120
If you really die,

329
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,390
Lu Yan and Jiang Chengyi...

330
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,400
Wen, help me!

331
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,540
Help me!

332
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,080
[So I'm destined not to get the person I want, right?]

333
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,080
[God seems to enjoy torturing me.]
[My looks are average, my family is average, my education is average.]

334
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,560
I will never forget

335
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,580
how she struggled in the lake.

336
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,850
She wanted me to save her.

337
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,890
But I didn't.

338
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,750
I just watched as she

339
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,120
slowly

340
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,000
sank to the bottom of the lake.

341
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,350
Why don't you go die?

342
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,710
You should die.

343
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,610
Why don't you go die?

344
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,490
Go to hell!

345
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,900
I will die.

346
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,390
But I want Jiang Chengyi

347
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,470
to personally see

348
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,560
you and I

349
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,470
die together.

350
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,750
Wen.

351
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,150
I'm here to see Lu Yan

352
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,510
on behalf of the school.

353
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,630
Is she okay?

354
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,250
She still has a fever.

355
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,790
It's been two days.

356
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,400
We'll have to go to a big hospital if she doesn't recover.

357
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,280
Wen,

358
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,070
can you do me a favor?

359
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,830
Lu Yan and I still have a thesis

360
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,980
that we haven't submitted.

361
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,630
I need to get it done.

362
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,720
Can you take care of her for me?

363
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,250
Sure, no problem.

364
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,690
Thank you, Wen.

365
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,630
Call me if you need anything.

366
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,470
I'll be back soon.

367
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:55,950
Okay.

368

Hello.

388
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,750
Captain Jiang,

389
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,760
you finally found me.

390
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,290
Keep walking.

391
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,380

Attention, everyone.

394
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,050
The suspect kidnapped the hostage.

395
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,780
They're in the Lehu Villa area 15 kilometers away

396

399
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,060
I request for the SWAT Team

what do you think of the scenery here?

404
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,850
It's beautiful!

405
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,660
It's very suitable

406
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,110
for us two to live together.

407
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,620
In the end,

411
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,100
I'm here today

412

to tell you that...

413
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,550
Alright, Captain Jiang.

414
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,690
I know what you want to say.

415
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,640
You just want to

416
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,860

417
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,230
and be the hostage, right?

418
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,550
Captain Jiang is so brave.

419
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,670
Are you doing this

420
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,220

00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,590

423

Captain Jiang, listen.

424

You will never get Lu Yan.

425
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,390

I want to tell you that

429
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,430

and despicable you are.

438
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,740
You put in so much effort

439

for me to find this place

440
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,150

442
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,390
You've done so many things

443

and killed so many people.

444
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,770
Isn't your final goal

00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,190
just to stop Lu Yan

446
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,270
from being with me?

447
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,350
Then you messed up.

448
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,900
Since you have the guts to kill,

449
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,950
then why don't you

450
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,710
just kill me?

Why won't you kill me?

You're a coward

453
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,480
and don't dare, right?

454
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,300

455
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:03,870
hide behind a woman

456
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,290

Attention, sniper.

479
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,239
The suspect is too close to the hostage

480
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,560
and they're connected by a rope.

481
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,500
