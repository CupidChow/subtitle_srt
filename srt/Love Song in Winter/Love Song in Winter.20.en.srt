L-Look at me.

5
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,580
I don't have a weapon.

6
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,750
I'll trade with him, okay?

7
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,070
I'll be the hostage. I'll go with you.

8
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:11,640
Okay.

9
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,250
Okay.

10
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,140
We're not exchanging.

11

You won't be able to leave like this.

How about I drive for you?

13
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,160
I'll drive you to wherever you want to go.

14
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,850
Okay?

Open the door.

I really didn't expect this.

Tell me. What's your name?

34

I'm asking you a question.

35

If you don't want to say it,

36
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,909
I'll say it for you.

37
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,580
Name, Li Ruonan.

38
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:40,909
Born on December 30,

39

1997,

40
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,490
in Chengzhou.

41
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,520
Your family was poor

42
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,310
and your father passed away early.

43
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,740
So you and mother

44
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,670
depended on each other.

45
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,530
You were sent to a martial arts academy ten years ago

46
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,100
but your grades were not good.

47
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,220
and you didn't make any much progress in school.

48
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,480
So you dropped out and wandered around the country,

49
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,110
working part-time jobs for a living.

50
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,230
Until three years ago,

51
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,940
you appeared in Ninghai.

52
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,760
You have no permanent residence,

53
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,750
so you helped others

54
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,660
deal with some special issues

55
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,090
and even started to kill.

56
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,620
Li Ruonan,

57
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,490
have you ever thought about

58
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,670
what kind of sentence

59
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,950
you might receive

60
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,950
if all these issues are combined?

61
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,750
We

62
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,830
are the only ones

63
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,950
that can help you.

64
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,150
I hope you can actively cooperate

65
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,880
and strive to achieve significant meritorious service.

66
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,590
Tell me, why did you kill them?

67
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,340
Who did I kill?

68
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,600
Li Ruonan.

69
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,510
You wouldn't think

70
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,430
we're trying to trick you, would you?

71
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,480
Without enough evidence,

72
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,070
do you think we can bring you here?

73
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,590
Based on the evidence we currently have,

74
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,980
it is sufficient to prove that

75
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,990
you committed the murder of

76
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,310
Wang Qianqian and Ding Jing.

77
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,810
Even if you don't say anything now,

78
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,230
you can't be cleared of suspicion.

79
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,110
Who is Wang Qianqian?

80
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,850
And who is Ding Jing?

81
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,030
Do you think the police

82
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,070
are merely decoration?

83
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,050
There's no use asking like this,

84
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,110
we won't get a confession.

to deny the allegations.

90
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,470
You know that right?

91
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,650
The evidence is solid.

92
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,000
Wouldn't it be better to

93
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,340
give yourself a chance at a reduced sentence?

94

Wouldn't it be better to strive for an early release

95
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,910
so you get to visit home

96

What are you doing this for?

00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,450
What's the point of

and mentioned her mother,

136
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,380

138
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,950

Half a month ago,

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,750
Dr. Lu went to Ding Jing's house.

202
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,550
But I checked.

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,360

211

the details.

306
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,890
I always thought

307
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,790
the reason why

308
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,030
she committed suicide

309
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:13,880
was because

310
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,130
she couldn't be with you.

311
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,030

312
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,390
she asked to meet up with me.

313
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,700

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,050
to break up with you

315
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,270
for her to be with you.

316
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,670
I didn't agree,

317
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,690

my words were

327
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,870

336
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,860

Come back!

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,880
Are your eyes there

387
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,260
to breathe?

388
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,360
Zhong Wenxuan.

389
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,880
What does that mean?

390
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,680
It's a pregnancy test stick.

391
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,220
I'm really worried that

392
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,800
my child's IQ will resemble yours.

393
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,480
You're pregnant?

394
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,070
I'm going to be a father!

395
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,980
That's great, honey!

396
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,720
Don't move.

397
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,070
Honey.

398
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,490
I'm so sorry.

399
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,840
You are now a key protection target.

400
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,080
I just got pregnant.

401
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,070
I'm not that delicate.

402
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:05,880
Well,

403
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,190
I'll tell Wen Peng that

404
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,650
I won't go to see him this afternoon.

405
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,750
We'll visit the hospital

406
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,590
for a checkup,

407
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,160
and then, go get

408
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,150
some baby products.

409
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,860
I also need to go to the bookstore.

410
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,010
What for?

411
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,110
To get a copy of the Cihai.

412
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,580
We need it to name the baby.

413
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,920
I don't want the study anymore.

414
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,650
Let's demolish it.

415
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,700
Build a baby's room instead.

416
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,130
I don't want these anymore.

417
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,060
Move them to the office.

418
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,890
Let's turn it into

419
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,210
our baby's game room.

420
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,920
No.

421
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,460
Let's not demolish anything.

422
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,350
Let's not demolish anything.

423
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,480
Let's move into a villa.

424
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,100
Buy a bigger house.

425
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:34,830
Enough, enough.

426
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,340
Stop.

427
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,180
Zhong,

428
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,090
don't make such a fuss.

429
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,720
Alright?

430
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,880
There's no rush.

431
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,030
The child's registration can only be done

432
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,150
when they're more than seven weeks old.

433
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,710
Besides,

434
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,590
we have nine months

435
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,110
to buy slowly things for the baby.

436
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:46,910
Also,

437
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,790
this house is big enough.

438
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,820
There's no need to change.

439
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,660
I have other plans today.

440
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:51,790
I'll listen to you, wifey.

441
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,470
Wait.

442
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,290
Why do you still have plans?

443
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:54,890
Yes.

444
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,640
You should follow your plan,

445
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,270
and then,

446
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,320
send me to Lu Yan's house on your way.

447
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,430
I want to tell her

448
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,950
this good news

449
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,200
and celebrate with her.

450
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,280
Yes, honey.

451
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,300
Shouldn't you celebrate with me?

452
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,980
Why are you celebrating with Lu Yan?

453
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,310
Who is the child's father?

454
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,410
Hang in there.

455
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,610
Come on.

456
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,050
What's wrong?

457
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,210
What's wrong?

458
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,230
You sprained your ankle?

459
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,160
Get on the chair.

460
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,670
Let's go.

461
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,650
Sit.

462
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,660
This foot?

463
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,810
I think so.

464
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,710
Let me see.

465
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,280
Does it hurt here?

466
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,350
Yes.

467
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,720
You sprained the outer side.

468
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,250
You shouldn't rub it.

469
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,340
Go back and apply an ice pack.

470
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,470
There's still a distance

471
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,710
from here to the campus.

472
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,250
How about this?

473
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,350
Wait for me for a while.

474
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,930
Where are you going?

475
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,150
Senior Wen.

476
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,010
Is your back seat

477
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,690
installed separately?

478
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,460
Yes.

479
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,680
Is it for your girlfriend?

480
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,720
It's not.

481
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,580
It's for Zhong.

482
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,450
Does Senior Zhong not own a bike?

483
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,310
If he's riding a bike,

484
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,800
how can he have breakfast in the morning?

485
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,490
Senior.

486
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,740
Do you have a girlfriend?

487
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,480
I don't.

488
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,430
What's wrong?

489
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,970
There's a pit over there.

490
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,240
Has your ankle recovered?

491
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,000
Thank you.

492
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,170
It's much better now.

493
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,300
Don't rub it tonight.

494
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,880
I'll bring you some medicine tomorrow.

495
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,340
See, the textbook is right.

496
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,250
Exercising helps to secrete dopamine

497
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,270
and make people feel happy.

498
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,710
Are you stupid?

499
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,840
This is obviously happiness

500
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,030
brought by a man.

501
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,370
Lu Yan.

502
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,400
Lu Yan.

503
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,670
You heard it.

504
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,990
Leniency to those who confess, severity to those who resist.

505
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,110
What's the progress of

506
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:10,750
your relationship with Jiang Chengyi?

507
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,110
What do you mean?

508
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,550
Don't see everyone in that light

509
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,690
once you and Zhong got together.

510
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
There's...

511
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,640
There's nothing between us.

512
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,680
Yan, tell me.

513
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,730
Are you interested in

514
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,340
Jiang Chengyi?

515
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,870
No.

516
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,450
He just gave me

517
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,820
an ice pack as my senior.

518
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,970
Why are you smiling so widely if there's nothing?

519
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,170
Alright.

520
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,180
I admit it.

521
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,000
Just a little.

522
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,820
-Just...
-A little?

523
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,270
A little.

524
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,350
Isn't it this much now?

525
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,510
Is this considered a little?

526
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,320
That's not true.

527
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,740
What are you going to do next?

528
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:43,880
Next?

529
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,910
You two now have

530
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,270
mutual feelings.

531
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,190
Shouldn't you confess

532
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,420
and move forward?

533
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,160
Moreover, Ding Jing

534
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,390
is still eyeing him.

535
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,260
Oh, right!

536
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,150
Ding Jing!

537
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,280
I heard that

538
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,160
she and Jiang Chengyi grew up together.

539
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,350
They're childhood sweethearts.

540
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,300
You have to take the lead.

541
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,030
What do you mean by taking the lead?

542
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,790
It's to take the initiative.

543
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,180
What do you mean by taking the initiative?

544
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,560
Let me raise an example.

545
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,070
Like

546
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,100
Zhong and I...

547
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,000
This is

548
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,590
a medicinal wine made by my dad.

549
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,750
For sprains like yours,

550
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,820
apply for a few times and it'll recover.

551
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,110
Thank you.

552
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,720
You...

553
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,820
You need to...

554
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,060
You have to...

555
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,700
You need to rub it harder.

556
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,340
Come.

557
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,660
You need to use more strength.

558
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,190
Otherwise, the bruise inside

559
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,010
won't fade.

560
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,620
Do you always get injured?

561
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,480
That's why you carry medicinal wine with you

562
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,770
all the time?

563
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:36,870
No.

564
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,610
I went home to get it.

565
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,230
Did you go back

566
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,200
specially for me?

567
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,260
You got hurt while running with me.

568
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,010
I have to be responsible for you.

569
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,550
I mean...

570
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,350
I mean this.

571
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,520
Jiang Chengyi.

572
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,470
I like you.

573
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,120
Do you feel the same way?

574
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,540
Would you be my boyfriend?

575
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,690
I...

576
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,660
I'm sorry.

577
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,100
For what?

578
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,810
It's nothing.

579
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,750
Aren't you nice to me

580
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,130
because you like me?

581
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,140
No, I...

582
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,910
I treat everyone well.

583
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,960
Lu Yan,

584
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,840
I think you can understand.

585
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,550
Now, I can

586
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,230
jog with you

587
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,020
and exercise with you.

588
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,720
But I can't be with you forever.

589
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,320
I don't understand.

590
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,330
I just want an answer.

591
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,370
You...

592
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,670
Do you

593
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,580
not like me at all?

594
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:11,520
Yes.

595
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,620
I...

596
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,940
don't like you.

597
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,179
[Criminal Investigation Science]

598
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:51,860
Lu Yan.

599
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,830
[Alarm]

600
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,570
You're awake.

601
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,200
Get some more sleep.

602
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,110
I'll get the door.

603
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,590
There's no sound in there.

604
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,210
Zhong.

605
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,960
Come in.

606
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,410
You're up.

607
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,070
You guys talk. I'll go wash my face.

608
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,480
Looks like

609
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,330
we're not the only ones with good news.

610
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,390
He...

611
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,930
I'll go get him

612
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,550
a toothbrush

613
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,110
holder.

614
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,110
Congratulations.

615
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,290
You're going to be a father.

616
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,010
Thank you.

617
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,550
Aren't you back together too?

618
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,650
It's not easy.

619
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,630
I'm happy for you.

620
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,060
You have to hurry up

621
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,320
and speed up the progress.

622
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,350
If our families give birth to a boy and a girl,

623
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,410
we should arrange an early betrothal.

624
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,560
If they were two girls,

625
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,780
they can be sworn sisters.

626
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,880
If they were two boys,

627
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,690
they are like us,

628
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:05,940
not brothers

629
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,000
but closer than real brothers.

630
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,250
What era is it?

631
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,210
Arranged betrothal?

632
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,790
What's wrong?

633
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,160
Are you shy?

634
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,490
Isn't it reasonable?

635
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,870
You two like kids too.

636
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:18,980
This matter

637
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,670
is in no hurry.

638
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,110
Let me

639
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,090
have my romantic life with just the two of us first.

640
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,010
I understand.

641
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,550
You've missed eight years.

642
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,090
You've been counting the days.

643
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,070
It's not easy.

644
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,870
How did it work?

645
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,820
I didn't really...

646
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,500
Say it exactly.

647
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,610
You didn't confess?

648
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,690
Probably...

649
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,190
Not.

650
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,940
That doesn't work.

651
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,510
A piece of advice

652
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,310
from a married man.

653
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,720
Life needs a sense of ritual.

654
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,760
If you don't say anything now,

655
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,990
you'll suffer in the future.

656
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,450
Learn from me.

657
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,670
The food is boiling.

658
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,390
Hurry.

659
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,870
I'll put the broccoli in it.

660
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,510
What?

661
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,050
You agreed without him confessing to you?

662
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,320
Jie.

663
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,500
We are...

664
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,170
No, no, no.

665
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,250
It's not that I don't agree with

666
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,520
you two getting back together.

667
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,830
I don't agree with

668
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,010
you two getting back together casually.

669
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,850
Have you forgotten?

670
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,000
When you first confessed to him,

671
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,070
he turned you down.

672
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,640
You were the one who pursued him ten years ago.

673
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,710
If you don't want him

674
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,430
to do something now,

675
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,260
the chance for him to do it in the future is even lower.

676
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,480
I don't care about being ceremonial.

677
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,150
Besides,

678
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,190
it's not the first time

679
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,140
we got together.

680
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,950
Haven't you heard that saying?

681
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,870
People live for a few moments.

682
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,330
We have to make every moment

683
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,680
more meaningful.

684
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,840
I didn't care about being ceremonial before.

685
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,800
I didn't even want to hold a wedding.

686
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,910
But Zhong does.

687
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,400
Now that I think about it,

688
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,500
I realized

689
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,960
these senses of ritual

690
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,460
are what make our ordinary life

691
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,790
more interesting

692
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,580
and spiced up our relationship.

693
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,870
Zhong treats you so well

694
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,490
but you still pick on him all the time.

695
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,530
Why are you talking about me again?

696
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,640
I'm talking about you now.

697
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,540
Dr. Lu.

698
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,460
Please adopt the right attitude

699
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,900
this time.

700
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,490
Don’t be soft-hearted

701
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,640
whenever you face Jiang Chengyi.

702
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,690
You should at least

703
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,040
let him properly pursue you once.

704
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,400
At the very least,

705
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,010
he has to confess.

706
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,930
Fine.

707
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,530
Fine.

708
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,510
I know what to do.

709
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,250
Let me think about it.

710
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,340
Let me see the baby.

711
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,960
Is there such a thing now?

712
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,090
It's at most a bud now.

713
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,960
It's just a cell.

714
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,830
Even if it's a cell,

715
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,360
it's still the cutest little cell.
