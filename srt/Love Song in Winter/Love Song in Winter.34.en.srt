to commit more crimes?

216
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,710
Yes, Director Xing.

217
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,130
Wen Peng's initial motive

218
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,870
was to separate Lu Yan

00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,430
his attitude

223
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,890
has completely changed.

224
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,290

227
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,450
did he not get Lu Yan,

228
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,340

231
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,740

232
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,680
he will make another move against Jiang Chengyi.

233
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,160

00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,710
Wait.

391
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,550
Thank you.

392
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,290
You have a patient?

393
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,210
Which department are you from?

394
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,510
I'm from General Surgery.

395
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,940
Are you new here?

396
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,410
Yes.

397
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,920
No wonder I haven't seen you before.

Captain Jiang.

00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,390
It's Wen Peng.

401
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,470
Look.

402
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,420
Can you zoom in?

403
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,490
Where did he go after that?

404
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,630

and see where he went.

408
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,030
Yes.

409
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,580

Matron Qiao,

411
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,080
don't tell anyone

412
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,320
about this.

413
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,110
Okay.

414
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:49,950
Thank you.

[Under Construction. Do Not Enter]

417
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,120
Hello, Captain Jiang.

418
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,430
We found the black Buick

419
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,650
that Wen Peng took Lu Yan in

420
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,870
at the construction site on Wujiang Road

421
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,830
in the Xincheng District.

00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,230
And

424
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,660
a construction vehicle is missing here.

425
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,810
We suspect

426
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,070
Wen Peng brought the car here

427
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,510
to

428
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,710
switch vehicles

429
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,890
and evade our capture.

[Under Construction. Do Not Enter]

431
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,460
Someone must have helped Wen Peng escape.

432
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,710
I've already asked others

433
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,020
to track the construction vehicle.

434
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,990
Okay, that's great.

435
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:26,620
Keep investigating.

436
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,490
Yes, Captain Jiang.

what do you want?

00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:17,990
What do I want?

441
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,070
Of course I want to

442
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,000
be with you.

443
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,310
Help!

444
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,020
Is anyone there?

445
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,350
Help!

446
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,510
No one is here.

447
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,130
It's just the two of us.

448
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,290
I remember you once said

449
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,590
the place you want to go most

450
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,770
is Lake Baikal.

451
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,260
But

452
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,600
I can't take you there now.

453
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,120
But

454
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,200
when I bought this villa,

455
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,290
I had already decided

456
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,070
I want to spend the rest of my life

457
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,250
with you.

458
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,740
What do you think?

459
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,210
Do you like it?

460
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:17,870
You like it, don't you?

461
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,390
You took me away.

462
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,480

463
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,760

466
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,210
I'm not escaping.

467
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,730
Didn't I tell you just now?

468
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,540
I want to be with you.

469
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,930
I know

470
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,830
you can't accept me now.

471
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,490
But

472
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,050
I can promise you

473
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,660
as long as you are willing to be with me,

474
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,590
you won't be hurt

by anyone.

476
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,870
From beginning to end,

477
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,370
you're the only one who hurt me.

478
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,390
You've hurt

479
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,460
everyone closest to me.

480
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,370
What do you really want?

481
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,830
Why don't you understand

482
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,450
why I did all this?

483
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,980
I did all this for you.

484
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,490
No one

485
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,310
will ever

486
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,310
love you the way I do.

487
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:17,910
You know?

488
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,750
Stop saying

489
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,390
such disgusting words!

490
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,450
So you're rejecting me?

491
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,820
I'm not rejecting you.

492
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,480
I hate you.

493
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,360
I despise you.

494
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,590
So you don't want

495
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,790
to be with me, right?

496
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,010
Even if none of this had happened,

497
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,960
I wouldn't be with you.

498
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,210
I hate you.

499
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,190
The most regretful thing

500
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,130
in my life is knowing you.

501
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,980
I never should have saved you.

502
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,160
I shouldn't have said...

503
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,420
Enough!

504
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,640
I'll go check if Auntie's awake.

505
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,110
What are you doing?

506
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,680
Didn't I tell you?

507
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,230
As long as you agree to be with me,

508
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,950
I'll do whatever you want me to do,

509
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,310
including

510
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,430
keep hurting the people you care the most.

511
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,860
You...

512
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,790
You've gone crazy.

513
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,610
Lu Yan,

514
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,670
do you know

515
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,010
what day it is today?

516
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,110
My birthday.

517
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,430
When I was eight,

518
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,120
my mother left me.

519
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,400
After she left,

520
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,520
I never celebrated my birthday again.

521
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,390
Because

522
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,940
every time it was my birthday,

523
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,800
my dad would think of my mom

524
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,010
and get extra angry.

525
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,560
So I was especially

526
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,430
envious of other kids.

527
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,870
They had family and friends

528
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,050
to celebrate their birthdays with them.

529
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,090
But fortunately,

530
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,290
you're here with me today.

531
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,060
Lu Yan,

532
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,150
do you like this cake?

533
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,080
It's the same style my mom bought

534
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,080
the first time she celebrated my birthday.

535
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:36,990
Today,

536
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,820
let's celebrate my birthday together, okay?

537
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,550
Can you

538
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,670
sing a birthday song for me?

539
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,240
It's okay.

540
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,470
If you won't sing, I'll sing.

541
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,730
Happy birthday to me.

542
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,470
Happy birthday to me.

543
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,590
Happy birthday to me.

544
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:14,990
Happy birthday to me.

545
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,390
My wish is

546
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,350
that we will

547
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,750
always be together, just the two of us,

548
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,660
forever and ever.

549
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,970
Come on, take a bite.

550
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,530
What's the point of you doing this?

551
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,160
Of course, there's a point.

552
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,510
Today is my birthday,

553
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,270
and it's also

554
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,020
our anniversary.

555
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,550
How wonderful.

556
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,800
You know it.

557
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,230
I was forced.

558
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,449
Do you have to

559
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,000
make me unhappy

560
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,949
on such a happy day?

561
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,100
For the sake of my birthday,

562
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,630
have a bite.

563
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,000
Have a bite.

564
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,489
Have a bite.

565
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,050
Get up!

566
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,380
Have a bite!

567
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:37,230
Get up!

568
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,560
Get up!

569
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,020
Have a bite!

570
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,470
Hello?

571
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:21,930
You found it?

572
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,570
Okay, got it.

573
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,070
Captain Jiang.

574
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,260
The construction vehicle has been found.

575
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,510
Wen Peng drove from

576
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,510
Xincheng District's Wujiang Road

577
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,430
all the way south to the Laowan District's

578
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,590
nature reserve on the national highway.

579
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,090
The nature reserve is sparsely populated.

580
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,830
There's a lot of traffic

581
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,550
and no surveillance.

582
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,920
I guess there are two possibilities.

583
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,910
One is that he changed vehicles in the reserve.

584
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,100
The other is that he went straight up the mountain.

585
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,010
Send people to search.

586
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,000
Okay.

587
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,590
Hurry.

588
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,030
Lu Yan.

589
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,180
Lu Yan, are you alright?

590
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,020
Lu Yan.

591
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,190
Why did you fall down?

592
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:27,940
Get up.

593
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:28,760
One, two.

594
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,910
Are you hurt?

595
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,510
Are you okay? Let me see.

596
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,300
Let me see.

597
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,800
I'm sorry.

598
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,830
I didn't take good care of you.

599
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,330
But I have a surprise for you.

600
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,890
Look.

601
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,170
It's beautiful.

602
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,240
Isn't it not allowed to set off fireworks?

603
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,700
The fish ran away.

604
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,910
Lu Yan,

605
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,220
you know what?

606
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,710
Today is the happiest day

607
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,750
in my life.

608
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,150
I feel that everything I've done

609
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,110
for this day

610
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,950
is so worth it.

611
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,330
From the first day I met you,

612
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,290
I've been imagining

613
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,390
that we would have

614
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,470
a cabin with a view of the lake.

615
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,880
We would take walks together during the day,

616
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,460
and read books together by the fireplace at night.

617
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,220
This place

618
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,230
is not as good as Lake Baikal,

619
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,880
but it also fulfills my dream.

620
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,640
In the future,

621
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,430
I will definitely take you

622
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,260
to see Lake Baikal.

623
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,240
Not only Lake Baikal,

624
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,870
I will also take you to see

625
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,090
every beautiful corner of the world.

626
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,840
Lu Yan,

627
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,700
we've really missed out on a lot.

628
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,300
But fortunately, the ending is perfect.

Let me cover you up.

636

Don't catch a cold at night.

637
