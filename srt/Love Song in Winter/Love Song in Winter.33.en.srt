The doctor said I could have chemotherapy.

274

But I knew

275
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,750
chemotherapy would just make me live

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,430
I couldn't afford

285
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,570
there's something I can't let go.

287
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,830

288
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,420

290
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,150

292

294
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,050

00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,390
I wrote the anonymous letter.

383
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,150
I watched Deng Man

384
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,230
being bullied back then,

385
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,390
but I didn't stop it in time.

386
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,640
Later, that kind of thing happened,

387
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,900
I've always been feeling guilty,

388
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,990
so I wanted to seek justice for her.

389
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,510
But later I thought that

390
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,110
I might get myself into trouble.

391
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,130
So...

392
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,710
Are you afraid that Ding Jing will cause you trouble?

393
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,350
How did you know about Ding Jing?

394
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,180
Deng Man is the person you cheated with during your marriage.

395
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,270
Ding Jing shot a video

396
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,750
of you two being intimate

397
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,970
and threatened you.

398
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,000
You told Deng Man to bear the insult.

399
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,950
In the end, she was forced to die.

400
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,270
Is that so?

401
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,910
Coach Zhou, you know what?

402
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,790
If Ding Jing

403
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,110
knows about this,

404
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,030
with her temper,

405
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,390
she won't let you go.

406
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,480
But don't worry.

407
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,030
I've already

408
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,870
suppressed this matter on her side.

409
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,550
Some things have passed.

410
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,390
Let the past stay in the past.

411
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,400
Even if you tell the truth,

412
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,150
Deng Man won't come back to life.

413
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,590
Maybe it's better

414
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,490
to take this to the grave.

415
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,690
It's good for everyone.

416
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,640
What do you think?

417
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,470
You...

418
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,850
What do you mean?

419
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,090
You don't want

420
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,210
two women to die quietly

421
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,530
because of you, do you?

422
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,830
In the end,

423
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,160
before Jiang Chengyi and Lu Yan

424
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,110
found me,

425
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,130
Wen Peng contacted me.

426
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,820
He taught me a set of phrases,

427
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,740
showing me how to lie to them.

428
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,690
Last time you chased me,

429
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,560
I called him.

430
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,620
He asked someone to crash your car.

431
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,960
I had no choice.

432
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,330
I could only listen to him.

433
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,030
My life and my wife's life

434
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,110
are both in his hands.

435
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,240
Okay.

436
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,710
Zhou Zhicheng.

437
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,930
We've finished the interrogation.

438
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,470
You are suspected of obstructing justice.

439
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,460
We will further verify

440
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,980
your testimony.

441
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,540
During this period,

442
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,020
you have the right to remain silent

443
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,040
or hire an attorney.

444
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,470
We will officially

445
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,600
arrest you

446
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,470
and transfer you to the court.

447
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,510
Also,

448
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,060
you have cancer now.

449
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,350
And your wife can't take care of

450
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,420
herself.

451
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,610
We will explain to the court

452
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,430
so that you

453
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,090
and Lin Chunmei

454
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,270
can receive proper medical care.

455
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,590
Thank you.

456
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,550
Thank you.

457
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,390
I'm finally free.

458
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,030
♫Charging into the world, with you in my backseat♫

459
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,980
♫Pretending not to care even though you're all I care about♫

460
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:32,240
♫I couldn't tell you for some unknown reason♫

461
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:38,490
♫That I like you the way you are♫

462
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,680
♫Like raindrops falling, wishing to return to the sky♫

463
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,880
♫As long as I can meet you, I'd gladly endure anything♫

464
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,930
♫Like a shadow quietly guarding its light source♫

465
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,900
♫You keep walking, and I'll walk with you forever♫

466
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,630
You're up?

467
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:57,760
Come to eat.

468
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,730
♫You're the shooting star I chase with all my might♫

469
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,090
What are you waiting for?

470
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,660
♫I can't hold you, but I can still make a wish♫

471
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,880
I miss you so much.

472
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,510
I'm right here.

473
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,600
Why do you miss me?

474
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,450
♫So precious, so bittersweet♫

475
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,070
Can you

476
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,360
never leave me?

477
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:21,210
♫Even the wind knows the one I love is you♫

478
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,820
From now on,

479
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,510
I'll always be by your side.

480
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,710
♫You are the shooting star I gaze at and chase♫

481
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,840
♫You saved my lonely heart♫

482
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,330
It's not over yet.

483
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,600
Lu Yan,

484
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,420
I still have a chance.

485
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,930
Wu Di,

486
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,750
the hit-and-run driver

487
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,420
who hit Yuan Li has confessed.

488
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,820
It was you

489
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,270
who ordered him to do that.

490
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,790
Hao,

491
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,650
show him the photo.

492
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,760
This is a screenshot of the surveillance footage

493
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,430
from half an hour

494
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,750
before Yuan Li's incident.

495
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,430
All the details of your deal with him

496
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,730
were shown clearly in the footage.

497
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,070
Go to the corner of Dongli Street

498
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,510
and give this to Qiu Laowu.

499
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,240
Tell him to hit this person.

500
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,280
Remind him to see clearly.

501
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:06,710
Okay.

502
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,310
Well,

503
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,550
there's something that I don't understand,

504
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,360
Wu Di.

505
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,350
Logically speaking, you've been working

506
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,270
beside the boss for so many years.

507
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:21,990
I think you should be a person

508
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,830
who pays much attention to details.

509
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,550
But how could you end up

510
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,550
being caught on surveillance?

511
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,110
You shouldn't have been.

512
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,150
Also,

513
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,950
we investigated your company's computer.

514
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,200
It's recorded in detail that

515
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,280
it was you who spread rumors in the game

516
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,220
and incited netizens.

517
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,990
Have you ever thought

518
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,150
why these records

519
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:47,750
would appear

520
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,910
in your company's computer?

521
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,360
You may not

522
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:56,490
know the current situation

523
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,230
and the seriousness of the problem.

524
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,260
Just with the Yuan Li incident alone,

525
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,040
you're suspected of intentional murder.

526
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,760
Plus, you spread rumors online

527
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,590
and intentionally crashed a police car

528
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,200
to obstruct our investigation.

529
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,230
Think about

530
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,460
the consequences you'll be facing.

531
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,540
Can't figure it out?

532
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,310
Let me analyze it for you.

533
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,550
There are only two possibilities.

534
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,710
Either

535
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,480
you want to bear everything for Wen Peng

536
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,310
or

537
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,510
Wen Peng wants you

538
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,560
to shoulder everything for him.

539
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,510
Officer,

540
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,600
I have a question.

541
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,270
If I provide you

542
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,390
some clues and criminal evidence,

543
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,850
can I negotiate for a reduced sentence?

544
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,750
It's not up to us

545
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,790
to get the sentence reduced.

546
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,310
We will follow

547
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,360
the legal process as usual.

548
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,760
If the information you provide

549
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,920
is valuable,

550
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,580
we will report it truthfully.

551
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,210
Okay.

552
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,950
I'll tell you everything.

553
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,340
All the things were done

554
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,600
under Wen Peng's instructions!

555
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,170
Actually, I was forced, too.

556
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,270
If I didn't do those things for him,

557
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,230
he would threaten me

558
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,520
and my family.

559
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:39,670
So,

560
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,750
one thing led to another,

561
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,980
and I ended up making too many mistakes.

562
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,880
Do you have proof that

563
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,790
Wen Peng told you

564
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,150
to do everything?

565
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,160
I...

566
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,410
installed a hidden camera

567
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,610
in my apartment.

568
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,680
It recorded some of my conversations

569
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,820
with Wen Peng.

570
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,690

before Wen Peng left,

573
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,230
he told me to do one thing.

574
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,780
He asked me to make an appointment

575
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,710
with a second-hand car dealer.

buy a used car?
