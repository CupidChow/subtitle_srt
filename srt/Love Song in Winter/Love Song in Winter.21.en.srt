[No Entry]

4
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,979
I didn't expect so many things

5
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,210
to happen on my business trip.

6
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,540
I shouldn't have let you

7
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,360
go to Ding Jing's funeral.

8
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,900
It's okay.

9
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,090
My injury is not serious.

10
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,289
Not serious?

11
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,240
If there's a scar,

12
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,949
you'll have problems with filming too.

13
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,670
It won't be that bad.

14
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,240
But to be honest,

15
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,110
I didn't expect

16
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,450
that girl to be so strong.

17
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,690
She almost strangled me to death.

18
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,820
Luckily, the police were there.

19
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,250
Otherwise, she would have killed me.

20
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,470
I've dealt with

21
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,570
the media for you already.

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,370
Don't worry.

23
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,329
Thank you.

24
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,460
It must've cost you a lot.

25
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,230
You must be heartbroken.

26
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,190
It's fine.

27
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,310
You really don't need me

28
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,070
to visit you?

29
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,970
No need. Don't come.

30
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,320
Aren't you preparing for the drama?

31
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,110
Get back to work.

32
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,530
Yes.

33
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,560
I've been busy lately.

34
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,480
War scenes

35
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,510
are all expensive.

36
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,470
Hey,

37
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,850
is there still hope

38
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,079
for that role of mine?

39
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,200
They called me.

40
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,210
They said the auditions are over.

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,660
Don't worry.

42
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,680
If there are

43
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,710
more roles like this in the future,

44
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,940
I'll keep an eye on them for you.

45
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,940
It's okay.

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,090
We'll see.

47
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,210
I'll hang up now.

48
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,230
[No Entry]

49
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,370
Professor Yu?

50
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,100
How are you?

51
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,880
Do you feel better?

52
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,860
Does it still hurt?

53
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,870
It doesn't hurt.

54
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,210
I won't die, anyway.

55
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,150
I didn't expect you

56
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,860
to be so strong mentally.

57
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,500
You acted

58
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,760
very calm yesterday.

59
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,390
But to be honest,

60
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,800
I was almost scared to death yesterday.

61
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,040
I'd only encountered fake scenarios

62
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,950
when filming.

63
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,950
I'd never encountered a real one before.

64
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,250
Isn't that good?

65
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,690
Remember it well.

66
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,790
Maybe you can use it

67
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,100
when filming in the future.

68
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,880
Don't you have classes today?

69
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,710
You have time to visit me?

70
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,390
After all, you got hurt

71
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,250
when we arrested the criminal.

72
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,630
I'm here to express my gratitude.

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,420
So you came just to see me?

74
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,350
I'm here to visit you

75
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,310
on behalf of the special investigation team.

76
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,680
Alright, you talk a lot.

77
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,490
You're quite spirited.

78
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,230
Lie down.

79
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,710
What's wrong?

80
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,470
I think I pulled it.

81
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,340
I pulled it.

82
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,400
Let me call the doctor for you.

83
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,090
Don't.

84
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,320
I just want an apple.

85
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:50,960
Can I?

86
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,960
How did you peel

87
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,670
a great apple

88
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,760
like this?

89
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,210
This is the essence.

90
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,940
Eat.

91
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,790
If my mom saw me

92
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:07,880
peeling apples like this,

93
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,400
I would've gotten spanked to death.

94
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,800
By the way,

95
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,920
didn't you tell your family

96
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,320
about your injury?

97
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,750
They haven't come to visit you.

98
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,400
You're afraid

99
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,950
your mom would be worried,

100
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,580
right?

101
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,150
It makes sense.

102
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,050
I wouldn't tell them if it were me.

103
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,060
Professor Yu.

104
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,110
I have to tell you

105
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,830
I lied to you about something.

106
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,880
When I was taking classes with you,

107
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,550
I made things up when filling out

108
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,630
my family information.

109
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,270
My company thinks

110
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,590
my family background isn't that great,

111
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,310
so they made up

112
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,470
a fake one for me.

113
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,630
My parents passed away

114
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,430
when I was very young.

115
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:57,990
But I had a great neighbor auntie

116
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,520
who treated me very well.

117
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,150
She raised me up.

118
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,080
She was the one

119
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,300
who named me Yu Bofeng.

120
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,470
To me,

121
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,160
she was my biological mother.

122
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,890
But later,

123
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,870
there was an accident too.

124
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,230
When I was 17,

125
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,590
she also passed away.

126
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,820
I've been alone since then.

127
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,560
But I feel like

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,490
I didn't tell you the truth,

129
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,090
so I should apologize to you.

130
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,530
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,830
Don't be mad at me, okay?

132
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,460
I'm not.

133
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,750
Thank you for your honesty.

134
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,220
I believe

135
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,400
your family in heaven

136
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,790
would be proud of

137
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,520
your current accomplishments.

138
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,280
Don't worry.

139
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,870
I'll keep it a secret.

140
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,780
I won't tell anyone.

141
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,130
Don't think too much.

142
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,850
Take care of yourself.

143
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,400
I'm leaving.

144
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,610
What now?

145
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,380
While I'm hospitalized...

146
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,950
Can you come help me with my studies?

147
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,930
We'll see.

148
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,570
That means you're coming!

149
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,920
You must!

150
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,230
Mr. Wen, coffee.

151
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,110
Mr. Wen.

152
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,870
Director Chen Chang

153
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,950
wants to meet you.

154
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,390
He likes Yu Bofeng very much

155
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,760
and really wants to work with him.

156
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,400
Mr. Wen.

157
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,010
Mr. Wen?

158
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,480
Take a look.

159
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,580
Go on. I'm listening.

160
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,480
Although Director Chen Chang

161
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,520
has just transitioned to filming movies,

162
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,960
he has a good reputation.

163
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,850
This can be

164
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,840
Yu Bofeng's entry point

165
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,950
into the film industry.

166
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,590
He just transitioned to filming movies.

167
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,179
Will anyone invest in him?

168
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,809
Should we meet him or not?

169
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,390
No.

170
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,180
One more thing.

171
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,340
The advertiser called,

172
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,960
saying that our artist Liu Keru

173
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,340
got angry on the set again.

174
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,160
How many times has it been?

175
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,990
Including this time,

176
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,860
this is the sixth time.

177
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,610
When will she come to the company?

178
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,950
2 P.M.

179
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,480
Anything else?

180
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,480
Yu Bofeng's assistant

181
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,520
just called me.

182
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,880
He said

183
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,810
Professor Yu went to see him.

184
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,960
They were together

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,910
for a long time.

186
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,830
Did anyone take a photo?

187
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,800
Well, no.

188
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,800
I'm just worried

189
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,630
Yu Bofeng

190
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,790
is getting out of control.

191
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,400
We spent so much money

192
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,380
in promoting him.

193
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,950
If he has any scandals,

194
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,410
will our money...

195
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,940
It's none of your business.

196
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,520
I understand.

197
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,990
Then, Mr. Wen,

198
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,630
if there's nothing else,

199
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,460
I'll get back to work.

200
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:51,980
Peng.

201
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,640
Why are you here?

202
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,830
I was just passing by.

203
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,800
I brought you two bottles of good wine to try.

204
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,710
Take a look.

205
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,920
[Taste]

206
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,350
[Treasure]

207
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,360
I know you like baijiu.

208
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,980
What's up?

209
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,370
Is something wrong?

210
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,670
Nothing.

211
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,520
Well,

212
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,070
about that movie partnership

213
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,610
you told me last time,

214
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,030
can I still participate?

215
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,530
Are you interested now?

216
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,470
Weren't you trying

217
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,590
to keep things safe before?

218
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,620
What?

219
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,820
You're being ambitious now?

220
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,350
Things are different now.

221
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,760
Tang Jie is pregnant.

222
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,840
I’m going to be a father.

223
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,420
I need to earn some money for the baby.

224
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:32,940
Congratulations.

225
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,640
This is worth celebrating.

226
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,380
Let's have a drink.

227
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,420
Thank you, Peng.

228
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,570
Well,

229
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,890
when the baby is born,

230
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,890
I'll invite you to the baby shower.

231
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,260
Listen.

232
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,110
There are so many good things

233
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,970
happening lately.

234
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,270
One after another.

235
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,140
Jiang

236
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,320
has made up with Lu Yan.

237
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,950
Maybe one day,

238
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,150
they'll invite us to the wedding.

239
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,960
Peng.

240
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,930
Peng?

241
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,270
Cheers.

242
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,840
Look at them.

243
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,160
After so many years,

244
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,990
it wasn't easy,

245
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,200
but there's finally a happy ending.

246
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,700
I've really fussed over them

247
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,480
with Tang Jie.

248
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,240
I’ve discussed it with Tang Jie.

249
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,780
When my baby is born,

250
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
they will be the godparents.

251
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,980
The godfather is a police officer,

252
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,170
while the godmother is a doctor.

253
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,890
This combo of professions

254
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,480
is great.

255
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,130
Zhong.

256
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,460
I have something to do.

257
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,160
I have to go.

258
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,870
How about this?

259
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,700
I'll let you know right away

260
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,530
when there's news about the movie.

261
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:36,910
Okay.

262
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,160
I'll wait for your message.

263
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,140
I'm leaving.

264
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,030
I'll stop bothering you.

265
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,670
Okay.

266
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,770
Remember to try the alcohol.

267
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,230
I'll wait for your news, Peng.

269
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,150

270
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,070
Don't worry, okay?

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,520
[Yunyin Ninghai]

272
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,230
I starved myself for two days

273
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,790
for this commercial.

274
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,600
This one commercial

275
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,830
took more than ten hours to shoot.

276
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,100
Are you trying to kill me?

277
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,880
Ke.

278
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,590
Hang in there.

279
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,140
After all, we've signed the contract.

280
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,140
Don't mention the contract.

281
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,130
Listen.

282
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,020
If you won't let me

283
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,960
eat this today,

284
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,770
I won't shoot anymore.

285
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,920
You'll have no one.

286
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,600
Okay, okay.

287
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,470
Calm down.

288
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,790
Leave it to me.

289
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,010
Don’t talk to me.

290

Mr. Wen.

291
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,400
Wen,

292
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,960
I don't want to do commercials anymore.

293
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,140
I want to act in a movie.

294
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,080
Didn't you promise

295
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,270
to get a movie for me?

296
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,550
Is work tiring?

297
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,770
Yes.

298
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,840
I've even lost weight.

299
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,260
Looks like

300
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,900
I should reward you today.

301
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,390
Really?

302
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,010
I'll treat you to a drink today.

303
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,860
A drink?

304
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,790
Where?

305
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,480
Here.

306
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,370
For last year's costume drama,

307
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,140
you were late 16 times

308
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,850
from the start to finish.

309
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,310
You worked hard.

310
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,080
Wen,

311
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,110
I'm sorry.

312
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,090
At the beginning of the year, I had you be

313
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,410
the leading actress of the company's drama.

314
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,510
Not only did you date,

315
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,770
but you were also photographed

316
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,090
and hit the reporters.

317
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,330
Do you know how much I sacrificed

318
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,270
for this?

319
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,720
Wen, I know.

320
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,290
You don't like shooting commercials.

321
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,610
You like insulting people.

322
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,520
Are you a superstar?

323
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,520
Come on, superstar.

324
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,420
Here's to you.

325
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:01,990
Remember.

326
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,480
It's not my duty

327
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,070
to be nice to you.

328
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,630
I can promote you.

329
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,070
I can also drag you down.

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,640
What are you cooking?

Soup.

332
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,270
Then I'll wash tomatoes.

333
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,910

Oh, that's a relief!

644

Listen,

646
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,280

Didn't you say

662
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,460

doesn't that mean I'll meet your parents?

669
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,790
I think

670
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,400
there is a step

671
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,630

672
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,230

678
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,810

682
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,720
this is an improper sudden visit?

You need to think about it, huh?

767
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,530
♫Romance only exists with you♫

768
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:27,920
Fine.

769
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,910
Take your time.

770
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,880
I'll help you think about it.

771
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,430
♫Forever and ever into the future♫

772
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,170
♫Let's be super sweet lovers♫

773
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,710
♫How should I describe love, my perfect dear?♫

774
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,320
♫It's my privilege to make you happy♫

775
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,400
♫Endless loving and longing♫

776
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:55,690
♫Loving you, every day is Valentine's Day♫

777
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,750
Morning.

778
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,030
This way please, Mr. Wen.

779
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,520
You're quite busy, Mr. Wen.

780
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,160
You came alone?

781
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,410
Where are your employees?

782
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,710
What about your artists?

783
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,810
Are they swamped with work too?

784
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,860
Is this how you've arranged

785
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,400
your father's birthday?

786
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,440
I see, Mr. Wen.

787
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,730
You did this on purpose

788
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,390
to humiliate me,

789
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,030
Right?

790
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:21,920
Say something.

791
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:41,690
Who do you think

792
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,870
will come to attend your birthday?

793
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,660
Your friends?

794
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,870
You have no friends.

795
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,850
Or your family?

796
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,800
You don't have one.

797
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,960
You are a lonely old man.

798
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,450
Your wife left you,

799
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,040
and so did your friends.

800
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,640
Almost everyone has left you.

801
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,440
One day,

802
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,460
I will leave you too.

803
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,420
Listen.

804
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,530
I don’t need them.

805
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,210
Mr. Wen,

806
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,520
you can't do whatever you want

807
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,590
just because you're somewhat rich.

808
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,960
You should be glad that I'm rich.

809
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,210
Otherwise,

810
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,880
you wouldn't have a chance

811
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,570
to mess around in such a fancy restaurant.

812
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,510
Instead,

813
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,070
you'd make a scene

814
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,000
on the street.

815
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,320
Dad.

816
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:02,620
Happy birthday.

817
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,170
I forgot

818
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,639
you've never been happy in your whole life.

819
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,080
[Peng, you can't listen to the voice messages now? I just want to ask you something.]

820
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,110
[Call me when you come back to China, okay?]

821
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,110
[Peng, your Christmas holiday is coming, right? Are you coming back to China?]

822
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,310
Mom,

823
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,600
did he hit you again?

824
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,410
No.

825
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,970
I hit myself by accident.

826
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,520
Mom.

827
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,180
Y-You should go.

828
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,590
Don't ever come back.

829
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,280
As long as I hold Dad off,

830
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,190
he won't have a chance to beat you again.

831
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,300
You've grown up.

832
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,580
I promise you.

833
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,650
I will come back to pick you up

834
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,340
once I settle down.

835
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,930
You did your best.

836
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,400
But no one

837
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,090
will really care about your death.
