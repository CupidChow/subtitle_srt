00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,470
I don't care about the price.

5
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,500
You negotiate it.

6
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,310
But it has to be paid in full,

7
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,170
and it's paid today.

8
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,190
I gotta go.

9
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,610
I'm accompanying Tang Jie for her prenatal check-up.

10
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,740
No way, this is so amazing.

11
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,500
Yes.

Honey,

15
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,030
you called me. What's wrong?

16
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,350
Pay the fee.

17
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,750
Pay the fee, Zhong.

18
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,390
Pay the fee. I'll go pay it.

What's wrong?

20
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,590
I just think Zhong

21
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,910
has been acting weird lately.

22
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,500
How?

23
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,820
He's been going out to meet people every day

24
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,329
and coming home very late.

25
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,910
When he comes home, he just sits on the sofa,

26
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,560
without saying a word,

27
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,390

28
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,790
Is he under a lot of stress at work?

29
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,740
I thought so before.

30
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,980
But you know what?

31
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,710
He calls people every day behind my back

32
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,390

33
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,860
You...

34
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,500
checked his phone?

35
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,580
Of course.

36
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,210
But I found nothing.

37
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,310
He deleted everything.

38
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,400
Well, did he actually delete everything,

39
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,550
or was there nothing there to begin with?

40
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,590
Stop guessing.

41
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,310

How could he possibly cheat on you?

45
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,360

What does he want?

106

There's no need for that.

107

At that point,

115
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,990
we can act.

116
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,659
Okay.

117
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,450
Be careful.

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,310

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,720
just disband it.

129
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,050
Didn't you always say I was keeping

130

a bunch of idle people?

131
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,750
Might as well take this chance

132
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,470
and disband it.

133
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,430

We need to be more careful with money.

137

It's okay.

138
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,990
I still have some money on this card.

139
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,060
It's enough to support your company for a while.

140
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,270
No, honey,

what are you doing?

142
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,550
This is the money that Mom gave you as your personal savings.

143

I-I-I can't take this money.

have been with you for so many years.

149
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,180
They all have families to support.

150
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,070
If you lay them off,

151
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,190
how will they survive?

152
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,280
Besides,

153
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,940
even if you want to dissolve the company,

154
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,510
you still have to compensate them according to their length of employment,

155
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,630
right?

156
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:27,910
Take it.

157
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,010
Take it.

158
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,110
Do you remember

159
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,820
how you established

160
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:42,590
the company back in the day?

161
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,880
Back then,

162
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,070
you had no background.

163
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,090
Your family didn't give you any money,

164
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,270
and no one helped you.

165
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,830
It was all you,

166
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,870
working with all your men,

into what it is today.

170
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,170
You've made it through all the hardships before,

171
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,830
so why are you afraid now

172
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,630
of only this small matter?

173
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,260
Yes, I shouldn't be afraid.

174
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,620
Why should I be afraid?

175
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,530
I have the best wife in the world,

176
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,150
my baby,

177
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,780
and a group of

178
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,110
loyal men who've been with me

179
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,100
throughout this journey.

180
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,710
It's okay. I can handle it.

182
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,600
If it comes to it, we can always

183
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,470
start over.

184
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,640
I'll be there for you.

185
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,929
Thank you, honey.

186
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,360
I'll go out to get some business tomorrow.

187
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,090
Everything will be fine.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,940
Of course,

189
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,030
this is an investment on my part.

190
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,970
In the future,

191
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,490
pay me back with interest.

192
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,270

Nothing.

I came to Chengzhou.

Why did you go to Chengzhou?

407
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,590
Because I heard

408

that Yu Zheng and others came to Chengzhou.

409
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,630

00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,960
offer her some advice.

569
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,550
My dear mother,

570
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,750
please stay out of this.

571
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,740
Fine,

572
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,800
I will!

573
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,390
But you have to

574
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,860
hurry up and take action about it.

575
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,950
I'm quite satisfied

576
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,600
with Jiang.

577
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,130
He is a good kid,

578
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,150
reliable and dependable.

579
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,570
I approve of him

580
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,510
as my son-in-law.

581
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,170
Okay.

582
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,310
Have you decided what to eat?

583
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:11,880
Professor Yu,

584
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,330
I think now

585
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,270
that the most important thing is to find

586
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,430
the person who took

587
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:17,920
Li Ruonan's mother away.

588
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,180
But according to Director Li,

589
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,600
Li Ruonan's mother

590
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,070
was in very poor health at that time.

591
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,040
The fact that someone was able to

592
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,110
take her away in that condition

593
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,640
means that the person

594
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,590
has a very close relationship

595
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,670
with Li Ruonan.

596
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,510
And Li Ruonan also trusts him deeply.

597
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,150
Could it be

598
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:38,950
one of her relatives?

599
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,500
That's a possibility.

600
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,560
Or perhaps

601
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,270
this person gave Li Ruonan

602
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,430
a very convincing reason,

603
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,240
such as transferring her mother

604
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,550
to a better hospital

605
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,270
for better treatment.

606
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,040
But there are no further

607
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,430
hospital records for her mother.

608
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,150
If Li Ruonan's mother

609
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,500
has already passed away,

610
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,630
and this person has hidden

611
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,370
all the information,

612
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,800
then this person...

613
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,660
Is the person we're looking for?

614
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,120
Professor Yu,

615
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,270
wait for me in the car.

616
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,130
Okay.

617
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,410
Liu Hao.

618
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,090
Make sure to be careful.

619
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,000
If Wang Yifan is really

620
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,950
the one we're looking for,

621
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,210
you mustn't expose yourself.

622
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,530
I'm afraid that he may have

623
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,230
an extreme reaction if he sees you.

624
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,190
Got it.

625
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,030
I'm prepared.

626
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,960
Be very careful!

627
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,110
Today, I'll show you

628
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,270
how to play pool.

629
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,670
Almost, boss.

630
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,120
Almost.

631
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,020
Okay.

632
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,570
You're still the best.

633
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,800
I'm done playing.

634
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:40,750
You don't want to play anymore?

635
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,030
It's no fun to play with you guys.

636
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,480

00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,340
Professor Yu.

641
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,500
I'm really sorry.

642
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,200
Someone has paid for your life.

643
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,560
You're so pretty

644
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,700
and have a good figure.

645

But don't worry.

646
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,000
I'll leave your body in one piece.

Hello?

648
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,840
Run over one of your men.

649
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,760
That celebrity who's often around you.

650
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,150
He came here and appeared

651
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,420
to save that woman.

652
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,740
What should we do?

653
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,450
Then get rid of both of them.

00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,290
Two people,

655
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,030
the price goes up.

656
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,890
Name your price.

657
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,940
Okay.

658
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,150

00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,340
I'm with the Anshan District Criminal Investigation Unit.

He's in the car behind.

Yes.

Are you hurt?

676
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,659
I'm fine.

677
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,810
It's just a minor injury.

678
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,719
Why did you only show up after following us

679
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,100
for so many days?

680
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,100
You knew I was following you?

681
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,780
Yes.

682
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,250
I also knew

683
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,190
that you were following me,

684
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,989

685
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,000
right?

686
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,900
I did hesitate.

687
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,190
But...

688
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,550
but when I saw that person

689
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,590
trying to kill you,

690
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,190
I didn't think I could just stand by.

691
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,710
I knew it.

692
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,340
I was right about you.

693
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,580
You won't hurt anyone.

694
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,450
Right?

695
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,760
Anyway,

696
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,110
thank you for today.

kill you today?

00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,850

What should we do?

708
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,670
Then get rid of both of them.

He thought I'd passed out.

710
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:08,670
He had been lying to me

711
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,070
from the very beginning.

712
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,810
I believed every word he said.

713
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,350
But the words you told me,

714
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,790
I didn't listen to a single one.

715
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,740
That was all because you're a fool.

716
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,240
Wasn't he just taking advantage of

717
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,310
your innocence?

718
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,190

00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,480
he heard Wang Yifan

761
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,440
calling Wen Peng.

762
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,920
I checked the number,

763
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,360
and it's not registered under Wen Peng's name.

764
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,590
Wen Peng is very cautious.

765
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,560
He rarely leaves a trail.

766
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,400
How are you

767
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,440
and Professor Yu doing?

768
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,510
I'm fine.

769
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,200
I guess Professor Yu

770
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,330
needs to rest for a few days.

771
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,830
Hao, don't push yourself too hard.

772
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,900
You're still injured.

773
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,510
Don't force yourself.

774
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,350
Don't worry.

775
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,280
I'll be back tomorrow.

776
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,810
Okay.

777
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,720
[Love] [Love Rival] [Artist Under his Management] [House-Hunting] [Business Relationship] [Teacher]

778
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,540
Qin Yue.

779
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,240
Keep a close eye on Wen Peng.

780
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:36,800
Yes.
