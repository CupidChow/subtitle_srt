153
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:35,950

161
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,740
Why are you here?

She works here.

163
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,100
You know each other?

164
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:56,850
Yes.

165
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,340
We went to the same university.

166
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,550

University...

168
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,670
So You and Chengyi

169
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,870
should be fellow university alumni too.

170
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,340
You don't know each other?

171
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,380
Auntie.

172
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,700
There were so many students in our university.

173
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,090
How could they all know each other?

174
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,520

175
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,140
We've been together since middle school.

176
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,320
We should be considered

childhood sweethearts, Uncle.

178
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,970
How did you come to this conclusion?

179
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,500
There are thousands of students in a school.

180
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,320
Are they all childhood sweethearts?

181
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,490

182

183
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,540
You've always been so mean.

184

00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,280
No.

00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,409
Thank you, Dr. Lu.

188
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,169
Dr. Lu.

189
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,940
He does feel much better,

190
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,789
but

191
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,370
I still feel uneasy.

192
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,630
Can you let him

193
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,929
stay in the hospital for a few more days?

194
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,620
Auntie, don't worry.

The doctor said you can't smell this.

266

Why did she bring flowers of all gifts?

267

to take more vitamins?

278

The doctor said you haven't fully recovered.

279

I'm staying for you?

752
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,260
♫The person I trust♫

753
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,940
♫Insists on separating♫

754
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,380
♫Who can explain?♫

755
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,100
Come on. I'll send you home.

756
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,530
♫I'm not afraid of your happiness♫

757
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,130
Jiang Chengyi,

758
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,790
♫I'm afraid you'll forget me♫

759
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,050
♫To feel my heartache♫

760
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,800
I'm here.

761
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,600
♫When I no longer have the best♫

762
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,370
♫I miss you missing me♫
