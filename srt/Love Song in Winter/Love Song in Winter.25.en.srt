8
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,150
Sorry,

9
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:20,940
I'm late.

10
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,250
Where were you?

11
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,870
I went to a book club today.

12
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,190
They happened to be discussing

13
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,310
"Hiroshima Mon Amour"

14
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,329
by Marguerite Duras.

15
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,850
I was going to

16
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,060
ask you to come with me.

17
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,620
I'm sorry, Man.

18
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,630
I can't take you

19
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,240
to movie theaters

20
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,440
and amusement parks

21
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,520
like your classmates do.

22
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,500
You have to settle for places like this.

23
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,579
Not at all.

24
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,829
Being able to do this,

25
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,430
I'm already more than happy.

26
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,170
Happy birthday.

27
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,390
How did you know

28
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,000
today is my birthday?

29
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,970
I looked it up.

30
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,790
I also know

31
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,350
you've always spent it

32
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,390
alone in the past.

33
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,990
From now on,

34
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,520
I'll spend it with you.

35
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,870
Thank you.

36
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,430
Make a wish.

37
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,130
What do you want for your birthday?

38
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,840
I usually read it

39
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,320
quietly in the library,

40
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,030
but today,

41
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,110
I want you to read it to me.

42
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,530
"I once had the misfortune

43
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,720
of being utterly humiliated.

44
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,400
The razor at my head.

45
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,880
From this foolish act,

46
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,710
I gained extraordinary wisdom.

47
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,480
I want to have lived through that moment.

48
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,470
That incomparable moment.

49
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,310
He speaks,

50
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,909
as though divorced from the present.

51
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,850
He: In a few years,

52
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,870
when I'll have forgotten you,

53
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,750
and when other such adventures,

54
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,920
from sheer habit, will happen to me,

55
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,110
I'll remember you

56
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,870
as the symbol

57
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,070
of love's forgetfulness.

58
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,400
I'll think of

59
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,710
this adventure

60
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,950
as of the horror of oblivion.

61
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,510
I already know it.

62
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,110
I'll do that."

63
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,250
What's wrong?

64
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,560
No matter what happens in the future,

65
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,030
whether we have one or not,

66
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,520
the moment

67
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,900
just now

68
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,400
is the most special

69
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,790
and happiest of my life.

70
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,810
Thank you.

71
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,550
I love you.

72
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,830
I love you too.

73
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,990
Where was I?

74
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,630
"I meet you."

75
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,909
"I meet you.

76
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,350
I remember you.

77
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,790
This city

78
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,920
was made to the size of love."

79
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,940
Why did you film me?

80
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,730
Stay away from me!

81
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,450
You're causing such a scene.

82
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,780
Aren't you afraid the whole school will find out?

83
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,120
Then Coach Zhou's life

84
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,660
would be completely ruined by you.

85
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,710
You want to smash it?

86
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:55,550
Go ahead.

87
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,890
I have more than one copy.

88
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,120
But think it through.

89
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,640
This phone is expensive.

90
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,430
Can you afford to pay it

91
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,160
with your student loan?

92
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,030
What...

93
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,910
W-What do you want?

94
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,000
I want you to pretend to fall in love with Jiang Chengyi

95
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,270
and break up Lu Yan and Jiang Chengyi.

96
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,910
Impossible.

97
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,120
In your dreams!

98
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,030
In my dreams?

99
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,190
That's right.

100
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,700
I've been dreaming all along.

101
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,830
But look,

102
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,590
my dream

103
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,910
is about to come true.

104
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,050
I don't have much patience.

105
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,270
If you've made up your mind,

106
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,030
come to the small garden

107
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,820
behind the teaching building tomorrow.

108
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,600
I'll teach you what to do.

109
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,230
Do as Ding Jing said.

110
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,590
Impossible.

111
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,070
I would never, ever do anything

112
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,660
to hurt Yan.

113
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,340
Then what should we do?

114
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,590
If she makes that video

115
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,360
public,

116
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,150
I'll be branded

117
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,350
as a hypocrite,

118
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,230
and you'll be labeled

119
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,430
as a homewrecker that everyone despises.

120
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,350
Even if I don't care,

121
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,470
you're still so young.

122
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,710
With that kind of reputation,

123
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,990
how are you going to move forward?

124
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,750
I don't want that for you either.

125
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,870
Listen to me, Man.

126
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,550
W-We don't really need

127
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,670
to break them up.

128
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,910
We'll just put on a show,

129
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,380
making Ding Jing think

130
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,830
she's won,

131
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,910
so she'll destroy

132
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,910
that video.

133
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,200
Okay?

134
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,320
A show?

135
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,200
Yes.

136
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,400
Once Ding Jing

137
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,720
destroys the video

138
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,670
and this all blows over,

139
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,390
we'll go apologize

140
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,430
and find a way to make it up to them.

141
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,660
I'll do it with you.

142
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,310
But...

143
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,750
I still can't

144
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,450
hurt Yan for myself.

145
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,350
You're each other's best friend,

146
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,000
right?

147
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,330
You don't want to hurt her,

148
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,830
and she wouldn't want to see you

149
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,790
suffer like this either.

150
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,550
Once it's over

151
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,270
and she knows the truth,

152
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,310
she'll forgive you.

153
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,720
Really?

154
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,190
But...

155
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,540
Just do it for me.

156
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,190
For us.

157
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,710
Okay?

158
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,270
Then I'll…

159
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:39,910
I'll go.

160
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,830
You're alright?

161
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,190
Call me if you need anything.

162
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,360
Let's put an end to this.

163
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,030
I can't keep doing things

164
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,470
that hurt Yan and Jiang Chengyi.

165
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,110
I'd rather die.

166
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,510
I understand.

167
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,630
Sorry.

168
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,460
I shouldn't have pushed you

169
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,700
to do something you didn't want to.

170
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,740
This is my responsibility.

171
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,240
I was out of my mind.

172
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,990
I can't believe I asked you,

173
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,750
a young girl, to cover for me.

174
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,590
I'm such a jerk.

175
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,350
Stop, stop.

176
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,020
Stop.

177
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,830
I'm sorry, Man.

178
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,190
I'm useless.

179
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,990
I really don't know what to do.

180
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,350
If they ever ask you,

181
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,390
just say I forced you.

182
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,030
My life can't

183
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,870
get any better anyway.

184
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,270
But you're different.

185
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,040
You're still young.

186
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,190
You still have a future.

187
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,790
You deserve a good life.

188
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,070
I'll protect you.

189
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,190
What are you planning to do?

190
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,350
I…

191
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,800
I can't tell you

192
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,830
what I'm going to do now,

193
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,190
but I promise

194
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,350
that after this,

196
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,390
threaten us again,

197
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,470
and she'll never hurt

198

What are you going to do?

200
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,510
Tell me.

201
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,860
I'll do it with you.

202

No.

203

You don't need to do anything.

204
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,430
I told you,

205
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,080
I want us

206
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,470
to always be together.

Dear leaders and teachers,

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:36,750
hello.

214

died in an accident yesterday.

217
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,070
Starting today,

218
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,120
the police will conduct an investigation on campus.

219
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,200
If any teacher

220
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,470
can offer any clues,

221
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,950
please contact the administrative office immediately.

222
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,630
Thank you.

231
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,900
This is Coach Zhou Zhicheng.

232
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,950
He's been a PE teacher

233
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,480
at our university for many years,

234
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,480
and he's

235
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,710
the Model of Morality this year.

236
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,310
Zhou,

237
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,030
did you

238
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,770
see the message from the administrative office?

239
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,350
Yes.

240
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,690
Coach Zhou,

241
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,230
do you know that girl?

242
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,830
She was one of my students.

243
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,820
What sport did she take for PE?

244
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,480
Volleyball.

245
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,520
Did you have

246
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,099
any private interactions with her?

247
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,430
No.

[Hiroshima Mon Amour]

249
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,619
I've thought about

250
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,470
destroying this book many times.

251
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,290
But I couldn't bring myself to do it.

252
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,110
It holds all

253
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,160
my memories with her.

254
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,790
I couldn't let it go.

255
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,140
I really loved her.

256
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,990
How did you love her?

257
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,420
You loved her,

258
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,710
yet you watched as Ding Jing bullied her.

259
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:51,950
You loved her,

260
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,790
yet you forced her

261
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,350
to confess to Jiang Chengyi,

262
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,260
even though you knew

263
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,760
the person she liked was you.

264
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,860
You're so much older than her.

265
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,150
Even if what Man did

266
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,110
was not right,

267
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,750
shouldn't you have told her

268
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,350
to stop before it went too far?

269
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,390
How could you just sit back

270
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,780
and let it all happen?

271
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,560
Do you know that

272
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,750
Deng Man

273
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,430
never revealed your relationship

274
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,590
even before she died?

275
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,330
We even called you a teacher.

276
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,940
How could you do that to Deng Man?

277
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,360
How could you do that to your wife?

278
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,230
Do you deserve

279
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,230
to be called a teacher?

280
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,050
Calm down.

281
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,930
Let him make things clear.

282
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,740
You're right.

283
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,430
I'm a jerk,

284
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,990
and karma has caught up with me.

285
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,010
I was diagnosed with cancer three years ago.

286
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,810
I don't think I have much time left.

287
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,610
But I thought,

288
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,090
if I died too,

289
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,370
then no one would ever

290
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,760
bring up Man's case again.

291
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,820
So I wrote an anonymous letter

292
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,270
to the police.

293
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,030
You wrote that letter?

294
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,360
Back then, the letter claimed

295
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,620
that Deng Man didn't commit suicide.

296
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,830
Do you have any evidence

297
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,910
or leads?

298
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,750
I don't have any evidence.

299
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
But I know

300
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,710
she'd never have committed suicide.

301
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,590
We were so in love.

302
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,950
She'd never have had the heart

303
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,510
to leave me behind like that.

304
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,420
She definitely didn't commit suicide.

305
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,600
We've figured out where the money came from

306
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,070
and what happened between them back then.

307
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,930
But something still feels off.

308
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,800
What do you think…

309
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,110
is off?

310
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,030
I can't say for sure.

311
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,380
I'll think about it after I get back.

312
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,760
His story

313
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,910
is too perfect.

314
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,860
I've already

315
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,130
done everything you asked.

316
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,430
Don't worry.

317
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,150
I won't let anyone know

318
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,180
about your existence.

319
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,000
Yan.

320
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,560
Man.

321
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,350
I finally see you again.

322
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,640
I've missed you so much.

323
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,910
I've missed you too.

324
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,940
You and Jiang Chengyi made up?

325
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,790
That's wonderful.

326
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:30,950
Man,

327
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,590
there's something I've always

328
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,550
wanted to ask you.

329
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,350
Do you regret it?

330
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,220
Of course, I do.

331
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,070
I lost the two people

332
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,730
I loved most in my life at the same time.

333
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,070
I was too young back then.

334
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,680
I didn't really understand what love was.

335
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,630
When I needed care

336
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,400
the most,

337
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,470
he appeared,

338
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,230
and

339
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,870
he treated me very well.

340
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,770
But compared with that,

341
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,480
what I regret more…

342
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,350
is not telling you

343
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,190
about my relationship with him.

344
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,550
You'll forgive me,

345
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:18,530
won't you?

346
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,920
You must believe

347
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,190
in your choice.

348
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,620
Jiang Chengyi really loves you.

349
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,910
And,

350
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,370
from now on,

351
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,960

352
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,870
I dreamed about Deng Man.

353
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,090

Jiang,

366
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,550
your takeout.

367
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,430
I didn't order any takeout.

368

371
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,260
Let me see.

372
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,530
Are you dating someone?

373
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,630
What is it? Let me see.

374
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,100
Not unless you admit it.

375
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,400
Let me see!

376
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,510
You're dating someone, aren't you?

377
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,280
Teach me how.

378
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,150
I want to date too.

379
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,370
I'm still single, Jiang.

380
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,590
What can I teach you? Figure it out yourself.

381
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,350
How can I teach you that?

382
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,510
I want to date too.

383
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,680
What's wrong with you?

384
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,510
I can't teach you that.

385
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,300
Get back to work.

386
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,270
Panda love bento.

387
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,310
Keep it down. Why are you so loud?

388
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,790
[Thanks for the love bento.]

389
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,240
[Stairs]

390
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,950
Thanks

391
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,030
for the love bento.

392
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,890
[Huiting Complex]

393
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,730
You didn't turn the lights off when you left?

394
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,990
I did.

395
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,500
Then why are the lights on?

396
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,190
Mom?

397
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,610
Auntie.

398
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,500
Hello, Auntie.

399
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,630
-Hello, Auntie.
-Mom.

400
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,200
Why are you here?

401
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,240
What?

402
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,540
Did I come at a bad time?

403
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,460
No,

404
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,770
but if you'd told me in advance,

405
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,120
I could've picked you up.

406
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,370
You've already met his parents.

407
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,100
Of course I had to hurry back to check things out.

408
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,240
Listen.

409
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,100
There are a few places

410
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,870
I haven't visited.

411
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:18,760
You'll need to reimburse me.

412
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,510
Okay.

413
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,720
No problem.

414
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,470
Why have you lost weight?

415
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,270
No.

416
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:23,850
Look at you.

417
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,840
You must've been through a lot.

418
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,300
What are you talking about? I…

419
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,170
I-I've been really happy.

420
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,520
This, uh, this is…

421
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,110
Auntie.

422
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,430
Mom.

423
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,950
Nice to meet you.

424
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,890
Jiang Chengyi.

425
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,470
-Well.
-Hello, Auntie.

426
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,270
Jiang, right?

427
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,110
Yeah.

428
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,140
You're in great shape

429
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,140
and pretty tall too.

430
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,070
What are you, 190 cm?

431
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,700
Not quite,

432
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,390
just over 180 cm.

433
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,830
See?

434
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,950
Mom's got a good eye.

435
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:48,980
Definitely.

436
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,460
A-Are you two living together?

437
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,030
No.

438
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,910
-No.
-Auntie.

439
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,570
I live next door.

440
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,390
-And…
-Yeah.

441
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,280
We run into each other

442
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,440
going to and from work,

443
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,720
and sometimes…

444
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,430
We grab a meal together.

445
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:03,830
Yeah.

446
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,830
We sometimes have meals together.

447
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,750
How's that different from living together?

448
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,300
With those long legs of yours,

449
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,670
one step from your balcony

450
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,470
and you'd be here.

451
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,640
No way.

452
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,950
Mom, stop joking.

453
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,710
It's the sixth floor.

454
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,510
Who in their right mind

455
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,550
would do that?

456
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,750
Have you eaten yet?

457
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,660
Why don't we order takeout?

458
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,430
You're always eating takeout, aren't you?

459
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,190
No wonder you've lost weight.

460
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,570
Takeout is unhealthy.

461
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,360
-Don't order takeout.
-Alright, no takeout.

462
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,130
Since your mom's just arrived,

463
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,140
let's go out for dinner.

464
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,870
What do you think?

465
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,710
Okay. Do you want to eat out?

466
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,520
Nah.

467
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,350
I'm tired after traveling.

468
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,550
Let's just eat at home.

469
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,110
Okay.

470
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,840
Let's eat at home.

471
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,730
We've got food anyway.

472
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,910
Sit with your mom for a bit.

473
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,990
I-I'll cook.

474
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:41,790
Alright.

475
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,470
Have a rest.

476
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,350
Auntie, I'll cook.

477
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,550
Okay.

478
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,190
Okay.

479
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:44,900
Mom.

480
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:47,830
Mom.

481
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,390
Okay.

482
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,890
He's a great cook.

483
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,130
He looks quite at home.

484
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:58,940
He…

485
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,030
Here.

486
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,390
Be careful.

487
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,070
Thank you.

488
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,110
The dishes are all here.

489
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,430
Eat up.

490
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:10,670
Mom,

491
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,830
try the beef first.

492
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,330
It's a secret family recipe.

493
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,270
It's really good.

494
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,830
How is it?

495
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,310
Not bad.

496
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,820
The beef is really tender.

497
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,350
Secret family recipe.

498
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,020
You like it?

499
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,450
Delicious.

500
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,220
Sit down.

501
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,630
I won't eat with you.

502
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,230
Oh, my memory's terrible.

503
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,730
What's your name again?

504
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,530
I'm Jiang Chengyi, Auntie.

505
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,020
Jiang Chengyi?

506
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,830
Right.

507
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,020
Why does your name sound so familiar?

508
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,190
Sit down and eat.

509
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,710
I'm good.

510
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,470
Well,

511
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,790
your mom just got here today.

512
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,430
You two have a chat.

513
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,480
I'll head back now.

514
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,870
Auntie, I'm leaving.

515
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,560
Jiang.

516
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,990
The clothes in the washing machine

517
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,870
are yours, right?

518
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,110
Yes.

519
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,460
I washed them for you.

520
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,540
Don't forget to take them.

521
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,080
Oh,

522
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,240
thank you, Auntie.

523
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,310
Thank you.

524
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,990
Stop grinning!

525
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,040
Mom,

526
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,010
how long are you staying this time?

527
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,910
Why?

528
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,260
You think I'm in the way?

529
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,860
No!

530
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,630
Why are you always talking like that?

531
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,940
I just want to know how long you're staying

532
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,750
so I can decide if I should take time off to be with you.

533
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,710
No need.

534
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,850
I'm here for two things:

535
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,580
one,

536
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:28,680
to check out

537
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,170
that boyfriend of yours next door;

538
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,660
two, to get a health check at the hospital.

539
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:34,960
I'll book it for you.

540
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,730
No need.

541
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,480
Dr. Han has

542
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,430
already booked it for me.

543
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:43,910
Tell me.

544
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,470
How was the meeting

545
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,420
with Jiang's parents?

546
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,430
It went well.

547
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,600
His parents really like me.

548
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,760
I knew it'd be pointless to ask you!

549
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,110
In your eyes,

550
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,620
everyone's good.

551
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,520
I just can't figure it out.

552
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,670
For eight years,

553
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,210
you didn't date anyone.

554
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,910
Then all of a sudden,

555
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,650
you've met his parents.

556
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,170
How long have you two known each other?

557
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,870
How long?

558
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,120
We've known each other…

559
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,830
for quite a while now.

560
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,100
For quite a while?

561
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,610
And you didn't tell me?

562
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,550
You had me worrying about you

563
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,790
every single day!

564
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,420
I keep thinking about the days

565
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,470
when you broke up

566
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,250
with your ex

567
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,740
and cried your heart out.

568
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,290
Mom.

569
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,610
Actually,

570
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,700
he's

571
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,460
my ex.

572
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,580
I-I knew it.

573
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,580
No wonder his name sounds so familiar.

574
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,910
But honestly, Mom,

575
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,330
it wasn't his fault back then.

576
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,240
I was the one who ended things.

577
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,440
Yan,

578
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,950
it doesn't matter who ended things.

579
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,430
The fact that you two

580
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,940
broke up back then

581
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,270
means you weren't

582
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,560
right for each other.

583
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,260
Mom,

584
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,990
it was all just a misunderstanding back then.

585
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,510
We've cleared it up,

586
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,230
and we can finally

587
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,520
be together again.

588
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,430
And

589
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,310
you know what?

590
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,810
For these eight years,

591
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,390
neither of us was with anyone else.

592
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,260
We both waited for each other.

593
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,090
Really?

594
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,930
I believe in your judgment,

595
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,530
but Yan…

596
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,790
But…

597
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,350
But you're worried about his job,

598
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,090
aren't you?

599
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,160
It's not that I think

600
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,750
his job is bad.

601
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,280
It's just…

602
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,730
his line of work seems a bit dangerous.

603
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,550
Oh, Mom,

604
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,100
we're not kids anymore.

605
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,750
Do you think we wouldn't have

606
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,910
thought about these things

607
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,630
before deciding to be together?

608
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,150
We don't need you

609
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,390
to point that out for us.

610
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,630
Don't worry.

611
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,290
We'll figure it out

612
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,490
and make it work.

613
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,230
We'll be happy together.

614
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,430
Now, lie down

615
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,310
and get some sleep.

616
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,440
It's so late.

617
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,110
Go to sleep.

618
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,320
You've got your checkup tomorrow, right?

619
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:11,860
Come here.

620
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,190
I've missed you so much.

621
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,310
I've missed you.

622
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,290
I've missed you too.

623
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,030
Good girl.

624
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,620
Are you asleep?

625
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,780
Not yet.

626
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,560
See you on the balcony.

627
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,010
Okay.

628
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,440
Are you cold?

629
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,310
Not really.

630
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,770
Is your mom asleep?

631
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,710
Don't take

632
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,950
what my mom said to heart, okay?

633
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:31,940
She's always like that.

634
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,250
I'm fine.

635
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,060
Your mom's visit was so sudden.

636
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,490
I wasn't prepared at all.

637
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,780
How was the food?

638
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,030
It was amazing!

639
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,910
The Stir-fried Beef

640
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,910
was so good.

641
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,880
What does your mom like for breakfast?

642
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,050
I'll get up early and make it for her.

643
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,710
No need.

644
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,390
Tomorrow morning,

645
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,170
I'm taking her to the hospital for her checkup.

646
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,090
She can't eat breakfast.

647
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,030
Don't worry about it.

648
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,470
Then I'll take you guys there.

649
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,840
Don't bother.

650
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,310
She knows her way around the hospital better than you do.

651
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,240
By the way, about what my mom said earlier,

652
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,630
can you really do it?

653
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:06,820
Do what?

654
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,420
You know,

655
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,130
take one step and come here.

656
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,190
You don't want me anymore, huh?

657
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,700
Then catch me.

658
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,640
No problem.

659
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,790
Get ready.

660
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,500
-I'm coming.
-Come here.

661
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,130
I'll head in.

662
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,670
Go. Get some sleep.

663
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,080
Goodnight.

664
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,280
Goodnight.

665
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,910
Goodnight.

666
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,290
If he's Jiang, you've got nothing to worry about.

667
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,650
Just accept him.

668
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,560
If you don't,

669
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,410
someone else will snatch him away.

670
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,990
Dr. Han,

671
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,850
you're a parent too.

672
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,440
You can understand me, right?

673
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,190
Of course,

674
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,400
I understand completely.

675
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,190
I know

676
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:14,710
you're here

677
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,750
to check him out, aren't you?

678
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,290
You've noticed it, haven't you?

679
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,250
In this hospital,

680
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,580
there are so many

681
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,330
female doctors and nurses

682
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,060
with their eyes on Jiang.

683
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,010
If Lu Yan weren't so well-liked,

684
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,980
someone

685
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,560
would've gotten to him already.

686
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,910
How long do you plan to evaluate him?

687
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:33,870
Alright.

688
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,000
Mrs. Lu,

689
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,370
think about it.

690
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,850
Captain Jiang is a police officer,

691
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,820
and Lu Yan is a doctor.

692
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,180
A cop and a doctor,

693
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,720
doesn't that sound perfect?

694
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,250
But they're both so busy,

695
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,610
and their work schedules are irregular.

696
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,180
Even if they're together,

697
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,990
it's almost like

698
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,990
a long-distance relationship.

699
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:00,320
[Blood Test Station]

700
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,190
I can't speak for anyone else,

701
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,070
but Captain Jiang?

702
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:58,780
He's 100%

703
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,090
reliable.

704
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,940
Every time Lu's in trouble,

705
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,050
he's the first one

706
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,870
to show up

707
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,790
and protect her.

708
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,360
Don't worry.

709
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,380
Captain Jiang

710
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,760
is a great guy.

711
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,520
Don't worry, okay?

712
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:18,860
Yilin,

713
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,950
look,

714
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,240
if they're so great together,

715
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,880
why did they break up

716
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,790
in the first place?

717
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,830
Oh, you don't get it.

718
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,350
They just rekindled their love.

719
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,190
It's wonderful.

720
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,190
Don't worry.

721
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,430
Your blood pressure is a bit high.

722
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,230
Let's stop talking.

723
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,700
Take another reading.

724
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,030
Sorry.

725
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,430
Mom.

726
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,660
The test results are out?

727
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,190
Have some water.

728
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,110
You're pouting again.

729
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,600
What's bothering you this time?

730
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,290
I've figured out

731
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,790
what's going on here.

732
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,030
Everyone

733
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,780
at this hospital

734
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,860
has been bought off by Jiang Chengyi.

735
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,750
They're all

736
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,070
singing his praises.

737
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,960
What are they saying?

738
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,350
They say he's decent,

739
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,610
reliable,

740
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,630
honest,

741
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,320
and down-to-earth,

742
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,870
and that all the doctors and nurses at this hospital

743
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,950
like him.

744
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,950
It's as if he's one in a million,

745
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,120
and you'd regret missing out on him.

746
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,220
Where is he now?

747
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,050
At work.

748
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,100
Call him.

749
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,930
Ask him to pick us up later.

750
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,770
Mom, come on.

751
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,260
Relax.

752
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,450
I won't give him a hard time.

753
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,500
Fine,

754
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:34,820
I'll call him later.

755
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,160
Call him now.

756
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,440
Let me check the results first.

757
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,600
Call him now.

758
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,530
Later, I promise.

759
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,460
[I'd like to explain it to you in person.]

760
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,460
[Got time to have lunch with me? About what happened last time—]

761
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,140
Open the door.

762
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:29,900
Get in the car.

763
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,520
Come on.
