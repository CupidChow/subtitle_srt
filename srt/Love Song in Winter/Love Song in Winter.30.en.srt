00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,740
I'm about to win here!

00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,230
One Circle again.

198
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,270
Playing with you old-timers…

199
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,920
West Wind.

200
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,440
is such a hassle.

201
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,700
Which one of you is playing?

202
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,000
Ma Cheng, you're on a roll today.

203
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,000
When am I not…

204
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
Who are you?

[Public Security]

206
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,270
Are you playing or not?

207
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,010
Just play.

208
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,710
An old friend of mine is here.

209
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,680
I'll be back in a minute.

210
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,150
Play for me.

211
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,830
Alright.

212
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,030
Easy. We just need to ask you something.

213
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,110
Alright.

214
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,710
[Mutao Mahjong]

215
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,070
Come on, quick.

216
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:41,820
Yes,

217
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,620
I was Yan Mei's caregiver.

218
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,840
About two years ago,

219
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,970
I looked after her.

220
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,950
Who hired you at the time?

221
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,680
Do you still remember?

222
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,830
It was a man

223
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,000
in his thirties.

224
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,760
We only met once.

225
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,320
After handling the hospital admission,

226
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,370
I never saw him again.

227
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,390
How did you stay in contact?

228
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,320
By phone.

229
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,750
I remember

230
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,500
we'd usually talk once a week.

231
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,960
He also gave me a card

232
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,220
to cover

233
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,580
all the expenses.

234
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,230
Later, Yan Mei was discharged,

235
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:13,950
right?

236
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,350
At the time,

237
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,670
Yan Mei's condition was quite serious.

238
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,240
So I notified him right away.

239
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,070
After he found out,

240
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,470
he told me to arrange for her discharge

241
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,790
and take her home.

242
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,710
Actually, it's understandable.

243
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,420
At that stage,

244
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,140
treatment or no treatment

245
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,310
didn't make much of a difference.

246
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,110
So I sent Yan Mei home.

247
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,750
When I contacted him again,

248
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,620
he said I could leave

249
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,800
and he'd be there soon.

250
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,870
I thought about

251
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,720
meeting him before I left,

252
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,710
just in case something happened

253
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,920
to the patient

254
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,790
and I wouldn't be able to explain it.

255
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,760
But he told me

256
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,860
once she was home,

257
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,150
my job was done,

258
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,780
and I could go.

259
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,600
So after that,

260
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,390
I left.

261
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,450
Take a look.

262
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,470
Is this the man?

263
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,910
No.

264
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,040
Are you sure?

265
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,750
I'm sure.

266
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,770
Can you describe him to us?

267
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,210
What did he look like,

268
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,990
or did he have any distinctive features?

269
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,080
We mostly stayed in touch

270
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,910
over the phone,

271
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,690
but from his voice,

272
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,970
I'd say he was probably local.

273
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,240
Do you still have his number?

274
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,330
I deleted it a long time ago.

275
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,430
Do you remember Yan Mei's address?

276
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,430
That day,

277
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,230
I sent Yan Mei here,

278
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,820
made the call, and left.

279
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,700
Officers,

280
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,690
is there anything else?

281
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,620
No, nothing else.

282
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,060
You can go. Thank you.

283
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
If we need anything, I'll get in touch.

284
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,790
I'm leaving.

285
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,100
Ma Cheng.

286
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,390
Do you smoke?

287
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,630
I don't.

288
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,280
Why?

289
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,170
Nothing. You can go.

290
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,030
Okay.

291
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm off.

292
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,630
Professor Yu.

293
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,400
Look.

294
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,680
These medicines

295
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,050
should be the ones Yan Mei was taking.

296
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,650
And this.

297
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,130
Aside from you, Ma Cheng,

298
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,770
and me,

299
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,270
someone else has been here.

300
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,150
So, you think

301
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,280
Yan Mei is already deceased, right?

302
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,530
Yes, Captain Jiang.

303
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,850
Based on Ma Cheng's account,

304
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,690
Yan Mei's condition was very severe at the time.

305
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,320
Taking her away in that state…

306
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,030
It would've been either to save her

307
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,790
or to kill her.

308
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,510
Exactly.

309
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,120
And so far,

310
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,270
we haven't found

311
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,070
any information or clues

312
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,550
about the person who hired Ma Cheng.

313
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,600
I suspect

314
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,970
this person meant

315
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,270
to hide their identity.

316
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,120
Here's the plan.

317
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,950
You'll stay a couple more days,

318
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,330
visit a few more departments,

319
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,190
and see if you can find any leads.

320
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,710
Alright.

321
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,840
If anything comes up,

322
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,710
I'll tell you immediately.

323
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,790
Okay. Thanks.

324
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,590
Alright, Professor Yu,

325
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,530
I'm heading back to rest.

326
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,390
Liu Hao.

327
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,750
Go buy several packs of cigarettes.

328
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,100
In the next couple of days,

329
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,240
if we encounter any suspicious people,

330
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,410
you'll offer them a cigarette.

331
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,190
After all, there aren't many

332
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,100
who bite their cigarette butts like this.

333
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,270
Got it.

334
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,050
Hello, Qin Yue?

335
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,740
Well, check Yan Mei's

336
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,900
medical records for me.

337
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:03,690
Yes.

338
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,320
Let me know once you've found anything.

339
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,070
What's up?

340
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,120
Nothing, just work.

341
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,950
I made something tasty.

342
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,830
Want to try it?

343
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,990
Sure. Let me see what you made.

344
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:25,840
Come on.

345
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,050
Go take a look.

[Police]

347
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,360
What's this about?

348
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,220
You got me here

349
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,770
but won't say anything.

350
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,280
I've already explained everything.

351
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,130
Do what you want with me.

352
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,290
I'll accept it.

353
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,780
Come in.

354
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,380
Captain Jiang.

355
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,500
Thank you.

356
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,030
Chengzhou Second People's Hospital,

357
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
Yan Mei,

358
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,510
female,

359
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,510
51 years old,

360
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,330
from Chengzhou,

361
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,290
Han ethnicity,

362
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,600
diagnosed with uremia, right?

363
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,710
We looked into it.

364
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,350
Your mother

365
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,750
stayed

366
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,390
in the Second People's Hospital

367
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,090
in 2021 for uremia

368
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,390
for six months.

369
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,400
After she was discharged,

370
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,720
she didn't receive treatment

371
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,670
at any other hospital.

372
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,360
I thought she'd been sent abroad,

373
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,050
but I checked her travel records—

374
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:54,830
she wasn't.

375
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,710
She wasn't treated abroad,

376
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,150
nor was she treated domestically.

377
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,040
But uremia is a condition

378
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,130
that requires treatment.

379
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,270
Without it, she wouldn't survive for long.

380
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,920
So after I think about it,

381
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,470
there's only one possibility left.

382
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,370
Impossible.

383
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,280
He showed me

384
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,230
photos of her.

385
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,330
He seems a nice guy.

386
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,530
He…

387
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,490

Wen Peng is definitely hiding something.

579
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,220
Not going to hit me?

580
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,560
You're going to be a father soon.

581
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,870
Zhong, you need to have a sense of responsibility now!

582
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,390
Calm down.

583
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,740
Calm down.

584
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,190
Calm down.

585
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,150
Zhong.

586
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,720
I've already been merciful.

587
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,290
I've cut you some slack.

588
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,330
If it were someone else,

589
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,280
it wouldn't stop at just losing money.

590
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,260
Come out now.

591
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,480
There's someone at my door.

592
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,100
Professor Yu,

593
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,470
there's no one else in the hallway,

594
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,390
just two staff.

595
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,140
What happened?

596
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,160
Someone was outside my door.

597
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,710
Around

598
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,950
12 o'clock at noon.

599
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,920
This is the second-floor hallway.

600
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:11,540
[Hallway]

601
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:20,750
[Hallway]

602
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,260
There really was someone.

603
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:28,580
[Hallway]

604
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,930
He probably went to the wrong room.

605
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,470
Don't worry.

606
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,660
Our hotel has excellent security.

607
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,370
Just make sure your door…

608
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,580
Can we check the lobby surveillance footage?

609
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,760
Of course.

610
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:38,810
The lobby.

611
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,430
[Lobby]

612
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,230
Did you

613
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:44,950
lose something?

614
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,550
Stop there.

615
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,720
[Lobby]

616
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,360
[Lobby]

617
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,820
Yu Bofeng?

618
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,960
It should be him.

619
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,590
So right after Yu Bofeng got out of prison,

620
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,910
he came to Chengzhou to follow us?

621
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,030
Do you think he's trying to get revenge on you?

622
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:19,710
I don't think so.

623
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,240
I believe he wouldn't

624
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,230
do something like that.

625
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,860
Professor Yu,

626
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,790
Yu Bofeng was a big star

627
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,550
before ending up like this.

628
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,680
It's natural for his mindset to change.

629
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,000
And he does hold resentment

630
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,710
toward both you and Captain Jiang.

631
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,980
We should be cautious.

632
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,750
We can observe

633
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,900
Yu Bofeng a bit longer

634
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,910
to see what his real intentions are.

635
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,470
But honestly,

636
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,830
I don't think

637
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,480
he'll do anything extreme.

638
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,070
The top priority now

639
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,070
is to find Li Ruonan's address.

640
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,480
I'm really sorry.

641
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,020
Manager Sun isn't in today,

642
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,530
but he specifically asked me

643
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,870
to assist you.

644
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,490
Let me introduce myself.

645
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,900
My surname is Wang.

646
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,540
I'm a temp worker here.

647
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,010
You can just call me Wang.

648
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:08,690
Alright.

649
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,880
What are the specifics of the body

650
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,280
you're looking for?

651
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,630
Female,

652
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,970
around 50 years old.

653
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,690
She should have been sick before she died,

654
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,870
so she was very thin and light.

655
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,010
She died about two years ago.

656
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,350
Among the unclaimed bodies

657
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,850
in the hospital, it seems

658
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,560
none of them matches your description.

659
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,400
But the police station

660
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,320
has a body of a woman

661
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,450
in her 50s.

662
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,230
Maybe that's the one

663
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:43,950
you're looking for.

664
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,310
Can we take a look

665
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,100
at her basic information?

666
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:46,950
Sure.

667
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,190
The reason this body

668
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,630
hasn't been claimed

669
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,200
is because all her family members have died.

670
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,760
But her time of death

671
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,860
seems to have been last year.

672
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,860
Here's the name.

673
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,720
See if it matches up.

674
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,270
[Unclaimed Bodies]

675
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,840
By the way,

676
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,900
what kind of case are you working on

677
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,239
that brought you all the way here?

678
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,920
Nothing major.

679
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,800
Thanks for your help.

680
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,139
If I need anything else, I'll get in touch.

681
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:25,909
Cigarette.

682
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,210
Wang, right?

683
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,120
Here.

684
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,860
Oh, thanks.

685
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,620
I'm afraid

686
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,610
we'll need your help again.

687
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,460
Thank you.

688
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,750
Thank you.

689
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,380
Goodbye.

690
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,350
Thank you.

691
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:45,909
Goodbye.

692
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,560
Did you notice

693
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,780
the way that guy smoked?

694
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,500
I did.

695
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,260
And he seemed very interested

696
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,230
in what we'd found out.

697
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,410
Exactly.

698
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:17,840
Find a way to get hold of

699
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,830
one of his cigarette butts.

700
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,110
Got it.
