00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,729
Coach Zhou,

4
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,140
you're out for a walk again?

5
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,860
Yeah.

6
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,750
Coach Zhou,

7
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,009
you're so good to your wife.

8
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,770
It's been almost 20 years.

Yeah.

Well,

there's something I want to ask you.

What is it?

how have you been?

24
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,350
Same as always.

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,720
It's been hard for you these years.

Back in school,

32
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,240
there was a girl named Ding Jing.

33
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,390
Do you remember her?

34
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,710
Kind of.

35
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,750
She was killed not too long ago.

36
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,550
I've heard about it.

Coach Zhou,

38
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,050
did you still have contact

39
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,870
with Ding Jing?

40
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,030
No.

41
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:47,850
I had no reason

42
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,510
to stay in touch with her.

43
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,990
Since when did you

44
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,990
stop contacting her?

45
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,350
We never really had any contact.

46
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,510
Here's the thing.

47
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,320
When Ding Jing was at school,

48
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,760
as you may know,

49
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,440
she was pretty arrogant and domineering.

50
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,510
At that time,

51
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,530
she bullied a girl in her class

52
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,950
named Deng Man.

53

It's been too long.

55
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,840
I can't really recall.

Deng Man

59
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,430
confessed to me back in school.

60
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,930
You were the one who mentioned that, right?

61
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,110
Ever since I got sick,

62
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,900

64
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,570

You came all this way,

68

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,060
that before Ding Jing was killed,

I'm not

79

implying anything, Coach Zhou.

80

I just want to know

81
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,650
what you two talked about,

82
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,159
the specifics of it.

83
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,920
I want to see if it might

84
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,070
help us solve the case.

85
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,050
I'm really sorry,

86
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,690
but my wife isn't doing well.

87
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,540
No matter what it is, could we…

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,110
could we discuss it another time?

89
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,830
No problem.

Firstly,

147
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,170
I'm just Yu Bofeng's

148

you can just let us know.

should I have?

He's spent almost a million yuan on it.

197
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,300
Really?

198
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,030
But do you remember

199
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,440
his family was very poor

200
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,910
when we were in college?

201
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,420
His wife's been bedridden for years.

202
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,280
We even donated money to him.

203
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,230
Yeah, yeah,

204
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,270
I remember that.

205
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,220
So I think

206
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,570
there's more to this.

207
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:37,870
How about this?

208
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,790
I'll send you the screenshots.

209
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,990
Take a look

210
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,150
and see if they help.

211
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:41,850
Alright.

212
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,160
Send them over.

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,860
Okay, I'll hang up now.

214
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,640
[Have Film, Have Fun]

215
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,200
I understand your concerns.

216
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,750
Yes.

217
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,030
Alright.

218
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,070
Give me a bit more time

219
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,910
to make this…

220
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,470
Um…

221
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,360
I'll get back to you later.

222
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,470
What is it, Professor Yu?

223
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,870
Is this your idea, Mr. Wen?

224
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,110
PR companies are just like this.

225
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,470
They want to resolve problems quickly,

226
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:19,960
so…

227
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,230
So you think

228
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,430
money

229
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,550
is a quick solution

230
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,360
to all problems,

231
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,000
right?

232
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,110
I have to consider everyone.

233
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,640
This industry

234
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,550
is a game of fame and fortune.

235
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,670
I can't trust

236
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,430
anyone's promises.

237
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,710
I can only trust the law.

238
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,640
Precisely because I respect everyone,

239
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,760
I need to ensure

240
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,120
everyone's interests are protected.

241
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,360
I still have things to do.

242
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,860
Professor Yu, if there's anything,

243
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,790
you can call me.

244
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,610
Mr. Wen.

245
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,290
I recall you mentioned

246
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,520
you took psychology as an elective

247
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,150
in college, right?

248
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,260
Yes.

249
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,120
Then you should know

250
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:06,990
everyone has

251
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,410
their own individuality

252
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,440
and the right

253
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,670
to choose their own fate.

254
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,300
Yu Bofeng has the right to decide

255
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,520
whether to meet me or not.

256
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,990
You don't have the authority

257
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,110
to decide whether I can see him or not.

258
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,420
From what I know of Yu Bofeng,

259
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,990
he's not someone

260
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,510
who can be easily swayed by profit.

261
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,660
So everything

262
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,200
you're doing today

263
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,290
is solely for yourself.

264
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,080
I'm running such a big company.

265
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,620
If it's not for the company's interests,

266
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,830
then what's it for?

267
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,510
For you?

268
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,120
Actually, compared to Yu Bofeng,

269
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,910
I'm more interested in you.

270
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,060
Is that so?

271
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,230
You possess

272
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,270
all the traits

273
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,380
of a high-IQ criminal—

274
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,950
exceptional intelligence,

275
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,150
meticulous planning,

276
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,120
and rebellious views.

277
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,470
Most importantly,

278
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,670
you were connected to

279
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,140
Deng Man,

280
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,230
Wang Qianqian,

281
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,270
and Ding Jing.

282
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,190
I only knew them.

283
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,200
This is not something

284
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,310
you can joke about.

285
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,180
I'm not joking.

286
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,730
Professor Yu,

287
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,140
as I've said before,

288
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,470
we businesspeople

289
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,780
hate trouble the most.

290
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,330
Is there anything else?

291
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,010
Well, I'm sorry to say,

292
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,710
but life always

293
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,420
comes with plenty of trouble.

294
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,470
Been waiting a while?

295
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,640
It's fine.

296
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,770
You came together?

297
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,230
Yeah.

298
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,660
Hello, Dr. Lu.

299
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,570
I'm Yu Zheng.

300
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,390
Hello.

301
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,480
He told me about you.

302
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,400
You're quite an expert

303
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,790
in criminal psychology.

304
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,070
Thank you for helping me look into

305
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,050
Man's case.

306
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,030
I've gone through

307
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,790
the clues I have

308
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,630
and made a mind map.

309
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,670
Take a look.

310
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,150
I've arranged the clues

311
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,340
related to Deng Man

312
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,260
[Deng Man] [Zhou Zhicheng] [Ding Jing]

313
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,470
chronologically.

314
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,880
They're "Hiroshima Mon Amour,"

315
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,350
the unknown video,

316
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,600
the alternate Weibo account,

317
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,010
Deng Man's suicide note,

318
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:37,870
and the anonymous letter

319
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,070
from three years ago.

320
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,910
Let's extract the key points

321
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,280
from all the clues.

322
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,230
"Hiroshima Mon Amour"

323
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,650
symbolizes a forbidden love.

324
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,820
The unknown video

325
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,490
was Ding Jing's method

326
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,980
of threatening Deng Man.

327
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,000
The alternate Weibo account

328
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,910
was Deng Man's

329
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,400
accusation against Ding Jing.

330
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,510
The suicide note

331
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,720
explains the reason for her death.

332
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,430
The anonymous letter from three years ago

333
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,480
indicates someone

334
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,750
was questioning the cause of Deng Man's death.

335
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,880
The biggest problem now

336
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,780
is that when we connect

337
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,870
all the clues together,

338
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,040
the logic doesn't hold,

339
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,270
and they contradict each other.

340
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,150
If the suicide note is real,

341
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,060
then Deng Man

342
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,880
took her own life because she couldn't have you.

343
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,600
"Hiroshima Mon Amour"

344
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,590
and that anonymous letter

345
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,610
wouldn't make sense.

346
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,830
But if the anonymous letter

347
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,330
is genuine,

348
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,950
then the suicide note

349
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,820
is questionable,

350
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,310
and there must be more

351
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,580
to her cause of death.

352
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,380
Oh, right,

353
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,350
I've discovered

354
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,030
a new clue recently.

355
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,110
Over the eight years since Deng Man's death,

356
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,310
Zhou Zhicheng

357
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,140
visited her grave many times,

358
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,350
fourteen in total.

359
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,110
To me,

360
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,000
that goes beyond

361
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,550
a normal teacher-student relationship.

362
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,430
So, are you saying

363
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,350
there was something between Deng Man and Coach Zhou?

364
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,720
Girls like Deng Man,

365
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,190
who grow up unloved,

366
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,380
often develop a tendency

367
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,350
to seek father-like figures.

368
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,960
It's actually

369
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,290
quite common.

370
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,190
So it's not entirely impossible

371
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,670
that she was involved with Coach Zhou.

372
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,390
Besides, doesn't "Hiroshima Mon Amour"

373
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,770
perfectly align with

374
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,470
the idea of being involved

375
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,630
with a married man?

376
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,630
So Coach Zhou lied to me.

377
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,870
I asked him about this,

378
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,490
and he said he wasn't close to Deng Man.

379
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,580
These are just my theories,

380
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,780
but I think the general direction

381
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,150
is correct.

382
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,030
As for evidence,

383
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,350
Captain Jiang can find it.

384
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,390
Alright.

385
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,310
Do you have

386
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,590
any updates on your side?

387
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,100
There are some clues,

388
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,280
but they're still incomplete.

389
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,070
I'll let you know

390
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,030
once I've confirmed them.

391
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,750
Alright.

392
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,280
Thanks for your help.

393
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,830
No problem.

394
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:34,470
I'll get going.

395
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:34,990
Okay.

396
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,910
I need to go find Coach Zhou.

397
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,540
I'll go with you.

398
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,770
Wouldn't it be inappropriate for you to go?

399
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,520
No.

400
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,550
For now, this is still a civil case.

401
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,790
Besides, I'd worry

402
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,590
if you went alone.

403
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:10,880
Are you there?

404
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,980
My phone was confiscated.

405
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,109
I just borrowed someone else's phone

406
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,160
to log into WeChat.

407
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,480
How are you doing now?

408
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,589
[Yu Bofeng] [Delete]

409
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,010
[Yu Bofeng]

410
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,319
[Settings] [Block]

411
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,030
You still need

412
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,890
to do the rehab.

413
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,780
Maybe one day,

414
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,990
you'll be able to stand up again.

415
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,820
Alright.

416
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,330
Time to eat.

417
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,110
Time to eat.

418
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,390
I just made some porridge.

419
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,440
It's been sitting for a bit.

420
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,710
I tried it.

421
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,430
It's not hot anymore.

422
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,230
Here.

423
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,350
Come on.

424
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,900
Still angry?

425
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,780
I know I've made mistakes,

426
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,380
but I've told you

427
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,120
I'll never do it again.

428
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,830
Forgive me, okay?

429
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,110
Right now, you only have me,

430
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,830
and I only have you.

431
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,290
Let's spend the rest of our lives together.

432
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:56,950
Here,

433
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,960
have some porridge.

434
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,430
Have some porridge.

435
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,410
What do you want?

436
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,620
I've apologized to you.

437
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,540
I've promised I'll never do it again.

438
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,160
You just won't forgive me.

439
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,160
You're never satisfied.

440
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,550
What do you want from me?

441
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,770
What exactly do you want me to do?

442
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,010
Come on.

443
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,320
Eat.

444
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,750
Come on.

445
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,190
Open your mouth.

446
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,030
Open your mouth.

447
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,430
Eat.

448
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,500
Do you hear me?

449
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,280
You don't want to live anymore, do you?

450
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,130
Then let's die together.

451
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,470
After all, you've long given up on life!

452
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,770
Fine.

453
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,790
If you don't want to live, then don't!

454
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,150
Let's just die together!

455
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,630
Die together!

456
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,230
I brought back some porridge from the cafeteria.

457
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,500
Eat some, okay?

458
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,110
Here.

459
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,810
It's pumpkin porridge,

460
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,030
a little sweet.

461
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,710
Come on, try it.

462
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,910
You haven't eaten anything

463
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,670
for several days.

464
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,710
You can't go on like this.

465
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,420
Honey,

466
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,590
I know you're devastated.

467
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,160
You probably wish you were dead.

468
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,990
If I could take your place,

469
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,930
I absolutely would.

470
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,320
Don't be afraid, okay?

471
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,550
I won't abandon you.

472
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,370
I'll stay with you,

473
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,110
watch over you,

474
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,470
and take care of you.

475
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,030
I'll never leave you.

476
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,990
Believe me, okay?

477
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,590
I promise.

478
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,230
I swear,

479
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,500
I'll take care of you forever.

480
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,150
Coach Zhou,

481
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,620
you deserve the title

482
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,000
of Moral Model of Ninghai.

483
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,050
Thank you, Principal.

484
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,770
Dear audience,

485
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,520
sitting next to me now

486
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,890
is Mr. Zhou Zhicheng,

487
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,830
an exceptional coach

488
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,090
who has tirelessly looked after

489
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,160
his paralyzed wife

490
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,690
for nearly five years.

491
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,870
Coach Zhou Zhicheng,

492
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,020
do you have anything to say?

493
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,870
As her husband,

494
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,460
it's my responsibility to take care of her.

495
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,150
It must have been tough these years.

496
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,980
No matter how hard it gets,

497
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,270
I won't give up on her.

498
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,090
Are you crazy?

499
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,000
You really plan to take care of her for life?

500
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,420
Son,

501
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,150
I know you're responsible,

502
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,070
but you can't

503
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,470
ruin your life too.

504
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,700
Don't even start.

505
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,350
The woman I'm caring for now

506
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,870
is completely bedridden,

507
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,330
doing everything in bed—

508
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,650
eating, drinking, and all.

509
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,050
There's no dignity left.

510
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,710
If you ask me,

511
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,140
it'd be better if she just died.

512
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,860
Coach Zhou.

513
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,390
What brings you here?

514
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,750
I just missed you.

515
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,390
The caregiver told me

516
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,350
you're not eating again.

517
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,150
What do you want?

518
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,530
I've been taking care of you for ten years.

519
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,010
A full ten years.

520
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:01,880
I've never complained.

521
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,910
I've never said a word

522
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,950
of resentment.

523
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,570
I indulged myself just once,

524
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,170
and even that's not allowed?

525
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,230
I'm a human being!

526
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,710
I'm a human being!

527
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,300
You'd better start eating,

528
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,230
or I'll get the doctor

529
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,230
to hook you up to glucose.

530
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,580
I won't let you die.

531
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:55,630
Hello?

532
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,080
Captain Jiang,

533
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,640
we've looked into

534
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,770
Zhou Zhicheng's financial records.

535
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,150
As you suspected,

536
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,270
there's indeed an issue.

537
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,830
Aside from his regular salary

538
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,010
and subsidies,

539
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,330
at the beginning of each year,

540
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,940
he deposits a large sum into his account,

541
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,090
at least 300,000 yuan each time.

542
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,350
He's been doing that

543
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,520
for three years now.

544
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,330
Can we trace the source of the money?

545
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,280
I asked the bank,

546
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,240
but each deposit was made in cash,

547
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,180
so it's quite difficult to track.

548
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,850
Alright, I understand.

549
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,510
So,

550
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,710
ever since Coach Zhou

551
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,010
was diagnosed with cancer,

552
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,980
someone's been giving him money

553
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,310
for three years.

554
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,490
Why would this person

555
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,020
do that?

556
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,750
We'll find out

557
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,430
after we ask him later.

558
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,040
Coach Zhou,

559
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,790
it's so late.

560
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,820
Why are you sitting out here?

561
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,720
I-I

562
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,260
just came out for some fresh air.

563
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,960
It's so cold out here.

564
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:03,960
Hurry and head back inside.

565
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,830
Okay.

566
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,770
Coach Zhou?

567
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,020
Coach Zhou?

568
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,400
Not at home?

569
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,030
Coach Zhou?

570
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,240
Mrs. Zhou.

571
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,530
Mrs. Zhou.

572
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,950
Where's Coach Zhou?

573
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,030
Mrs. Zhou.

574
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,590
You know why we're here.

575
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,450
Did Coach Zhou and Deng Man…

576
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,890
Something's there?

577
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,160
Up, up.

578
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,790
She's looking up.

579
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,800

595
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,140
She fainted.

596
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,000
Did she skip breakfast today?

597
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,600
Yes, we woke up late.

598

599
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:00,950

601
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,710
You're awake.

603

606
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,510
You skipped breakfast, didn't you?

607
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,420
Low blood sugar, right?

608
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,920
You really need to eat breakfast.

609
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,580
Skipping breakfast

610
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,870
is very bad for your health.

611
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,030

00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,960

615

616
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,210

618

620
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,940

Why was Coach Zhou here?

631
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,300
You should thank him.

632
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,560
When you fainted,

633
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,360
the boys in our class all freaked out.

634
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,560
Fortunately, Coach Zhou was there.

635
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,440
He came over

636
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,510
and picked you up.

637
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,390
Coach Zhou is so kind.

638
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,070
I heard he's especially good to his wife.

639
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,870
His wife's legs

640
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,160
have been paralyzed for many years.

641
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,430
Coach Zhou takes such good care of her

642
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,080
that she's never even gotten bedsores.

643
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,090
Oh my god.

644
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,610
So attentive and responsible.

645
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,170
Where can you find a man like that?

646
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:35,990
Yeah.

650
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,670
I was thinking it must be you.

651
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,560
Why are you still here?

652
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,310
Why haven't you

653
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,820
headed home for the holiday?

654
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,590
I remember your family

655
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,390
isn't local, right?

656
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,660
I have nowhere to go.

657
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,990
What do you mean?

658
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,590
What about your parents?

659
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,150
My parents passed away.

660
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,110
Then,

661
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,110
do you have any other relatives?

662
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,550
If you don't mind,

663
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,900
you can come to my place today.

664
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,880
I plan to make dumplings.

665
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,270
Wouldn't that be too much trouble for you?

666
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:32,870
Not at all.

669

Our parents don't live with us,

670
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,890
and we don't have kids.

671
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,150
If you come over,

672
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,110
you can liven things up a bit.

[Hiroshima Mon Amour]

768
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,090
Deng Man,

769
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,080
you keep coming here,

770
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,230
and it's affecting our training.

771
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,710
Don't come again.

772
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,510
I understand,

773
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,350
but you keep avoiding me.

774
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,920
You're too young.

775
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:19,870
You don't even know

776
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,870
what you're doing.

777
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,440
I'm sorry.

778
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,340
Anyway, I've said what I need to.

779
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,580
Please don't come again.

780
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,200
Put them back in.

781
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,350
Okay.

782
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,890
Clean up properly.

783
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,240
Okay.

784
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,230
Why didn't you fight back?

785
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,930
I don't mind.

786
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,070
Don't you know that by doing this,

787
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,600
you'll only encourage them to go further?

788
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,250
Are you worried about me?

789
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,430
Coach Zhou.

790
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,260
I know this is wrong,

791
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,800
but I can't help it.

792
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,960
I really like you.

793
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,510
I know you have a family,

794
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,500
and I don't want to interfere.

795
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,580
I just want

796
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,890
to watch you from afar.

797
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,870
Enough, Deng Man.

798
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,430
Stop. This isn't right.

799
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,910
Wait, wait, wait.

800
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,000
Don't leave me, Coach Zhou.

801
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,380
Please,

802
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,900
just stay a little longer.

803
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,360
Maybe ten minutes?

804
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:09,820
Or

805
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,490
three minutes will be enough.

806
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,130
Deng Man.

807
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,190
You're so young.

808
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,110
I'm afraid you've misunderstood

809
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,030
your feelings.

810
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,840
I'm very sure about my feelings for you.

811
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,910
And I feel for you too.

812
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,790
You've been carrying such

813
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,070
a heavy burden

814
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,330
for so many years

815
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,890
while others call you

816
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,350
responsible

817
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,750
and a good man.

818
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,170
But no one

819
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,050
sees your pain.
