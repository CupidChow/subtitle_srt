00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,910
We've been asking around everywhere these days,

7
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,250
but no one knows

8
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,330
when Li Ruonan's mother

9
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,820
disappeared.

10
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,120
From what I know, those in the neighborhood

11
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,100
don't interact with each other a lot.

12
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,330
They suddenly found out one day

13
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,240
that her house became empty.

14
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,930
What about Li Ruonan?

When people like Li Ruonan

19
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,110
they're determined to die.

20
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,480
So it's very hard to get them to talk.

21
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,290
Based on the last interrogation,

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,360
we speculated that

23
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,650
Li Ruonan values her mother very much.

24
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:28,880
But at the moment,

25
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,579
we have too few clues.

26
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,040
It took us a lot of time

28
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,930

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,970
I suddenly feel that

33
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,390
there's one person we can't overlook.

34

48

Now, we have absolutely no idea

49
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,470
what motivated Li Ruonan

to kill Wang Qianqian,

51
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,360

after killing Wang Qianqian,

53
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,950
she went through so much trouble

54

does this lake have?

to see if we missed anything.

64

So you suspect

00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,970
there was something wrong with that case back then?

66
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,260
Based on the current situation,

this case

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,360
After that,

195
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,000
you'll have a grasp

196
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,180
of the basic logic

197
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,000
and professional terms

198
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,350
of criminal psychology.

199
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,170
Do it carefully.

200
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,310
Call me when you're done,

201
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,150
and I'll come collect the homework.

202
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,710
Okay.

203
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,550
Professor Yu

204
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,260
may not know well

205
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,920
about our industry.

206
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,150
In our industry,

207
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,830
urgent matters can't be delayed

208
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,320
even for a second.

209
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,190
But when it's not urgent,

210
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,900
there may be no news

211
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,030
for ten days or even half a month.

212
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,190
Right.

213
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,880
I may not know much

214
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:47,909
about your industry.

215
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,790
But I believe

216
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,300
it'll be better for artists

217
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,850
to reserve more time to prepare

218
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,150
before they do anything.

219
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,950
You're right, Professor Yu.

220
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,420
Why don't you say thank you?

221
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,470
No need.

222
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,730
You guys continue.

223
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,940
Professor Yu,

224
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,040
why don't you

225
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,900
tutor him now?

226
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,770
I have classes later.

227
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,410
Maybe another day.

228
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll text you when I'm done.

229
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,400
The interview is already over.

230
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,350
Why did you ask her to deliver these materials to you?

231
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,190
Didn't you say

232
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,870
you'd tell me everything about you?

233
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,750
Have you forgotten it already?

234
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,320
Well...

235
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,380
Peng.

236
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,840
Actually, I...

237
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,740
You like her?

238
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,160
Yes.

239
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,950
Bofeng.

240
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,970
You should know

241
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,870
our company made you popular

242
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,590
step by step.

243
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,980
I know that.

244
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,940
My plan was to

245
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,930
have a good talk with you after getting discharged.

246
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,750
How would I know

247
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,990
you'd bump into each other today?

248
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,910
Did she agree?

249
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,950
She doesn't know yet.

250
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,800
Make sure you keep me updated on

251
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,870
what you do.

252
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay.

253
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,470
Don't worry.

254
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,440
I know what to do.

255
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,760
Every one else in your department had got off work.

256
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,410
Only you, the model worker, was still working.

257
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,080
Dr. Lu, are you off work?

258
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,960
Yeah, I'm off. Bye.

259
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,550
Bye.

260
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,610
What brings you here?

261
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,020
Zhong went to discuss business,

262
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,130
and I was left alone at home.

263
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:41,710
I thought I'd come

264
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,550
to ask the baby's godmother to buy me dinner.

265
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,350
Is he out making money for baby formula?

266
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,530
I don't expect him to make much money.

267
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,430
As long as our family is safe

268
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,170
and healthy.

269
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,570
What about your boyfriend?

270
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,110
He went to see his parents.

271
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,910
Little baby.

272
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,950
Godmother will cook for you,

273
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,880
okay?

274
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,750
Why bother cooking?

275
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,460
Let's just eat outside.

276
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,060
You can't eat outside now.

277
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,230
The oil they use is not clean.

278
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,380
I'll cook for you.

279
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,590
We can talk about it again in six months.

280
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,520
Hello, Zhong.

281
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,240
Don't have dinner yet.

282
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,620
We may need to have dinner with our clients.

283
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,150
Okay.

284
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,390
See you in the office in a bit.

285
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,500
Still haven't finished?

286
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,480
I don't know how to do it.

287
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,110
What kind of question is this?

288
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,510
There's no logic at all.

289
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,940
What question is it?

290
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,260
Look at this question, Peng.

291
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,160
It says a pair of sisters

292
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,670
saw a man

293
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,770
on their father's funeral,

294
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,760
and they fell in love with him at the same time.

295
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,760
The next day,

296
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,990
the younger sister killed the older sister.

297
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,670
The question is,

298
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,540
what's the younger sister's motive for murder?

299
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,050
Isn't it easy?

300
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,660
The younger sister wants to hold another funeral

301
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,140
so that she can see that man again.

302
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,790
Peng, you do have a point.

303
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,270
You've learned this too?

304
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,670
You're amazing, Peng.

305
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,480
All right.

306
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,470
Just do your homework.

307
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,380
But Bofeng,

308
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,060
don't blame me for not reminding you.

309
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,090
After you lie once,

310
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,060
you'll have to make up thousands of lies

311
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,070
to patch up that lie.

312
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,230
But I have no choice.

313
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,260
I'm cornered.

314
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,930
You must be the first person

315
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,130
to pursue a girl this way.

316
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,450
Good luck.

317
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,180
See you.

318
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,190
Come on.

319
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:28,730
Come on.

320
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,370
Try it and see if it's too salty or too bland.

321
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,790
It's perfectly cooked.

322
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,560
Really?

323
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,420
Your cooking is excellent.

324
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,720
My dad's cooking is indeed the best.

325
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,790
-Of course.
-Yeah.

326
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,510
Well...

327
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,760
Dad, Mom.

328
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,850
Are you free

329
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,790
next weekend?

330
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,690
What?

331
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,050
Are you bringing your girlfriend back?

332
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,850
Really?

333
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,520
Yes.

334
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,740
Is it Dr. Lu?

335
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,780
Yes.

336
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,190
My goodness, Son.

337
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,920
Thumbs-up for you.

338
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,910
You're awesome.

339
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,440
You really got her to be your girlfriend?

340
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,970
Who does our son take after? So nice.

341
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:13,610
Son.

342
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:14,840
Are you sure about this?

343
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,620
Yes.

344
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,000
Then make sure you

345
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,230
make it clear to Dr. Lu that

346
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,680
you'll be in the front line

347
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,810
for the rest of your life.

348
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,870
I'm worried

349
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,060
she'll be frightened and worried all the time

350
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,010
in the future like your mother.

351
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,150
But

352
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,890
I definitely support you.

353
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,800
But Son,

354
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,950
you must

355
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,670
listen to Dr. Lu more.

356
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,030
Okay.

357
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,790
She knows

358
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,040
the situation and nature

359
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,270
of my work.

360
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,550
And we've been together for a while.

361
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,430
She can accept it.

362
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,230
Okay, that's good.

363
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,700
I knew Dr. Lu

364
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,360
was a sensible girl.

365
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,480
Besides,

366
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,710
when you choose someone,

367
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,390
right?

368
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,100
You should support

369
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,180
and respect each other.

370
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:54,790
Right?

371
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,160
Besides,

372
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,590
if you weren't a policeman back then,

373
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,310
being all upright and cool,

374
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,390
would I have fallen for you?

375
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,230
If it weren't for that police uniform,

376
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,110
I might not have married you.

377
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,660
That's true. I did look great in the police uniform.

378
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,480
Exactly.

379
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,280
The point is you loved my cooking.

380
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,800
That was just a bonus.

381
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,760
Let's make it

382
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,910
next Sunday then.

383
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,410
It's a deal.

384
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,270
Okay.

385
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,080
Alright then.

386
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,220
I'll call Xu

387
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,050
right away

388
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,520
and ask him to save

389
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,370
some high-quality pork butt for me.

390
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,070
Okay.

391
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,890
Make your specialties.

392
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,950
Finish your meal first. No hurry.

393
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Tell me, Son,

394
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,720
where are you two at in your relationship?

395
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,750
Well...

396
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,470
We're just dating normally.

397
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,190
When pursuing a girl, you need to make hay while the sun shines.

398
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,760
You must treat her well,

399
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,450
understand?

400
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,410
I do. I know.

401
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,510
If you don't know how, ask your dad to teach you.

402
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,270
The time when my dad was dating...

403
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,770
It was in the last century.

404
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,710
Learn to cook from him.

405
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,230
I can't use his tricks.

406
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,000
How nice.

407
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,820
[Huiting Complex]

408
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:52,840
Try it.

409
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,180
Is it good?

410
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,960
Really good.

411
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:58,630
Not lying?

412
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,810
I'm not.

413
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,190
You know what?

414
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,670
Jiang Chengyi has been cooking here

415
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,320
and showing off his cooking skills,

416
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,100
you know?

417
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,970
I have to learn some specialties

418
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,950
and take him down with a single brilliant feat.

419
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,550
I support you.

420
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,430
I'm blessed.

421
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,460
You just said

422
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,550
you didn't think it was a good idea

423
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,780
for Zhong to do business with Wen Peng. Why is that?

424
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,990
Well, as for Senior Wen,

425
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,150
he does have good resources and connections.

426
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,350
After all,

427
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,550
he's been in the industry for so many years.

428
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,550
But Zhong

429
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,430
has always been focusing his energy

430
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,610
on me.

431
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,100
He never cared much about his career,

432
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,110
and he's honest and naive.

433
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,240
I'm worried he'll suffer losses.

434
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,870
It's understandable that you have concerns.

435
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,830
But

436
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,910
I feel that

437
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,520
Senior Wen is not that kind of person.

438
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,070
You feel?

439
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,400
Do you think what you feel is correct?

440
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,760
Haven't you noticed that

441
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,630
Senior Wen Peng

442
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,910
treats you a bit differently?

443
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,960
Are you kidding me,

444
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,930
Sis?

445
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,670
Senior Wen and I...

446
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
We are just senior and junior fellows.

447
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,230
You treat him as your senior,

448
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,280
but he may not

449
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,720
think the same about you.

450
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,750
Think about it.

451
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,950
He's a man who never married

452
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,100
or dated

453
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,000
in the past eight years.

454
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,250
He's always so distant,

455
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,340
but he only takes

456
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,750
attentive care of you.

457
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,050
If you weren't pregnant…

458
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,900
I wouldn't hit a pregnant woman.

459
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,100
Listen.

460
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,350
That's not possible.

461
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,100
Attentive care?

462
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,830
You must be kidding.

463
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,310
Think about it yourself.

464
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,330
Peng.

465
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,000
Is Mr. Ke coming or not?

466
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,440
Exactly.

467
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,690
It's been three hours.

468
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,510
What's the rush?

469
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,110
He owns the IP.

470
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,360
Do you know how many people are fighting for it?

471
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,270
Of course he makes the call.

472
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,910
Mr. Wen.

473
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:58,940
Mr. Ke is here.

474
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,180
Hello, Peng.

475
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:02,950
Hello, Mr. Ke.

476
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,750
Bring me the tea

477
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,400
I bought a few days ago.

478
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,220
Okay.

479
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,290
Sorry to keep you waiting.

480
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,880
We've also just finished our work.

481
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:10,820
Mr. Ke.

482
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,680
Let me introduce.

483
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:12,990
Zhong Wenxuan.

484
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,630
Yuan Dalu.

485
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,230
They were both my classmates in college,

486
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,400
and my partners now.

487
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,560
They also work in the film and television industry.

488
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,720
Hello, Mr. Ke.

489
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,640
I'll skip the tea.

490
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,540
Time is limited.

491
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,860
Let's make it short.

492
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,340
Sit.

493
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,270
Come on, let's sit and talk.

494
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,710
Sit.

495
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,180
Mr. Ke.

496
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,940
I've gone through

497
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,650
the project proposal and the creative team.

498
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,560
There's no problem with that.

499
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,910
The script is also very good.

500
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,990
It suits

501
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,570
the trending feminist theme very well.

502
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,280
And of course, thank you very much

503
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,470
for letting Bofeng be a part of it.

504
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,620
That's what I should do.

505
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,550
Bofeng is an excellent actor.

506
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,120
After all, as you know,

507
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,550
we have many choices.

508
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,350
We own a big IP.

509
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,470
Luckily, you were willing to make an advance payment,

510
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,770
which solved some problems for us.

511
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,820
So, Mr. Ke,

512
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,880
the reason why I wanted to see you

513
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,900
is to tell you that

514
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,070
I want to give some of my investment shares

515
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,070
to my friends.

516
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,300
To them?

517
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,819
Please don't get me wrong.

518
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,339
What I mean is,

519
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,569
I'll give my part

520
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,480
to them.

521
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,390
I won't take any of your share.

522
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,829
After all, you are in charge here.

523
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,990
I have to keep you informed.

524
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,810
Peng.

525
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,450
Why would you want to do that?

526
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,290
This is a project with promising profit.

527
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,230
Why would you give the profit

528
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,310
to some other people just like that?

529
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,859
They're my friends.

530
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,160
Please give us younger generation

531
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:28,870
some opportunities.

532
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,780
Right.

533
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,510
Mr. Ke, please help us.

534
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,570
Peng.

535
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,660
You should know

536
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,040
the only reason why you

537
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,030
got to be part of this

538
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,110
is that

539
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,910
you let me use Yu Bofeng for free.

540
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,730
Mr. Ke, sorry

541
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,390
to interrupt.

542
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,600
Peng and I

543
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,510
were college classmates.

544
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,460
I trust him, and he trusts me.

545
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,350
In business,

546
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,830
what matters is credibility.

547
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,270
Since he treats me well,

548
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,110
I'll definitely

549
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,300
repay him twice as much in the future.

550
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,880
We may be inexperienced,

551
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,670
but we won't let you down.

552
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,790
Don't worry.

553
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,670
But if you really can't approve of it,

554
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,880
we won't make things difficult for Peng.

555
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,780
No, Mr. Ke.

556
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,640
What Zhong meant is that…

557
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,220
Mr. Ke.

558
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,200
Here's the thing.

559
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,870
This friend of mine

560
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,110
is an honest and simple man.

561
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,580
He's not very eloquent,

562
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,260
but

563
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,060
he's very reliable in work and life.

564
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:16,870
So,

565
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,830
you can count on him.

566
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,780
Yes.

567
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,560
Mr. Ke.

568
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,180
Please give us a chance.

569
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,290
Zhong, right?

570
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,430
I really like

571
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,990
your straightforward personality.

572
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,990
To be honest,

573
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,900
I only trust him

574
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,160
in this project.

575
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,710
Since he trusts you,

576
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,380
let's

577
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,290
work together and give it a try.

578
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,550
That's great, Mr. Ke.

579
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,350
Thank you.

580
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,680
Mr. Ke.

581
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,110
We look forward to working with you.

582
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,920
Draft

583
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,640
a cooperation agreement

584
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,470
and send it to me,

585
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,300
and we'll talk later.

586
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,500
Okay.

587
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,440
Thank you, Mr. Ke.

588
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,030
Thank you, Mr. Ke.

589
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,000
It's getting late.

590
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,200
I have to go.

591
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,110
You guys continue.

592
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,280
See you.

593
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,780
Mr. Ke.

594
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,210
I've got the club ready for you.

595
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,470
You can go right away.

596
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,230
All right.

597
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,490
Thank you.

598
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,990
What?

599
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,190
Do you feel uncomfortable about it?

600
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,230
What's the point

601
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,140
of talking business like this?

602
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,330
You look like you've eaten fly poop.

603
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,560
I'm already used to it.

604
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,830
Look how tactful

605
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,550
Dalu is.

606
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,640
You should learn

607
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,350
from him in this regard.

608
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,300
Zhong.

609
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,410
You are a businessman now,

610
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,910
not a moral model.

611
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,270
If you don't like it,

612
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,610
you can quit.

613
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,950
To make money,

614
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,050
sometimes you have to kneel,

615
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,830
and sometimes you have to play dumb.

616
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,030
As long as it's not against the law,

617
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,870
right?

618
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,980
It's getting late.

619
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,340
Go home now.

620
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,040
Have Keru comfort you,

621
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,860
and you'll be fine.

622
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,310
Alright, Peng.

623
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,650
No matter what,

624
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,870
thank you for today.

625
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,570
Well,

626
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,730
let me treat you to a meal.

627
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,430
Right.

628
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,290
The contract is almost settled.

629
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,950
Let's have dinner together.

630
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,320
I'll take you home after dinner.

631
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,310
No need.

632
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,790
I still have things to do.

633
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,060
You guys go back first.

634
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,050
Another day then.

635
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,940
We're off then.

636
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,030
Zhong.

637
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,040
Do you think we can trust Mr. Ke?

638
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,950
I don't know whether we can trust him or not,

639
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,630
but I don't like

640
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,710
the way he deals with things.

641
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,030
That's true.

642
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,440
We've been

643
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,190
in this industry

644
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,200
for so many years.

645
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,870
We've seen all kinds of bosses.

646
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,090
Most of them are modest and cautious.

647
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,460
There are not many people

648
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,190
like him.

649
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:03,820
By the way,

650
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,890
he even asked artists to have a drink with him.

651
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,910
I'm speechless.

652
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,770
Maybe people are just different.

653
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,630
Peng is right.

654
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,230
We are doing business now.

655
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,290
We need to be flexible.

656
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,620
As long as we don't get involved

657
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,300
in anything that's against the law.

658
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,200
Of course.

659
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,090
Peng only did it to help us.

660
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,610
We can't embarrass him.

661
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,060
You're back, Honey.

662
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,880
You're still up, Honey.

663
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,450
How was it?

664
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,510
Did it go well?

665
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,040
Kind of.

666
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,850
Why do you look unhappy then?

667
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,300
Maybe I haven't socialized for too long.

668
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,080
I feel a bit uncomfortable with it.

669
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,370
If you feel uncomfortable,

670
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,510
just quit.

671
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,670
Anyway, I think

672
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,750
our family is doing well now.

673
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,780
We have enough money to spend.

674
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,370
Don't worry, Honey.

675
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,540
Peng and I have been working together for so many years.

676
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,310
His company is big,

677
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,110
and it has a great reputation in the industry.

678
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,440
Today,

679
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,470
he introduced a boss to me,

680
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,580
saying there's a project of a big IP.

681
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,170
I only need to co-invest with him.

682
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,290
It's secured profit.

683
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,330
Besides,

684
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,200
making movies

685
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,470
has always been my dream, right?

686
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,600
And you're always supportive of me.

687
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,920
Of course I support you.

688
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,710
I'm just worried that you'll be too tired.

689
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,750
I'm not tired.

690
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,660
You are the most tired one in our family now.

691
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,090
You're pregnant.

692
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,790
I'll take care of our family from now on.

693
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,190
All you need to do is take good care of your health.

694
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,110
Let's sleep.

695
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,710
I'm hungry.

696
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,270
Oh?

697
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,600
Pregnant women get hungry easily, right?

698
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,200
What do you want to eat? I'll cook it for you.

699
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,680
Instant noodles.

700
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,810
You want eggs?

701
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,260
Yes, I want two.

702
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,230
Okay.

703
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,060
Wait here, Honey.

704
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,870
Call me when you're done.

705
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,990
I'll serve it to bed for you,

706
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,540
okay?

707
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,720
So sweet.

708
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,630
How is it?

709
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,910
It's good.

710
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,360
So, we'll go to my parents' house

711
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,590
this weekend.

712
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:47,750
Okay.

713
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,110
Are you nervous?

714
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,390
Why should I be nervous?

715
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,070
It's not like I haven't seen them before.

716
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,790
And I already told my mom that

717
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,780
I'd go to your parents' house for dinner.

718
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,230
What did your mom say?

719
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,490
Nothing.

720
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,260
She just complained that I told her about it too late

721
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,210
and I dated behind her back.

722
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,750
She's right, actually.

723
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,070
Do you not want to

724
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,030
introduce me to your mom?

725
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,840
I just haven't found

726
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,060
the right opportunity.

727
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,170
Eat up.

728
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,080
I applied to the bureau

729
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,510
to retrieve and re-investigate

730
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,960
some details

731
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,750
of Deng Man's case.

732
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,240
I always feel her case must

733
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,470
have something to do with these recent cases,

734
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,270
but I haven't found any pattern.

735
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,680
Really?

736
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,600
If I don't

737
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,550
figure these out,

738
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,170
I can't sleep tight at night.

739
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,510
That's great.

740
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,870
Thank you.

741
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,230
It's to serve the people.

742
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,990
Jiang.

743
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,260
What are you doing?

744
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,670
The kids are almost here.

745
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,940
The house isn't tidied up yet.

746
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,150
Why are you still dawdling inside...

747
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,340
Am I handsome?

748
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,100
What are you doing?

749
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,520
Dress up to see my daughter-in-law.

750
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,600
Why don't you just

751
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,720
put on your police uniform then?

752
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,190
You...

753
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,240
I did try to put it on,

754
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:32,910
but my belly is too big

755
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,680
and I can't fit in.

756
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,390
Otherwise, I would have put on

757
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,190
my summer uniform, okay?

758
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,820
That's much cooler than this.

759
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,970
Give you an inch, and you'll take a mile.

760
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,030
Are you meeting your daughter-in-law

761
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,290
or interrogating a criminal?

762
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,970
I do have to interrogate her.

763
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,810
Right?

764
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,800
What a crook.

765
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,270
Seriously.

766
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,320
Take it off.

767
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,040
-It's not appropriate.
-What should I wear then?

768
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,200
You need to make her feel at home.

769
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,110
Just wear what you usually wear

770
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:52,930
at home.

771
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,450
W-What do I normally wear at home?

772
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,310
Loungewear, of course.

773
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,550
I bought so many sets for you.

774
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,790
Take it off. Hurry up.

775
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,470
Why do I feel

776
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,730
quite nervous?

777
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:00,820
Take these off.

778
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,870
Alright. Alright.

779
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,670
Why should you be nervous?

780
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,470
Right?

781
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,530
You need to relax

782
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,270
and make her feel at home.

783
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,890
If you're nervous, she'll be tense too.

784
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,480
Right. Right.

785
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:09,790
Right?

786
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,430
Our family atmosphere is not like that.

787
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:13,620
Come on.

788
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,280
Dad.

789
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,140
They're back.

790
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,220
Take it off.

791
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,180
Don't embarrass me.

792
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,710
Coming.

793
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,240
Jiang, hurry up.

794
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,150
Okay. Okay.

795
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,740
Which outfit should I wear?

796
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:26,880
You're back.

797
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,970
Whatever. This is it.

798
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,300
Yan, you're here.

799
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,910
Auntie.

800
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,550
Come on.

801
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,920
Uncle.

802
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,260
You're dressed quite formally.

803
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,870
-Yeah.
-Well…

804
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,810
We have a guest.

805
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,600
Well...

806
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,130
Come on in.

807
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,750
Come on.

808
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,070
Come in and have a seat, Yan.

809
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,550
Come on.

810
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,910
Come on.

811
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:47,960
Here, Uncle.

812
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,380
This wine is for you.

813
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,110
You really have great taste.

814
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,230
I love this wine.

815
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:52,990
He's so happy.

816
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,750
Auntie.

817
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,930
I bought you a scarf.

818
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,770
You're too polite.

819
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,750
Here, have some fruits.

820
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,000
We specially went to buy it.

821
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,950
Really?

822
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,060
It's getting cold.

823
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,490
I can put it on soon.

824
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,390
Thank you, Yan.

825
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,230
It's nothing.

826
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,830
The kids are already here.

827
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,000
Go on and cook.

828
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,350
-Okay.
-I'll go help.

829
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:10,870
No need.

830
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,710
The Jiang's family rule is that

831
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,070
men are in charge of cooking,

832
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,330
and women only need to wait to eat.

833
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,510
Come help me.

834
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,150
But, Dad,

835
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,910
are you going to cook in this?

836
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,610
If I hadn't stopped him today,

837
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,540
your dad would have put on his police uniform.

838
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,030
He only gave up because his belly was too big

839
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,470
and he couldn't button it. And...

840
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,620
Who said I have a big belly?

841
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,830
Okay, let's go.

842
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,730
Okay, let's go.

843
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,290
Come help me.

844
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,480
Making it so grand.

845
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,090
Sit tight.

846
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,120
Even a great chef wouldn't dress like this.

847
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,130
Just stay seated.

848
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,200
Our family rule is

849
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,820
men are in charge of cooking.

850
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,220
Have your uncle cook

851
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,110
his specialty...

852
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,110
Stir-fried Beef.

853
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,750
Chengyi made it for you before?

854
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:47,780
It's very delicious.

855
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,340
That's more like it.

856
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,540
That's what a good guy should do.

857
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,060
Since we have nothing to do for now,

858
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,030
how about I take you

859
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,080
on a room tour?

860
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,990
Sure.

861
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,210
Let's go.

862
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,630
This used to be

863
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,140
Chengyi's room.

864
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,010
We've renovated it into a study.

865
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,030
These are all his awards certificates.

866
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,830
Look.

867
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,940
Bachelor's degree certificate.

868
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,960
Energetic young man.

869
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,430
This is his

870
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,650
third-class merit medal.

871
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,430
He risked his life for it.

872
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,340
His father and I

873
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,980
have worried about him a lot.

874
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:28,750
Here.

875
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,800
This one.

876
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,550
Look.

877
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,270
Back in college,

878
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,610
he was in the basketball team.

879
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,110
Look at these brats,

880
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,580
reeking with sweat all day.

881
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,760
They were really happy.

882
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,010
By the way,

883
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,150
Yan, come here.

884
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,780
This is Chengyi's childhood album.

885
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,740
This is when he was three years old.

886
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,240
He was very shy back then.

887
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,750
His dad was even worried that

888
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,620
he'd suffer autism.

889
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,190
Look.

890
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,790
This is when he was ten years old.

891
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,410
He already wanted to be a police officer at that time.

892
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,470
As soon as his dad came home,

893
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,900
he'd snatch his dad's cap, put it on,

894
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,750
and go to the courtyard

895
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,830
to show it off.

896
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,620
You know what?

897
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,380
All the children in the neighborhood

898
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,000
were disciplined by him so well that

899
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,410
they'd salute him when they saw him.

900
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,230
He was a king of kids.

901
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,580
In fact, Chengyi

902
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,150
may seem carefree,

903
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,880
but deep within,

904
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,880
he's very

905
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,850
sensitive and fragile.

906
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,560
I guess he didn't tell you this,

907
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,510
but actually,

908
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,890
when he was in college,

909
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,830
he dated once.

910
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,880
And they broke up

911
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,190
for some unknown reason.

912
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,240
His father and I didn't dare to ask.

913
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,160
He'd get angry with us whenever we asked.

914
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,430
All these years, he's locked himself

915
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,480
in the police force.

916
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,590
He seldom came back.

917
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,030
Every time he was back, he'd have injuries all over his body.

918
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,870
Yan.

919
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,460
I just feel that

920
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,280
you are like

921
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,710
a ray of light in Chengyi's life.

922
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,120
And why do I say that?

923
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,960
Because since Chengyi

924
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,990
started dating you,

925
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,560
he became like his old self.

926
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,960
He was that happy

927
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,660
and cheerful boy again.

928
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,000
His dad and I are both so happy.

929
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,670
I think

930
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,250
you are

931
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,020
the mature

932
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,830
and elegant kind of girl.

933
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,420
That's why I'm not afraid of letting you know those things.

934
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,230
I know you wouldn't mind.

935
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,720
Because

936
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,560
everyone's experience

937
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
is our precious treasure,

938
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,870
am I right?

939
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,060
Yes.

940
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,760
But Auntie,

941
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,980
actually,

942
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,030
his girlfriend back in college

943
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:56,920
was also me.

944
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,780
But don't worry.

945
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,950
Since we're

946
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,430
back together,

947
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,100
we'll

948
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,800
make it work.

949
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,030
I won't break his heart.

950
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:10,960
Don't worry, Auntie.

951
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:15,960
It's black.

952
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,750
Come on.

953
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,210
My specialty,

954
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,350
Stir-fried Beef.

955
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,010
Come on.

956
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,900
This is my favorite.

957

All the dishes have been served,

958
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,030
right?

959
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,270

So delicious.

your cooking is better than his.

988
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:57,830
Of course.

He's my master.

990
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,910
You know?

Of course I knew.

So as soon as I was discharged,

1001

I did some investigation.

Yes.

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,070
perfectly avoid

1146
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,540
all the right choices?

1147
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,530
What is the probability of that?

1148
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:11,960
All wrong?

1149
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:13,770
But

1150
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,350
I did it very carefully.

1151
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,710
But

1152
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,620
I counted on my feeling for most questions.

1153
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:21,810
Feelings?

1154
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,590
I worked so hard

1155
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,850
and highlighted so many key points for you,

1156
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,350
yet you told me you solved them basically based on feelings?

1157
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,260
Have you read it or not?

1158
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,230
I have.

1159
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,730
Isn't it written clearly that

1160
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,100
from the original family to bad habits,

1161
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,850
then to strong emotional changes,

1162
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,340
and eventually it developed a motive for murder?

1163
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,270
Do you not understand

1164
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:36,920
the logic

1165
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,550
and the way of thinking?

1166
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,960
Have you read it carefully?

1167
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,390
I...

1168
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,340
What's your college entrance exam score?

1169
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,790
I didn't take the college entrance exam. I went to technical secondary school.

1170
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,800
Then it's understandable that

1171
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,070
this is a bit difficult for you.

1172
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,630
But you got this question right.

1173
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,270
Not bad.

1174
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,610
It's even a word problem.

1175
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,750
I didn't solve it myself.

1176
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,020
When I was solving this question that day,

1177
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,200
Mr. Wen was here too.

1178
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,310
He told me the answer.

1179
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,630
Wen Peng?

1180
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,470
Yes.

1181
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:13,880
Professor Yu.

1182
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,350
I really read carefully all the key points

1183
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,090
you highlighted for me.
