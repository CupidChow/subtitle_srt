196
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,020
I know it's not easy for you either.

197
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,340
It's not your fault.

198
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,350
But this project is very important to me.

199
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,870
I cannot let it fail.

200
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,030
I know.

201
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,790
It's definitely my fault when

202
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,830
there's an issue with my artiste.

203
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,659
But I truly didn't expect

204
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:00,830
the death of Bofeng's foster mother

205
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,810
is related to Jiang Chengyi.

206
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
That's completely made up.

207
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,170
I saw it on Weibo.

208
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,320
Something about Jiang Chengyi

209
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,980
shouting at Wang Dan,

210
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,560
and then Yu Zheng pinning him on the ground.

211
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,840
Do you think that's actually possible?

212
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,430
Jiang is a good friend of mine.

213
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,380
I know him well.

214
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,360
He would never

215
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,710
do such a thing.

216
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,710
I suspect somone

217
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,390
is spreading rumors

218
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,020
on purpose.

219
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:22,750
Could it be

220
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,870
the work of Wang Dan's family?

221
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,860
Who would know such details besides

222
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,940
the family members themselves?

223
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,390
Regardless,

224
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,860
this person is up to no good.

225
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,470
This matter

226
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,110
affects not only our project,

227
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,590
but also Jiang.

228
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,520
So, I'll not back out from the project,

229
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,110
and Jiang will have my full support.

230
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,429
Okay.

231
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,740
Don't worry.

232
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,350
I will solve this problem as soon as possible.

233
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,350
Okay.

234
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,790
I'll wait for your news.

235
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,180
[Huiting Complex]

236
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,260
I'm back.

237
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,380
What are you making?

238
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,510
You're back.

239
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,500
Does it smell good?

240
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,510
Try it.

241
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,150
Here.

242
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,550
How is it?

243
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,810
You didn't add any salt?

244
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,070
Well, Xiao Jie's pregnant, isn't she?

245
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,540
She can't drink anything too salty.

246
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,020
So you weren't making it for me?

247
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,370
Why are you comparing yourself to a pregnant woman?

248
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,050
I'll eat the leftovers of a pregnant woman then.

249
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,860
You...

250
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,110
How have you been today?

251
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,770
Pretty good.

252
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,810
All's normal.

253
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,780
Tell me more.

254
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,870
Share some stories.

255
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,900
You've seen it?

256
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,600
Why didn't you

257
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,480
mention it before?

258
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,570
It happened many years ago.

259
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,240
I was on an assignment.

260
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,200
On the way,

261
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,170
we ran into someone shouting about catching a thief.

262
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,650
So I gave chase.

263
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,170
But I didn't expect that this person

264
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,370
would have a heart attack

265
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,780
and die suddenly.

266
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,140
All this years, I thought

267
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,790
this matter was behind me.

268
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,210
I didn't expect it would return to haunt me.

269
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,640
I mean, isn't it such a coincidence for her to be

270
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,890
Yu Bofeng's foster mother?

271
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,330
You did everything you could.

272
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,750
It's not your fault.

273
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,720
Have you eaten?

274
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,850
Not yet.

275
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,670
I was waiting for you.

276
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,600
Let's eat.

277
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,700
I'll add some salt for you.

278
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,010
Let's eat.

279
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:45,990
Look.

280
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,190
Isn't it beautiful?

281
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,320
I bought this with Lu Yan

282
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,350
when we were shopping today.

283
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:49,790
Look.

284
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,990
One for each of us.

285
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,530
Yes, it's nice.

286
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,990
Everything you buy looks good.

287
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,270
Honey,

288
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,440
I've noticed a change in you lately.

289
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,630
No, I don't so?

290
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,500
You used to tell me everything.

291
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,630
But recently,

292
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,300
you seem to have a lot on your mind and

293
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,000
have been speaking less.

294
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,080
I've been busy lately.

295
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,860
I'll be fine after this busy period.

296
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,930
Haven't I told you?

297
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,490
You're pregnant now.

298
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,580
We need to buy a bigger house

299
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,110
and a bigger car,

300
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,780
and also hire a nanny.

301
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,070
I don't want you to take care of our child alone.

302
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,750
It's too tough.

303
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,070
Honey.

304
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,950
Honey!

305
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,710
I know you want to give your all

306
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,720
for our family.

307
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,920
But I'm already very satisfied.

308
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,250
I don't want you to feel burdened.

309
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,070
I'm your wife,

310
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,260
the person closest to you.

311
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,230
If you face any difficulties,

312
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,030
you have to tell me.

313
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,580
You mustn't bear it all alone.

314
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,630
Understand?

315
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,690
I know that Yu Bofeng's trending topic

316
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,510
has greatly affected

317
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,860
your project.

318
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,580
But it will all be resolved.

319
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,090
Don't be upset about this.

320
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,780
Got it, honey.

321
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,600
Cheer up.

322
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,430
Smile.

323
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,570
Smile!

324
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,750
Peng.

325
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,310
Have you eaten?

326
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,830
I have no appetite.

327
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,030
How are things now?

328
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,660
I only have bad news for you.

329
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,600
Which one do you want to hear first?

330
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm mentally prepared.

331
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,950
Go ahead.

332
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,460
There are currently 7 endorsements

333
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,680
looking to terminate their contract with you.

334
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:58,960
We'll have to pay

335
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,310
more than 10 million yuan.

336
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,700
I'll pay.

337
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,640
I'll sell

338
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,740
my house in Yanbei.

339
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,120
It should be enough.

340
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,840
Among your three upcoming projects,

341
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,270
besides the one where I am the main investor,

342
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,750
the other two are also looking to terminate their contracts.

343
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,060
We'll have to pay

344
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,980
about 6 million yuan.

345
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,350
I'll pay with all my savings.

346
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,260
If that's not enough, I'll sell my car.

347
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,710
That should be enough.

348
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:25,910
Anything else?

349
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,570
Up until now,

350
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,830
your Weibo, Douyin,

351
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,310
and other social media platforms

352
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,440
have lost about 40% of followers collectively.

353
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,610
They all say you have a fake persona.

354
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,790
You're a thief's son.

355
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,710
You lied to the public.

356
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,890
It's okay.

357
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,270
It's not your fault.

358
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,200
You simply kept your background a secret.

359
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,180
Do you understand?

360
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,890
Alright, no matter what,

361
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,080
you still need to eat something.

362
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,030
I'll make you some porridge.

363
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:07,990
Who is it?

364
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,310
Yu Zheng.

365
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,630
She's looking for you?

366
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,270
Peng.

367
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,070
I'd like to ask you to

368
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,190
help me have a chat Yu Zheng.

369
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,990
I want to know what is

370
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,030
her stance on this matter.

371
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,690
This is very important to me.

372
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,540
Okay.

373
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,920
This way,

374
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,230
we can also avoid unnecessary trouble.

375
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,000
[I'll meet you in my office at 8 a.m. tomorrow]

376
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,000
[Yu Bofeng, at least give me a chance to explain]

377
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,000
[Can we meet and talk?]

378
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,650
[Office]

379
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:51,750
So he's still

380
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,670
unwilling to see me.

381
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,950
This matter had

382
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,790
hurt him greatly.

383
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:57,870
He...

384
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,150
still couldn't come.

385
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,010
Professor Yu,

386
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,220
Do you regret it?

387
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
She's a thief.

388
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,190
We are the police.

389
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,680
It's only right we arrest her.

390
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,850
What's there to regret?

391
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,960
But it's only

392
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,140
for Bofeng's tuition fees

393
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,310
that she stole the money.

394
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,010
It's just a few hundred yuan.

395
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,280
She didn't deserve to die.

396
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,090
Yes.

397
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,690
That's why I feel guilty.

398
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,710
Otherwise,

399
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,670
I wouldn't have left the frontlines.

400
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,430
I would often think

401
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,720
what if I had

402
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,950
found out about

403
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,770
his mother's health condition earlier,

404
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,640
or had called for an ambulance earlier.

405
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,100
Would things not have become

406
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,190
what it is today?

407
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,140
But it's too late to say anything now.

408
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:50,990
Isn't it?

409
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,430
As you can see,

410
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,360
the public's opinion

411
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,210
is really getting to Bofeng.

412
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,170
Can you step forward

413
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,790
and make things clear?

414
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,110
Make things clear?

415
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,470
What do you want me to say?

416
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,470
To make clear that Yu Bofeng's mother

417
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,910
is not a thief.

418

from a legal perspective,

421
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,760
Wang Dan had indeed

422
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,750
committed a theft.

423
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,990

there's no way I can

426
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,910
make such a clarification.

427
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,370
This case has been settled.

There's no wiggle room.

with just a few words from me,

431
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,790
you could turn the case around?

494
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,720
A statement

495
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,570
has been made regarding this.

496
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,010
I won't read your statement.

I'm asking you

498
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,250
if you've witnessed it with your own eyes.

499
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,890
No.

500
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,260
But we had a witness

501
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,230
and material evidence.

502
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,950
And in the end, we had also proven that

503
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,310
she did steal something.

504
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,710
Show me the evidence.

I can make a request to the force

wrong Aunt Wang of stealing money?

519
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:41,830
Fine.

520
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,950
Even if Aunt Wang had stolen,

521
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,420
it was only 500 yuan.

528
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,750
is not about the stolen value.

As a police officer,

533

00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,070
Goodbye, Sister.

765
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:21,990
Senior.

766
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,760
Do you feel like

767
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,460
the two of you are in

768
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,360
better shape lately?

769
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,080
What's changed?

770
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,300
Her spirit and demeanor,

771
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,550
her skin,

772
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:31,830
and her mood.

773
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,760
People who are nourished by love

774
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,630
are indeed different.

775
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,070
Stop teasing me.

776
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,420
You... go out and have fun.

777
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,680
I want love too.

778
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,580
Go find it.

779
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,990
Ask your girlfriend to introduce someone to me.

780
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,870
This way, we can be hospitalized

781
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,950
together in the future.

782
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,830
Stop talking nonsense.

783
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,620
Go out and find it.

784
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,670
I want love too.

785
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,390
Introduce someone to me,

786
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,100
and we can be hospitalized together.

787
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,520
Stop messing with me.

788
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,470
Rest well.

789
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,510
Go get some physiotherapy tomorrow.

790
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,860
No, I can't.

791
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,470
I’m the most experienced when it comes to this.

792
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,240
If I don't touch it,

793
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,570
the pain is localized.

794
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,180
If I go for therapy,

795
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,350
my entire back will hurt instead.

796
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,670
You won't listen to me.

797
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,940
♫As the city flickers♫

798
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,550
What's wrong with him?

799
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,550
He went hard on you.

800
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,240
♫It's as gentle as wind wrapping around rain♫

801
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,570
It's not that he's heavy-handed.

802
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,880
My muscles on this side

803
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,790
were already overworked.

804
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,630
♫And you, who love to smile♫

805
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,850
With just a bit of force,

806
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,020
♫Always offer your happiness to me first♫

807
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,260
it will easily get inflamed.

808
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,430
♫The humor of time♫

809
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,340
Yu Bofeng

810
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,910
was too impulsive.

811
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,380
♫No one to blame for breaking the promise♫

812
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,260
I made it very clear to him.

813
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,390
He just can't get over it himself.

814
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:40,490
♫It's because we met too soon that we missed each other♫

815
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,550
Then,

816
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,990
what'll happen to him?

817
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,540
I will write him a letter of forgiveness.

818
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,240
♫We're stranded at sunset♫

819
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,080
Maybe he'll

820
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,440
get a lighter punishment.

821
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,280
♫My sunburnt face doesn't mean a word♫

822
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,090
Take a good rest at home the next two days.

823
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,390
Make sure to take care of your back.

824
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,000
♫The stubborn me♫

825
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,350
Do you hear me?

826
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,550
I know.

827
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,900
♫I always think of the far future♫

828
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,710
I can't move now anyway.

829
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,730
♫I walk willfully♫

830
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,790
No, don't move.

831
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,930
♫Like a star revolving around♫

832
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,250
H-Help me lie down.

833
00:30:59,300 --> 00:30:59,830
What are you up to?

834
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,740
It's not

835
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,630
comfortable here.

836
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,880
♫I turn around♫

837
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,060
Come, give me a hand.

838
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,030
You...

839
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,650
♫But you're not behind me♫

840
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,070
How am I...

841
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:08,630
Slow down.

842
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,310
Come on.

843
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,710
♫Losing you♫

844
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,560
♫It's so unreal♫

845
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:25,660
Mr. Wen

846
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,630
How is it?

847
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,590
He's still in the police station.

848
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,180
It's considered an assault on the police.

849
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,280
Fortunately,

850
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,880
it didn't cause serious consequences.

851
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,290
What's crucial now

852
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,540
is Jiang Chengyi.

853
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,560
If he can forgive him

854
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,950
and downplay the incident,

855
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,590
the best possible outcome

856
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,970
would likely be detention

857
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,910
as a form of punishment.

858
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,360
Mr. Wen.

859
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:51,920
How about

860
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,910
you talk to

861
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,010
Jiang Chengyi?

862
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:55,990
What did you say?

863
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,270
No.

864
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,780
I mean...

865
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,590
you guys are college alumni.

866
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,750
If you step in to help,

867
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,070
wouldn't this matter...

868
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,310
Don't make such a low-level mistake again

869
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,320
in the future.

870
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,070
Got it.

871
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,360
I'll use my other contacts.

872
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,830
Okay.

873
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,010
Professor Yu!

874
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,030
Professor Yu!

875
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,090
I made it.

876
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,790
Thank you.

877
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,000
Thank you, Ms. Yu.

878
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,850
I'm leaving.

879
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,360
What now?

880
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,480
While I'm hospitalized...

881
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,060
can you come over and help me catch up on my studies?

882
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,810
Actually, I...

883
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,030
Say no more.

884
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,540
I know.

885
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,020
What do you know again?

886
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,410
You like me.

887
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,520
When I was little,

888
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,380
my mother would also always

889
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,040
give me her egg.

890
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:38,920
Some more.

891
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,400
Are you sure?

892
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,280
Yes.

893
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,010
Yu Zheng.

894
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,239
Are you asleep?

895
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:11,889
What's wrong?

896
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,620
How's your back?

897
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:14,909
I'm fine.

898
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:15,960
I'll recover in a few days.

899
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,150
You...

900
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,710
Something's up? It's late.

901
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,590
I know it's inappropriate

902
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,620
for me to say this,

903
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,560
but I would like to ask you to

904
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,710
write a letter of...

905
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,840
I understand what you are trying to say.

906
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,530
Actually,

907
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,389
I've mentioned it to the

908
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,610
officer-in-charge back then.

909
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,650
But it's such a big deal now.

910
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,550
I really don't know

911
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,870
how would it all work out.

912
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,190
Yes, I know.

913
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,870
It's quite serious this time.

914
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:43,960
But it's not easy for him

915
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,000
to come this far either.

916
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,210
Just consider it as a favor for me.

917
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,230
Will you?

918
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,630
Don't worry.

919
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,710
Actually,

920
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,710
the incident back then

921
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,909
had always been a burden in my heart.

922
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,750
I will never

923
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,470
give him a hard time.

924
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,630
Don't worry.

925
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:00,950
Thank you.

926
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,510
Okay.

927
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,870
Don't worry.

928
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,010
Tell me if you need anything.

929
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:13,770
Who is it?

930
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,480
Professor Yu.

931
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,150
What's wrong again?

932
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,150
She's worried about Yu Bofeng.

933
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:20,720
It's fine.

934
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,310
Take off your cardigan and sleep.

935
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,280
Need my help?

936
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,270
It's not that serious.

937
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:31,910
I'm fine.

938
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,960
I can lie down.

939
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,090
Don't overstretch yourself.

940
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:37,900
Here.

941
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,530
Done.

942
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,310
Okay.

943
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:43,910
Okay.

944
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,470
Alright.

945
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,710
Let's sleep.

946
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,760
Yes.

947
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,710
You're awake.

948
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,360
Let me change it for you.

949
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,470
It hurts here?

950
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,440
Are you okay?

951
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,350
Do you need my help?

952
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,940
How will you help with brushing my teeth?

953
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:14,950
I'll hold it for you.

954
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,990
Why did you swallow it?

955
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,840
Let me carry you back.

956
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:22,950
It's best if you don't touch me.

957
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:23,780
Let me hug you.

958
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,110
Why are you looking at me?

959
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,390
I'll see if you can put it on.

960
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,570
Help me.

961
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,340
So you need help now?

962
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,410
Say, "Help me?"

963
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,170
Help me.

964
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:35,830
Come on.

965
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,110
Don't move so much.

966
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,750
I'll pull it for you.

967
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,750
Okay.

968
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,060
Sleeping again?

969
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,200
I just closed my eyes for a while.

970
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:53,590
Here.

971
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,140
I bought breakfast for you.

972
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:55,800
Okay.

973
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,470
Take a look.

974
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,520
Get up and eat.

975
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,610
It's really hard for me to get up from this position.

976
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,270
Give me a hand.

977
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,330
Give you a hand?

978
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,440
Okay.

979
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,430
Here.

980
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,780
How can I help you without causing any pain?

981
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,150
Can't I just hold onto your hand?

982
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,090
Pull me up from my back.

983
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,800
I'll hold you up then.

984
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,870
This is unbearable, honestly.

985
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,630
Get better soon then.

986
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,130
Try this.

987
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,670
I'll get it for you.

988
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,830
Just tell me.

989
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,930
Your mouth's broken too?

990
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,270
I feel embarrassed to trouble you.

991
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,480
You're indeed in a lot of trouble.

992
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,380
Don't take this lightly.

993
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,110
Listen.

994
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,150
With your brute force,

995
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,530
even a little effort

996
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,620
would result in injuring

997
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,790
the same muscle again.

998
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,810
It'll get better in three or four days.

999
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,790
I still have to work.

1000
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,380
Three or four days?

1001
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,040
No matter what,

1002
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,310
you should at least have a week off.

1003
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,220
How am I going to work

1004
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,310
if I take a week off for this?

1005
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,530
Then don't get hurt.

1006
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,320
Take a sip.

1007
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,760
That's sweet.

1008
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,580
I've put the medicine there.

1009
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,390
It's painkillers.

1010
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,630
When it hurts a lot,

1011
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,510
take one more.

1012
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,230
It's fine.

1013
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,220
I'll try not to eat it.

1014
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:12,850
What for?

1015
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
It's no big deal, right?

1016
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,230
Again?

1017
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:16,790
You say you're fine,

1018
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,630
only to get hurt afterwards.

1019
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,180
I'm fine.

1020
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,920
I'm going to work.

1021
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:21,950
You're on duty?

1022
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,830
Wouldn't you want to take care of me

1023
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,800
when it hurts the worst these two days?

1024
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,230
So I shouldn't take care of my patients in the hospital,

1025
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:27,800
is that right?

1026
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,410
Help me to lie back.

1027
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,030
You don't want to eat anymore?

1028
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,370
I'll eat later.

1029
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,700
I can't eat when it hurts this way.

1030
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,750
Let me help you.

1031
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,570
-Come.
-Come on.

1032
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,100
Don't worry. Go to work.

1033
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,520
I'm leaving.

1034
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,440
I'm fine.

1035
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,230
Director Xing.

1036
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,560
Director Xing.

1037
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,750
Do you think you could

1038
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,680
have another word

1039
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,830
with the station's chief again?

1040
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,590
Well...

1041
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,310
I've already sent them the letter of forgiveness.

1042
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,950
I've told them everything.

1043
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,430
Yes.

1044
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,190
As for

1045
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,270
how'll this case be settled,

1046
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,920
that's beyond my scope to decide.

1047
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,680
I know.

1048
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,190
But...

1049
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,350
Please help me out here.

1050
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,960
Please talk to them again.

1051
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,750
I've tried my best

1052
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,240
to communicate with them.

1053
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,280
If I say anymore,

1054
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,870
I'll be breaking the rules.

1055
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,120
I know

1056
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,520
you feel guilty

1057
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,630
for what happened

1058
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,830
to his foster mother.

1059
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,160
But Yu,

1060
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,950
haven't you had many cases where

1061
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,550
it's a matter of law over mercy?

1062
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:38,940
We can't

1063
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:39,790
lose our judgment

1064
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,390
because of our personal emotions.

1065
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,990
This matter is final.

1066
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,260
You and Jiang

1067
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,240
have done

1068
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,230
your best.

1069
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,630
Wait for my news.

1070
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,070
I'll let you know if there's any news.

1071
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,550
Okay, thank you, Director Xing.

1072
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:56,580
[Case evaluation room]

1073
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:01,850
Professor Yu.

1074
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,920
Relevant information regarding Runying Pictures

1075
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:04,530
are all here.

1076
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,210
All the projects, from investment

1077
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,280
to co-production and production,

1078
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,430
are in place.

1079
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,280
Okay.

1080
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,470
Thank you.

1081
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:20,670
[Case evaluation room]

1082
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,150
You're welcome.

1083
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:26,990
First, it was his fake identity.

1084
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,640
That I will say no more.

1085
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,810
Now, Yu Bofeng

1086
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,050
went on the street

1087
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,130
to beat up the police.

1088
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,390
Listen.

1089
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,590
We must change Yu Bofeng

1090
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,310
no matter what.

1091
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,270
Peng.

1092
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,030
What did Mr. Ke say?

1093
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,410
What else?

1094
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,910
Regret, anger and fustration.

1095
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,460
But Mr. Ke said

1096
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,990
we cannot delay the start of production.

1097
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,330
He wants us to resolve it as soon as possible.

1098
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,880
Otherwise,

1099
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,270
he'll give the intellectual property rights to someone else.

1100
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,690
No way.

1101
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,140
What about the money?

1102
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,430
Before you came,

1103
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,270
I've contacted

1104
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,230
a few top actors.

1105
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,350
But the conditions they've proposed

1106
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,390
are very tough to meet.

1107
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,920
To put it bluntly,

1108
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,430
they know we have a problem.

1109
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,940
They’re making unreasonable demands now.

1110
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,070
But the problem is

1111
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,150
I don't have much money to offer.

1112
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,230
But most importantly,

1113
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,830
pre-production has been all paid for by us.

1114
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,920
I know.

1115
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,360
I'm also in a

1116
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,550
tight spot right now.

1117
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,060
As you can see,

1118
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,750
the people demanding compensation from me

1119
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:27,910
have started to form a queue.

1120
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,030
Actually, to say these things to you both,

1121
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:37,670
I...

1122
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,510
I also feel very guilty.

1123
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,150
But I...

1124
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,930
I really have no choice.

1125
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:48,510
How about this?

1126
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,140
Zhong.

1127
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,400
I'll give you two choices.

1128
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,610
You either pull out,

1129
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,210
and then we sign an agreement

1130
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,890
where we'll put the money you've invested

1131
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,950
into the next film

1132
00:42:59,030 --> 00:42:59,750
of my company.

1133
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,230
Or,

1134
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,260
we think of other ways

1135
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,670
and raise some more money

1136
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,400
to get a top actor

1137
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,550
and ask him to save this production.

1138
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:10,940
What do you think?

1139
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,680
Let me think about it.

1140
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:18,930
Okay.

1141
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,330
You must decide fast.

1142
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:30,710
Zhong.

1143
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,100
What are you still thinking about?

1144
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,400
Let's just quit if it doesn't work out.

1145
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,310
I heard that they

1146
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,000
still have several projects

1147
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,770
with the platform.

1148
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,130
We can always do something else.

1149
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:38,770
Dalu.

1150
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,570
That's not what I'm thinking about.

1151
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,670
How many years have we been in this industry?

1152
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,380
It's been at least ten years.

1153
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:45,310
Yes.

1154
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,480
In this industry, projects have always

1155
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,090
followed the actors' availability.

1156
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,050
Now that the actor is in trouble,

1157
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,350
mormally, the investors

1158
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,000
will think long and hard

1159
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,020
with the producers.

1160
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,020
Yes.

1161
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,670
Wen Peng has been in the industry for so many years.

1162
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,910
There's no way he doesn't get this.

1163
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:58,790
So why is he

1164
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:59,880
so anxious to start production?

1165
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,110
I have a nagging feeling that

1166
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,440
something's wrong with Mr. Ke.

1167
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,830
Dalu, look into him.

1168
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,990
He never seemed like an investor to me.

1169
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:08,790
Okay.

1170
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:09,840
I'll look into it right away.

1171
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:19,710
Hello?

1172
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:21,430
Qin Yue.

1173
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:22,370
Senior.

1174
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,680
the Cyber Investigation Unit called.

1175
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,830
They said that the individual

1176
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:29,420
[Anshan Criminal Investigation]

1177
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,530
used virtual currency from a game

1178
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,460
as a bait to

1179
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,490
lure others into

1180
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:31,750
spreading rumors online.

1181
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,280
But this game

1182
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,830
is still under beta testing.

1183
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,470
There is no registered name yet.

1184
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,900
So it will take some time.

1185
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:38,960
Okay.

1186
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,690
Something's wrong with that driver, right?

1187
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,110
Captain Jiang,

1188
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,880
we’ve found the boss.

1189

[Anshan Criminal Investigation]

1190
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,700
And now,

1191
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:47,570
I've brought him back.

1192
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,010
I'll report to you

1193
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,970
if I uncover any meaningful leads.

1194
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,280
Thank you.

1195
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:52,380
It's okay.

1196
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:53,430
Take care of yourself at home.

1197
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,420
Don't worry about us.

1198
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:55,790
If you don't trust these kids,

1199
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,790
do you still not trust me?

1200
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:58,310
Okay.

1201
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,170
Yu Bofeng.

1202
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,040
How was he dealt with?

1203
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,790
This morning,

1204

police from Limin Local Police Station

1205
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:08,510
called me.

1206
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:09,760
He said he was detained for five days.

1207
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:10,480
Senior,

1208
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:11,350
your letter of forgiveness worked,

1209
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,160
I think.

1210
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,160
Okay, go get busy.

1211
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:14,820
Alright.

1212
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,660
[and may be detained for assaulting a police officer]

1213
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,660
[Yu Bofeng clashed with police officer Jiang Chengyi over his foster mother's case]

1214
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,310
Yu Bofeng.

1215
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,570
You were arrested for assaulting police officer Jiang Chengyi.

1216
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:13,710
Although in the process

1217
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,910
there was no grave consequences,

1219
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,260
had also forgiven your behavior,

1220
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,860
this is still considered an assault on the police.

1221
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:21,950
It has brought about

1222
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,270
a serious and adverse influence on society.

1223
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,730
