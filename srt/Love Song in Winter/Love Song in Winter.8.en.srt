[Episode 8]

3
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,380
Qianqian.

4
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,180
Say something.

5
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,650
My third toast

6
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,660
is to thank Wen Peng.

7
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,470
Not only did you save

8
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,380
Lu Yan and me,

9
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,280
you even found me

10
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,290
such a nice apartment.

11
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,380
Here, a toast to you.

12
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,220
It's nothing.

13
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,110
Congrats on your new home...

14
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,530
He saved you?

15
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,470
When?

16
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,070
It was at a dinner together

17
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,720
and she was then dating someone

18
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,790
very paranoid,

19
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,130
who came in with a knife.

20
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,070
A knife?

21
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,420
Yeah, thank goodness Wen was around.

22
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,000
Were you hurt?

23
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,640
The two of us weren't hurt.

24
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,940
Wen.

25
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,150
How's your hand?

26
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,030
Much better.

27
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,410
That's good.

28
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,510
I really have to thank you then.

29
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,540
You stepped forward to help

30
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,590
in a dangerous situation.

31
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,940
Here.

32
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,030
That's rare in today's

33
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,710
society.

34
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,570
I've been taking care of her

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,770
for the past eight years.

36
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,490
When she needed help,

37
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,710
I was always with her.

38
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,170
So, you're welcome.

39
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,079
Okay, okay.

40
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,140
Guys,

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,200
let's eat!

42
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,250
You must be starving.

43
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,250
Come on, eat up.

44
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,970
Eat up.

45
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:51,570
Eat up.

46
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,310
Lu Yan.

47
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,120
I'll help you get it.

48
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,829
You can't reach here.

49
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,680
I want meat.

50
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,350
Thank you.

51
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,590
Want more juice?

52
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,120
Juice...

53
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,050
I'm good...

54
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,710
Here, have some crab.

55
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,230
Thank you.

56
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,070
Let me help you.

57
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,940
Drink some water.

58
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,170
I'll peel it for you, okay?

59
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:07,790
Okay.

60
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,730
You can open it

61
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,090
from a spot...

62
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,020
You got a bad crab. I'll get another.

63
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,750
Zhong.

64
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,450
Cheers.

65
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,030
Cheers!

66
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,670
Drinking more?

67
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,579
Honey, leave me alone today.

68
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,829
Let me tell you.

69
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,690
I miss the days when we were in school.

70
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,650
Too spicy?

71
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,400
Right?

72
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,329
Back then, you and I...

73
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,750
My cab's here. I'll get going.

74
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,150
Okay.

75
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,200
-Bye.
-Bye.

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,829
Take care.

77
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,829
Be safe!

78
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,030
Bye!

79
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,540
Take care.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,910
Text me when you get home.

81
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,470
Okay!

82
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,980
Bye!

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,640
Bye!

84
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,450
Look at you.

85
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,360
Why didn't you wear a scarf?

86
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,079
I'm not cold!

87
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,940
You're dressed too lightly.

88
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,000
Hurry up. Wear it.

89
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,590
Aren't you cold?

90
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,220
No, I'm not.

91
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,170
Okay, okay.

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,920
I'll wear it.

93
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,960
Oh, right!

94
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,620
We didn't take

95
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,780
any photos today!

96
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,700
We can do that anytime.

97
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,030
Must we do it today?

98
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,960
Are you kidding?

99
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,310
Today's such a memorable day.

100
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,300
Fine, let's do it.

101
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:13,870
Jie.

102
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,440
Come here!

103
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,390
Let's take photos together.

104
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,140
Okay, hold him.

105
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,700
I'll hold him.

106
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,390
Come on!

107
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,089
I'll hold it.

108
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,650
One, two.

109
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,050
Good, good.

110
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,900
Good?

111
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,530
Yeah.

112
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,680
I took quite a few.

113
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,150
Take a look.

114
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,210
I'll send it to you later.

115
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,830
Send it to our group chat.

116
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,710
Not bad.

117
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,460
Look.

118
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,400
Is your cab almost here?

119
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,270
Don't fret it.

120
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,220
Go home.

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,060
My home's nearby.

122
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,909
I'll get going.

123
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,270
Okay.

124
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,350
Let's hang out at my place sometime!

125
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,250
Bye! Bye!

126
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,370
Bye!

127
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,440
Lu Yan.

128
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,690
Why don't I send you home?

129
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,200
Um, I'm going to the hospital.

130
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,640
I'll send you back.

131
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,220
You're going to the hospital at this time?

132
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,820
To see my dad.

133
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,150
Let me give you a ride.

134
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,070
Wen.

135
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,530
He's drunk. Give us a ride.

136
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,030
My goodness!

137
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:06,550
Let's go!

138
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,230
Let's go!

139
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,310
Let's go! Go!

140
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,510
We're leaving!

141
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,650
Watch out!

142
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,840
Watch your head!

143
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,120
Bye!

144
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,260
Let's go.

145
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,160
Is Zhong okay?

146
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,340
Have some water.

147
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,670
Thank you, Wen.

148
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,960
What's on your mind?

149
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,190
Nothing.

150
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,270
It's just...

151
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,200
it'd be great if Deng Man were still here.

152
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,300
I remember

153
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,710
the three of you were the closest

154
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,920
in university.

155
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,230
You were inseparable.

156
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,890
Unfortunately...

157
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,780
After Deng Man committed suicide,

158
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,040
Yan was in great shock.

159
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,510
She was so

160
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,590
emotionally unstable.

161
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,610
She almost dropped out of school.

162
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,420
She broke up

163
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,740
with Jiang Chengyi then too.

164
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,850
Speaking of which, I have to

165
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,710
thank you.

166
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,920
For what?

167
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,040
Have you forgotten?

168
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,800
When I was very busy at the end of the semester,

169
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,210
Lu Yan was sick,

170
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,880
and you

171
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,070
helped me look after her for a bit.

172
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,680
It's no problem.

173
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,080
It's what I should've done.

174
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,760
Deng Man's passing

175
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,990
really changed all of us.

176
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,960
I went abroad right after

177
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,640
and was scared to come back for a long time.

178
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,670
Yan must've been even more

179
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,390
traumatized.

180
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,230
Wang Qianqian

181
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,710
and you

182
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,140
seem really close.

183
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,950
She started working here

184
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,860
alone,

185
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:51,870
without family

186
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,810
or friends.

187
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,520
I guess I'm her...

188
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,390
first friend in the hospital.

189
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,270
That's nice.

190
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,040
It's rare to

191
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,750
make close friends

192
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,570
as an adult.

193
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,190
At first,

194
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,790
it wasn't like that.

195
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,860
Here's our nurse station.

196
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,900
Shift handovers

197
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,910
take place here.

198
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,520
The lounge is back there.

199
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,510
Doctors and nurses

200
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,330
all rest there.

201
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,550
Dr. Lu!

202
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,350
What a coincidence.

203
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,470
Let me introduce

204
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,510
our new nurse,

205
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,330
Wang Qianqian.

206
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,260
Anesthesiologist, Lu Yan.

207
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,240
H-Hello, Dr. Lu.

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,490
Can I add you on WeChat?

209
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,150
I hope

210
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,090
I can consult you directly

211
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,430
about work.

212
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,659
I didn't bring my phone.

213
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,460
I'm busy.

214
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,330
Dr. Lu, are you alone?

215
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,190
Let's eat together.

216
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,870
You eat so little?

217
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,320
No wonder you're so thin.

218
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,220
I'm done.

219
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,050
Are you really leaving?

220
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,130
Were you scolded?

221
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,680
I accidentally touched the sterile table

222
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,540
in the operating room today

223
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,470
and was kicked out by the matron.

224
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,480
Matron Qiao

225
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,270
seems to have a good temper,

226
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,360
but she's very strict with work.

227
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,130
It's normal to be scolded by her.

228
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,810
Everyone's been scolded at least once.

229
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,400
I'm not crying

230
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,640
because I was scolded.

231
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,750
If the patient

232
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,610
got infected because of me,

233
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,980
what should I've done?

234
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,540
In our line of work,

235
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,580
mistakes cannot be tolerated.

236
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,600
A tiny mistake

237
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,030
could lead to unimaginable consequences.

238
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,860
If you aren't sure, ask more

239
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,840
and look around more.

240
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,350
Then I...

241
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,400
You'll definitely become

242
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,590
an excellent nurse.

243
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,930
Really?

244
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,550
Dr. Lu.

245
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,260
Stay with me a little longer.

246
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:42,790
Sure.

247
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,540
Can I lean on you?

248
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:48,920
Okay.

249
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,870
Qianqian always says

250
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,430
I've been taking care of her

251
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,290
and accompanying her.

252
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,560
But she doesn't know that she was the one

253
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,150
who got me out of a slump

254
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,650
that lasted for years.

255
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,550
I'm really grateful to her.

256
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,130
Here!

257
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,380
What is it?

258
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,070
Look.

259
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,510
You brought so much yummy stuff again?

260
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,730
There's one more thing.

261
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,060
What is it?

262
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,340
A scarf?

263
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,800
Yes, it's a gift for you.

264
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,440
Do you like it?

265
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,980
Yes.

266
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,790
Wear it now.

267
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,320
It's so warm.

268
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,380
So beautiful.

269
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,510
It suits you really well.

270
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,180
What do you think?

271
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,010
Nice.

272
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:42,950
Yeah?

273
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,510
Hurry up.

274
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,110
Are you cold?

275
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,380
No, I'm wearing this.

276
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,070
Okay.

277
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,580
Your favorite strawberry cake.

278
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,510
What's wrong?

279
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,670
Stop the car.

280
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,120
Lu Yan!

281
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,010
Where are you going?

282
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,410
What's wrong?

283
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,280
I...

284
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,080
What are you looking at?

285
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,030
I...

286
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,010
I saw Deng Man.

287
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,030
This is my second time.

288
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,960
Half a month ago,

289
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,420
I saw her once too.

290
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,750
Are you sure?

291
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,220
She was right in front of me,

292
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,020
in the alley

293
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,290
by my apartment building.

294
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,190
Could it just be a look-alike?

295
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,280
Impossible.

296
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,550
I couldn't have been mistaken.

297
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,160
Also...

298
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,660
I was being stalked.

299
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,020
When did that happen?

300
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,510
Just...

301
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,160
Two days ago,

302
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,800
someone kept following me.

303
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,500
I hid in the fruit shop.

304
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,240
And then

305
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,510
they disappeared

306
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,430
when I came out.

307
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,320
Give me your phone.

308
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,350
I'll set my number

309
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,220
as your emergency contact.

310
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,200
When you're in danger,

311
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,660
just press the dial key

312
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,630
to call me.

313
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:07,950
Okay.

314
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,110
Get in the car.

315
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:15,750
Let's go.

316
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,110
I understand Jiang Chengyi,

317
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,080
but why was Wen

318
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,790
so weird too?

319
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,430
Look at the time!

320
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:42,790
Honey.

321
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,650
I drank too much yesterday.

322
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,950
Let me sleep a little longer.

323
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,910
Get up now.

324
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,670
Hurry up.

325
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,590
Please.

326
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,840
Just a bit longer.

327
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,120
Are you free today?

328
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,040
Yes.

329
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,110
Dalu's handling the work today.

330
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,310
Go somewhere with me.

331
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,830
Go somewhere with me!

332
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,980
What for?

333
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:02,950
Let's have a date.

334
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,120
Where are we going, honey?

335
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,500
You'll see.

336
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,050
Lu.

337
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,160
Going for a run again?

338
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,150
Forget running.

339
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,230
Let's go eat something good.

340
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:22,750
What's this?

341
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,550
You've been kidnapped by us.

342
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:23,950
Let's go.

343
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,910
I'm not going!

344
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,110
Dr. Lu, you're so self-disciplined.

345
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,500
You don't drink at all.

346
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,990
Tell me.

347
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,380
What’s up?

348
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:42,920
Lu Yan.

349
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,570
I have good news

350
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,000
that I think I should tell you.

351
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,190
Jiang Chengyi is back.

352
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,370
He was transferred to the Anshan Criminal Investigation Unit.

353
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,800
Surprised?

354
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,100
Shocked?

355
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,510
I don't think she understood

356
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,330
what I said.

357
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,190
Yeah.

358
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,630
Aren't you

359
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,030
too calm about it?

360
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,180
I know about it.

361
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,480
You do?

362
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,670
Impossible.

363
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,510
Absolutely impossible.

364
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,040
Honey.

365
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,260
I guarantee

366
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,430
I was the first to know

367
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,620
that Jiang Chengyi came back.

368
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,310
Jiang and I—

369
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:15,870
Zhong.

370
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,930
I doubt you're even in his top three.

371
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,750
Fine.

372
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,710
You two having a secret liaison?

373
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,560
Stop eating.

374
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,740
Tell us what happened.

375
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,750
Well,

376
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,650
his dad had an operation at our hospital.

377
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,430
We...

378
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,110
just chatted a bit.

379
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,220
Lu Yan.

380
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,800
If Jiang Chengyi

381
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,770
didn't come back to get back with you,

382
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,660
I'll hand you Zhong's head on a platter.

383
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,230
Honey—

384
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,790
Why would I want his head?

385
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,820
He came back to see his dad.

386
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,060
He said it himself.

387
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,750
I swear.

388
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,870
Swear?

389
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:52,630
Fine.

390
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,550
You two just keep lying

391
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,230
to yourselves.

392
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,190
Was this why you kidnapped me here?

393
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,550
Not only this.

394
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,360
Well...

395
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,850
What's going on with Wen?

396
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,839
Who?

397
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:05,859
Wen.

398
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,050
Wen?

399
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,849
Yeah!

400
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,920
Don't you think

401
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,910
he was too nice to you

402
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,970
and even

403
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,250
wary of Jiang Chengyi

404
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,839
last night?

405
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,670
Honey.

406
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,450
Why didn't I notice?

407
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,329
You were drunk.

408
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,190
Do you even remember

409
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:16,790
how you got home?

410
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,010
Wen...

411
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,650
seems to have been a bit...

412
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,829
weird lately.

413
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,440
Does he like you?

414
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,750
No way.

415
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,640
Ever since he quit as a doctor,

416
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,390
we haven't

417
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,530
been in touch.

418
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,750
I only see him...

419
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,630
at gatherings

420
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,470
during festivals and such.

421
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,400
You two were present too!

422
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,350
That's true.

423
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,740
Then what's going on?

424
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,870
I know.

425
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,470
It's not about you.

426
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,180
It's about Jiang Chengyi.

427
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,200
Didn’t you see?

428
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,630
Whenever Jiang Chengyi was nice to you,

429
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,310
he got angry.

430
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,630
Whenever Jiang Chengyi was nice to you, he got angry.

431
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,350
Whenever—

432
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,550
Eat your food.

433
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,950
Get your mind

434
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,490
out of the gutter.

435
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,470
Lu Yan.

436
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,130
Be honest.

437
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,630
How do you feel

438
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,990
about Jiang Chengyi now?

439
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,030
I've visited him in Jinzhou

440
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,300
over the years.

441
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,430
Think about it.

442
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,070
He used to

443
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,000
be such a lively person.

444
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,780
Ever since you broke up,

445
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,030
it was like he became another person,

446
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,420
all cold and detached.

447
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,450
I often teased him,

448
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,360
saying he's completely changed

449
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,150
after becoming a cop,

450
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,390
that he's one of them now.

451
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,570
Actually, I know

452
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,130
that's not who he is.

453
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,040
Ever since you two broke up,

454
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,150
he's been so miserable.

455
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,690
He's like a living zombie.

456
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,320
He always

457
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,220
went for the most dangerous missions,

458
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,470
like he didn't care for his life.

459
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,320
Then...

460
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,060
Has he ever been injured?

461
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,800
What do you think?

462
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,270
Whenever I visited him,

463
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,440
he was always wounded.

464
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,170
How do you think he got

465
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:02,900
all his awards?

466
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,320
He risked his life every time.

467
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,200
But he's different

468
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,400
after meeting you here.

469
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,110
There's light in his eyes again,

470
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,440
like he was revived.

471
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,430
Lu Yan,

472
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,450
our great Dr. Lu,

473
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,640
please help out

474
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,070
and save Jiang.

475
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,390
Lu Yan.

476
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,220
If you really don't plan to do that,

477
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,480
then let him go.

478
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,580
Don't give him hope.

479
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,980
That's enough.

480
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,190
Don't pressure

481
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,940
Yan like that.

482
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,040
What pressure?

483
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,070
What I mean is

484
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,550
if Lu saves Jiang,

485
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,410
it'll be a miracle

486
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,350
greater than becoming immortal!

487
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,550
Huh? What?

488
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,310
Do you think Yan has

489
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,020
had it easy?

490
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,160
She's not acting like him

491
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,230
like it's the end of the world,

492
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,510
but wasn't she

493
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,580
devastated that day too?

494
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,720
That's even better!

495
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,190
Mutual redemption! A perfect match!

496
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,200
Enough already.

497
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,320
I'm still here.

498
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,250
Stop acting.

499
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,620
Eat up and let's leave.

500
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,570
Eat up.

501
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,660
I'm just doing this for my buddy.

502
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,430
Well...

503
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,580
Were his injuries serious?

504
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,580
Coming.

505
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,200
You're quick.

506
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:31,990
Dalu's here too.

507
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,960
Of course.

508
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,110
Boss Zhong

509
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,260
took me out for some fresh air.

510
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,960
Don't you know all pets must be on leash?

511
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,790
You'll get fined.

512
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,640
Don't worry.

513
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,450
The leash is in the car.

514
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,470
Cut the crap. What's up?

515
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,450
Jiang Chengyi.

516
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,510
You'll regret

517
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,920
speaking to me in that tone.

518
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,040
Have I ever

519
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,870
regretted it?

520
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,470
Today,

521
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,920
my dear wife Tang Jie and I

522
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,070
went to see Lu Yan.

523
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,970
I

524
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,800
told Lu Yan

525
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,090
about how miserable you've been

526
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,510
all this while.

527
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,870
Why did you tell her that?

528
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,150
I...

529
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,100
Jiang.

530
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,660
You're too headstrong.

531
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,690
Listen.

532
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,230
Girls nowadays

533
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,000
aren't that into macho

534
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,350
old wolf dogs like you.

535
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,050
You're the old wolf dog.

536
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,420
It's true.

537
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,970
Puppy-like guys who can be

538
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,800
cute and vulnerable are all the rage.

539
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,350
That's right.

540
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,430
I won Tang Jie's heart

541
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,600
with this trick.

542
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,180
See?

543
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,340
How loving.

544
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,080
E-Enough.

545
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,990
You bulldog.

546
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,750
W-What did she say?

547
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,990
Buddy.

548
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,360
The best buddy in the world.

549
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,530
Being vulnerable?

550
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,200
That's more like it.

551
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,420
If you don't want to be punched in your face,

552
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,870
get to the point.

553
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,410
She didn't say anything.

554
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,910
But I could

555
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,270
tell from her eyes

556
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,740
that she really cares about you.

557
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,000
I think she

558
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,830
hasn't let you go.

559
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,430
Now that you're back,

560
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,600
why don't you strike while the iron's hot?

561
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,010
She's almost 30 years old.

562
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,120
She might go on some blind date

563
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,570
and before you know it,

564
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,230
she's married with four kids.

565
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,280
Shut up.

566
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,180
How could it be so quick?

567
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,430
You'd better stay out

568
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,160
of this.

569
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,000
If I didn't get involved,

570
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,500
you might really have no hope.

571
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,760
You'll regret refusing the help

572
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,390
of such a

573
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,490
brilliant love coach like me.

574
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,980
Is there so much to regret about?

575
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,660
Hey.

576
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,540
Aren't you going to strategize?

577
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,600
Strategize?

578
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:32,830
I do

579
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,270
enough of that at work.

580
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,620
Here's an important lead for you.

581
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,590
She runs at the riverside park

582
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,910
in her neighborhood

583
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:41,890
every day after work.

584
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,790
That's it?

585
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,520
That's none of my business.

586
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,530
Bye.

587
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,570
Really leaving?

588
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,490
Be careful on your operations!

589
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,030
I bet two yuan

590
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,140

591
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,840
I'll up it.

592
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,600
I bet three yuan

593
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,530
that he'll regret it soon.

620
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,500
Yeah.

621
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,180
I went to...

622
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,130
visit my dad.

623
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,950
Then I wanted to exercise.

624
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:42,930
So I...

625
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,280
came here to exercise.

626
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,550

00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,070
Oh, right,

630
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,420
you know your dad can be discharged

631
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,230
tomorrow, yeah?

632
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,610
I-I know.

633
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,280
Tomorrow, I...

634
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,110
I have work to do.

635
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,060
And then...

636
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,970
I'll come here in advance

637
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,150

638
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,190
Okay.

639
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,070
Then

640
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,030
I'll continue running.

641
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,850
Go ahead.

644
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,510
I'm super slow.

645
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,870
I can't catch up with you.

646
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,150
It's okay. I'll slow down.

647
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,310
Okay.

648
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,750
What are you listening to?

649
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,000
Want to listen?

650
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,710
Sure.

651
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,670
Are you sure?

652
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,590
Take it then.

653
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,720
Hello, everyone.

654
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,730
Welcome to

655
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,390
today's podcast.

656
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,230
On September 20,

657
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,700
a surgeon from

658
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,390
the University of Maryland Medical Center

659
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,420
successfully transplanted

660
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,230
a transgenic pig heart...

661
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,230
What the hell is this?

662
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,500
Into a human body.

663
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,010
Someone said

664
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,360
to let nature take its course

665
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,420
but ended up listening to a story about a pig's heart.

666
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,500
So?

667
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,330
Regret not listening to me now?

668
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,600
Cut the crap.

669
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,140
Just tell me what to do.

670
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,380
Listen.

671
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,430
You made a grave mistake today.

672
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,240
Couldn't you've been honest?

673
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,900
Why did you say you ran into her

674
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,410
by coincidence?

675
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,600
So unromantic.

676
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,870
What should I have said?

677
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,760
Tell her

678
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,790
I went there

679
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,600
to wait for her?

680
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,280
That's so pressurizing.

681
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,330
Bro,

682
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,080
girls want to

683
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,730
be the exception.

684
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,540
Forget about all that by chance,

685
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,080
coincidence,

686
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,430
and happenstance, okay?

687
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,730
Fine.

688
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,020
Let me teach you a foolproof move.

689
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,510
Take her to

690
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:41,590

691
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,310
and classy restaurant.

692
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,340
It's better if you can see the night view.

693
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,180
Have a drink together.

694
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:49,790
Huh...

695
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,180
Isn't that too grand of a gesture?

696
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,210
Take her to dinner right now!

697
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,400
How can I ask her out?

698
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,430
Jiang.

699
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,910
Have you forgotten

700
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,590
how you courted her

701
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,380
in school?

702
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,990
Are you so prideful now?

703
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,490
No.

704
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,990
She courted me back then.

705
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,450
He's hopeless.

706
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,300
Are you asleep?

707
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,600
No.

708
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,300
What's up?

709
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,610
[No. What's up?]

710
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,220
Nothing.

711
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,870
I'm just asking if you're home.

712
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,510
If I'm home?

713
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,310
If I'm home?

714
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:08,400
Mm,

715
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:08,950
I'm home.

716
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,640
Let me teach you a foolproof move.

717
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,360

I know of a nice restaurant.

My friend recommended

a good restaurant.

724
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,190
Do you want to try it?

725
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,660
That sounds so dumb.

726
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,990
Are you free this weekend?

727

757
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,720
I'll just wear anything.

They're all nice.

760
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,830
I'll wear a trench coat.

761
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,820
It's more elegant.

I know you're off today,

00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,830
I'll just say a few words.

973
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:46,700
First,

974
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,640
the explosion case was resolved perfectly.

975
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,760
The higher-ups

976
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,800
awarded our unit with

977
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,730
a collective third-class merit!

978

[Anshan Criminal Investigation]

979
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,400
Second,

980
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,120
let's welcome Jiang Chengyi.

981
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,540
Applause!

982
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,890

986
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,260
Third...

987
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,630
Director Xing bought everyone milk tea!

988
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,550
Let me tell you.

989
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:14,240
Captain Jiang

990
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,660
was my senior at school.

991
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,990
We were classmates.

992
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:17,750
Work hard.

993
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,640
Don't worry, Director Xing.

994
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,710
Have some milk tea.

995
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:20,110
Okay.

996
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,880
Come on.

997
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:24,740
Take one.

998
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,320
Here.

999
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,270
Captain Jiang.

1000
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:26,870
Here's the

1001
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:27,900
retrieval notice you requested.

1002
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,350
Okay, thank you.

1003
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:30,600
What case are you working on?

1004
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:32,650
If you're free, come with me tonight.

1005
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:33,590
Okay, let's go.

1006
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,680
[Outpatient]

1007
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,300
I'm exhausted.

1008
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:42,340
Work's finally over.

1009
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,870
I'm sleeping

1010
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,070
the minute I get home.

1011
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,250
There really were many operations today.

1012
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:49,950
My bike is fixed.

1013
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,990
I'm getting it later.

1014
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:51,760
See you.

1015
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:52,910
How about I drive you there?

1016
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:53,870
No need.

1017
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:54,870
I can walk there.

1018
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,210
Congrats then.

1019
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:57,510
You won't have to

1020
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,430
walk to work anymore.

1021
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,550
Right? I'll get going.

1022
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,270
You sure you don't want a ride?

1023
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:01,750
No.

1024
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:03,300
Bye.

1025
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,090
Mr. Feng.

1026
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,480
How's my bike?

1027
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:27,690
Dr. Lu, you're here.

1028
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,470
It's not fixed yet.

1029
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:29,110
Wait a moment.

1030
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:29,670
Okay.

1031
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,750
I'll check it for you.

1032
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,540
What's wrong with it?

1033
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,100
The tires are a bit tight.

1034
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,570
I'll fix it. Loosen them.

1035
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,240
Okay.

1036
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,550
Then it'll be less tiring to ride it.

1037
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,100
It's getting cold.

1038
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,970
Right?

1039
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:00,990
Here's all the surveillance footage

1040
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:01,870
from that day.

1041
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,950
Let me see.

1042
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,120
Can you zoom in?

1043
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,010
Yes.

1044
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:18,510
There are no cameras in the alleys;

1045
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,630
the footage is from the main road

1046
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,510
by the alley entrance.

1047
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,450
Who is this, Jiang?

1048
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,200
Someone who shouldn't have appeared.

1049
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:43,870
Go back and check

1050
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,070
the cameras around Binjiang Road

1051
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,560
for that same person.

1052
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,760
Okay, I'll get going.

1053
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,520
Okay.

1054
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,790
Hello?

1055
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,940
What's up?

1056
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,520
[Jiang Chengyi]

1057
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,300
Are you off work?

1058
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,980
I just got off work. I'm on my way home.

1059
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:10,240
I just got my bike.

1060
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,770
I just checked

1061
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:12,930
the surveillance footage.

1062
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,150
The person you met that day

1063
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,710
does look a lot like Deng Man.

1064
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,870
Something's off.

1065
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:23,310
Where are you?

1066
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:24,450
I'm in your neighborhood.

1067
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:25,410
Let's meet up.

1068
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,750
I'm at the alley by my apartment building.

1069
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,200
What's wrong?

1070
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,270
Hello?

1071
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:38,870
Lu Yan?

1072
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,180
What’s wrong?

What do you want?
