Let's say it's the same murderer.

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,870
Then they chose to kill the two

198
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,590
by extremely different methods.

199
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,560
In Wang Qianqian's case,

200
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,040
you can clearly sense that

201
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,100

202
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,470

205
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,150
I'm leaning towards

206

207
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,850

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,150

to prevent being exposed.

212
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,230
Isn't it logical?

213
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,530
If they just wanted to kill someone,

214
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,150
why did they torture

220

So the key

221
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,970
lies in whether

Why did Ding Jing buy this?

391
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,710
This doesn't go with the clothes

392
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,390
she usually wore.

393
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,110
Let me see.

394
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,590
Is it hers?

395
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,430
I don't know if it's hers.

396
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,070
But it's

397
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,070
a recent parcel she got.

398
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,250
It should be a coincidence.

399
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,610
[A small memorial service is scheduled to be held at 10:30 a.m. on January 7.]

400
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,610
[My daughter, Ding Jing, has passed away recently.]

401
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,510
Ding Jing's memorial service

402
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,760
is this Saturday.

403
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,280
Let's go together.

404
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,340
The funeral is the best place to investigate

405
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,850
a person's social relationships.

406
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,520
Maybe the murderer will be there too.

407
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,330
I have to go.

408
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,660
Don't be nervous.

409
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,850
It's just a first meeting today.

410
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:59,750
They're not

411
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,990
deciding on the role yet.

412
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,190
But first impressions are too important.

413
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,070
I feel like if

414
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,370
I don't perform well today,

415
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,070
there will be no next chance.

416
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,440
Haven't you been

417
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,110
taking Professor Yu's classes?

418
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,590
I think I've learned

419
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,750
enough from her.

420
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,120
Did you quarrel?

421
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,260
No.

422
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,990
It's just a work partnership.

423
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,240
We're not that close.

424
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,240
You have to

425
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,230
seize this opportunity

426
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,100
and learn from Professor Yu.

427
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,550
It'll also come in handy

428
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,190
for future roles.

429
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,750
But she's never been sincere

430
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,790
in teaching me.

431
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,330
Come in.

432
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,010
Mr. Wen.

433
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,870
This morning,

434
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,870
we received a letter.

435
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,790
[A small memorial service is scheduled to be held at 10:30 a.m. on January 7.]

436
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,790
[My daughter, Ding Jing, has passed away recently.]

437
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,790
[Obituary]

438
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,310
Ding Jing passed away.

439
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,320
No way.

440
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,230
Didn't we just meet her

441
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,270
at the mixer a few days ago?

442
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,750
I'll be on a business trip.

443
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,280
Send her off for me.

444
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,350
Okay.

445
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,270
Hello?

446
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,060
What do you mean?

447
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,310
I've searched Ding Jing's home

448
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,470
and company.

449
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,250
I didn't find anything.

450
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,750
Could it be that

451
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,870
she doesn't have evidence?

452
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,090
Can you guarantee that?

453
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,830
I'm sorry.

454
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,020
If you still want to see your mother,

455
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,470
you know what to do.

456
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,400
Don't worry.

457
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,980
I will find it.

458
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,120
Yue.

459
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,800
How is it?

460
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,510
Nothing unusual.

461
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,860
Go back and rest.

462
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,740
It's okay. We're not sleepy.

463
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,080
Just go back and rest.

464
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,200
Or you can go to the hospital

465
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,260
to accompany Liu Hao.

466
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:05,850
Okay.

467
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,310
Thank you, Yue.

468
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:08,910
Where's the walkie-talkie?

469
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:09,770
At the handle.

470
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,400
Go.

471
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,120
Bye.

472
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:11,750
Take care.

473
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,370
Be careful.

474
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,090
Go in.

475
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,930
Her parents are inside.

476
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,970

488

Call me if there's anything.

489

Isn't that your lady?

490
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,240
She's quite kind,

491
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,340

here?

It's inappropriate.

495

Cut it out.

It's not too late to put down the knife,

Don't move!

580

Calm down.

582
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,470
We'll back off, okay?

583
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,420
We'll back off.

584
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,270
Calm down.

585
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,350
Don't hurt the hostage!

586
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,170
L-Look at me.

587
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,380
I don't have any weapon.

588
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,550
I'll trade with him, okay?

589
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,610
I'll be the hostage. I'll go with you.
