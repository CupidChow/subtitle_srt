Honey.

378
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,660
Abalone and bird's nest is a meal.

379
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,030
Noodles are also a meal.

380
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,050
What matters is it's filling,

381
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,940
don't you think?

382
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,700
You should

383
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,230
stop thinking about this.

384
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,070
Most importantly,

385
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,830
the matter has passed.

386
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,870
What we should do now

387
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,630
is to accept it

388
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,730
and face the future.

389
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,830
I even bought some hats just now.

390
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,540
Look.

391
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,240
One for you,

392
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,030
one for me,

393
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,080
and one for our baby.

394
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,130
It's Chinese New Year. Let's have fun.

395
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,220
Honey.

396
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,720
I almost cost us our home.

397
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,510
Should we—

398
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,530
Zhong Wenxuan!

399
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,600
This again?

400
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,700
Sorry. I'm sorry.

401
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,070
You're right, wifey.

402
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,920
Get into the festive spirit.

403
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,150
Exactly.

404
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,150
Only by

405
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,470
living well day by day

406
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,910
can we have a bright future.

407
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,270
Honey.

408
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,400
Actually, I have a plan

409
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,310
to discuss with you.

410
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,460
Go ahead.

411
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,590
Aren't short videos

412
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,150
quite popular now?

413
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,360
I want to write

414
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,230
skits with Dalu.

415
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,430
I'll find

416
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,350
my old director

417
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,000
and actor friends

418
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,110
to help me build

419
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,080
a video channel.

420
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,550
Sure.

421
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,450
Will you be a producer then?

422
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,390
Producer Zhong.

423
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,430
Can you give me a role

424
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,860
when the script is done?

425
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,850
My wife must be the leading actress.

426
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,990
No thanks.

427
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,630
It's too tiring.

428
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,630
Just give me a supporting role.

429
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,080
You can play whatever you want.

430
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,670
Honey.

431
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,230
Am I handsome?

432
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,820
Yes, you are,

433
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,030
but it's a bit loud.

434
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,440
Why don't you take it off?

435
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,290
Who cares?

436
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,550
Then I'll put mine on too.

437
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,120
Honey, I'm so lucky to have you.

438
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,850
Honey!

439
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,420
It's snowing!

440
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,770
This is the first snow of the year, honey.

441
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,060
It's so romantic!

442
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,920
Take some photos for me!

443
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,560
My wife's so beautiful.

444
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,350
Come, let's take selfies too.

445
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:55,810
Here.

446
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,410
Why did you save me?

447
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,850
It's my duty to save people.

448
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,260
And you should be

449
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,430
punished by the law.

450
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,970
Don't you hate me?

451
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,620
I hurt so many people;

452
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,950
your colleagues, friends,

453
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,190
and your future mother-in-law.

454
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,680
So you know it yourself.

455
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,990
I thought you were some

456
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,300
extreme perverted killer.

457
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,030
Tell me.

458
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,360
You've done so many bad things

459
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,390
and hurt so many people.

460
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,630
Now that you're here,

461
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:41,740
are you ashamed?

462
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,250
In my life,

463
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,240
nothing really

464
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,310
belonged to me.

465
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,200
But there is one thing

466
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,550
where we're the same.

467
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,510
We both want to get Lu Yan.

468
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,940
You want

469
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,650
to get Lu Yan.

470
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,460
First of all, the word choice is problematic.

471
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,510
You just want to coop Lu Yan up

472
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,910
in your little world.

473
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,490
Your so-called efforts

474
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,590
and sacrifice

475
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,040
were just

476
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,940
to satisfy your selfish desires,

477
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,630
am I right?

478
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,590
That's your guess.

479
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,280
Lu Yan doesn't think so.

480
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,810
Still being stubborn?

481
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,670
I hope that

482
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,490
one day,

483
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,530
you'll really figure out

484
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,430
what you have done.

485
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,150
If there's a chance,

486
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,040
see your mother

487
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,880
and have a proper chat with her.

488
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,520
She's always missed you.

489
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,230
♫As the city flickers♫

490
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,500

Peng!

Peng.

528
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,820
Peng.

529
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,470
Peng.

530
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,160
Can you look at me?

531
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,830
I know

532
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,510
it's my fault.

533
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,920
I was wrong.

534
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,600
I know it's my fault.

535
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,640
I'm really sorry.

536
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,160
I'm here to see you.

537
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,990
Look at me, okay?

538
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,360
Enough, stop crying.

539
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,590
It has nothing to do with you.

540
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,460
What I did

541
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,650
is my business.

542
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,280
Why not?

543
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,280
If I knew it'd turn out like this...

544
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
If I knew this

545
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,910
would happen,

546
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,120
no matter what,

547
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,630
I wouldn't have abandoned you.

548
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,130
I regret it.

549
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,190
My dear child.

550
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,270
I regret it.

551
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,810
I love you.

552
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,700
You love me?

553
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,710
If you love me,

554
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,030
would I be like this now?

555
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,580
Peng!

556
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,730
Peng!

557
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,210
What are you doing here?

558
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,550
I want to see my child again.

559
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,400
How dare you come here?

560
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,590
If it weren't for you,

561
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,580
would he have ended up like this?

562
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,210
I'm sorry.

563
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,390
He doesn't even want to see you

564
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,470
for the last time.

565
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,720
I'm really sorry.

566
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,790
It's retribution.

567
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,370
Your retribution.

568
