00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,530
You go in first. I'll park the car.

385
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:50,930
Sixth floor.

386
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,350
The chocolates you arranged

387
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:52,870
have already

388
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,990
been sent in.

389
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,880
Open one for me first.

390
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,070
Wait for me downstairs.

391
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,670
Okay.

392
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,020
Lu Yan.

393
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,870
Senior Wen?

394
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,340
You've returned from abroad?

395
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,740
I came back a couple of days ago.

396
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,330
Tang Jie mentioned that day

397
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,390
that Zhong was upset

398
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,370
because you couldn't come back.

399
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,360
He said your basketball team

400
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,380
couldn't get all its members together.

401
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,090
Of course, I would come back.

402
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,760
I even sponsored their wedding candy.

403
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,700
Really?

404
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
What kind of wedding candy?

405
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,530
I just happened to bring one with me.

406
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,550
Chocolate?

407
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,170
This brand is hard to find.

408
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,710
I bought them when I

409
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,420
was at Fashion Week.

410
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,690
I really love it.

411
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,170
I know.

412
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,280
When you were in college,

413
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,870
you used to carry a lot of candy and chocolate

414
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,610
in your pockets.

415
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,310
Yeah. You still remember that?

416
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,700
When we were in college,

417
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,560
your basketball team

418
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,790
played so hard

419
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,710
that it was easy to get low blood sugar.

420
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,270
So, I carried candy with me every day.

421
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,470
Jiang Chengyi used to call me

422
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,210
a mobile snack shop.

423
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,470
The elevator is here.

424
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,440
Let's go.

425
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,610
Jiang Chengyi?

426
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,780
What a coincidence.

427
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,130
Yes.

428
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,660
Lu Yan,

429
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,390
how's Mr. Han's

430
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,090
health?

431
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,390
Dr. Han? He's doing well.

432
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,170
He just

433
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,690
really misses you.

434
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,630
He told his students in class,

435
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,690
"None of you write papers

436
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,920
as well as a student of mine."

437
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,180
Does he still eat pancake rolls

438
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,670
with fried dough sticks for breakfast?

439
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,620
Yes.

440
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,930
His cholesterol is high, so he doesn't dare to eat them.

441
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,640
So,

442
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,200
he secretly eats them behind his wife's back.

443
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,010
Next weekend,

444
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,470
if you don't have surgery scheduled,

445
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,210
I'll host

446
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,420
a meal

447
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,050
for Dr. Han,

448
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,690
his wife,

449
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,230
you,

450
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,520
and the juniors.

451
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,430
If it's okay with you,

452
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,600
you can show me

453
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,450
You left your lipstick in my car.

454
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,840
Thank you.

455
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,120
Let's go.

456
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,590
Good. One more time.

457
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,420
Let's try another pose.

458
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,270
Finger hearts.

459
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,070
Try to look a bit more cheerful!

460
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,630
Okay.

461
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,750
One, two, three.

462
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,880
Cheese.

463
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,550
Take care of the guests for me, Ping.

464
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,030
Okay.

465
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,860
Go over there first.

466
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,000
Drink more, Qin Yong.

467
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,190
Zhong.

468
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,500
You're here.

469
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,470
Isn't this Captain Jiang?

470
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,070
Congratulations.

471
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,720
Come here, Yan.

472
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,870
You look so beautiful.

473
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,930
Why did you two come together?

474
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,900
We met on the way.

475
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,530
Why are you two here together?

476
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,410
We met on the way.

477
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,060
I mean you and Wen Peng.

478
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,450
We met on the way.

479
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,520
What a coincidence.

480
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,470
What a coincidence.

481
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:29,910
What a coincidence.

482
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,740
Tang Jie,

483
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,620
Da Zhong.

484
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,990
May you grow old together.

485
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,770
Senior.

486
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,120
Thank you for the wedding candy.

487
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,710
It really elevated

488
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,880
the level of our wedding.

489
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,510
You're welcome.

490
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,550
Just a small gesture.

491
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,810
What a sweet talker.

492
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,390

493

Come on.

Let's take a photo.

496
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,800
The bride should be in the middle, right?

497
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,350
Then I'll go to that side.

498
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,440
We still need one person here.

499
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,110
How about having one more person over here?

500
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:07,900
Jiang.

501
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:10,890
I'll go.

502
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,580

do you have anything to say?

00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,690
I do.

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,680

00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,520
Just say it.

531
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,700
I...

532
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,690
Give your speech.

00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,470
haven't yet reached 30 years,

what's wrong?

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,620
Let's get married.

555
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,480
But we...

556
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,350
we've only been together for a month.

557
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,380
In this month,

558
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,390
you've been in training for...

559
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,500
for half of it.

560
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,910
I'm about to take the entrance exam

561
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,310
to be a graduate student in Public Security.

562
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,920
If I pass,

563
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,650
I'll be going to the police academy.

564
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,410
I've checked,

565

566
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,210
I can take high-speed trains every weekend

567
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,610
to come back and see you.

568
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,430
Since I'm leaving,

569
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,390
I want to promise you

570
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,290
a future.

571
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,750

572
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,020
if you want to go to Beijing or Shanghai,

573
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,310
I'll go with you.

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,170
If you want to stay here,

[Happiness Station]

576
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,570
I'll apply to transfer back.

577
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,690
Don't worry.

578
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,040
I'm not pushing you to get married.

579
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,940
What I mean is…

580
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,930
What I mean is…

581
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,590
my proposal

582
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,370
will always be valid for you.

583
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,880
No.

584
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,700
It's not a proposal.

585
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,170
A proposal would be more formal.

586
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,400
Today, it's...

587
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,020
Well...

588
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,750
You...

589
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,110
Are you feeling unwell?

590
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,870
I'll go buy you a bottle of water.

592
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,650
Do you know what the best way

593
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,000
to treat diaphragm muscles is?

594
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,490
What's the way?

596
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,690
This method didn't work very well.

597
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,240
Could it be that the dosage wasn't enough?

598
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,750
Let me help you.

599
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,480
Honey,

600
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,460
I love you.

601
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,690
I love you too.
