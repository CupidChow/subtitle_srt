00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,009
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,039
[Peng]

4
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,000
[Peng, I saw a boy on the street today. He looks like you when you were young]

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,500
[Peng, you'll have time off for Christmas, right? Are you coming back to China?]

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,500
[If you do, make sure to contact Mom, okay?]

7
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,160
[Call me when you're free, okay?]

8
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,160
[Peng, I wanted to call you today, but I was afraid to disturb you]

9
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,750
All right.

10
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,610
Stop crying.

11
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,140
It's bad for your health.

12
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,440
It's my fault.

13
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,250
But you know

14
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,840
we had no choice

15
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,670
at that time, right?

16
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,470
I know. I know.

17
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,460
I know it all.

18
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,470
You have always felt guilty

19
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,930
toward Peng.

20
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,470
But it's all in the past.

21
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,000
We can't change anything.

22
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,200
Look forward.

23
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,960
Look forward.

24
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,630
As long as we

25
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,610
treat him sincerely,

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,440
he will accept you in the end.

27
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,690
Do you think

28
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,390
he hates me?

29
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,960
Otherwise, why hasn't he replied to

30
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,750
any of my messages for such a long time?

31
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,790
No matter how much he hates you,

32
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,560
he's still your son.

33
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,250
How about this?

34
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,710
When you get better,

35
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,080
I'll accompany you

36
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,520
to go find him.

37
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,700
No matter what issues you have between you,

38
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,460
just talk it out.

39
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,450
Okay?

40
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,760
Okay, wipe your tears.

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,640
Wipe them clean.

42
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,329
I really feel bad.

43
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,750
Look at him.

44
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,350
Alright.

45
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,650
Enough.

46
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,810
Alright.

47
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,320
I'll go with you for everything.

48
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,110
Okay?

49
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,120
I'm here.

50
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,250
All right.

51
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,350
Sorry.

52
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,430
You can't go in here.

53
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,690
Who is this?

54
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,660
Who knows?

55
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,860
Let's go.

56
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,710
What's wrong?

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,440
I don't know.

58
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,110
What are you looking at?

59
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,420
Mr. Wen,

60
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,610
that woman has been here since early this morning.

61
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,350
She's been standing downstairs all the time.

62
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,100
Drive her away.

63
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:50,060
Drive her away!

64
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,050
Yes.

65
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,080
I know. I won't barge in.

66
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,790
But…

67
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,270
I really need to talk to Mr. Wen.

68
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:02,840
Can you

69
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,230
find a colleague in charge to…

70
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,710
May I help you?

71
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,230
I’m looking for Mr. Wen.

72
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,070
Sorry.

73
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,220
We don't

74
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,250
have this person here.

75
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,990
I searched online.

76
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,370
Your boss's surname is Wen.

77
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,270
He's named Wen Peng.

78
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,030
Just help me…

79
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,630
I don't know

80
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,020
where you found that information.

81
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,660
However,

82
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,680
there really is no such person here.

83
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,080
You're standing here,

84
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,670
blocking our company's vehicles

85
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,590
and people from getting in and out.

86
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,580
So,

87
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,590
please leave.

88
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,380
[Peng, I know you're in Ninghai. Can you meet me?]

89
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,740
Peng.

90
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,030
I know you're in Ninghai.

91
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,830
Can you meet me?

92
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,380
Look.

93
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,130
You look so sad.

94
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,450
Don't be sad.

95
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,760
So…

96
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,130
he has been in Ninghai the whole time.

97
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,190
He knows I'm looking for him.

98
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,470
He just doesn't want to see me.

99
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,330
If I knew this would happen,

100
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,520
I shouldn't have

101
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,790
left him alone back then.

102
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,580
No matter how hard it was,

103
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,820
I should've taken him with me.

104
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,140
Mom,

105
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,240
I don't think

106
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,470
it's all your fault.

107
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,060
Don't blame yourself.

108
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,620
It's not like you didn't go back to look for him.

109
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,630
You did.

110
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,720
You just didn't find him.

111
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,330
His father

112
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,390
took him away.

113
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,860
He just didn't want him to see you.

114
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,050
What could you have done?

115
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,870
It's okay.

116
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,559
Now,

117
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,159
we meet him again.

118
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,480
Now, we know

119
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,470
he's in Ninghai.

120
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:40,970
We met again.

121
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,140
You'll have plenty of time to make up for him.

122
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,430
Right?

123
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,390
Yes.

124
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,260
Professor Yu,

125
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,030
we'll be in Chengzhou soon.

126
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,190
Where should we go first?

127
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,680
Let's go to the sports school first.

128
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:10,780
Okay.

129
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,650
Are you hungry?

130
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,990
Do you want to eat first?

131
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,030
I'm not hungry.

132
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,560
Let's go there first.

133
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:17,920
Okay.

134
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,390
This is

135
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,240
Li Ruonan you're looking for.

136
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,240
She is my most talented student

137
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,750
in all these years.

138
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,450
She's really good,

139
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,390
but she's not moral.

140
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,290
She almost stabbed me to death.

141
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,320
Of course she's good.

142
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,330
She was gifted.

143
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:36,950
Later,

144
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,350
she practiced harder than anyone else.

145
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,680
Unfortunately,

146
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,750
such a promising young athlete…

147
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,790
What a pity.

148
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,890
What happened to her?

149
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,130
It's about her family.

150
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,140
Her father

151
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,710
passed away early.

152
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:46,830
My mother

153
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,090
is always sick.

154
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,560
In the end, she had no choice

155
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,070
but to drop out.

156
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,550
Do you know

157
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,210
what disease her mother got?

158
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,880
As for the details,

159
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,010
I'm not sure.

160
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,490
Let me show you this.

161
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,180
This is the photo of her and her mother.

162
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,750
Coach,

163
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,020
can we have this?

164
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,580
Sure.

165
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,200
Thank you.

166
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,050
Okay.

167
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,170
Thank you.

168
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,990
-Thank you, Coach.
-You're welcome.

169
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,630
Okay.

170
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,370
Bye.

171
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:17,870
Okay.

172
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,000
So, she dropped out

173
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,290
because her mother was sick?

174
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,350
That's right.

175
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,650
She would rather drop out of school

176
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,790
to take care of her mother.

177
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,390
It seems that she was close

178
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,550
[Anshan, Ninghai Public Security
Criminal Investigation Unit]

179
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,310
to her mother.

180
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,680
I guess…

181
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,920
after Wen Peng saw her

182
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,310
hit the assistant director,

183
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,700
he thought she was good at martial arts,

184
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,440
so he helped her to settle the problem with money

185
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,420
in order to buy her over.

186
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,670
If she dropped out

187
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,330
because of her mother's illness,

188
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,480
then...

189
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,040
now that she committed a crime

190
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,990
and needed to go to jail,

191
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,220
she definitely considered

192
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,440
who would take care of her mother.

193
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,880
Have you checked this line?

194
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,010
Yes.

195
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,190
That's why I decided

196
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,270
to start from this direction.

197
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,660
How's it going on your side?

198
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,430
I...

199
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:58,940
Not bad.

200
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,160
Since I knew

201
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,590
that Wen Peng is

202
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,250
my mother's biological son,

203
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,590
I've thought it through.

204
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,240
What have you thought through?

205
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,080
His criminal motive.

206
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,490
If he is the murderer,

207
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
his motive is me.

208
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,180
This should be all.

209
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,340
You can check

210
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,830
and ask him what other questions he has.

211
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,330
Auntie.

212
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,960
Lu, I was looking for you.

213

214
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,920
I need…

215
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,570
a favor from you.

216
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,030
No problem.

217
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,750
Go ahead.

218
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,480
What is it?

219
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,430
I...

220
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,630
I think...

221
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,080
Can you help me find Peng?

222
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,070
Auntie…

223
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,960
I know

224
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,670
this is putting you in a difficult place.

225
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,720
I went to his company to find him.

226
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,530
They stopped me from seeing him.

I...

229
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,870
I have no other way.

230
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,850
I know

231
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,490
you and Peng are alumni.

232
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,190
Can you give him a call for me?

233
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,670
Auntie…

234
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,230
Ask him out

235
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,000
so that I can meet him, okay?

236
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,640
Auntie,

237
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:08,470
I...

238
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,630
I'm begging you.

239
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,410
Please help me.

240
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,180
Okay?

241
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,820
Please help me.

242
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,070
Okay?

243
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,780
No. No.

244
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,050
Auntie, don't be like this.

245
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,600
I'll call him…

246

for you.

247
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,260
Okay.

00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,500
Okay.

250
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,670

251

Yes.

Can we have dinner together?

253
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,260
Sure.

254
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,450
What do you want to eat?

255
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,160
My treat.

256
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,510
Okay.

257
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,510
I'll send you

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,480
Okay.

260

Auntie, I'm done.

261
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,990
I'll send you the address later.

262
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,560
Okay.

Lu,

264
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,140
don't tell him you're with me.

Otherwise...

266
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,100
I didn't say anything.

267
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,820
I just invited him to dinner.

268
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,270
Well...

269
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,670
Lu,

270
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,850
can you…

271
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,560
go with me tonight?

272
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,880

and begged me because she wanted to see Wen Peng.

279

-Mr. Wen.
-You're finally willing to see me.

283
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,410
Actually,

it's not me who wants to see you today.

285
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,190
Then, who is it?

289
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,220
have a good chat with Auntie.

290
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,860
Give her another chance.

291
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,230
You must be hungry.

292
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,670
Eat something.

293
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,710
All these years,

294
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,560
I've imagined countless times

295

you are right now.

299
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,210
I heard

300
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,090
when you were in college,

301
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,250
your major grades were always among the top few each year,

302
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,910
and you got a scholarship every year.

303
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,940
Moreover,

304
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,200
you made it to the school team for basketball.

305
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,350
You were even a student council officer.

306
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,390
Am I right?

307
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,480
At that time,

308
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,990
you studied medicine.

309
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,200
Why didn't you become a doctor after you graduated?

310
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,710
Does it have anything to do with you?

311
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,860
You're right.

312
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,940
As your mother,

313
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,230
I'm not qualified at all.

315
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,470
you went abroad to study.

you didn't reply.

324
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,550
don't blame me.

I even called the police to find you.

beat you to death

to my company today.

354
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,640
But I asked my assistant

355
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,580
to drive you away.

356
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,790
Do you know why?

357
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,250
Because you came too late.

359
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,070
I would go to you without hesitation.

375
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,430

But I couldn't wake him up.

379
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,600
If I woke him up,

380
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,790
I would get a harsh beating

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,270
with whatever was beside the bed.

383
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,690
Sometimes it was a belt;

384
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,270
sometimes, a rattan stick;

385
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,700
sometimes,

386
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,610
a wine bottle.

387
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,790
Do you know what he said to me

388
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,860
when he hit me?

389
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,160
He said I was something

390
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,460
that no one wanted.

391
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,720
He also said

392
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,210
I betrayed him

393
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,000
by letting you go.

394
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,250
I...

395
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,740
Mom…

396
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,060
I want...

397
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,390
I want you.

398
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,910
Actually, when I was 17,

399
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,640
I saw you.

400
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,820
When I went to your house that day,

401
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,130
I saw you and Jiang Chengyi.

402
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,030
What's wrong?

403
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,910
You look upset. Are you unhappy?

404
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,940
Perfect.

405
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,540
I can ask Granny to persuade my dad.

406
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,630
Do you want to go to the police academy that badly?

407
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,470
I've always wanted to since I was little.

408
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,240
My dad agreed to it before.

409
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,560
Why did he suddenly change his mind?

410
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,910
Fine.

411
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,550
I promise you

412
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,870
I'll tell your grandma.

413
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,540
However,

414
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,920
you have to promise me

415
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,560
if your grandma agrees,

416
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,760
you'll eat two more

417
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,920
drumsticks your grandma made.

418
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,930
Okay?

419
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,310
Deal.

420
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,960
You silly boy.

421
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,700
Okay, let's go.

422
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,270
At that time, I thought,

423
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,440
now that you had a new family—

424
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,220
a new son

425
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,860
and a new husband,

426
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,610
you didn't need me anymore.

427
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,730
So, you just said

428
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,200
you'd been looking for me all these years.

429
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,650
Do you think I'll believe you?

430
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,440
Do you think I'd reply

431
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,910
to those messages you sent me?

432
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,470
You brought those two here

433
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,500
to see me.

434
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,880
What do you want to tell me by doing that?

435
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,110
Do you want to show me

436
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,260
how happy you are now?

437
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:18,830
Do you?

438
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,630
No.

439
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,390
Fine, I don't want to hear it.

440
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,430
I don't want to hear your explanation.

441
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,600
Look at me.

442
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,060
I'm doing well.

443
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:38,750
The gold watch.

444
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,340
Everyone revolves around me.

445
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,030
They cater to my every need

446
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,150
and take care of everything for me every day.

447
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,510
I don't need you.

448
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,130
So, this is the last time

449
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,360
I see you.

450
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,650
This is the last time we meet.

451
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,260
Thank you

452
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,580
for bringing me

453
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,960
all the sadness and fear.

454
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,730
Everything.

455
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,630
Here's to you.

456
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,580
Peng.

457
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,150
Peng.

458
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,860
By the way,

459
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,040
I forgot to answer your question.

460
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,580
I studied medicine because

461
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,400
someone used to get hurt a lot.

462
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,320
I thought when I became a doctor,

463
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,360
I could take better care of her.

464
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,380
Auntie.

465
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,140
Auntie.

466
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,120
What's wrong?

467
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,050
Auntie.

468
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,100
Wen Peng.

469
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,870
What are you trying to say now?

470
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,230
I know you've suffered a lot

471
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,630
all these years,

472
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,250
but she's your biological mother.

473
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,610
Be nice to her.

474
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,410
What are you doing?

475
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,900
Trying to lecture me?

476
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:22,890
I'm not.

477
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:24,670
It's just advice.

478
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,750
I'm afraid you'll regret it.

479
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,570
Regret?

480
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,750
Why are you and she appearing

481
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,060
in front of me at the same time?

482
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,110
Do you want to embarrass me

483
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,030
in front of Lu Yan?

484
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,760
You overthink.

485
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,210
Then, why did you show up?

486
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,970
She misses you.

487
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,490
I'm afraid she might be

488
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,870
in danger to be here.

489
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,700
Danger?

490
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,730
Am I that danger?

491
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,360
I didn't say it was you.

492
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,150
Arrest me.

493
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,670
Arrest…

494
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,220
Or not.

495
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,970
Jiang Chengyi.

496
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,170
Auntie passed out.

497
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,620
According to the test data,

498
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,720
there's nothing serious.

499
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,270
It's just her blood pressure is a little high.

500
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:34,950
Sir,

501
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,470
how was her blood pressure

502
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,210
before?

503
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,430
People at this age all have slightly high blood pressure. She's no exception.

504
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,920
But it has been quite stable.

505
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,190
Well then, it was because

506
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,390
she became too emotional.

507
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,590
It's fine. Just be careful.

508
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:45,980
Okay.

509
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,730
Ma'am.

510
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:49,960
Don't move.

511
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,020
You have an IV needle in your hand.

512
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,650
How do you feel now?

513
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,940
Does your head still hurt?

514
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,240
No.

515
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,300
Okay.

516
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,050
Tell us if you need anything.

517
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,790
Ma'am is awake.

518
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,610
I think

519
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,270
there's no problem now.

520
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,110
Keep an eye on her tonight.

521
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,590
If she has a headache

522
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,550
or feels sick,

523
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,720
let us know immediately.

524
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,440
Okay.

525
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,820
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

526
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,500
Lu,

527
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,640
call me if you need anything.

528
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,290
I'm leaving.

529
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,160
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

530
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,830
It's nothing.

531
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,540
Why am I in the hospital?

532
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,060
Auntie.

533
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,170
You fainted.

534
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:31,990
Chengyi.

535
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,640
Where is Wen Peng?

536
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,930
Don't think about these things for now.

537
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,510
Take good care of yourself first.

538
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,190
Don't get worked up again.

539
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,640
Did you...

540
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,770
Did you two fight?

541
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,990
Don't worry about that.

542
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,460
Take care of yourself.

543
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,170
Dad.

544
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,200
You stay here.

545
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,420
I'll go down and buy some drinks.

546
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,270
Okay, go ahead.

547
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,030
I'll go with you.

548
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,470
Have something warm to drink.

549
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,150
Jiang Chengyi,

550
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,360
if...

551
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,860
I mean if,

552
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,870
if Wen Peng is behind all this,

553
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,440
what will you do?

554
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,700
Do what I should do.

555
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,090
I can't compromise on this.

556
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,640
But Auntie will be very sad

557
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,960
with her health condition like that.

558
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,360
I hope she can understand me.

559
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,760
There's no other way.

560
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,480
Come on.

561
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,690
Stop crying.

562
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,730
Why are you laughing?

563
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,960
It just occurred to me

564
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,080
that twenty years ago,

565
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,620
there was a pretty girl

566
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,700
at Chengyi's after-school care.

567
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,890
She cried every day.

568
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,180
I was wondering

569
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,750
what exactly happened to her.

570
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,550
Why did she cry every day?

571
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,480
Why didn't she come to me,

572
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,470
a handsome

573
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,350
and righteous police officer,

574
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,530
and ask me to save her?

575
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,970
Narcissistic.

576
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,320
Even at such a young age,

577
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,110
Chengyi figured it out.

578
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,790

00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,190
You investigate normally.

772
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,760
It's getting some general information.

773
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,340
Everyone, listen up.

774
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,670
Let's call it a day.

775
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,110
What do you mean?

776
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:57,550
Nothing.

777
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,420

778
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,350
Okay.

779
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,010
You're wrapping up?

780
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,730
Let's call it a day, too.

781
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,640
But if

782
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,310
our work requires it,

783
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,590
we may come back tomorrow and the day after it.

784
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,150
I hope you'll welcome us, Mr. Wen.

785
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,140
No problem.

786
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:13,860
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

787
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,520
Thank you.

788
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,190
Wait.

789
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,100
Tell Captain Jiang

790
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,720
if he doesn't have any clues,

791
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,470
he can come to me.

792
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,290
I can help him.

793
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,400
Then, I can answer you

794
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,630
for Captain Jiang now.

795
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,490
No need.

796
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,050
I'm leaving. Bye.

797
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,490
Thank you.

798
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:52,690
Peng.

799
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,550
Peng.

800
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,650
Why did the police go to the set?

801
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:04,090
Jiang Chengyi sent someone to the set.

802
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,430
To investigate?

803
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,380
What can they investigate?

804
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,820
I don't know.

805
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,300
They said they were just investigating,

806
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,290
so I asked the crew to call it a day.

807
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,250
But they said

808
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,750
they would come back again

809
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,030
in the upcoming period.

810
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,310
Jiang Chengyi!

811
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,070
Jiang Chengyi is so annoying.

812
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,430
I think

813
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,070
during the time ahead,

814
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,510
the company will face a lot of trouble.

815
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,160
You did nothing wrong.

816
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,550
Why are they targeting you?

817
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,750
I did nothing wrong.

818
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,850
But have you ever thought that

819
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,630
you worked for my company?

820
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,830
Everything they do now

821
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,550
is

822
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,710
for revenge.

823
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,290
I'm sorry, Peng.

824
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,150
It's all my fault.

825
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,720
I've dragged you into this.

826
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:08,790
Alright.

827
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:09,960
Let's not talk about this.

Bofeng,

829
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,070
many things will happen in the future.

830
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,040

00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,070
I hope you can

834
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,220
discard the unpleasant thoughts.

835
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,060
Once all of this is over,

836
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,300
I'll find a chance

837
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:27,840
to give you a push.

838
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,390

no matter what.

842
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,830
Why can't you understand

843
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,750
what I'm talking about?

844
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,110
Don't you know

their approaches?

846
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,330
We are very passive now.

847
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,900
I don't want you to get involved again.

848
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,830
I'm not afraid of

849
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:53,790
anything now.

850
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,280
I don't care anymore!

851
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,960
Calm down.

852
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:57,950
Okay?

853
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,950
I understand how you feel.

854
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,040
But can you

855
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,590
stop stressing over things about

856
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,770
Jiang Chengyi and Yu Zheng?

857

has already implicated you…

860
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,480
Calm down.

861
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,170
Calm down.

862
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,960
Reason.

863
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,760
Be rational.

864
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,230
You just want to vent your anger, don't you?

865
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,670
Fine.

866
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,750
I'll find someone to teach them a lesson.

867

868
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:33,860

870
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,350

00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,240

Your health is more important.

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,880
I let Peng down.

982
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,670
To be honest,

983
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,430
all these years, I haven't spent one day

984
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,360
without thinking about him.

985
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,440
Watching you grow up every day,

986
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,930
I thought

987
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,640
if Peng

988
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,360

Chengyi

990
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:56,720
and as sensible as him?

991
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,540
If I knew this would happen,

992
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,600
no matter how hard it was,

993
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,820
I should have brought him along.

994
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,790
All these years have passed.

995
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,440
And he's an adult.

00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,350
Some things just can't be forced,

997
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,150
so don't try to push it.

998
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:27,900
Chengyi,

999
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,650
thank you for understanding me.

1001
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,500
fully empathize

1002
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,510
with these things.

1003
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,570
But I know

1004
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,580
you can't give up this kind of relationship.

1005
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,200
I understand.

1006
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,580
What's important is

1007
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,270
that you shouldn't overthink.

1008
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:58,210
Your health is the most important.

1009
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,120

Yan Mei?

1012
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:21,750
Yes, we found that

1013
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:22,670
she was treated by you

1014
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:23,730
for a while.

1015
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,200
So, we came here to find out more about it.

1016
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,290
I remember.

1017
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,730
She's my patient.

1018
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:34,310
Can you tell us

1019
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,190
what happened at that time?

1020
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,040
When Yan Mei was hospitalized,

1021
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,010
she was seriously ill.

1022
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,510
She needs dialysis every week.

1023
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,570
Do you remember

1024
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:45,510
who sent her

1025
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:46,650
to the hospital back then?

1026
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,370
No.

1027
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,460
She came alone.

1028
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,150
Every time she needed to be hospitalized,

1029
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,550
she came alone.

1030
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,520
So,

1031
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:55,310
I remembered her

1032
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:56,270
pretty clearly.

1033
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,110
But I remember she once said

1034
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,200
she had a daughter

1035
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,150
working in another city.

1036
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:04,710
Then what happened?

1037
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,960
She was here for treatment

1038
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:10,680
for half a year,

1039
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,640
but her condition had always been rather serious.

1040
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,390
I remember in the end,

1041
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,390
we also performed a resuscitation

1042
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:16,760

1043
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,610
Although she was saved,

1044
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,650
but

1045
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,470
she had to

1046
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:21,270
undergo a kidney transplant.

1047
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,780
In Yan Mei's case,

1048
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:26,980
there's no other way

1049
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,560
but to have a kidney transplant.

1050
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:29,600
But we understand her

1051

when she asked to be discharged.

1052
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:31,790
As far as big surgeries

1053
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:32,710
like kidney transplants are concerned,

1054
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,870
the cost

1055
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,000
is one issue,

1056
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:36,240
and finding a donor

1057
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,520
is another big problem.

1058
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,820
She had always been alone.

1059
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:40,820

1060
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,750
when she was hospitalized?

1061
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:42,900
Yes.

1062
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,230
She had a caretaker

1063
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:44,980
taking care of her.

1064
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,830
The caregiver was helping her

1065
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:47,900
with things like

1066
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,820
paying bills, nursing, and contacting her family.

1067
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,760
Is the caretaker still here?

1068
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,110
I don't know.

1069
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,100

1084

was very serious.

1093
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:28,990
I guess there were only two reasons

why she left the hospital.

1095

00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,790
You know.

1153
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:55,720
I told you

1154
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,110
we had no connection anymore.

1155
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,030
What did you say?

1156
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,850
No connection?

1157
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:07,870
Look at me and tell me.

1158
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,500
Who am I?

1159
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,920
Who am I?

1160
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,540
Let me tell you.

1161
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,790
I'm your dad.

1162
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,030
I'm your father!

1163
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,770
Do you know that blood is thicker than water?

1164
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:18,820
If you keep saying it,

1165
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,230
I'll sue you!

1166
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,400
Remember this, you punk.

1167
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,570
In this world,

1168
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,230
no one cares about you

1169
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,590
or likes you except me.

1170
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,330
Since you were little,

1171
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,720
no one has ever wanted you.

1172
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:36,340
You're right.

1173
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,570
We are the same.

1174
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:39,930
No one wants us.

1175
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,510
But I got to where I am today

1176
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:44,590
because of you.

1177
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,500
And you are what you are

1178
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,980
because of your incompetence.

1179
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,900
Say it again.

1180
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,890
I said you were incompetent.

1181
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,150
That's why you

1182
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,380
ended up being betrayed by all.

1183
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,920
Brat,

1184
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,360
I think your skin is itching.

1185
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,230
Right?

1186
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,280
I...

1187
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,040
I met my mom a few days ago.

1188
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,240
Who did you see?

1189
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,300
Your mother?

1190
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,250
Where did you see her?

1191
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,220
What is she doing?

1192
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,140
How is she now?

1193
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:16,190
Tell me!

1194
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,190
She is in Ninghai right now.

1195
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,280
She remarried.

1196
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:21,040
She is very happy.

1197
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,550
Her husband is a police officer.

1198
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,830
So is her son.

1199
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,540
She looks a dozen years

1200
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,150
younger than you.

1201
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:34,120
She also said,

1202
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:37,220
thankfully, she left you,

1203
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,810
which helped her escape from suffering.

1204
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:42,690
If she sees you now,

1205
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:44,080
or thinks of you,

1206
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,280
it will make her sick.

1207
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:00,390
I...

1208
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:10,040
It's useless for you to act crazy now.

1209
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,440
Look at my mom.

1210
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,860
Look at me.

1211
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:15,050
Look at you.

1212
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,710
Everyone leaves you

1213
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:18,390
becomes…

1214
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,150
becomes very happy.

1215
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:22,560
So...

1216
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:25,370
So, you and I...

1217
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,240
who is the thing that no one wants?

1218
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:33,130
I really...

1219
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:34,070
I'll kill you!

1220
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:37,990
I'll kill you!

1221
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:38,730
Don't hit me!

1222
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:41,110
Help!

1223
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:41,730
I...

1224
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:42,900
Help!
