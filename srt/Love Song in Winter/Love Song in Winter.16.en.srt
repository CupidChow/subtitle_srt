Jing.

5
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,060
Have you seen Wang Qiang?

6
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,880
Yes.

7
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,830
Then why didn't you contact me?

8
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,350
Jing, didn't you say...

9
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,940
I should wait for you to contact me

10
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,750
for matters regarding Wang Qiang?

11
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:20,870
Cut the crap.

12
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,790
What did he say?

13
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,190
He said...

14
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,670
to wait a little more.

15
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,810
To wait a little more?

16
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,380
How long have we been waiting?

17
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,910
I don't know.

18
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,020
He said...

19
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,940
things are tense lately,

20
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,450
so it's difficult to get done.

21
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,670
Difficult to get done?

22
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,800
Or is it difficult to get done because there's not enough money?

23
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,910
Tell him

24
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,350
I’ll give him how ever much he wants.

25
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,940
Get him to deal with Lu Yan as soon as possible.

26
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,860
Jing.

27
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,090
How about...

28
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,390
you don't get Wang Qiang

29
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,740
to go after Lu Yan?

30
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,550
What do you mean?

31
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,980
I...I...

32
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,290
I didn't mean that.

33
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,260
What I mean is,

34
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,580
we've been classmates for so many years.

35
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,010
We are friends.

36
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,780
By doing this,

37
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,820
what will happen if the police caught Wang Qiang?

38
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,630
I don’t like it

39
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,260
when others teach me how to do things.

40
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,230
Jing.

41
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,370
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,579
That's not what I meant.

43
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,320
Jing, I'm sorry.

44
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,300
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,579
Aren't you my good friend?

46
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,450
If I go to jail,

47
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,870
wouldn't you come with me?

48
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,930
Why are my new shoes dirty again?

49
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,700
How despicable.

[Anshan, Ninghai Public Security
Criminal Investigation Unit]

51
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,240
From pretending to be Deng Man,

52
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,530
and then Wang Qianqian,

53
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,850
[Deng Man] [Wang Qianqian] [Chanson Artificial Lake]

54
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,650
and then dying in the same lake as Deng Man.

55
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,210
Then we have Wang Qiang,

56
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,030
who has been stalking, taking photos secretly,

57
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,930
[Ding Jing] [Lu Yan]

58
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,040
and even attempted rape.

59
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,230
All these incidents

60
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,990
point back to Lu Yan.

61
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,010
So now,

62
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,190
the prime suspect

63
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,200
is Ding Jing.

64
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,310
It's pretty obvious

65
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,340
that it was Ding Jing who

66
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,210
asked Wang Qiang to

67
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,350
take photos of Lu Yan secretly.

68
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,230
What I can't figure out now is

69
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,750
what is the mastermind's purpose

70
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,810
behind Wang Qianqian's murder?

71
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,890
Why?

72
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,130
Look.

73
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,610
There is a clear motive and purpose

74
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,270
to kill Wang Qianqian.

75
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,850
It's to bring Lu Yan

76
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,980
[Ding Jing] [Lu Yan]

77
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,830
back to the fear she felt at the time.

78
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,660
Consistently

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,550
and repeatedly,

80
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,650
they kept bringing her more pain

81
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,470
and regret.

82
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,890
If we consider Wang Qiang,

83
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,060
his methods are very straightforward.

84
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,140
Secretly taking photos,

85
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,620
and stalking.

86
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,840
His purpose

87
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,640
is to physically hurt Lu Yan

88
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,830
and also tarnish Lu Yan's reputation.

89
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,990
It seems that their modus operandi

90
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,350
is completely different.

91
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,950
So, you believe that

92
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,320
the criminal motives

93
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,550
behind these two cases

94
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,430
are completely different?

95
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,050
Yes.

96
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,370
I don't think so.

97
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,610
Ding Jing's personality is flawed.

98
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,540
If she can order Wang Qiang to hurt Lu Yan,

99
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,500
she can also get others to do the same.

100
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,700
You are college alumni, right?

101
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,280
This proves

102
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,150
she knows

103
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,230
about Deng Man's suicide.

104
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,310
And Ding Jing

105
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,360
definitely can afford

106
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,390
to hire a hitman.

107
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,850
As I recall, information showed that

108
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,600
after Deng Man's accident,

109
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,940
Ding Jing went abroad.

110
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,430
By the way,

111
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,730
what about Liu Yujie?

112
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,620
Is she aware of Ding Jing's

113
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,409
actions?

114
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,670
Wang Qiang

115
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,810
was

116
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,210
introduced to Ding Jing

117
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,670
by Liu Yujie.

118
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,210
But it was only much later

119
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,910
when she found out what Ding Jing

120
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,100
asked Wang Qiang to do.

121
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,830
What about Wang Qiang?

122
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,400
I interrogated Wang Qiang.

123
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,570
He’s a voyeuristic photographer

124
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,960
who sells photos of girls.

125
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,130
Looking at the way he acts,

126
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,350
he's unlikely to be a killer.

127
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,940
If it was Ding Jing who ordered Wang Qiang

128
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,070
to hurt Lu Yan

129
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,630
and kill Wang Qianqian,

130
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,690
it indeed does not add up.

131
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,960
Ding Jing can definitely afford

132
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,880
to hire a hitman to commit the crime.

133
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:40,950
Why would she find

134
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,909
someone like Wang Qiang?

135
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,150
His counter-investigation skills are weak,

136
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,430
and he's easily discovered.

137
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,790
Wouldn't this make it even easier

138
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,590
to expose herself,

139
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:48,570
no?

140
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,680
So,

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,820
Ding Jing is not the only person

142
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,940
who is targeting

143
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,980
Lu Yan.

144
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,310
If so, how are they related?

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,460
That I don't know.

146
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,010
But this person

147
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,780
is much smarter than Ding Jing.

148
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,500
Lu.

149
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,340
Xiaoman's surgery time is confirmed.

150
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,890
It's the day after tomorrow at 2 p.m.

151
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,750
I have also informed her family.

152
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,550
But Mrs. Lin

153
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,950
still looks very worried.

154
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,510
Actually, this is not a major surgery.

155
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,870
It's just that Xiaoman's mood has been poor.

156
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,700
Keep an eye on her for the next two days.

157
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,909
Don't worry.

158
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,070
Mood is one of the

159
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,310
important indications for surgery.

160
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,510
Don't worry.

161
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,930
I'll continue to talk to them.

162
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,830
Thank you.

163
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,750
You're now off duty.

164
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,430
Don't just zone out here

165
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,070
all by yourself.

166
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,950
Go home now.

167
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,270
Are you working the night shift today?

168
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,510
Well, I'm single.

169
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,840
The night shift specialist

170
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:54,810
has to be me.

171
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,320
Bye.

172
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,690
You still have work to do?

173
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,700
It's nothing.

174
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,230
Do you know some celebrity

175
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,950
named Yu Bofeng?

176
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,240
I don't know what's wrong with him,

177
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,710
but he has been insistent on learning criminal psychology from me.

178
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,800
He calls me every day.

179
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,610
Senior.

180
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,270
Senior!

181
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,440
Someone found a female tenant

182
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,630
in the suburbs of Xishan

183
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,270
who looks very similar to the murderer of

184
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:36,980
Wang Qianqian.

185
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,120
Bring a team. Let's go.

186
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,669
Go.

187
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,070
I won't go with you all.

188
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:40,770
Yes, don't come.

189
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,520
I'm leaving.

190
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,000
After all this time, you’re not even going to buy me a meal?

191
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,060
Order takeout.

192
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,100
I'll reimburse it for you.

Great. One more.

Mr. Yu Bofeng,

206
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,710
why did you agree to

207
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,780
this endorsement?

208
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,030
Because I was already

209
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,590
familiar with this brand.

210
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,670
Hello, Jing.

Liu Yujie, where have you been?

212
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,450

Where are you?

215
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,570
I'm in the dressing room upstairs.

Come up.

217
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,830
Okay, I'm coming.

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,810

Why are you so clumsy?

223
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,850
What did Wang Qiang say?

224
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,270
He asked me to ask you,

225
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,330
besides taking naked photos of Lu Yan,

226
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,870
is there anything else

227
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,010
you want to do to her?

228
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,860
If there are any,

229
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,950
it's a separate charge.

230
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,370
Tell Wang Qiang

231
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,000
he just needs to deal with Lu Yan.

232
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,530
The rest is up to him.

233
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,610
I have plenty of money,

234
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,730
and I only care about the result.

235
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,310
Okay.

236
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,680
Just deal with Lu Yan.

237
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,890
Don't worry.

This residential environment

246
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,860

252
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,310
there's a tenant that came in this afternoon

253
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,100
who looks very similar to our portrait.

254
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,650
Which unit?

255
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,510

256

257
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,860
Have you checked her identity?

258
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,060
Yes, it's a fake identity.

259
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,140
What's wrong, Senior?

260
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,050
Don't you want to go in and get a feel?

261
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,710
No need.

262
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,960
Watch over here.

264
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,360
Okay.

265
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,020
Copy that.

266
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,090
Mr. Wen,

267
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,960
when will you give us a chance?

268
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,450
There are so many artists in your company.

269
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,670
You can give both our companies

270
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,950
more endorsements.

271
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,790
Our companies are also well-established.

272
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,480
Sounds great.

273
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,820
I'll get my staff

274
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,670
to liaise with you.

275
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,290
Okay.

276
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,020
Look.

277
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,520
We owe it to Mr. Wen's favor.

278
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,330
Mr. Wen,

279
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,510
if we collaborate,

280
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,660
we’re willing to explore new avenues.

281
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,480
Okay.

282
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,750
I have faith in you.

283
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,720
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

284
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,940
What’s the conversation about? You seem so happy.

285
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,710
Jing is here.

286
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,010
We were hoping to leverage

287
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,930
your influence

288
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,270
to collaborate more with Mr. Wen.

289
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,820
Yes.

290
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,170
Please take care of us.

291
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,360
The two of us

292
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,200
bought a good amount

293
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,360
of your company's porcelain today.

294
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,060
Really?

295
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,930
How supportive.

296
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,730
No problem then.

297
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,480
But you can't

298
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,650
take my brand ambassador.

299
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,550
Okay.

300
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,290
You guys continue.

301
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,980
We'll go over there and say hello.

302
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,930
Okay, go ahead.

303
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,610
Okay.

304
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,350
See you, Mr. Liu.

305
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:03,980
Bye.

306
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,990
Bofeng is so handsome today.

307
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,810
Thank you, Ms. Ding.

308
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,190
You look great today, Ms. Ding.

309
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,040
Thank you.

310
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,970
We are very happy to work with you.

311
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,200
Looking forward to a long-term collaboration.

312
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,400
Well, I think you should thank

313
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,590
my boss, Mr. Wen, for this collaboration.

314
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,760
He is my boss.

315
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,180
He has the final say.

316
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,450
It has nothing to do with me.

317
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,740
We only look at two factors.

318
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,930
One is the product's legitimacy,

319
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,070
and the other,

320
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,920
is money.

321
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,580
What a coincidence.

322
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,410
I have both.

323
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,880
Cheers to a pleasant partnership.

324
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,600
Cheers.

325
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,240
What projects has Bofeng been working on lately?

326
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,600
There has been three or four productions.

327
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,680
Among which, there's one

328
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,940
which I especially liked.

329
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,420
I asked Mr. Wen to help me

330
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,430
get the role.

331
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,080
The key is in his effort.

332
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,760
-Wen!
-I’m rather curious...

333
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,800
Tang Jie.

334
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,670
Tang Jie is here too.

335
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,960
Ms. Ding has put on

336
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,150
quite a show here.

337
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,790
Of course I must come.

338
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,030
What's up?

339
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,080
You don't welcome me?

340
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,490
How could that be?

341
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,790
We welcome you, of course.

342
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,710
I know you love to be part of the action.

343
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,290
Weren't you just like this in school?

344
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,790
What do you mean?

345
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,920
I don't understand.

346
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,690
Have you forgotten?

347
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,200
Don’t you remember how you

348
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,340
followed Jiang Chengyi

349
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,830
and Lu Yan around,

350
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,530
becoming their third wheel?

351
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,580
Their third wheel?

352
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:21,950
Yes.

353
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,790
But I think

354
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,730
being a third wheel

355
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,710
is better than being a bootlicker.

356
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,050
Some people are really something.

357
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,250
They've been sucking up for 8 years,

358
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,630
but are somehow not tired of it.

359
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,240
Indeed.

360
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,900
Who are you talking about?

361
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,440
I'm talking about whoever's talking to me.

362
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,350
Ms. Ding.

363
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,910
The signing ceremony is about to begin.

364
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:41,490
Got it.

365
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,210
I'm feeling good today,

366
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,950
so I'll let it slide this time.

367
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,030
What was that?

368
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,400
Tang Jie.

369
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,470
Have you seen Lu Yan?

370
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,350
Lu Yan didn't say she was coming, did she?

371
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,190
I have no idea.

372
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,390
She's the one

373
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,590
who asked me for an invitation.

374
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,570
She said she would come.

375
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,270
Maybe she had an urgent case to see to?

376
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,250
I'll give her a call to ask.

377
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,450
No need.

378
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,690
No need.

379
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,200
Let's go over first.

380
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,030
Wen.

381
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,360
Can I take a photo

382
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,680
with Mr. Yu Bofeng?

383
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,290
Sure.

384
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,780
Let's take a selfie.

385
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,120
Come.

386
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:19,510
Okay.

387
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,710
So handsome!

388
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,310
Thank you.

389
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,490
Come with me to check out the main stage.

390
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,470
Next, we'll have the signing ceremony.

391
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,030
-Great!
-Yes!

[Signing Ceremony of Boya Porcelain's Spokesperson, Yu Bofeng]

393
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,660
The signing ceremony had successfully concluded!

394
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,570
Wishing us a pleasant partnership.

395
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,480
Same here.

396
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,750
Kindly have a commemorative photo.

397
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,270
Let's welcome

the organizer

399
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,130
of this exchange conference,

400
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,050
the founder of Boya Porcelain,

401
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,050
Ms. Ding Jing,

402
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,160
to give a speech!

403
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,270
Let's give her a round of applause!

404
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,880
Great!

405
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,790
Thank you, thank you.

406
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,150
Thank you, everybody.

407
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,430
I deeply appreciate

408
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,450
everyone's support for this conference.

409
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,790
For the past six years...

410
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,590
I'm sorry.

411
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,720
A little hiccup.

412
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,160
Over the past six years,

413
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,870
our company has been dedicated to

414
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,540
establishing a porcelain brand that represents

415
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,480
a fresh take on traditional Chinese styles.

416
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,240
We hope to

417
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,640
attract more young people

418
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,000
to like porcelain,

419
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,150
and fall in love with porcelain.

420
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,150
Today, our company

421
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,750
has a big announcement to make.

422
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,119
We've finally signed

423
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,480
Mr. Yu Bofeng on.

424
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,630
-Great! 
-Nice!

425
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,630
We'd also like to thank Mr. Wen

426
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,540
for supporting our company over the years.

427
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,220
Next,

428
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,710
I would like to invite everyone

429
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,420
to join me in enjoying

430
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,290
our first promotional video.

431

[Ninghai International Cultural and Artwork Exchange Conference]

432
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,430
Let go of me!

433
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,240
I have no idea

434
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,460
what you're talking about.

435
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,660
Jing.

436
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,390
Are we

437
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,280
being followed?

438
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,510
Should we call the police?

439
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,360
What should we do, Jing?

440
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,640
Nonsense!

441
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,950
Ms. Ding is actually a bully.

442
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,220
That's right.

443
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,850
T-Turn it off!

444
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,800
What are you doing?

445
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,550
How can you work with someone like that?

446
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,560
Yes.

447
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,320
I'm so sorry.

448
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,510
There must be a misunderstanding.

449
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,240
Stop looking.

450
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,030
It's a waste of time.

451
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,470
I'll just tell you, alright?

452
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,670
Yes, I did bully her.

453
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:21,780
So what?

454
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,000
She washed my clothes

455
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,600
and shoes,

456
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,840
and had even knelt down before me.

457
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,760
That's because she's timid

458
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,320
and incompetent.

459
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,170
She's a coward!

460
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,370
What does it have to do with me?

461
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,400
Let me tell you one last time.

462
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,000
Her death has nothing to do with me.

463
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,640
She brought it on herself.

464
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,290
Lu Yan.

465
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,870
Has it ever occurred to you

466
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,380
that you're a jinx?

467
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,710
Has anyone around you

468
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,120
ever met a good end?

469
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,680
I honestly think that,

470
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,830
if it were up to me,

471
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,900
your death would be the best outcome for everyone.

472
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,170
Ding Jing.

473
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,100
Yes, I did bully her.

474
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,260
So what?

475
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,390
Ding Jing, you bastard!

476
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,860
I'll get even with her now.

477
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,510
No.

478
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,690
Don't be so anxious.

479
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,550
I have a plan

480
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,390
that I could use your help with.

481
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,030
Tell me.

482
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,010
I will do anything as long as

483
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,610
she gets punished.

484
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,030
She washed my clothes

485
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,610
and shoes,

486
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,650
and had even knelt down before me.

487
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,900
That's because she's timid

488
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,590
and incompetent.

489
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,460
She's a coward!

490
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,650
What does it have to do with me?

491
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,620
Liu Yujie.

492
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,630
I want to speak to you regarding

493
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,850
Deng Man's incident.

494
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,250
Do you realize now

495
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,530
that you're on your own?

496
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,350
You know very well

497
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,510
what kind of person Ding Jing is.

498
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,440
If you're going to

499
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,430
continue being like this,

500
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,540
no one can help you.

501
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,130
You'll get involved too.

502
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,640
Actually,

503
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,250
Jiang Chengyi came to see me before.

504
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,110
He...

505
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,260
He came to see you?

506
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,660
The incidents involving

507
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,160
Wang Qiang stalking

508
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,490
and photographing you

509
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,570
were on the orders of Ding Jing.

510
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,310
Can you do me a favor?

511
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,790
I'll tell you what to do.

512
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,570
I got the recording.

513
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,960
Give it to Jiang Chengyi.

514
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,860
It will prove your innocence.

515
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,560
A-Aren't you leaving?

516
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,560
I...

517
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,730
I have something else to do.

518
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,400
Thank you.

519
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,000
Dalu.

520
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,540
How is it?

521
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,480
The backstage crew is all on our side.

522
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:03,950
Don't worry.

523
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,590
No one can come in.

524
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,910
It's done.

525
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,030
Lu Yan, what are you doing?

526
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,190
I want you to pay the price.

527
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,590
You bullied your classmates

528
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,790
and drove your friend to death.

529
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,030
You did so many bad things.

530
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,410
How do you even sleep at night?

531
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,230
You even hired someone to stalk me

532
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,150
and take photos of me.

533
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,900
Don't talk nonsense.

534
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,170
Don't you slander me!

535
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,670
All of you saw it, right?

536
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,770
It's all on the screen.

537
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,520
Why are you still making excuses?

538
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,990
Today, I'll let everyone know

539
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,530
what kind of person you are.

540
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,750
A slap is nothing compared to what you deserve.

541
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,800
If I had known

542
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,830
you had been bullying Deng Man,

543
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,730
I'd have torn your mouth apart.

544
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,690
Stop shooting!

545
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,800
What are you shooting?

546
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:18,870
Don't...

547
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:19,700
Don't hit him! Watch out!

548
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,670
Watch out.

549
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,030
Ms. Ding.

550
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,130
I'm sorry.

551
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,930
As per the contract,

552
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,710
it’s you who have violated the terms.

553
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,630
Stop!

554
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,710
Hold her down!

555
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,550
I've got her!

556
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,440
Get up.

557
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,430
Take off your hat.

558
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,330
Take off your mask.

559
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,790
What's your name?

560
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,250
He's asking you. What’s your name?

561
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,600
Zhou Fang.

562
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,780
What’s this?

563
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,140
Captain Jiang.

564
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,340
I've searched the room.

565
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,450
She's a dealer who specializes

566
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,710
in selling antiques.

567
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,510
Is this yours?

568
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,290
Yes.

569
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,070
Yes?

570
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,040
Okay.

571
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,990
Take her back.

572
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,710
Let's go.

573
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,260
Sihan,

574
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,970

575
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,420
try to verify it first.

576
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,470
Got it, Yue.

577
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,320
Fortunately, we've found something that

578
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,590
could be of help to other departments.

579
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,590
What's wrong, Senior?

580
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,170
Send this case back to the station,

581
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:17,950
and then go home.

582
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,020
We're done here.

583
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,510
Let's go.

584
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,730
Let's go.

585
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,940
I've never seen something this expensive before.

586
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,700
You're leaving, Senior?

587
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,250
Bye.

Are you home?

589
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,260
That was gratifying.

590
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,390
I feel great!

591
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,170
Today, the two of us

592
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,450
worked hand in hand

593
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,780
to deliver justice.

594
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,390
Indeed.

595
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,590
Looking at what you did back there,

596
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,870
you were really something.

597
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,750
You scared me.

598
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,060
I even felt that the slap was delivered late.

599
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,790
I should have slapped her back then.

600
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,180
The recording...

601
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,710
have you handled it?

602
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,190
Yes.

603
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,240
I don't want too many people to know that

604
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,020
Man was bullied.

605
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,430
Indeed.

606
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,230
She's already gone.

607
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,470
Let's not make any more accusations.

608
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,340
Lu Yan.

609
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,590
If Man knows

610
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,980
you did this for her,

611
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,330
I'm sure she'll be very pleased.

612
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,240
Don’t tell Dazhong and Jiang Chengyi

613
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,350
about what happened today.

614
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,400
Why?

615
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,280
My evidence collection process

616
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,710
was especially inappropriate.

617
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,300
Just like what Ding Jing did to me,

618
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,470
I also stalked her

619
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,440
and threatened her.

620
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,310
How could that be the same?

621
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,360
You're trying to get

622
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,350
justice for Man.

623
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,350
Actually, at that time,

624
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,240
it's because I only had Deng Man's

625
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,350
Weibo's secondary account.

626
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,350
Even if I had showed that

627
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,820
to the police,

628
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,250
they wouldn't handle it.

629
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,750
I was left with no choice.

630
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,850
But...

631
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,130
it's all for Deng Man.

632
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,320
I remember Jiang Chengyi

633
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,470
always used to say,

634
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,290
"A just outcome

635
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,220
achieved through unjust means

636
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,950
is not true justice."

637
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,060
That's true.

638
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,240
What I did in this case was wrong.

639
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,790
Huh? What?

640
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,520
I don't understand.

641
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:41,980
No.

642
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,960
I only know

643
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,230
Ding Jing bullied Deng Man,

644
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,560
so she has to pay the price.

645
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,650
However, I can keep it a secret.

646
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,110
But there's something

647
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,240
I don't understand.

648
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,090
You see, even if Man was introverted,

649
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,310
it's not to the extent that

650
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,950
she would kneel down to Ding Jing.

651
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,860
Indeed.

652
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,130
Even if Man likes Jiang Chengyi,

653
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,110
Ding Jing couldn't possibly

654
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,190
threaten her like this.

655
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,270
Could it be...

656
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,060
Man had other secrets?

657
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:21,810
Ding Jing.

658
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,910
What are you doing?

659
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,870
