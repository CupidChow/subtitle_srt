530
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,630
Please just this once.

531
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:01,380
S-She has a scar!

532
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,720
Wait, but her left hand?

533
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,310
The hand that held me was her right hand.

534
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:08,550
Well, if you put a fingerprint on this, most of the papers will be taken care of.

535
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,750
What are you doing?

536
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,360
Fingerprints are supposed to be from the right hand, right?

537
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,810
Yes.

538
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:50,430
Good.

539
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,290
But Ma'am,

540
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:56,820
this...

541
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:01,330
Your fingerprint doesn't seem to appear.

542
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:08,250
I worked such harsh jobs... so my fingerprints are worn out.

543
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,870
Such is my life.

544
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,110
I can't confirm in this case.

545
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:22,590
What is this?

546
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,700
Am I the only one who thinks it's strange?

547
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:28,830
Did you do this?

548
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:32,850
What? Were you going to compare it with my ID file after getting my fingerprints?

549
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,120
No... It's just...

550
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,480
Are you doing this because I'm not giving you the money?

551
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,960
Is that why you're doing this?

552
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,230
How are you related?

553
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:50,750
Seeing as how you two keep hanging out with each other.

554
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,700
It hasn't even been that long since your husband died, and you two are hooking up.

555
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,370
What are you saying?

556
00:47:56,370 --> 00:48:01,220
What do you mean "what am I saying?" You two are working together to frame me!

557
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,370
That's right.

558
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:06,810
To be honest, I don't trust you.

559
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,640
I wanted to check at least.

560
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,950
If you can't get the fingerprint, try doing a DNA test!

561
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:23,870
Did you say you cremated him, and you cleaned up all his belonging?

562
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,500
Then you probably don't even have DNA to compare it to.

563
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:55,060
Ma'am, when you fainted,

564
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,210
the blood tested positive for pregnancy.

565
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,070
E-Excuse me?

566
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,550
You're pregnant.

567
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:06,160
It's been three months. Did you not know?

568
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,300
First of all, you have to rest

569
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,900
and make sure you visit the gynecologist before you leave.

570
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,280
I was told I had fertility problems.

571
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,610
I was told it would be hard for me to get pregnant.

572
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,330
Just as misfortune comes when you least expect it,

573
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:31,300
miracles can happen when you least expect it as well.

574
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:56,260
If I'm pregnant, couldn't I use the fetus' DNA to compare it with hers?

575
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,110
No.

576
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:02,640
According to the Bioethics Protection Act, it's not possible to test the fetus.

577
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,080
It has to be ordered overseas, but that could be dangerous to the fetus.

578
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,270
Sister-in-law, this might not be safe for the baby.

579
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:13,410
Well, then I won't do it.

580
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,010
Hey!

581
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:17,840
What's going on between you two?

582
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,100
A child? Child!? Are you saying that child is Byeong Cheol's?

583
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,520
I'm asking what's the relationship between you two!

584
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,830
That child is not my Byeong Cheol's, is it?

585
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,330
Hey, where are you going?

586
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,550
Don't follow us.

587
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,550
I know you're a fraud.

588
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,190
I will reveal it.

589
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,940

I'm Kim Hyeon Mi!

591
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,960
I'm the mother of Kim Byeong Cheol!

592
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,150
I don't need the insurance money.

593
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,980
I don't want to be involved with that person anymore either.

594
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,810
I can't put my child in danger.

595
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,320
Is this how things are going to end?

596
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:13,620
The fact that she has a scar on both hands is evidence that she's a fake.

597
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,700
A fraud is someone who can do anything.

598
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,740
Is there really nothing we can do?

599
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:29,250
In two days, that fraud will be taking all the money.

600
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,650
We...

601
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,770
should do what we're supposed to.

602
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:37,110
He asked us to put in a bathtub.

603
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:39,370
That's what Byeong Cheol wants.

604
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,440
At least there's something we can do.

605
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,870
I'm glad you exist.

606
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,930

607

608

You say it's because of money,

609
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,960
but I'm grateful.

00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,700

Come on, it's you and me! We're not online friends or anything.

Are you disappointed with how things turned out?

If So Yeon got that money, she could've moved to a better house.

and due to that, you have no right to receive the insurance money.

This insurance money, once Mr. Kim Byeong Cheol's biological son is born, and after a DNA test,

00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:54,730
will be rewarded to his wife, Mrs. Park So Yeon.

00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:55,840
♫ I'll tell you honestly ♫

707
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:59,430
♫ I need you ♫

708
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,870
♫ You appear and disappear ♫

709
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:12,240
♫ I'm curious about you. I'm curious about you ♫

[Delivery Man]

711
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,400
You said that this taxi belonged to your mother. I have your mother's hair tie.

712
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,120
I can't get away from this taxi.

713
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:25,050
A taxi and a ghost. A taxi that has a ghost stuck to it. I'll hear your concerns.

714
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:28,750
She has to go away for you to get customers, not see ghosts, and make money!

715
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,520
Mister Driver, I don't feel good.
♫ Our relationship makes no sense ♫

716
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,400
Excuse me?
♫ If it's destiny ♫

717
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,870
Gangneung? Chuncheon? Why do I care?
♫ I'll tell you honestly ♫

718
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:42,020
It's good that she's gone. I'm sick of ghosts.

719
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:46,350
It's for the better.
♫ I need you ♫
