This is a strange place to meet again.

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,380
Why did you insist on driving yourself? You should've just taken a taxi.

188
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,860
Why would I take another taxi when I'm already a taxi driver?

189

- Don't overreact.
- Mr. Seo Yeong Min, are you an idiot?

Why would you jump in front of a baseball bat?

191

What if you got hit in the head?

192
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,570
It's better than the cellphone breaking.

194
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,670

200
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:34,750
- Yes, it's fine. I've practiced.
- Practice?

201
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:40,430
So I can drive with one hand while holding my girlfriend's hand.

Yes, didn't you say they attended a party somewhere?

00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,000
She said she attends the annual psychological symposium.

I hope you get the care you need.

Is your grandmother still taking her medicine regularly?

236
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,620
Taking medicine regularly is the most important thing for diabetes.

- You know that, right?
- Yes. I'm taking good care of that.

I don't think Ha Yul's situation is a simple runaway case.

I heard that they were all arrested by the police. What should we do?

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,400
The police already think it was a suicide.

351
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,930
Mi Ra and the other kids are mean, but they're also clever.

352
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,920
Then what? Do we just watch?

353
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,750
We only have circumstantial evidence, it's no good.

354
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,340
It's our country's law that they can't do anything unless there's a body.

355
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,270
You're going to make your arm worse.

356
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,080
I told you to bring it no matter what!

357
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,180
Hey, Choi Mi Ra!

358
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,610
Yun Ga Eun, have you finally lost it?

359
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,900
If you want to buy cigarettes, buy it yourself, and don't beg others for it.

360
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,330
Beg? Did you say beg?

361
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,780
What else would you call it?

362
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,370
You're just a loser who bullies other people!

363
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,940
- Are you crazy?
- Get lost!

364
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,750
Next time, I'll pour hot coffee on you.

365
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:01,260
To tell you the truth, that day...

366
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,560
Stop it! What are you doing?

367
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,420
Did you come all this way to save her?

368
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,770
Your friendship must be great.

369
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,950
Ga Eun, are you okay?

370
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,490
Seriously, stop it.

371
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,270
Do you want the school's violence committee to look into this?

372
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:27,290
I don't know, Ga Eun won't report us.

373
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:31,630
If Ga Eun doesn't, I will, so don't worry.

374
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,320
Who do you think you are? What makes you so great?

375
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,250
You're just a kisengsu! Why are you acting so proudly?
(T/N: Shortened version meaning a welfare recipient.)

376
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,300
That's right. I'm just a kisengsu.

377
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,000
Then why can't you beat me?

378
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,150
Why do you look more pathetic than I do?

379
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,990

380
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,030

No.

388

If you say what happened here today,

389
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,180
I'm going to make you all look like that.

390
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,710
So shut your mouth!

391
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,590
What are you doing? Cover her!

392
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,610
I couldn't do anything.

393
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,010
I'll turn myself in after we find Ha Yul.

394
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,650
I'll report all the other kids, too.

395
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:44,240
Please... get Ha Yul out of the mountains.

396

I think she's at her mental limit.

401
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,260
Ga Eun, I don't think this will work.

402
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,880
You said we just need to go a little further after the end of the stairs, right?

403
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,170
Yes.

404

414
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,030
If Ha Yul is really dead, she wouldn't have been able to pass on because of Mi Ra.

415
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,820
Seeing that Ha Yul still hasn't appeared...

416
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,250
Could she...

417
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,060
Ha Yul...

418
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,710
may still be alive.

419
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:32,890
I can't tell where Ga Eun was talking about.

420
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,100
It's too dark.

421
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,810

00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,830
Yes, I know him.

531
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:34,910
My colleague said that they have suspicious information that pertains to him.

532
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:39,420
Try calling. I'll give you their number.

533
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,990
Okay, thank you.

534
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,590
What did the chief say?

535
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,610
That's strange.

536
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,370
Why did he mention a guy?

537
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,720
Hey, it was you, wasn't it? You snitched, right?

538
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,520
Let go.

539
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,110
Do you think this will be the end?

540
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:12,140
I know what's behind that hypocritical mask.

541
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,470
There's a saying that it takes one to know one.

542
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:25,580
- You bastard–
- Doctor!

543
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,190
What are you doing?

544
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,640
I'm going to call the security.

545
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,100
You be careful, too.

546
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:45,320
Dr. Do, what did he do to you?

547
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,660
What if he's dangerous?

548
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,860
I'll take you home.

549
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,790
You will?

550
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,980
Not the opposite?

551
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,600
Yes.

552
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,640
Do you want to have dinner with me today?

553
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,860
Dinner?

554
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,570
I'd like that.

555
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,210
[On Air]

556
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:13,410
Let's listen to the next story.

557
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:18,320
"Hello, I'm Choi Ha Jun from class 3-1 at Yoonbyeol Elementary School."

558
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,050
I'm going to introduce a taxi driver today.

559
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:25,530
"When my sister disappeared, everyone said she ran away,"

560
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:30,740
"but Hyung Yeong Min believed me and tried his best to find her."

561
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:34,490
"If he found my sister who fell in the mountains even ten minutes later,"

562
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:38,380
"I was told I would not have been able to see her again."

563
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,890
"Seoul 20 Ba 8255."

564
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:44,430
"Hyung Yeong Min, thank you so much."

565
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:50,880
Now, what's the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word "taxi"?

566
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,940
It may not be something positive.

567
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,700
However, there are taxi drivers like this.

568
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:02,140
Drivers who drop people off for picnics once a month who can't go on their own,

569
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:06,280
drivers who take pregnant women to the hospital in the place of an ambulance,

570
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,090
and drivers who drive their mother with Alzheimer's. They are normal people, just like us.

571
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:16,560
Don't you think these taxis are the taxis that deliver happiness?

572
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,360
She said we "deliver happiness."

573
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,220
We earn money and deliver happiness to people.

574
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,240
That's true.

575
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,220
What's your wish, Mister Driver?

576
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,830
My wish?

577
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,260
Yes.

578
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:38,040
Up until now, you've worked hard granting wishes for the ghosts.

579
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,120
Mister driver of the wish-granting taxi.

580
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,640
Mister Driver Seo Yeong Min.

581
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,800
What's your wish?

582
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,120
I'll grant all of it.

583
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,510
How about you? Don't you have any wishes?

584
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:06,600
Why? Will you grant them?

585
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,820
I have many.

586
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:19,440
♫  Welcome, nice to meet you, a flower that you are, a dream that you are  ♫

587

588
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,140

589
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,920
You said sleeping in a soft bed is your wish.

I even changed the bedding.

That's not kind of you to say.

I'll accept it since you put in so much work.

594
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,300

The space between the seats,

613
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:38,970
I also bought a lemon scented air freshener, because I thought it'd suit you.

614
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,910
How is it?

615
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,380
Refreshing.

616
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,560
It's just perfect.

617
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,740
Do you like it that much?

618
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,160
Of course.

619
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,440
You prepared this for me.

♫  You're like a dream that resembles a star that fills the whole world  ♫

622
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,460
I told you that ghosts can pass on if they love each other,

623
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,260
and it's the same when a ghost loves a person, too.

624
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,350
What?

625
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:19,250
When a ghost full of grievances feel love,

626
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,430
their grievances disappears, and that's why they pass on.

627
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:32,960
Ji Hyeon if you want to stay here and find your memory,

628
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,160
you cannot love that person.

629
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,350
What's wrong, Ms. Ji Hyeon?

630
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:45,100
Nothing! It's nothing.

631
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:50,450
Now, tell me your wish.

632
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,370
I told you before.

633
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:59,010
Mister Driver, don't you have any wishes?

634
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,060
I'll grant them all.

635
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:05,670
Putting a lock on the fence at Namsan tower with a girlfriend.

636
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:10,620
Right, Namsan! That's your wish, that's right.

637
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,900
By the way, isn't that a bit too much for a couple?

638
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,190
I want to go with you.

639
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,100
Me?

640
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,210
What is this? You like me, don't you?

641
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:24,880
Yes.

642
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,940
I like you...

643
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,680
Ms. Ji Hyeon.

644
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,560
You can't.

645
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,040
You can't like me.

646
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:53,050
We've already held hands too.

647
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:55,090
Stop joking around.

648
00:53:55,090 --> 00:54:01,060
This feeling is just because we've been hanging out together too much.

649
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,730
Why is your first instinct to deny?

650
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:05,830
Why? I'm a ghost and you're a person.

651
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:07,380
Does this make sense?

652
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,980
Why wouldn't it?

653
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,900
Because it's a person who's alive and a dead person.

654
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:21,080
What kind of future or happiness would you have from liking me?

655
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,950
It'll just hurt you.

656
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,010
And...

657
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,720
don't be nice to me anymore.

658
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,530
Why not?

659
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,140
Me being nice to you...

660
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:56,320
Does it make your heart skip a beat?

661
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,340
Well,

662
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,680
now, why don't you call me Noona?

663
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,990
Why?

664
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:19,580
Why do you think? I'm older than you.

665
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,090
As a business partner, let's address each other correctly.

666
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:24,740
♫ Nobody cares about it ♫

667
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,420
No.

668
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:32,250
I don't want to call someone I like Noona.
♫  The days we were only smiling  ♫

669
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:36,190
♫  The same days  ♫

674
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,800
We don't have a relationship like that.

How about a triangle? Or a square? Circle?
♫  Don't try too hard  ♫

676
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:04,250
A circle is nice.

00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:08,130
No. What I feel is a heart.

What are you doing here alone?

684
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,350
Hello, Doctor.

685
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,390
Why are you two here?

686
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,220
I ate dinner with Miss So Ri and then we came to take a walk.

687
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,550
Are you okay?

688
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:56,990
It must've hurt. You've done great.

689
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:00,090
You treated me well.

690
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,450
Doctor,

691
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:08,530
are you free tonight by any chance?

692
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,830
I asked him out before.

693
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,200
My photo, show it to him!

694
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,120
He'll say he knows me for sure.

695
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,560
Doctor,

696
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,500
do you know this woman by any chance?

697
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,100
Yes.

698
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,200
I do know this person.

699
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:43,150

00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:53,900
♫  Even if things don't go the way you want it  ♫

702
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,290
♫  Dream of the day  ♫

703
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:00,860
♫  that will one day shine  ♫

704
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:04,640
♫  At the end of a hard day  ♫

705
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:09,060
♫  Put down the heavy burden  ♫

706
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:14,720
♫  And try to breathe out the breath you've been holding in  ♫

707
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,090
♫  It's okay even if take a little while  ♫

[Delivery Man]

709
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:27,970
Doctor... did you... date that person?

710
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:29,660
Good morning.

711
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,810
Why are you suddenly greeting me?

712
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:36,570
Those memories have something in common: Daehun Medical Center.

713
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:39,110
You're the ghost taxi, right? I'll provide you information.

714
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:41,780
Kim Jeong Wu was often hiding things in his locker.

715
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,680
In exchange, you guys grant me my wish.

716
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,070
Sure, let's make a deal.

717
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:46,850
What's my wish?

718
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:50,240
I need to hide it all. For Ms. Ji Hyeon.

719
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:56,140
It's shameless, but can't you just be next to me like you are now?

720
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,840
Watch out!

721
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:03,360
♫ Put down the heavy burden ♫
