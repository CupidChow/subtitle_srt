Why do you have my dead mother's hair tie?

5
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,410
Excuse me?

6
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,630
When I was in elementary school, I gave that to her as a gift.

7
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,880
I wouldn't know. I don't even know what this is.

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,010
Let me see it.

9
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,480

12
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,880
Yes, I'll bring the car over right away.

It's silly to think this,

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,710
but I feel like my husband sent you

18
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,340
so I wouldn't give up and to encourage me.

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,110
It's a relief. Now, you can just focus on your baby.

20
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,360
Thank you.

21
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,910
Once you get the insurance money, let's look into a nice house for you and our child to live in.

22
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,520
Did I leave the door unlocked?

23

Hey! Hey, hey! How dare you mess with me?

29

Where's the bankbook?

30
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,460
- It's not here, damn it.
- If I were alive, you'd all be dead!

31

The code for the door is 0967.

If you want to have your child safely,

35

tell us where the bankbook is and quickly.

36
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,450
I left it in the taxi!

37
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,370
It's true! Trust me!

38
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,800
Quickly tell us where!

39
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,900
I'm telling the truth!

40
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,550
I said open up!

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,040
- Mrs. So Yeon, the police will be here soon!
- Spit it out!

42
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,140
Never mind, I don't think we can get it out of her just by talking.

43
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,650
P-Please don't kill me.

44
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,700

You evil assholes!

Do you think she would believe our story?

62
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,880
Of course.

63
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,580
And also, you two didn't get to say goodbye.

64
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,820
Ma'am, there's something I must tell you.

65
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,310
To tell you the truth, the first time I was here,

66
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,520
I came here at Mr. Byeong Cheol's request.

67
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,960
Yes, I know.

68
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,740
You said that he asked you before his accident.

69
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,360
Well, not exactly.

70
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,340
It was after he died.

71
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,010
Excuse me?

72
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,170
He's here right now.

73
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,570
So Yeon.

74
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,330
It's such a relief that I was able to protect you.

75
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,130
He said "It's such a relief that he was able to protect you."

76
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,360
That doesn't make sense...

77
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,580
Even if you can't understand it logically,

78
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,850
it's the feeling of someone protecting you.

79
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,090
Was it perhaps...

80
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,810
was it perhaps my husband who did that?

81
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,030
To protect me and my child?

82
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,350
Do you remember looking at the star-filled sky?

83
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,440
When we were on our way to school during early dawn?

84
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,750
When you were on the way to school during early dawn,

85
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,340
he's asking if you remember looking at the starry sky.

86
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,880
Yes!

87
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,460
I remember. But how did you...

88
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,580
Do you remember when I said to name our future child "Star"?

89
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,000
You said you didn't like it because it was cheesy.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,050
The reason Byeong Cheol wanted to name the child star is...

91
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,010
Star.

92
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,090
Star!

93
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,970
Is it really you?

94
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,180
He's right there.

95
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,540
- The sky full of stars–
- "The sky full of stars feels like it belongs to us," he says.

96
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,280
"Ever since then, I think I began falling for you."

97
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,680
Let's name our child...

98
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,020
Star.

99
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,380
So I can keep watching over you while in the sky.

100
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,130
Yes.

101
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,710
I like star.

102
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,520
Don't cry.

103
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,000
So Yeon,

104
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:23,060
I'm sorry that I left you alone.

105
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,970
I'm so sorry.

106
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,370
Don't say something like that.

107
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,790
I'm not alone. I have our child.

108
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,290
Thank you.

109
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,570
Ghost taxi.

110
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,070
Don't you think this is amazing?

111
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,200
Excuse me?

112
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,610
If Mr. Byeong Cheol couldn't protect Mrs. So Yeon,

113
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,270
he wouldn't have been able to pass on because of the unfairness.

114
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,000
Granting people their wishes and helping them let go.

115
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,810
Who could do such a job?

116
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:10,830
If someone passes on after saying what they wanted, would that help them?

117
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,790
Your mother?

118
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,150
What are you looking for?

119
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,240
Grandma, do you remember a hair tie?

120
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,080
The one I gave to mom a long time ago.

121
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,740
Oh, the black one?

122
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,410
Your mom tied her hair with that all the time.

123
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,000
- It is black.
- What did it look like?

124
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,310
One second.

125
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,190
Here it is! In your mom's phone.

126
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,150
Look. This was it, right?

127
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,530
You bought it because you thought it was cool.

128
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,590
It was taxi shaped, like the taxi your mom drove.

129
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,310
You said, "Mom, you're the best."

130
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,610
That's right.

131
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,290
But I think I did something more to it.

132
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,300
Hmmm...

133
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,380
There are initials on it, J.S.

134
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,490
Didn't you write something in English?

135
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,310
There's one more.

136
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,280
Y.M. Y.M... Yeong Min.

137
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,800
It's your name!

138
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,450
Later on, your mom put your name on too.

139
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,360
Why are you looking for it?

140
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,550
Is it missing? I still have all of your mom's belongings.

141
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,460
Mom had it on that day.

142
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,960
But why does she have it?

143
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,850
I don't know.

144
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,440
Aigoo. What a pretty lady.

145
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,330
Is this a customer? This photo was taken in the taxi.

146
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,890
Don't you have a girlfriend like this?

147
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,470
He couldn't, such a pretty lady for Mister Driver? I don't think so.

148
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,590
What is it?

149
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,090
I'm so pretty!

150
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,660
You said I was in my 50's the other day.

151
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,750
That's mean.

152
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,630
By the way, I wonder how I knew your mother.

153
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,020
I'm more curious about that than you are.

154
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,810
Is there a familiar name here by any chance?

155
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,040
Maybe you'll remember something if you saw your name.

156
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,890
Kim Seon Yeong, Kim Ji Su, Kim Jin Mo, Stella...

157
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,450
Did your mom attend catholic churches?

158
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,370
Come on, focus!

159
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,140
There's no name that feels familiar.

160
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,090
And I don't think I'll remember just by looking at names when I have no memories.

161
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,210
This hair tie was really precious to my mom.

162
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,270
It's not something she would've given to someone.

163
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,940
Thief?

164
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,340
- Me?
- Maybe you picked it up from the street?

165
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,320
I don't think it looks expensive enough for me to do that.

166
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,430
Then what on earth could it be?

167
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,020
There is one thing for sure...

168
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,500
- "One thing for sure"?
- You said that this taxi belonged to your mother.

169
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,450
There's a photo of us together, and I have your mother's hair tie.

170
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,190
Also,

171
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,780
I can't get away from this taxi.

172
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,700
It means we were close.

173
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,560
Kind of...

174
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,990
As if fate brought us together.

175
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,840
And what the hell is that you amnesiac ghost?

176
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,670
I can hear you.

177
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,120
How could such an unfair story exist?

178
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,400
There was a biological mother that suddenly appeared to collect life insurance money of her abandoned son.

179
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,250
Even that fact is already shocking enough, but what's even worse, is that she was acting...

Hello?

192

I'll return the April security recording after I check something.

193

Okay.

194

Keep this safe.

195
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,080
Are they still keeping security footage from three months ago?

196
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,750
They'll keep up to six months. There's constantly some incident or accident happening here.

197
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,990
What kind of people live here for that to be happening?

198
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,510
Wait, that taxi?

199
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,670
Yeah, 8255. I called him.

Mrs. Kim Jin Suk's son, Seo Yeong Min, was here on the day of the accident.

No.

204

Yes, I'm all right.

What's going on? You don't look so good.

To tell you the truth,

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,110
this is where my mother was in that hit-and-run accident.

- No.

I want to drink coffee, too. Coffee!

212
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,070
And I want it to be really dark instant coffee.

213
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,180
I want to at least smell the coffee!

214
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,600
By the way, why don't you go to cafes?

215
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,250
It's usually restaurants, taxi, or your home.

216
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,000
Why would I go to a cafe? It's a waste of money.

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,570

That's why he doesn't have a girlfriend.

Mister Driver, you've never dated, have you?

220
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,560
You're forever single. A forever single!

221

No, it doesn't.

227
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,950
I'm sorry, but can we sit outside?

228
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,020
I feel a bit cold from the air conditioner.

229
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:56,500
- Oh, you're cold. The weather is nice, so let's drink outside.
- Bring it out here. Out here!

Mister Driver! Mister Driver! Mister driver!

231
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,560
Why did you want to see me?

232
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,680
I heard that you were at the scene on the day of Mrs. Kim Jin Suk's accident.

233
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,960
What were you doing there?

234
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,170
A mother and a son were planning to meet up. That's a strange question to ask.

235
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,830
We were going to get some Korean BBQ near here at 9 p.m.

236
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,710
I heard that your cram school ended at 8 p.m.

237
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,010
What did you do for an hour?

238
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,780
Okay. I'm almost there.

239
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,730

240
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,210
- I think I have to go to the hospital right now.
- What's wrong, Mom?

241
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,290
Are you still hurting?

242
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,510
I'll talk to you later, Yeong Min.

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,910
Mom! Daehun Hospital emergency room, hurry!

246
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,780
We don't have enough room, so follow us in a taxi.

247
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:23,420
Why did it take you an hour to arrive after Mrs. Kim Jin Suk was taken to the hospital?

248
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,030
Why are you asking me such questions?

249
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,240
From here to Daehun Hospital is twenty to thirty minutes, at most, by car.

250
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,110
Why did you arrive late?

251
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,030
There was traffic so I ran after getting out of the taxi.

252
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,210
The 8255 taxi was already there, why did you take a different one?

253
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,920
Mister Driver...

254
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,740
Wait, this is the scene of the crime...

255

256
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,660
I'm sorry, Mister Driver, but I'm getting off here.

It's my mom's birthday,

260
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,370
but I'm sitting here under suspicion that I killed my mother.

261
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,590
Wow, Korean police sure are amazing.

262
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,680
I killed my own mother?

263
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,980
If you have the time for this,

264
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,230
at least go and find some piece of evidence of the culprit.

Are you looking for your mother?

Your mother is really beautiful.

280
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,100
You're probably handsome because you take after your mother.

My mom's like that.

283

She was nosy and loved chatting with her customers.

284

She was happy driving the taxi.

285
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:53,270
I can tell by her smile in the photos.

Are you that close with a friend's grandmother?

Okay.

532
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,220
You're late tonight. Did you have a lot of work?

533
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,600
I had to drive far today.

534
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,810
How far did you go?

00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,250
Gangneung.

536
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,550
"Gangneung"?

537
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,430
You must've seen the ocean then.

538
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:35,310
That must've been nice. You got to see the ocean.

539
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,620
Right.

540
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:44,130
Have you seen my mother?

541
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:46,270
My mom disappeared!

542
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:47,680

Seriously!

547
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,570
That woman kept running after my daughter!

548
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:29,660
She was definitely trying to do something to her!

549
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,480
What if she kidnapped her?

550
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,610
That's not true.

551
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,310
I was nice to Eun Su.

552
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,720
Why are you keep calling my daughter Eun Su?

553
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,020
Noona!

554
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,150
Noona, are you okay?

555
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,970
Can you get up?

556
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,850
Are you okay?

557
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,170
Yeong Min.

558
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,010
My mom,

559
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,800
to other people,

560
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,740
is like a ghost.

561
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:35,450
You can see her,

562
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,480
but you don't notice her.

563
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:42,170
She can't remember who she is,

564
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,770
so only I can see her, and I'm the only one who can find her!

565
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:51,310
I know who my mom is!

566
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,830
You didn't find her?

567
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,710
I can't find her anywhere.

568
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,630

00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,860
The car's over there.

577
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,640
E-Excuse me...

Excuse me!

579
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:32,720
Don't go!

580
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,600
Why does my heart...

581
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,850
hurt so much?

582
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:53,990

00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:25,270
Hello. Do you have a charger that fits this?

586
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,030
Is this what death is like?

587
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:04,260

I'm a bit strange these days. I keep getting annoyed for no reason, and something keeps bothering me.

605
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:32,840
You like someone, don't you?

606
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:37,040
What would it feel like to abandon you?

607
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,490
