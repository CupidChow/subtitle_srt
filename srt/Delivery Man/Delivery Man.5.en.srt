00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,770
It's Dr. Do.

178
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,040
At this point, it's not one-sided.

179
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,140
Battery! Do you have a charger?

180
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,640
Where's the charger...

181
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,410
Cellphone charging!

182
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,150
Get out.

183
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,030
Excuse me, but this is my room.

184
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,440
Did you have a nice date with Miss So Ri?

185
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,410
You must've had a good time.

186
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,250
Your face is glowing.

187
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,000
So Ri is just a friend.

188
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,210
Well, a friend becomes an oppa,

189
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:15,790
and then an oppa turns into a father, isn't that how it goes?

190
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,710
Nonsense.

191
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,430
Are you being jealous right now?

192
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,780
Je-je-jealous?

193
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,140
My gosh, I... well...

194
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,530
It's because of this.

195
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,650
You haven't come home for days and just left it like this.

196
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,570
Do you know how frustrated I was?

197
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,940
I'm sorry.

198
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,340
I didn't do it on purpose.

199
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,250
Should we go to Mr. Shin Wu now?

200
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,290
We made him wait for too long, right?

201
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,160
Yes, he's waited for too long...

202
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,530
Let's go.

203
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,390
Do you think it would be a good memory if it's keeping her stuck?

204
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,040
You can't handle her. Give up!

205
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,900
Ms. Ji Hyeon, thank you for working so hard for the taxi.

206
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,600
I was able to earn money thanks to you.

207
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,930
At least you're acknowledging me.

208
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:51,350
By the way, why does it sound like you're saying goodbye?

209
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,990
I really wanted this outfit.

210
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,700
How is it? Does it look good?

211
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,310
It's a last gift.

212
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,030
I'll give you a refund if you'd like.

213
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,740
Do you think money is important to a ghost?

214
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,420
My feelings are important to me, but you keep getting in the way.

215
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,990
This time, let me ask you. Why did you do it?

216
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,640
Was it really an accident or on purpose?

217
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,420
I was scared of Ms. Ji Hyeon disappearing.

218
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,980
Then does the fact that you've come here mean that you're giving up on her?

219
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,910
You can wait outside. Come in when I raise my hand and put the ring on.

220
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,350
This time, no matter what, please don't ruin my plans.

221
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,310
I'm asking you.

222
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,430
Oh, Yeong Min?

223
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,370
Yeah, go ahead.

224
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,630
Hyung Seok Jin...

225
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,350
What? Why do you sound like that?

226
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,390
Is something wrong?

227
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,840
Do you... remember when we first met?

228
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,540
Of course!

229
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,700
You were the first person to call my name.

230
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,810
Ji Hyeon...

231
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:08,360
for my entire life, I lived pushing everything I wanted to do aside.

232
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:14,770
Watching a movie with my girlfriend, or going on a date at a nice restaurant.

233
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:21,760
I said I'd do them after passing the exam, but I never imagined dying that day.

234
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,900
But then, I met you here, my first love.

235
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,350
I couldn't talk to you, even though I liked you so much.

236
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,680
I think meeting you here was destiny.

237
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,080
Ji Hyeon, when ghosts love each other, they can pass on.

238
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,710
Let's go together with our rings on.

239
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,780
Aren't you also unhappy here without your memories?

240
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,760
I've thought about it, and I think you're right. I must like that person.

241
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,490
Really? Then you should confess.

242
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,660
That person wouldn't want that...

243
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,220
Why not?

244
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,870
They're going far away.

245
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,450
Is it like an "I'm letting her go because I love her" kind of thing?

246
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,280
That's bullshit.

247
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,600
Where is it anyway? Where are they going?

248
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,540
A place... they can't return from.

249
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,080
Yeong Min, do you want to have regrets for the rest of your life?

250
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,350
There's a big difference between being rejected after asking them out versus not even trying.

251
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,760
Why can't you stop them? Run to the airport right now.

252
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,300
♫  I think it's a really old tale  ♫

253
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,170
♫  All alone  ♫

254
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,170
Shin Wu, thank you.
♫  waiting for you  ♫

255
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:58,830
For loving and caring for me like this.
♫  Even when you smile, or when you cry  ♫

256
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:03,940
Ji Hyeon...
♫  I only looked at you  ♫

257
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,930
♫  You look different today  ♫

258
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:16,020
You're the first person who told me, someone with no memories,

259
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,330
who I am, and who I used to be.

260
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,920
I was really happy hearing your stories.
♫  I couldn't say anything  ♫

261
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,330
♫  I just listen  ♫

262
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,970
♫  What do you  ♫

263
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,800
I'm glad you exist.
♫  think of me?  ♫

264
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,680
Who would listen and help us?
♫  I wanted to ask you,  ♫

265
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,380
I'm grateful.
♫  but I don't want  ♫

266
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,160
♫  To burden you  ♫

267
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:51,290
♫  The love that I pushed aside in my heart keeps getting bigger  ♫

268
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:57,660
Mister driver, mister driver! Mister driver!
♫  If my heart is accidentally heard by you  ♫

269
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:02,290
Head! Head!
♫  and we become further apart,  ♫

270
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:06,080
I'm the only person who knows you...
♫  I would hate that more  ♫

271
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,750
We're the only two who know each other.
♫  So I keep myself  ♫

272
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,580
♫  From saying  ♫

273
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,170
Mr. Yeong Min.
♫  "I like you"  ♫

274
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:18,400
Mrs. Kang... Ji Hyeon.

275
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,600
Hyung.

276
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,100
I thought I had to give up since we'd have to say goodbye eventually,

277
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,100
but no...

278
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,500
I have to tell her what I really feel,

279
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,510
that I can't let her go like this.

280
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,400
And Shin Wu, you're a really cool person.

281
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,660
But...

282
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,850
I want to find my memories here.

283
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:59,640
I think I can do it together with mister driver, Yeong Min.

284
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,130
Together...

285
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,340
Is it Yeong Min that you like?

286
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,170
No, it's not like that.

287
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:13,680
Ji Hyeon, what kind of future can a ghost and a human have?

288
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,430
I told you that ghosts can pass on if they love each other,

289
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:20,280
and it's the same when a ghost loves a person too.

290
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,790
What?

291
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:30,570
Even though it's a one sided love, my heart became full loving you.

292
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,460
When a ghost full of grievances feel love,

293
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,570
their grievances disappear, and that's when they can pass on.

294
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,520
Ji Hyeon...

295
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,640
If you want to regain your memory by staying here, you cannot love that person.

296
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:07,350
A date with my first love. I've fulfilled my final wish.

297
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,580
Ms. Ji Hyeon!

298
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,010
I have something to say to you!

299
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,510
Goodbye, Mister Driver.

300
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,890
Thank you for everything.

301
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,320
Ms. Ji Hyeon, don't go, please?

302
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,580
No... no!

303
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,030
Mister Driver, what are you doing?

304
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,010
Mister Driver!

305
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,360
What do you have to say?

306
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,900
Shin Wu left.

307
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:05,070
Why do you keep staring? You're going to make a hole in me.

308
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,630
You're happy that I didn't go, right?

309
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,920
Why didn't you go?

310
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,750
Why did you run up like that?

311
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,900
That's because... I felt like it'd be a waste!

312
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,240
Mr. Shin Wu probably has more money hidden somewhere.

313
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
That's what I thought.

314
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,160
So... why didn't you go?

315
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,500
I said I wouldn't until I find my memories!

316
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:39,050
Ms. Ji Hyeon, get in the car. I'm going to make a call.

317
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,900
Wow...

318
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,270
What is it?

319
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,470
Is it that woman again?

320
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,710
Yes, that thing I asked you earlier...

321
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,830
Mom,

322
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,440
the nickname of this place
[The Uyuni Salt Flat that I wanted to see before I die]

323
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,750
is "the largest mirror in the world."

324
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,080
It's because it reflects with no end...

325
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,450
Don't you think it's so cool?

326
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,720
[It was a place that filled my heart just by looking at a photo, so...]

327
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,860
Let's go there together, Mom.

328
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,230
Okay?

329
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,410
Mom, have this.

330
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,280
Hello. Eun Su, here.

331
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,770
Is your mother not feeling well? She's using a wheelchair.

332
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,260
She'll get better.

333
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,510
She has to so we can go on a trip together, right mom?

334
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,500
By the way, I haven't seen Yeong Min these days.

335
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,980
That's true.

336
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:46,340
He's been busy in his own world, talking about letting go or holding onto this woman he loves.

337
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,660
I haven't heard how it ends yet.

338
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,770
Mister Driver, where are we going right now?

339
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,840
Ms. Ji Hyeon, what memories do you want to find?

340
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,860
Are there different types of memories?

341
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,090
I want to find all of them.

342
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,490
I'll find your memories.

343
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:13,210
Today, I'll do everything you want.

344
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,110
Really?

345
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,370
Cellphone.

346
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:30,140
They said nobody is trustworthy... you traitor.

347
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,230
You're... You're trying to get rid of me.

It's soaked! Do you know how expensive this was?

350
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,560
This makes it weaker!

351
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,800
You said you'd let me do whatever I wanted today...

352
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,790
No, you misunderstood.

353
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,420

Didn't you tell her?

357
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,140
I did! I said I'd find her memories for her.

358

You weren't trying to get rid of me?

359
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,960
Ms. Ji Hyeon, do you know how hard it is to find someone's identity?

360
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,100
I was grasping at straws and thought of hypnotism...

361
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,890
Who would hypnotize a ghost?

362
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,210
I'm the only person capable of doing that.

363
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,970
I'm the flower doryeong (young master) of Cheongdam-dong.

364
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,120
Put your whole heart into it, your sincerity.

365
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,920
You're lucky that I brought one more.

366
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:49,750
By the way... how did she move the talisman?

367
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,900
No!

368
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,380
Do you know why we try to send away ghosts?

369
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,680
Why?

370
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,190
A ghost getting power... that's not a good sign.

371
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,080
They could become an evil spirit in a blink of an eye.

372
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,750
Be careful.

373
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:11,980

521
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,240
I think there's just a little more left.

522
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,000
It's a relief that we don't have inpatients.

523
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,470
Have a good rest of the day, Nurse Kim.

524
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,110
Okay, good luck.

525
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,580
Thanks. Bye.

526
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,930
Miss So Ri, is something wrong?

527
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,910
I saw something strange.

528
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,810
What was it?

529
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:07,400
I think I saw Nurse Jeong Wu put an ampoule into his pocket.

530
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,780
It's the anesthetic we left out to use in the treatment room.

531
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,960
It was in the security camera's blind spot.

532
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,080
I didn't see it myself. I felt like I was suspecting someone without a solid cause, so I didn't want to carelessly bring it up.

533
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,180
I should've double-checked.

534
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,490
Even if there was a small possibility...

535
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,910
Medical staff shouldn't do that.

536
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:31,330
Could you let me take over?

537
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,950
What are you planning to do?

538
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:34,890
I have to think about it,

539
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:39,640
but it's as you said, we can't be even a tiny bit uncertain.

540
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,470
Thank you.

541
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:48,920
Sure.

542
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,270
What is it?

Did your sister not come home yesterday?

She never misses work and is never late but didn't come to work or answer my calls.

Ahjussi, do you know Noona Ga Eun by any chance?

546
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,240
I fired her.

547
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,530
Ha Jun, ask why he fired her.

548
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:08,170
Why did you fire her? What was it? What made you fire her?

549
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:11,000
I heard it wasn't even a month since she started working here.

550
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,100
That's true. It hasn't been that long.

551
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,180
Children these days are quite clever.

552
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:19,980
She couldn't legally buy alcohol or cigarettes, so she got a job as a cover. To secretly steal.

553
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,030
Did you personally see that?

554
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:25,970
Did you personally see that?

555
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,170
They didn't know that I had installed a new security camera.

556
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,740
- That's a violation of privacy laws.
- That's a violation of privacy laws.

557
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,990
Is that so?

558
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:37,440
Was there anything Ga Eun said before she left?

559
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,450
Before Noona left, did she say anything?

560
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:44,910
Right, she said that her house would be empty since her parents were going on a trip and told Ha Yul to visit.

561
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,950
Tell me Ga Eun's phone number right now!

Tell me Noona's phone number right now!

00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,360
Okay.

564
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,010
Ha Jun, that was so good!

565
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,160
Maybe you should be a policeman or something later on.

566
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,980
It's a calling!

567
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,380
It's nothing.

568
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,590
Why do I feel like I was just interrogated?

569
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:08,100
Children these days are scary, so I can't reveal personal information...

570
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,140
I'll try calling her.

Ga Eun's home...

576
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,290
Maybe she really went to hang out at Noona Ga Eun's home.

577
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,690
Right. She's probably there.

578

She'll be at school tomorrow, so Hyung and I will go.

Okay!

Your point?

589

That's a bad thing, right?

590
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:33,390
People are crazy about buying it, but it's not allowed to be imported. What do you think would happen?

591
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:38,540
This is super popular amongst the plant owners these days.

Tell me right away if anything like this happens again, okay?

So what was the urgent matter?

00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,210
She asked what the urgent matter was.

It's not like we've been apart that long.

It hasn't even been a day. Do you miss her that much?

No, it's not that.

00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:58,830
You're right.

695
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:01,290
Ha Yul was the class president and was good at studying too.

696
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:04,590
- Ha Yul was always first place in school.
- Hey,

697
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:08,000
Mi Ra was number one this month.

698
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:15,070
So you're the queen bee, right?

699
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:19,050
Mister Driver, keep it together. Don't get swept up by them.

700
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:24,260
The investigator said that these girls were the last ones to see Ha Yul.

701
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:28,450
I heard you guys were the last ones to see Ha Yul, is that right?

702
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:32,580
[Choi Mi Ra]

703
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:37,960
I don't know. We're in the same class, so we saw her leave the school.

704
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,540
She was acting strange these days. Her grades dropped for the first time.

705
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:45,040
There was also a rumor that she hung out with men.

706
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,630
Right, Ji Min from the classroom next to us said she saw it,

707
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:50,210
- paid for–
- Hey...

708
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:52,090
How can you say such things in front of her uncle?

709
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:55,180
Is that true?

710
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,310
There's evidence too.

711
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:18,390
You need this, right?

712
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:21,340
Won't you get in trouble if you don't bring this?

713
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:26,290
Why are you doing this? I was just told to hand you the money...

714
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,590
If I'm purchasing as a middleman, you should do at least do this much!

715
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,690
Do what?

716
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:45,940
No matter how you look at it, this photo looks like a man assaulting a female high school student.

717
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,970
What do you think? Should I call the police right now?

718
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,910
You little twerp, how dare you threaten an adult?

719
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,990
You need this "little twerp" to beat you up, don't you?

720
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,880
There's something wrong with Ga Eun...

721
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,450
I think she's hiding something, for sure.

722
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:12,180
Ga Eun, you said you used to work part-time with Ha Yul, right?

723
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,260
She's not that close with Ha Yul.

724
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,010
She didn't work that long, either.

725
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,540
Right, Ga Eun?

726
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,590
Yes.

727
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:21,770
Mi Ra must be really close with Ga Eun.

728
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:24,040
She's acting like her spokesperson.

729
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,800
I'm sorry, but I want to talk with Ga Eun.

730
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,410
She's shy.

731
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:32,200
She can't talk that well with strangers.

732
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:37,080
- It's true.
- Ga Eun's quite shy.

733
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,480
Ask Ga Eun now,

734
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,710
if she was there when Ha Yul was buying the console.

735
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:47,310
Ga Eun, were you with Ha Yul the day she bought the gaming console?

736
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:58,560
Ga Eun, talk to me. Please.

737
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,630
Ga Eun! Ga Eun...

738
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:10,270
[Choi Ha Yul]

739
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,300
She's dead.

740
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,620
What are you doing right now?

741
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:31,640
Report... I'm reporting–

742
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:38,290
No. If you say what happened here today,

743
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,550
I'm going to make all of you look like her!

744
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:43,590
So shut your mouth!

745
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:52,330
♫ What do you think of me? ♫

746
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:59,830
♫ I wanted to ask you, but I don't want to burden you ♫

747
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:09,900
♫ The love that I pushed aside in my heart keeps getting bigger ♫

748
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:16,290
♫ If my heart is accidentally heard by you ♫

749
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:21,130
♫ and we become further apart, ♫

750
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,110
[Delivery Man]
♫ I would hate that more ♫

751
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:26,190
Shouldn't we call the police?

752
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:29,520
Seeing that Ha Yul hasn't appeared yet, she may still be alive.

753
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,960
Let's do what we can, one thing at a time.

754
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,510
Ha Jun...

755
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,910
Hyung... Hyung!

756
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:37,850
What is it?

757
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:41,040
She left a suicide note on her phone.

758
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,650
If she didn't come to Ha Jun, she should be here.

759
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:46,130
It looks like they set things up so people would find it.

760
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,650
Mister Driver! Watch out!

761
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,360
Don't be nice to me anymore.

762
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,510
Does it make your heart skip a beat?

763
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:54,910
I asked him out before.

764
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:57,130
What's your wish, Mister Driver?

765
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:01,110
I like you Ms. Ji Hyeon.

766
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:04,080
♫ out of the many... ♫
