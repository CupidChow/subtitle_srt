Are you thinking that it's nurse Kim Hui Yeon?

Yes. It's not something Kim Jeong Wu would be capable of doing on his own.

This can't be leaked.

359
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,260
Don't you know that patient information has to be confidential?

360
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,710
I'm just going to check the handwriting, so there's no danger of leaking it.

361
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,040
Anyway, thank you.

362
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,250
Why are you doing this?

363
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,030
Right,

364
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,950
you can't tell anyone that I checked nurse Kim Hui Yeon's handwriting, okay?

365
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:03,460
If it's revealed that you took a photo of a patient chart, I'll be fired first.

366
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,690
Doctor!

367
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,080
I just saw that Mr. Yeong Min was here. Is something wrong?

368
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,540
Did you see him?

369
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,210
Well...

370
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,380
He was asking me something.

371
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,030
What did he ask you?

372
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,700
It's personal...

373
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,270
It's...

374
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:43,280
He said he's short on the loan payment, so he asked me if he could borrow some money.

375
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,160
Is that so?

376
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,660
Yes.

377
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,010
Oh, Doctor.

378
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,610
A new pasta restaurant opened in front of the hospital. Do you want to go with me?

379
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,750
I'm sorry, but I don't really like Italian.

380
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,570
Well then, you should get back to work.

381
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,610
Okay. I understand.

382
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,450
Nurse Kim.

383
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,020
Seo Yeong Min just came by the hospital.

384
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,200
Actually, yesterday...

385
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,620
Seo Yeong Min visited Kim Jeong Wu's apartment again.

386
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,610
I'm Ji Chang Seok from the Dongpa police station's violent crimes, 2nd team.

387
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,960
We're going to search this place and seize anything in relation to the serial murder case

388
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,570
at Daehun Medical Center, so we ask for your cooperation.

389
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,580
- Let's start.
- What do you think you're doing?

390
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,950
Can't you see there are patients here?

391
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,200
We'll do our best to not cause any trouble to the patients.

392
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,100
Search and seizure... Did the chief of our medical clinic give you permission?

393
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,350
Of course. The chief said he'd cooperate fully.

394
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:01,670
So I ask that you cooperate as well.

395
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,330
Nurse Kim Hui Yeon.

396
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:21,800
Do you by any chance know what this is?

397
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:28,320
The pattern on this key ring is the Daehun Medical Center's logo.

398
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,700
It's a token given to graduates from Daehun's nursing school.

399
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,200
I see...

400
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:44,050
We think that the owner of this key ring has very close relations to this current case.

401
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:47,760
However, nurse Kim Jeong Wu...

402
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,670
wasn't an alumni of Daehun University's nursing department.

403
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,820
On the other hand, nurse Kim Hui Yeon...

404
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,450
you are an alumni of Daehun University's nursing department, correct?

405
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,780
Yes, that's right.

406
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,770
Actually, most of the nurses that work here

407
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,820
are alums of Daehun University's nursing college.

408
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,540
You don't have anything else to say, do you?

409
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,540
In that case, I'll be going.

410
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,740
Tae Wu!

411
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,340
Yes?

412
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,600
Yesterday, Seo Yeong Min talked about nurse Kim Hui Yeon's mansion, right?

413
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,460
Look into that mansion.

414
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,810
When and with what money she bought it.

415
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,920
Yes, got it.

416
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,320
Why are you doing this to me?

417
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,560
Are you getting your revenge?

418
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,930
That's not it.

419
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,340
I've wanted to kill you from the very start.

420
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,890
Don't do it.

421
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,500
Don't do it.

422
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,620
Wait.

423
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,750
I'm sorry.

424
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,500
No.

425
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,410
No!

426
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,050
No!

427
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,690
No!

428
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,790
I'll let you die quickly.

429
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:13,150
The results of the handwriting analysis comparing the memo and the health chart photo,

430
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,840
shows the two items to be from the same person.

431
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,820
It's as I thought, it was Kim Hui Yeon's memo.

432
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,730
Kim Jeong Wu and Kim Hui Yeon... Do you think they're accomplices?

433
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,020
If Kim Jeong Wu really is the culprit, he has to have an accomplice.

434
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,310
And right now, Kim Hui Yeon is a strong suspect.

435
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:37,350
Then, there must be a high possibility that Kim Hui Yeon knows Kim Jeong Wu's whereabouts.

436
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,460
Should I submit the memo to the police?

437
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,780
You should.

438
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,600
Even so, Kim Hui Yeon won't talk.

439
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,150
The moment Kim Jeong Wu is found, the fact that she was an accomplice will be revealed.

440
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,570
She won't talk easily.

441
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,600
Then what should we do?

442
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,310
We'll think about it.

443
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,660
Ms. Ji Hyeon...

444
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,580
It's happening again.

445
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,190
Prepare 1mg of Ativan!

446
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,710
Yes.

447
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,700
Are you okay?

448
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,280
I think I'm okay now.

449
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,890
This has been happening a lot recently...

450
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:37,780
If I were to pass on, I should pass on after we capture the culprit.

451
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,900
Hey...

452
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,270
How about I become the bait?

453
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,340
Bait?

454
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,490
I'm going to provoke Kim Hui Yeon.

455
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,790
Basically, throw in a bomb.

456
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,330
What do you mean?

457
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,500
[If you need help, come to me.]

458
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,140
What is this?

459
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:06,880
It's the memo that you gave to nurse Kim Jeong Wu.

460
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:13,100
How can you be sure that this was a memo that I wrote?

461
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,820
Shall I submit this to the police then?

462
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,610
It'll be revealed quite quickly if they do a handwriting analysis anyway.

463
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:23,180
I also heard they came by today to perform a search and seizure at Daehun Medical Center.

464
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:27,800
What have you and Kim Jeong Wu been doing until now?

465
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,910
She's panicking. She's definitely panicking.

466
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,210
I'll tell you the truth.

467
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:39,880
Nurse Kim Jeong Wu was a colleague that I really cared about.

468
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,870
He was in a difficult situation due his drug stealing and knife incident.

469
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:49,630
I wanted to personally help him, so I sent the memo.

470
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:53,020
But nurse Kim Jeong Wu didn't come.

471
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,400
Do you really think I'd believe that?

472
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,600
Believe it or don't, it's the truth.

473
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,960
What is this?

474
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,860
That's a photo that was found in the online storage of the deceased P.I. Gu Bong.

475
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,330
And?

476
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:22,550
The key ring in this photo and the one you have is the same.

477
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,550
Is that not true?

478
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:29,010
You're saying the same things as that detective...

479
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,810
You're right, I also have one.

480
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,680
However,

481
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,140
when such a key ring is given to every single Daehun nursing graduate...

482
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,680
can it really count as evidence towards my guilt?

483
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,810
If coincidences keeps happening, then they're not coincidences.

484
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,370
Just like how coincidences stop being coincidences when they keep occurring,

485
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,240
when multiple pieces of evidence mesh together,

486
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,790
it becomes incriminating evidence that you can't escape.

487
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,290
Good job, Seo Yeong Min.

488
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:59,530
I think you know Kim Jeong Wu's whereabouts.

489
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,960
If you're adamant about staying silent,

490
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,210
I'm going to assume you're an accomplice to Kim Jeong Wu.

491
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,380
I'll give you two days to think it over.

492
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:17,450
If I don't hear from you after two days, I will...

493
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,460
submit this memo to the police.

494
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:32,020
Mr. Yeong Min, that was a strong finishing blow!

495
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,610
I threw in the bomb, so I'll get to hear from her soon.

496
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,740
That why I'm more concerned.

497
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,540
I'm worried that the explosion will be too strong

498
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,380
and that the fragments might hit you.

499
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,280
I set up a safety net, so don't worry.

500
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,880
"A safety net"? What is it?

501
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,330
It's a secret.

502
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,520
What...

503
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,860
Do you have a secret? Mr. Yeong Min!

504
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,850
Are you keeping a secret from me?

505
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,000
That's not fair, not fair at all.

506
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,400
Mr. Yeong Min!

507
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,930
Wake up! Mr. Yeong Min!

508
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,130
Please wake up...

509
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,530
Mr. Yeong Min!

510
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,080
Mr. Yeong Min!

511
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,760
Mr. Yeong Min, are you okay?

512
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,840
Where... Wh-where am I?

513
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,700
Kim Jeong Wu...

514
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,150
Is he dead?

515
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,690
Yes.

516
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,230
Then is this Kim Hui Yeon's hideout?

517
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,990
No, it's not.

518
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,750
It's not. It's not Kim Hui Yeon, it's–

519
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,020
Do Gyu Jin!

520
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,590
You idiot!

521
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:04,340
Hey,

522
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,230
I watched as you didn't even realize that I killed your mother

523
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:11,490
and watched you live thinking that I was a lifesaver...

524
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,660
Do you know how... how much fun I had watching that?

525
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,370
You should've stayed quiet. Why did you do such useless things?

526
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:33,050
If I kill you now...

527
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,440
I won't be able to watch such an amusing sight anymore.

528
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,220
Don't you think?

529
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,510
Son, are you going to the academy?

530
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,860
Mom, what are you doing?

531
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,710
What do you think? I have to go to work.

532
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:20,880
You were coughing all day yesterday.

533
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,280
You should be going to the hospital, not work!

534
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,960
Hospital, ha, it's nothing.

535
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,580
I told you before, a taxi earns money only when it's rolling.

536
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,000
What if you faint?

537
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,250
Why don't you listen?

538
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,360
There's so much to pay for.

539
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,700
Loan payments, your academy, grandma's medicine...

540
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,940
Damn money...

541
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,500
Dad died from overworking himself trying to pay off the loan, are you going to do that, too?

542
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,260
Hey...

543
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,480
how could you say such a thing?

544
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,520
Damn taxi!

545
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,200
Hey, Seo Yeong Min! Stop!

546
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:25,650
We'll be studying the five principles

547
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,830
of "no penalty without a law.".

548
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:32,200
"No penalty without a law," it's as it says,

549
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,290
I shouldn't have done that.

550
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:37,670
it means things need to be decided through law. In other words,

551
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:39,530
- Apologize to mom.
- if there is no law,

552
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:43,470
there's no crime and no punishment.

553
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:48,530
Now, regarding the five subject matters... First, the customary criminal law prohibition principle,

554
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:54,620
- Come to the barbecue place you like after class.I'll treat you.
- second, principle of non-retroactive effect,

555
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,850
third, principle of clarity...

556
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,610
Detective, that will be 8.900 won ($7).

557
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,590
Do you need a hair tie?

558
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:08,930
Here, tie it with this.

564
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,600
Detective Kang Ji Hyeon, you attended today again.

565
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:06,690
Yes. I'm just really interested in this subject.

566
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,280
I'll attend the offline meetings too.

567
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,430
I didn't know you were so interested in psychology.

568
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,660
I thought it'd be helpful for catching criminals.

569
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,970
And also, it actually has been helpful.

570
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,740
I see.

571
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,850
Nurse Kim, you did a presentation on criminal psychology last time, right?

572
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,780
- Yes.
- That was so impressive.

573
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,500
I want to talk more about criminal psychology.

574
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,810
Do you have time today by any chance?

575
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:43,840
Cheers.

576
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,840
What?

577
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,110
There's no more alcohol.

578
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,590
Should we drink more?

579
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:58,840
I'd like that.

580
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,890
Nice.

581
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,360
I'll be right back. Just wait a moment.

582
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,440
Okay.

583
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,460
I need to find evidence related to Min Seo's death.

584
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,340
Unnie, are you already back?

585
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:42,670
Yes, the barbecue restaurant's parking lot was full, so I parked in front of Morose studio apartments.

586
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,310
Okay. I'm almost there.

587
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,610
Yeong Min, one moment.

588
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:52,990
Are you okay, Ms. Ji Hyeon?

589
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:54,850
What's–

590
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,970
What's going on?

00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:10,590

Here, here!

595
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,480
I think I have to go to the hospital right now.

596
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,590
What's wrong, Mom? Are you still hurting?

597
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:51,130
I'll talk to you later, Yeong Min.

598
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:55,750
Mom!

599

602
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,350
She's still alive.

603
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:28,620
Hey, over there. Is something wrong?

604
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,140
It's a hit and run victim.

605
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,940
She's in an urgent state, so please call 911.

606
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,030

607
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,990

611
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,040
Are you her son?

612
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,660
I'm a doctor from the emergency room of Daehun Medical Center.

613
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,060
Your mother was in a hit-and-run accident just now.

614
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,400

00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:19,400
What happened?

619
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,950
Your mother has many fractures, and she's not in good condition.

620
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:25,030
What are you talking about?

621

Mom, are you okay?

623
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,480
It would be dangerous if she loses consciousness.

Do you think testimony without any physical evidence will be admissible?

00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,840
You killed them!

644
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,670
Are you saying you're letting that murderer go?

645
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:36,370
So you're going to put this on Seo Yeong Min's taxi?

646
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:40,360
It's dangerous, but we should find out what we need to.

647
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,030
I'm sure there are other incriminating videos on that phone,

648
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:46,700
so... recover the cellphone data.

649
