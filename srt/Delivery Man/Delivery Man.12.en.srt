00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,490
Warden! Warden!

356
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,450
Warden! Warden!

357
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,200
Get away from me! Go away!

358
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,510
Go away! Warden!

359
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,580
Salute!

360
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,350
Salute.

361
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,000
I, Sergeant Kang Ji Hyeon, was transferred to the Dongpa police station's violent crimes, Team 2.

362
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,260
I'm reporting in now.

363
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,330
Salute!

364
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,880
How are you feeling?

365
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,520
I'm well enough to beat up criminals.

366
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,330
Who are you beating up? This isn't a gangster hideout.

367
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,610
Yes?

368
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,110
A body was found?

369
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,560
Yes, yes. We'll dispatch right away.

370
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,840
They said a body was found at Geumhwa-dong.

371
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,440
Sunbaenim, let's drink soju next time.

372
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,850
Yes, sounds good. Go ahead.

373
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,950
Okay. Kang Ji Hyeon!

374
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,660
You rest today, and officially start work tomorrow.

375
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,970
Understood?

376
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,000
But...

377
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,500
It's an order.

378
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,380
Understood.

379
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,670
- Let's go.
- Okay.

380
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,410
Ji Hyeon, you and I should go eat some tasty lunch.

381
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,690
- Dad.
- Yes?

382
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,450
I have a date to go on.

383
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,030
Salute.

384
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,710
Oh, Yeong Min! You're here!

385
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,330
Yeong Min.

386
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:08,060
Let me introduce you guys. This is Detective Kang Ji Hyeon, and these people are my taxi union family.

387
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,820
- Hello.
- Hello, hello.

388
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,890
I heard a lot about you. Nice to meet you.

389
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,890
Nice to meet you.

390
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:31,520
By the way, this is our first date... Why did you choose the bowling alley?

391
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,090
My mom and I used to go bowling a lot.

392
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:38,620
So when I got a girlfriend, I wanted to try bowling with her.

393
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,170
Okay!

394
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,560
I shall show you.

395
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,810
Ms. Ji Hyeon, are you good at bowling?

396
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,250
You'll be surprised.

397
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,410
Ms. Ji Hyeon, hwaitting!

398
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,880
♫ Welcome, nice to meet you, a flower like you, a dream about you♫

399
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,010
​​♫ I smile as I wonder if this is love♫

400
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,930
​​♫ Our surreal memories together ♫

401
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:18,640
​​♫ Are growing large enough to touch the sky♫

402
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:27,800
​​♫ To express how much as I want you I'll give you all of me♫

403
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:37,500
♫ You're like a dream that resembles a star that fills the whole world ♫

404
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,490
Alive? You?

405
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,190
Yes.

406
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,260
We came to report that I'm alive.

407
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,050
"If you do that she will die for real."

408
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,840
The Sir already knew that you were a spirit of a live person.

409
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,540
Now that I think about it, that meant that Ji Hyeon was alive.

410
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:05,600
That's why he warned us, telling us you could potentially die for real.

411
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:11,640
Anyway, when I was a ghost, you went through a lot trying to find my memories,

412
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,990
so thank you so much for that.

413
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,950
Well... Glad that you acknowledge that.

414
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:21,290
Can I ask one thing...

415
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,860
to the miraculous Sir?

416
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,900
Where on earth is my mom's soul?

417
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:37,210
Why didn't she come to see me, even once?

418
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,450
It's the last...

419
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:54,260
She's not able to leave because she's trying to keep her last promise.

420
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,910
Mom...

421
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,980
Mom.

422
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,880
Mom!

423
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,430
Yeong Min...

424
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,240
Can you see me?

425
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,420
My son!

426
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,120
You finally came!

427
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,290
I missed you, my son.

428
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,900
Mom...

429
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,470
you waited too long, didn't you?

430
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,870
I'm sorry...

431
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,400
for coming so late.

432
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,040
I'm okay.

433
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,520
Don't cry.

434
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,110
My handsome son's face is all ruined.

435
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,390
What a shame.

436
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,380
Don't cry, and smile like that all the time.

437
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:18,470
Happily... Be happy every moment of your life.

438
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:23,470
Do your best to be happy.

439
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,200
Okay.

440
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,840
I will.

441
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,790
I will, Mom.

442
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,050
Ms. Ji Hyeon?

443
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,300
Here...

444
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,830
My mom...

445
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,840
is here.

446
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,790
I...

447
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,850
Ms. Driver.

448
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,170
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

449
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:15,660
What are you sorry for?

450
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,300
She asked what you're sorry for.

451
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:30,600
You died because of me.

452
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,610
Why is that your fault?

453
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:46,650
The killer was someone else.

454
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:54,950
If it wasn't for me you would've...

455
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:59,290
been fine... together with Mr. Yeong Min, and Grandma...

456
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:01,640
living happily.

457
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,670
No.

458
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:10,970
Don't feel such guilt and remorse.

459
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:13,550
It's not your fault.

460
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:19,010
Such guilt... and remorse...

461
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:22,390
She said not to hold onto those, because it wasn't your fault.

462
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,230
Don't cry.

463
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:42,510
Don't cry, and smile.

464
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,050
By the way, Yeong Min,

465
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:01,810
how are you together with Ms. Ji Hyeon?

466
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,420
So that's what happened...

467
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,380
That's how you two met.

468
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,690
That's good.

469
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,800
That's so good.

470
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:20,000
I...

471
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,510
will take Mr. Yeong Min's side for you.

472
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:29,640
I'll do your part to protect Mr. Yeong Min

473
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,770
and love him.

474
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,240
Thank you, Ms. Ji Hyeon.

475
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:44,440
Thanks to you I can leave peacefully.

476
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:53,330
The meat is getting burned.

477
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:54,780
Go on, eat.

478
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,720
Ms. Ji Hyeon, you, too.

479
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:18,100
You said you wanted to come here so much,

480
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,730
and I said it was too expensive, so I couldn't bring you here, and that...

481
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:26,340
that kept bothering me.

482
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:32,650
Seeing you eat so well makes me happy.

483
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,950
Yeong Min...

484
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,100
I...

485
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,790
kept my promise, okay?

486
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,960
Yes.

487
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,160
You kept your promise.

488
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,630
Mom...

489
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:00,480
There was something

490
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,420
I really wanted to tell you.

491
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,890
I love you.

492
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,030
I love you so much, Mom.

493
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,690
I love you, too.

494
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:20,060
In the next life, please be my mother again.

495
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,790
I'll be born as your son in my next life as well,

496
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:28,050
and I'll do the duty of the son that I couldn't fulfill.

497
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:32,300
I won't be a cold-hearted son,

498
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:37,420
but a kind son who says I love you to you in the next life.

499
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:49,660
Even in this life you are my proud son.

500
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:55,460
You were the reason I lived and my happiness.

501
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,470
Thank you for everything, my son.

502
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,170
I think...

503
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:16,710
I should leave now.

504
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,870
Can I...

505
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,860
go?

506
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,980
What are you doing?

507
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,870
Come here and eat.

508
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:08,460
Wow, Grandma, you made so much food!

509
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:13,650
You were always with me, but you didn't get to even eat a single meal.

510
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:16,970
I felt bad about that the whole time.

511
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,670
Thank you, Grandma.

512
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:24,330
Thanks to you, I wasn't bored at all,

513
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:26,270
and I had a really comfortable time.

514
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:29,110
I was more grateful.

515
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:35,930
I was lonely by myself,

516
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,700
You'll... come again, right?

517
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,860
Yes.

518
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,160
What a vivid dream...

519
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,480
I can finally see the face of my grandson's girlfriend!

520
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:36,130
Grandma, this is my girlfriend.

521
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:42,040
Hello.

522
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,950
My name is Kang Ji Hyeon.

523
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,440
It's so very nice to meet you.

524
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:53,010
Here.

525
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:03,440
You really came back.

526
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,530
I'm...

527
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:10,420
so glad to meet you.

528
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,040
Welcome.

529
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,160
[Dongpa Police Station]

530
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,330
[Seoul]

531
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,360
It's cold!

532
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,970
Even so, one drink?

533
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,550
Thank you.

534
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:53,180
What's the case this time?

535
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:56,930
It's a cold case from a while ago.

536
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:00,850
We decided to re-investigate cases that don't have too much of the statute of limitations period left.

00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,200
What case is it?

538
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,030
A missing female case from Daeyeong-dong in Ilsan.

539
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,460
[Missing female case from Daeyeong-dong in Ilsan.]

540
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:16,830
This case... might be easier to solve than we think.

541
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,170
Let's go to get the culprit.

542
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,940
Let's go!

547
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,920
Excuse me, may we ask you something?

548
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,580
Me?

549
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,640
Can you see me?

550
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,180
Where? Where is she?

551
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:22,570
She's right over there. She's standing in front of the seats.

552
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:24,480
What?

553
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,970
Why?

554
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,820
She's already sitting behind you.

555
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,120
I see.

556
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,260
Okay.

557
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,970
Hello.

558
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:50,330
Are you the Mo Chae Ryeong who went missing around March 27 of 1999,

559
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:52,030
in Daeyeong-dong in Ilsan by any chance?

560
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:53,720
Yes.

561
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,600
That's me.

562
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:03,210
Who are you two?

563
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,490
She said, it's her.

564
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:08,060
And she asked who we were.

565
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,860
She doesn't know who we are, does she?

566
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:16,760
Well, you see,

567
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,100
we solve spirits' grievances, and grant their wishes,

568
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:25,990
we are the one and only taxi just for ghosts.

569
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:29,240
A taxi just for ghosts?

570
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,620
Now then, shall we go catch the culprit?

571
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,170
One second please.

572
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:37,100
Mr. Yeong Min...

573
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,120
Do you possibly have money for the taxi fare, or maybe something else?

574
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,890
My girlfriend said it's a bit of trouble if you have nothing.

575
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:52,950
Trying to charge ghosts... you guys are worse than ghosts.

576
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,900
I have it, money.

577
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:03,070
Staying here for more than twenty years... I saw all sorts of things.

578
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:07,660
A bag full of cash that gangsters hid.

579
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,420
I know where that is.

580
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,620
Would that be enough?

581
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:14,210
Ms. Ji Hyeon...

582
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:19,630
a bag full of cash that gangsters hid...

583
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,670
Okay!

584
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:26,690
Here we go.

585
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:36,060
But have we met before?

586
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:40,380
You seem familiar.

587
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,980
I get that a lot.

588
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,270
Okay.

589
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:51,240
Now then. Here we go.
