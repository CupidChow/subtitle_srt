00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,810
What's going on?

359
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,400
You stayed out all night, which you never do.

360
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,930
Grandma!

361
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,410
Oh?

362
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,020
I mean, why on earth is that ghost stuck with me?

363
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:37,380
No. This is a dream. If I go to sleep and wake up,

364
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,650
everything will be okay.

365
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,870
Shit.

366
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,750
I reserved this taxi.

367
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,500
- I reserved it.
- Ma'am?

368
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,300
Hello.

369
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,830
Here.

370
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,350
The person in the passenger seat is my mother who has Alzheimer's.

371
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,020
Thank you for understanding.

372
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,400
I'm sorry but would you sit in the back please?

373
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,230
Y-Yes.

374
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,780
Watch your head.

375
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,400
I'm closing the door.

376
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,540
Thanks.

377
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,090
Can you hold this?

378
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,240
- Okay.
- I'm leaving.

379
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,460
Hey.

380
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,340
Why isn't Yeong Min around these days?

381
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,870
I don't know, I can't reach him either. I wonder if he's all right.

382
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:30,990
I'm off!

383
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,250
Did you have a scary dream?

384
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,690
It's lunch time. How much longer are you going to sleep?

385
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:24,000
The other grandmas and I said we'd go to Burger Majesty today.

386
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,780
Take me now.

387
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,130
What?

388
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,990
Are you going to be in my taxi today?

389
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,520
Yes.

390
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,140
It's so hot.

391
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,370
There it is.

392
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:52,540
I mean, why did you park it so far instead of parking it at home?

393
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,280
Grandma!

394
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,570
I...

395
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,840
I think you should seat in the back today, there's something on the passenger seat.

396
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,920
Yeah? Okay.

397
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,300
Oh, so she's your grandmother.

398
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,470
Hello, Grandma.

399
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,940
Why would you say hi?

400
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,190
What?

401
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:39,190
Grandma, take another taxi. I'll get it for you.

402
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:43,550
Why would I take a different taxi when my grandson already drives one?

403
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,590
You're all about saving money usually. Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today?

404
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:59,020
It's just you have a chronic illness, and if something shocking happens.

405
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,930
I'm late!

406
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:07,030
We said we'd order Kioski or something today.

407
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,740
Driver Seo, please get going.

408
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,260
"Please get going."

409
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,660
Why do you keep looking at me? Keep your eyes on the road.

410
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,080
Grandma.

411
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,380
Are you okay?

412
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,660
Were the noodles I had yesterday bad?

413
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,170
I feel a bit nauseous.

414
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,240
It looks like that wasn't where you usually park.

415
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,410
You must've parked there on purpose yesterday, right?

416
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,580
E-Excuse me.

417
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:09,210
Mister Driver, why are you doing this!? Can't you see–

418
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,880
I'm driving, why are you acting like this?

419
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,250
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

420
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,740
Grandma, are you okay?

421
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,810
What on earth.

422
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,040
I'm okay.

423
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:48,270
Mister Driver, this is an act of killing me twice.

424
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,570
I'll do better, so please give me one more chance?

425
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,390
Just calmly pass on to the other side.

426
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:58,410
My blood, and my money is being wasted.

427
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,800
You shouldn't talk to things like that.

428
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,110
Okay.

429
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,000
Evil beings, disappear, disappear, disappear.

430
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,690
Evil beings, disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear.

431
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,760
What is this?

432
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,850
Teleportation?

433
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:24,360
Excuse me. Can you not see her?

434
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,390
She's over there.

435
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,730
What?

436
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,500
Are you saying that you don't trust me?

437
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,610
No.

438
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,340
Then...

439
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,420
this will work wonders.

440
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:50,200
"I'm hungry, give me some money to cross over."

441
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,500
Oh my gosh!

442
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,770
My ears hurt!

443
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,750
Mister Driver,

444
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,920
don't you think this is a waste of your hard earned money?

445
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,190
I think she's a fraud! A fraud!

446
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,890
Oh!

447
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,300
My ears.

448
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,040
Yes, Doctor.

449
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,500
This person is a really, really important customer.

450
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,430
It means I can't refuse because I have a ghost.

451
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,260
Come to think of it, everything would be fine without you.

452
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,680
The trunk or...

453
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,630
The roof! How about the roof?

454
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,290
What the hell?

455
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,650
Ghosts have human rights too.

456
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,440
Isn't the roof a bit too harsh?

457
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,480
Ghosts don't have rights! You're riding for free!

458
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,680
Look forward!

459
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,920
[Reserved]

460
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,110
Mr. Yeong Min, I received an urgent call, but my car is being repaired.

461
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:23,070
You said you were on the way just in time, so I decided to ask you.

462
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,520
Yes, I'll go as fast as I can.

463
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,970
Thank you.

464
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,250
Mister Driver. Mister Driver?

465
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,640
See? There are people who are fine!

466
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,190
It's just people with weak chi that can't get on because of a ghost.

467
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,570
That's a lame excuse.

468
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,500
See this person?

469
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,980
Breathing 45. Saturation fell to 80.

470
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,940
Test the ABG as soon as you go in.

471
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,130
Okay.

472
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,680
Oh, he's a doctor.

473
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,060
I wonder if I was like that.

474
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,060
Once the test is done, put the oxygen on and...

475
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,420
Mom... mom!

476
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,930
Daehoon Hospital emergency room, hurry!

477
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,290
Hey, Seo Yeong Min!

478
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:49,230
You didn't come when I called, but I heard you came right away when Dr. Do called you.

479
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,380
That's not cool.

480
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,630
Sorry, sorry. There's just been a lot going on.

481
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,080
By the way, I brought for Dr. Do. Could you give it to him?

482
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,240
Is that why you were waiting?

483
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,270
Give it to him yourself.

484
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,090
Should I get him for you? Wait here.

485
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,550
Wait here.

486
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,750
Mr. Yeong Min.

487
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,650
You're doing this again.

488
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:22,100
Well, you're probably tired these days, so take this and good luck.

489
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,430
You don't have to do this. How much longer are you going to keep this up?

490
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,080
It wouldn't be enough, even if I were to thank you my entire life.

491
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,100
I'll enjoy it.

492
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,050
Thank you, Mr. Yeong Min.

493
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,630
How sweet.

494
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,090
I wonder how they know each other.

495
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,990
Wait. This is your house. Right?

496
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:23,900
The empty parking lot is very dark with no street lamps,

497
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,310
and there are a lot of strange things too.

498
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,130
I was scared.

499
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:34,980
And probably it's inconvenient for you, too.

500
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,590
What is she going on about?

501
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:43,680
I really hate it there. I'm really scared!

502
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,320
So please, can't you park here?

503
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,450
I'll be good, please?

504
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:53,300
You saw how my grandma almost got hurt earlier, right?

505
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,090
Above all else, I can't stand something happening to my grandma.

506
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:00,990
Do not, do not come inside.

507
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,420
Of course, Mister Driver.

508
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,780
I'm not a god-less ghost.

509
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,100
As if ghosts have a god.

510
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,260
Good job today.

[Dongpa District Elderly Employment Portal]

512
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,100
I told her to just go and enjoy life, but she's looking at stuff like this again.

513
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,850
I wonder if she took her medicine today.

514
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:12,600
Grandma, wake up.

515
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,930
Grandma.

516
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,340
Yeong Min, you're home.

517
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,800
You should sleep in the bedroom.

518
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,760
Good night.

519
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,830
So pretty.

523
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,140
a ghost attached my taxi.

524
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:39,580
Is there a way to get rid of it?

525
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,040
It's bright at least, less scary.

526
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:57,460
Anyways, why can't I get away from this taxi?

527
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:02,270
To find that out, I should stick to him like glue.

528
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,850

538
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,630
Seriously?

539
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,080
What could "the door to the ghost realm has been opened" mean?

540
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:12,550
Well, anyway, what can I do? I'm the sole earner in this house.

541
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,030
Hello, Mister Driver.

542
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,630
Did you sleep well?

543
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:42,050
Why are you acting like this?

544
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:44,530
You're scary even if you're just there, and you're making it worse.

545
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:45,940
Why am I acting like this?

546
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,400
We were brought together by fate. Might as well be nice to each other.

547
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,600
Why would we be nice?

548
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,140
Do you have two personalities?

549
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,900
Never mind that, let's get in.

550
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,490
You need to earn money. The money that you like.

551
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,640
I've been thinking for a bit.

552
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,720
It's not like no one can get in the car because I'm in here.

553
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,260
And even yesterday, the doctor was fine.

554
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,960
So what I'm saying is,

555
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,020
I'll quickly move when the customers get in.

556
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:35,230
There's a customer right there.

557
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,840
Aren't you getting in?

558
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:01,080
Me?

559
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,740
Is it really okay for me to get in?

560
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,360
Of course.

561
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:10,910
Wow!

562
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,480
Did the door to the ghost realm really open?

563
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:40,310
Is that why they're all getting in? Like a buy one get one free?

564
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,400
You're no help to my life.

565
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:48,280
I mean, why is a ghost scared of another ghost?

566
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,160
This is my first time seeing a real ghost too. What am I supposed to do?

567
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,850
You're the first person I can talk to! Nice to meet you!

568
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:59,220
I mean, my taxi isn't some meeting place for ghosts or something,

569
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,810
- why are you doing this!
- Sir, there's something I have to tell you.

570
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,730
Wait!

571
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:08,080
I saw this person first.

572
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,320
It's not like it's first come, first serve.

573
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,710
Sir, I–

574
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,440
It hurts, hurts, it hurts.

575
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,770
Did you see that? I was so natural.

576
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,050
Maybe I was a security guard?

577
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,770
Let go, come on! Let me go.

578
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:28,350
Seriously, I'm staying still because you're a woman, if I decided to–

579
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:29,920
Decided to what?

580
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,000
Uncle, Uncle! Let go!

581
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:37,440
Are you a gangster? Who are you!?

582
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,050
- I know right? Who could I be?
- Sir, if you listen to me–

583
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,770
You're just acting weak, aren't you?

584
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:45,210
I'm telling you, I saw this person first.

585
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,180
I should be the first one to ask for favours?

586
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:50,410
- It's not important who goes first!
- This is a problem here!

587
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,130
Stop!

588
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,980
Do you think you're in line at a bank or something?

589
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,370
I mean, I'm telling you I saw this driver first.

590
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:03,960
And I'm saying, why is it important who saw him first?

591
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,200
How can a person have no manners like this? I'm first, and you're next.

592
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,940
I'm not a person, I'm a ghost.

593
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,880
You're being childish.

594
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,760
I was never childish, and also,

595
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,200
meeting a person who can see me for the first time, that's more important to me!

596
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:35,100
Oh, wow, why is the back of my neck hurting?

597
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,740
Mister Driver, I'm sorry.

598
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:42,910
Sir, Sir!

599
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,480
I'm screwed.

600
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,950
This taxi is done for.

601
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,910
- It's not like waiting is not important–
- What?

602
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:01,000
- Why?
- There's is no order in who goes first when you die.

603
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,010
Did you die first?

604
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:05,940
We're living in a world where that's not important.

605
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,950
How can you judge if you're more important than me–

606
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,710
I'm seeing all these random ghosts.

607
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:19,640
Why am I not seeing you, Mom?

608
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:23,230
I have something I really want to say to you.

609
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:26,170
Mom, I'm sorry, but...

610
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,720
I'm really sorry, but...

611
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,150
I don't think I can do it.

W-Wait! Mister Driver!

614
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,780
Think things over one more time.

615
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,080
You're currently ignoring two people, no,

616
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,010
you're ignoring the desperation of two ghosts.

617
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:20,530
Speaking of, if you'd just listen to me–

618
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,360
Hey! I said I'm first!

619
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,920
Say what you want to the next owner.

620
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,180
It was awful meeting you, and let's never meet again.

621
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:34,180
Wait! Other people can't see me!

622
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,880
Who I am, or why I died...

623
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,420
I can't end it without knowing anything.

624
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,460
That's...

625
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,710
your problem.

Can you see me?

632
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:08,790
Could you get the gold rings out of that car?

633
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,330
Gold?

My child is sick...

635
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,740
I got in a car accident while I was going to sell the ring from my child's hundredth day celebration, along with other gold pieces.

636
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,920
My wife then sold the car without knowing that.

637
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,880
My child is at the Sangjin hospital right now.

638
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,570

639
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:24,500

He says there's gold in this car! Gold!

643
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:40,980
It fell between here during the accident.

644
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,480
It's true.

645
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,460
We can use these to help pay for my child's hospital bills.

646
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,710
Do you think you could help?

647
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:01,200
Mister Driver, having a ghost around can be helpful sometimes.

648
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,810
So why don't you reconsider?

649
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:10,080
Sir! Are you interested in that car? You have a good eye!

Na Jeong, what is this? Who gave this to you?

658
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:37,350
Some ahjeoshi did.

659
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:41,220
And he said that dad gave this to me to give to you.

660
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,400
Dad?

661
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,830
If the dealer saw, they would've claimed it was his.

662
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,560
I see. That's why...

663
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,590
What is it?

664
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:39,310
Dad says this is yours.

665
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:44,110
Oh, thank you.

666
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:10,470
I guess ghosts can pay too.

667
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:16,110
Mister driver, where are you going?

668
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:20,450
Where do you think? I'm going to sell the taxi.

669
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,120
Mister Driver, I've been thinking,

670
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,880
and you should be more reasonable in situations like this.

671
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,650
Don't you need money right now?

672
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:37,940
You just need to drive the taxi and earn money. That money can come from ghosts.

673
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,740
Mister Driver, how much debt do you have?

674
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,760
Twenty million won.

675
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:46,270
Why? Are you going to give it to me?

676
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:49,760
That money, I'll give it to you!

677
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,960
I may not look it, but I was placed in the VIP room of the Daehoon Hospital Mortuary.

678
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,370
Wow! You had enough money to have your funeral in the Daehoon Hospital VIP room!

679
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:59,400
That place is so expensive!

680
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,980
You have to be at least...

681
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:09,090
a director level at a big company.

682
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:13,480
Of course. The VIP room at my hospital is very expensive!

683
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,970
Do you not think I can give you at least that much?

684
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:21,840
Ghosts...

685
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,480
can pay for taxi fees?

686
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,420
What do you think of a taxi just for ghosts?

687
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,270
A private taxi for ghosts.

688
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:37,910
Yes!

689
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:42,450
There are pet taxis that board cats and dogs,

690
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,740
and there are taxis that only deliver food.

691
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,480
Being in demand for driving ghosts only.

692
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,400
I'll be the sales manager.

693
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,760
I'll get every ghost that goes by,

694
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,130
so you can leave that part to me.

695
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:59,330

696
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,300
I guess ghosts can pay too.

697
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,160

01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:07,770
♫ You appear and disappear ♫

01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:10,470
[Delivery Man]

714
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:12,090
I'm glad I met you.

715
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,390
Who else would listen and help us?

716
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:17,460
I know you're in it for the money but I'm still grateful.

717
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,140
I will take you to your destination swiftly.

718
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:23,020
I died in a work accident after being married for only a month.

719
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,740
Industrial accident compensation was estimated at 300 million won ($246,000).

720
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,730
You said you were an orphan.

721
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:28,930
I don't have a mother.

722
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:31,050
I'm the idiot for trusting a ghost.

723
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:32,880
This photo.

724
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:37,670
We have to succeed. The Ghost Taxi.
