00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,080
These guys could kill me, right?

181
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,940
It's nice...

182
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,630
It's nice.

183
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,310
It's pretty...

184
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,250
It's pretty.

185
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,510
Why are you copying me?

186
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,670
Just because. I want to.

187
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,160
And also, thank you.

188
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,170
For what?

189
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,590
For coming to me.

190
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,900
Also for staying with me.

191
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:29,410
By the way, the flower boy said that ghosts pass on if they're in love.

192
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,920
How come you're still the same?

193
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,960
Right!

194
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,530
Why are you looking at me like that?

195
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,340
Ms. Ji Hyeon.

196
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,170
Are you sure you really love me?

197
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,700
Seeing that you're suspicious of me, you must be hiding something.

198
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,300
Maybe you just love me up to a certain degree?

199
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,210
Then what? Should I prove myself?

200
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,390
Prove yourself? What for?

201
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,310
Should I jump into the Han River? Or should I yell at people walking by?

202
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,550
Never mind.

203
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,440
What is all this?

204
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,560
I want to go home.

205
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,070
Okay, let's go.

206
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,080
Sure, let's go.

207
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,850
Let's go!

208
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,630
What did you see?

209
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,610
A Gh... ost. Yes.

210
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,880
A female ghost.

211
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,680
My company's employees said they often saw it.

212
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,090
The taxi drivers are fainting after seeing the female ghost.

213
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,860
They keep avoiding the evening shifts saying they don't want to, and now the company revenue is at a minus.

214
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,280
The atmosphere is all anxious and uneasy, it's very concerning.

215
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,800
Where was it again?

216
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,830
Morose studio apartments.

217
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,430
Aigo, aigo, aigo, my grandson, you're home.

218
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:40,300
How was your date today? Did you have fun?

219
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,570
No. Not really.

220
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,150
Me too. Not really.

221
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,740
Why?

222
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,140
She was a woman whose sincerity toward me is suspicious.

223
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,250
Look who's talking.

224
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,130
What does that mean?

225
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,820
I don't know.

226
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,930
I don't know, either.

227
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,630
[If the family is harmonious, everything will turn out well.]

228
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,600
I thought he went on a real date, he hasn't had one in a million years...

229
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,500
Why at this time of the day?

230
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,250
Hello?

231
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,490
Why are we here?

232
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,880
A ghost is haunting this place.

233
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,890
A ghost?

234
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,080
It's the mission of shamans like me

235
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:02,280
to help the poor souls wandering in this realm to pass on.

236
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,840
It's a great mission for the sake of our world, the world of the dead, and the whole universe.

237
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,530
But why did you bring me here?

238
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,650
Let's go.

239
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,750
What? There's nothing here.

240
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,110
Isn't it just a story that people made up?

241
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,420
Like a scary story?

242
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,120
Excuse me, you know...

243
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,480
Did you profess your love to her?

244
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,610
I told you over and over again not to do things you can't handle.

245
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,820
I can handle it and I am handling it!

246
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,240
You're definitely possessed.

247
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,400
By the way,

248
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,920
after they've loved someone sincerely, and professed their love,

249
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,160
what does it mean when the spirit doesn't pass on?

250
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,710
That is...

251
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,500
either they aren't sincerely in love,

252
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,750
or they're an evil spirit that can't feel any passion,

253
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,540
or...

254
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,380
it's a being other than a spirit.

255
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,060
An other being? What would that...

256
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,770
Wait.

257
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,450
Wow, what an ugly, malevolent energy...

258
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,280
What was that?

259
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,200
Stand back!

260
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,300
How dare that cunning, sly thing play a trick on the general.

261
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,800
Why on earth did you bring me here!?

262
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,600
Good job.

263
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,140
The flower boy said

264
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,160
that ghosts pass on if they're in love.

265
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,270
How come you're the same?

266
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,730
A date with my first love.

267
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,240
I've fulfilled my final wish.

268
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,330
I like Mr. Yeong Min,

269
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,110
but the rules don't apply to me.

270
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,910
Why am I still here?

271
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,660
[If the family is harmonious, everything will turn out well.]

272
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,910
That's either they aren't sincerely in love,

273
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:17,290
or they're an evil spirit that can't feel any passion.

274
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:22,290
[If the family is harmonious, everything will turn out well.]

275
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,800
[010-763-3114]

276
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,070
Hello?

277
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,490
Mr. Seo Yeong Min?

278
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,170
Yes, that's me.

279
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,580
Yes, I'm Kang Hyeong Su from the Bukdaemun police station.

280
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,590
Why did you want to see me?

281
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,390
Do you know Detective Ko Du Kang? The detective that used to be your partner.

282
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,930
You know the request that Ahjussi Ko Du Kang made?

283
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,770
I got a call from Detective Kang Hyeong Su last night.

284
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,510
He wants to meet.

285
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,280
That's good.

286
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,000
Let's push aside the uncomfortable feelings between us for now, and let's just focus on Ahjussi Du Kang's–

287
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,470
Of course. Involving personal feelings while on a job?

288
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,780
Only an amateur would do that, no?

289
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,400
Remember, I was a detective.

290
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,830
You just worry about yourself.

291
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,970
Okay. Let's go.

292
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,690
Fine.

293
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,710
Is this a dream, or reality?

294
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Thinking that I'd be meeting my old partner, Hyeong Su Hyeong.

295
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,040
Where is he? We have so much to talk about.

296
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,770
Mr. Seo Yeong Min?

297
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,380
Detective Kang Hyeong Su.

298
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,710
Hyungnim, it's me.

299
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,780
It's me, Du Kang, your partner.

300
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,440
Take a seat.

301
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,050
Thank you for coming out.

302
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,710
Hyungnim.

303
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,700
Hyungnim, how have you been?

304
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,860
What can I do for you?

305
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,120
Why do I feel this way?

306
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,100
What is it?

307
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:30,370
I'm someone who was helped immensely by Mr. Ko Du Kang.

308
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,060
I must be crazy.

309
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,730
One moment please.

310
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,390
Ms. Ji Hyeon!

311
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,330
Are you okay? What's wrong?

312
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,600
I don't know, either.

313
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,680
I just feel so sad.

314
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,680
Rest a bit. I'll be right back.

315
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,740
I heard that Mr. Ko passed away five years ago.

316
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,270
Yes.

317
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,670
I didn't know until now, and just heard the news.

318
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,700
After I succeeded in life,

319
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,250
I wanted to repay him.

320
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:01,500
So at least to his daughter I want to express my gratitude.

321
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,280
Mr. Du Kang's daughter's name is Ko Se Ra, right?

322
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,410
I thought you'd know miss Ko Se Ra.

323
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,620
Please help us find my daughter.

324
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,060
Please?

325
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:27,850
Se Ra lives in the United States.

326
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,840
Then could I at least have her contact information?

327
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:42,360
I feel indebted to Mr. Ko Du Kang.

328
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,000
She's in Korea right now.

329
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,020
Sorry?

330
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,070
Se Ra is in Korea.

331
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,690
I found out through an article I saw.

332
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,380
She's here for some seminar.

333
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,370
Seminar.

334
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:17,900
That's great. I can meet Miss Se Ra.

335
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,490
After I got your call, I was reminded of something,

336
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,110
so I was about to go meet her as well.

337
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,190
There's something I have to give her.

338
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,810
Oh, did you get the search warrant?

339
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,660
I don't think we can investigate Kim Jeong Wu.

340
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,860
Why not?

341
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,670
His history has no direct relations with neither the Kang Ji Hyeon case that we're investigating,

342
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,350
nor with Mrs. Kim Jin Suk's hit and run.

343
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,430
Also, we have no objective evidence to back up this investigation.

344
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:53,680
That's why we're saying we're going to look into it deeper!

345
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,840
Also, Daehun Medical Center is hesitant to speak about Kim Jeong Wu drug theft.

346
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,780
[Kim Jeong Wu / Kim Hui Yeon / Gu Bong]

347
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,420
Seeing that my Se Ra's name is in the newspaper, she must be quite successful.

348
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,060
Even when she was young, she was smart, you know?

349
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:20,560
She grew up so well on her own without me.

350
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:25,430
It's great that you'll be able to see your daughter.

351
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,150
Ms. Ji Hyeon, are you okay?

352
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,910
Of course. I'm fine.

353
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,470
I'm super good!

354
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,020
Give and take, now then.

355
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,690
It's time you give us information.

356
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,690
Nurse Kim Jeong Wu.

357
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,570
Nurse Kim has something in his private locker, and what may that be?

358
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,390
You said Nurse Kim Jeong Wu was fired.

359
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:04,260
If he was fired, he probably took everything personal with him. Would there be anything left?

360
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,420
I misspoke. It's just...

361
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,390
Nurse Kim, in his personal locker, not now, but in the past. In the past,

362
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,400
what was in that locker...

363
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,760
Some very dangerous drug was in there.

364
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,130
What kind of drug?

365
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:39,790
That's all! Until next time for the name of the drug. "Give and take."

366
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,240
Is he joking?

367
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,310
However, I sensed something.

368
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,780
I think this will be a very crucial piece of evidence.

370
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,840
As humans, we are born, crawl on all fours,

371
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,950
and walk on our two feet,

372
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:32,390
acquire intelligence, and live a full life.

373
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,330
The process of a human growing up–

374
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,630
- can be seen in a robot's muscles, and movements.
- My Se Ra is so cool.

375
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,710
- They can control their facial expressions...
- She grew up so well.

and can even converse with humans.

377
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:46,360
However, even then, a robot cannot share human emotions.

Hey, I'm going to wait outside.

379
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,890
- Why?
- I just don't feel very well.

380
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,210
It's not bad enough to make me pass on, though.

381

Don't worry about me.

The direction that human technology should go is clear.

Our loving family, our neighbors, and to go further, the whole of humanity.

384

The unlimited love toward humans that us scientists have in our hearts,

385
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:17,200
I believe it may be a journey toward finding true humanism.

waited and missed you, and finally, he's come all the way here.

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,300
A few months ago,

473
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:39,830
my mother suddenly passed away in an accident.

474
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:52,030
I wanted to say I'm sorry and say that I'm grateful to have been born as her son.

475
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,600
I wanted to say that,

476
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,380
but I couldn't because she passed away so suddenly.

477
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,620

I mean, it's an ability to see souls.

That's how I can see Mr. Du Kang.

480
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:25,830
It's just a shame that my mother is the only one I can't see.

481
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:30,060
However, after meeting other spirits,

482
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:34,120
I learned that my mother is always, wherever or whenever,

He always loved you, and worried about you,

486
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,660
but he couldn't express it.

487
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,330
"Later."

488
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,710
"I could do it later."

489
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,610
And then suddenly, he passed away.

The old USB that you supposedly carried around with you and that miniature robot,

Finally,

513

However, I still don't understand you.

521
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:28,110
More than family, more than your child, was work so important?

522
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:33,450
Even now, it still doesn't make sense to me.

00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,300
death anniversary.

533
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,490
Everyone's probably waiting for you. What are you doing here?

534
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,740
The grandfather that I never liked.

535
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,950
Are you telling me to act like I liked him?

536
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:51,600
The people who followed him are still keeping an eye on you.

537
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,990
Even if you don't feel like it–

538
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:55,940
Noona, I brought the champagne you like.

539
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,890
Sit down. Let's drink.

540
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,820
Noona.

541
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,100
I...

542
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,790
can't forget that day.

543
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:41,210
The day that you freed me.

544
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,320
That day.

545
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,340
Why did you do that to your friend?

546
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,290
Why did you stab your friends face with a pencil!?

547
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:53,690
They were laughing.

548
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:58,490
My friend's story wasn't funny at all but they smiled widely–

549
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:00,440
Chairman!

550
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:02,480
Hello.

551
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,630
Who are you?

552
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,440
Who the hell are you?

553
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,480
I'm Kim Hui Yeon, I'm your personal nurse starting today.

554
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,410
Wait outside!

555
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:12,920
No, Chairman.

556
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,900
What?

557
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,000
If you hit him further, I'll call the police.

558
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,600
It must've hurt a lot.

559
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,270
Should we go to the hospital?

560
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:29,700
It's okay. This happens all the time.

561
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,590
Does your grandfather often hit you?

562
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:38,930
My mother and father passed away, just like yours.

563
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:42,030
Until now...

564
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,000
you must've had a hard time being all alone.

565
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:50,310
From now on, I'll protect you.

566
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:57,430
"You'll protect me"?

567
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:00,400
Yes.

568
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,220
I love it.

569
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,100
Noona.

570
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,770
From now on, will you be my noona?

571
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,870
When I was sad and in pain,

572
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,470
the only person that protected me,

573
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,940
was you.

574
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:28,220
So...

575
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,300
you'll be by my side until the very end, right?

576
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,850
Yes.

577
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,290
Of course.

578
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,230
Busan Gwangjun 8091?

579
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:13,280
But why did this get discovered here now?

580
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,410
[Emergency Room]

581
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,400
Why did we come here again?

582
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,190
Remember what Mr. Du Kang said?

583
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:26,330
There's a suspicious drug in nurse Kim Jeong Wu's locker.

584
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:27,640
What's this?

585
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,520
Why are you here again in the middle of a night?

586
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,490
So Ri.

587
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:33,230
Oh, right. You lied to your grandmother.

588
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:36,300
You told her you have a girlfriend and that you went on a date.

589
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,930
Huh?

590
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:39,520
Oh, yes.

591
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:43,010
I know you said it was to make grandma feel happier,

592
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:45,220
but why would you tell a lie that would be discovered so quickly?

593
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:48,640
What if grandma asks to see your girlfriend?

594
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,660
It's not a lie, though.

595
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,230
So Ri, I have a favor to ask.

596
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:55,300
Can you show me nurse Kim Jeong Wu's personal locker?

597
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,110
There's something I have to confirm.

598
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,160
What are you saying?

599
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,850
You can't just see someone else's locker without permission.

600
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,210
You're talking nonsense.

601
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,700
So Ri, please.

602
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:12,970
It's really important to me, so help me.

603
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,180
I'm not suppose to...

[Nursing Department (Male)]
[Changing Room]

605
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,100
Anything?

606
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,350
It's already been all cleared out, so there's nothing there.

607
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,370
Are you sure you checked nurse Kim Jeong Wu's locker?

608
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:41,370
I checked two, three times. It's his.

609
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:45,430
If there's nothing, at least ask for his address.

610
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:49,740
Then can you give me his address?

611
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:53,850
Yeong Min, I understand how you feel.

612
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:58,190
After your mom passed away like that, I felt awful, too.

613
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:00,010
So it must be worse for you.

614
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,820
I understand you entirely.

615
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:10,320
But it seems like you've almost stopped driving your taxi, and you're obsesed with you mom's case.

616
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,520
So just drop it and leave things to the police.

617
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,650
I want to,

618
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,390
but I can't.

619
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,050
How come?

620
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,230
What's the reason?

621
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:31,200
I'll explain it all in the future, so

622
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,080
just this once. Please help me.

623
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,890
Yeong Min, I'm so worried

624
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:43,180
that something might happen to you too if you keep going on like this.

625
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:46,930
Miss So Ri is a really good friend.

626
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:52,940
Don't worry.

627
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,990
Nothing will happen to me.

Please find Jeong Wu Oppa for me.

How did you die?

632
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:10,370
I don't remember.

633
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:12,140
I was high.

634
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,210
Could Mr. Kim Jeong Wu have...

635
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:18,570
No! There's no way.

636
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:21,500
He was so good to me.

637
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,600
Anyway, please find him.

00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,840
I can't leave until I see him.

639

640
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,670
As expected, the culprit was Kim Jeong Wu.
