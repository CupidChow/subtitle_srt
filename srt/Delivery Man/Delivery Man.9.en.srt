180
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,070
That's cool.

181
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,940
I was an aspiring policeman, too.

182
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,200
I was preparing for the exam.

183
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,430
No wonder your detective skills are extraordinary.

184
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,700
Why did you quit?

185
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,130
I didn't quit.

186
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,240
I just temporarily put it aside.

187
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,310
After my mom died, I had to pay back the debt first.

188
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,890
I see.

189
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,980
You're free to go.

190
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,290
Am I being released?

191
00:15:54,290 --> 00:16:00,130
According to forensics, the body found in Kim Jeong Wu's apartment was deceased for over a week,

192
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:04,450
and your fingerprints weren't on the ampoule or the needles, so your charges are cleared.

193
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:09,030
See? I told you that Mr. Yeong Min is innocent.

194
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,180
Furthermore, a helmet and riding gloves

195
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,350
were found near the Morose studio apartments.

196
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,780
A DNA test of the hair found in the helmet

197
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,160
revealed that it belonged to nurse Kim Jeong Wu.

198
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,180
We are assuming that the culprit in this series of incidents

199
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,650
is nurse Kim Jeong Wu.

200
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,930
Are you saying both my mother's hit-and-run accident,

201
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,120
and Detective Kang Ji Hyeon's case

202
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,460
were Kim Jeong Wu's doing?

203
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,180
It's too premature to conclude anything yet,

204
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,170
but there's a high possibility.

205
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,200
Kim Jeong Wu.

206
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,820
Ask if he's arrested Kim Jeong Wu.

207
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,860
Have you

208
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,010
arrested Kim Jeong Wu?

00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,830
Not yet.

210
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,830
However, there's a wanted order that will be issued across the country.

211
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,450
I understand your point of view,

212
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,360
but you're not a policeman. It's problematic to act on your own accord.

213
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,860
We're doing our best so trust us and leave things to us.

214
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,010
Kim Jeong Wu needs to be found soon.

215
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:31,100
The wanted order went out, so he will be found soon.

Of course! I'm your daughter.

239
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:05,240
I couldn't recognize my own father. How pathetic?

240
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,190
It's because you lost your memory.

241
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,280
It's not your fault, so don't be too hard on yourself.

242

Don't tell Dad that I'm there.

I think it'd really hurt him.

251
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,720
Okay. I won't tell him.

252
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,980

May I come in for a second?

260

Well...

00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,430
I saw the poster on the police bulletin board.

273

I see.

275
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,440
So you had something to say about my Ji Hyeon?

00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,220
Yes.

What is it?

278
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,400
My mother Kim Jin Suk, who was a taxi driver,

279
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,810
died last April 12, in front of the Morose studio apartments in a hit and run accident.

280
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,300
Are you that driver's son?

281
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,340
Yes.

282
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,290
I heard that Detective Kang Ji Hyeon passed away that same day.

283
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,300
Is that true?

284
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,150

286
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,890

00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,840
also good friends.

291
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,440
I see.

292
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,590
So what did you want to tell me?

293
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:38,560
From the beginning, I thought that my mother and Kang Ji Hyeon's cases were related

294
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,870
and was investigating the cases simultaneously. Of course, secretly.

295
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:49,280
I heard that nurse Kim Jeong Wu from Daehun Medical Center is the suspect in both cases.

296

I'm aware. However, I feel like something's off.

297
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,990
"Something's off"? What do you mean?

298
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,220
Apparently, the photos found in the apartment don't belong to Kim Jeong Wu.

299
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,920
She said they weren't there before.

300
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:08,730
To tell you the truth, I don't have any concrete evidence.

301

That's why I came to you.

302
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,830

00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,210
could make it hard for the both of us,

358
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,690
and I'm aware that

359
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,490
we're destined to eventually part from each other.

360
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:36,630
I'm well aware of all of that. I know, I know it all, but...

361
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:41,890
even so thinking of saying goodbye to you...

362
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,940
is too hard for me.

363
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:53,430
I'm sorry about yesterday.

364
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,380
No. I'm more sorry.

365
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,650
[Murder Suspects]
[Kim Jeong Wu (Born `94, M) / Incident date: Sept 15 2022 ]

366
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,330
What are you staring at?

367
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,010
Don't you think it's strange?

368
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,600
Strange? What is?

369
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,390
The evidence that was found in Kim Jeong Wu's apartment.

370
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,250
Don't you think it's too perfect?

371
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:31,440
Yes. They're the perfect evidence that points to Kim Jeong Wu as the culprit.

372
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:36,480
I mean, if you were the culprit,

373
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,170
would you have brought and left all these pieces of evidence at home?

374
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:44,900
It'd be as if you were advertising "I'm the culprit," you know?

375
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:53,760
Well, maybe because his house was safest place to hide them?

376
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,690
No. Something's off.

377
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,200
It doesn't feel like the puzzle pieces fit perfectly,

378
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,180
but rather, it feels like they were forced together.

379
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,300
It's really not him!

380
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,100
He was so good to me!

381
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,270
He's a suspect in my murder? No way.

382
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:23,650
It might be that you don't realize Mr. Kim Jeong Wu is the culprit.

383
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,810
There are cases where the people closest to them have no idea.

384
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,130
There's no way!

385
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:33,600
Oppa Jeong Wu had the hardest time out of everyone if someone died at the hospital.

386
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,850
He's not a person who would do bad things!

387
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,930
Then who do you think killed you?

388
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,420
I don't know.

389
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,640
I was hazy from the drugs.

390
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:51,270
Even so, I was sure it wasn't him.

391
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:56,430
The hands that gave me the shot they weren't Oppa's.

392
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,750
Let's look for Mr. Kim Jeong Wu first.

393
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,450
We have to find him to know for certain whether or not he's the culprit, don't you think?

394
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:10,960
Then can you think of anywhere Mr. Kim Jeong Wu would be hiding?

395
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,620
Somewhere that only he knows, not many people pass by,

396
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,010
and that's isolated from the outside.

397
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,780
There is this one place.

398
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,710
I came here with him.

399
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,200
If you go over that way, there's a huge reservoir too.

400
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,160
We used to fish with nurse Kim Hui Yeon too.

401
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,390
Nurse Kim Hui Yeon?

402
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:45,860
Yes. This villa belongs to nurse Kim Hui Yeon.

403
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,950
Even if it's far from the city,

404
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:52,130
a villa this size must be pretty expensive.

405
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:56,610
Nurse Kim Hui Yeon's family must be quite wealthy, right?

406
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:00,590
Not at all. She grew up in an orphanage.

407
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,880
An orphanage?

408
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,840
Yes.

409
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,740
Let's go in first.

410
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,260
Mr. Yeong Min, you stay here for now.

411
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:35,170
Ms. Mi Kyeong and I will look for him inside.

412
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,950
Be careful.

413
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,860
How did he find out about that place?

414
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,780
He wasn't here either?

415
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,870
No.

416
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,840
Where on earth could Kim Jeong Wu be?

417
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,570
I was hoping he'd be here.

418
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,210
He liked this place.

419
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,730
First of all, it's free,

420
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:35,470
and no one comes around, so he could rest without being disturbed.

421
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,980
That's why we were here that day too.

422
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,140
That day?

423
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,110
The day the hit and run accident happened in front of the studio apartments.

424
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,760
The day of the hit-and-run accident?

425
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,720
Yes. We came here that day.

426
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,080
It was my birthday,

427
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,580
so we asked nurse Kim Hui Yeon for a favor and borrowed it.

428
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,680
Around... what time was that?

429
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,900
It was after he came from the hospital and ate dinner, so

430
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,550
around midnight.

431
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:11,350
It was really dark, so it was scary.

432
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,920
How much do you know?

433
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:51,880
Noona. Seo Yeong Min just showed up at the villa.

434
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:57,480
You probably didn't tell him anything.

435
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,980
Anyway, bye for now.

436
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:18,530
Do you think there's a possibility that Ms. Mi Kyeong is the culprit?

437
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:23,390
I think that's pushing it a bit much.

438
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,460
And also, seeing how Ms. Mi Kyeong is putting so much effort

439
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,770
into finding Kim Jeong Wu,

440
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:32,970
I think she's certain that Kim Jeong Wu isn't the culprit.

441
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,550
That's true.

442
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:39,130
There's one thing that's bothering me.

443
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:44,730
I was a bit too distracted to notice then,

444
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:47,810
but I was thinking about it, and I think it's odd.

445
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,820
What is?

446
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,520
Nurse Kim Hui Yeon.

447
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,250
Kim Hui Yeon probably saw Ms. Mi Kyeong dead for the first time back there,

448
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,580
but she didn't look surprised at all.

449
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:03,600
It was as if she already knew that she was dead.

450
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,160
Perhaps it's because she's a nurse, and it's the nature of her job?

451
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,930
Well, even so,

452
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:24,300
if you saw someone you knew lying there dead, you wouldn't react like that.

453
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,520
Wouldn't someone usually get surprised first?

454
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,030
Calling the police would be secondary.

455
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,730
Then...

456
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:40,120
No matter how I look at it, Kim Mi Hyeon is suspicious.

457
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,110
Dad's here.

458
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,130
Hello.

459
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,000
What brings you here?

460
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:05,100
That's everything I've learned.

461
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:09,960
How on earth... How did she die... Where...

462
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,460
What was her cause of death?

463
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,400
Tell us, Dad.

464
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,170
There's a girl named Min Seo...

465
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:27,030
she's my Ji Hyeon's best friend, and she got pregnant after trying very hard.

466
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:34,240
But then, she unfortunately and unexpectedly died, at Daehun Medical Center.

467
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,180
Daehun Medical Center?

468
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,790
At first, she thought it was just a simple death.

469
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,540
However,

470
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:48,460
she witnessed a questionable private investigator taking photographs of the bereaved family.

471
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,480
Ji Hyeon was interrogating private investigator Gu Bong

472
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,430
and discovered that he took a job from someone

473
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:58,170
and had been taking photos of bereaved families of the patients who died at Daehun Medical Center.

474
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,470
Ji Hyeon died while trying to track down the person who commissioned the job.

475
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,490
By the way, evidence was found.

476
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:09,220
There was a police announcement saying that Kim Jeong Wu was the prime suspect.

477
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,350
Why are you not satisfied?

478
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,770
Mr. Yeong Min. Tell him about what we found out.

479
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:29,010
That day, on the very day of the accident.

480
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,350
The culprit killed my mother in a hit-and-run accident,

481
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:38,240
abandoned the detective on the ground just like that, and fled.

482
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:43,560
There's a saying that "criminals are very diligent."

483
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,260
There's nothing they can't do if they put their mind to it.

484
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,560
That's not true, Dad!

485
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,900
Kim Jeong Wu could be the culprit in the hit and run case,

486
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,590
but he's probably not the one who left Detective Kang Ji Hyeon

487
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,550
because Kim Jeong Wu was at a different place at the time.

488
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,070
Is that true?

489
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:04,020
We can't conclude that Kim Jeong Wu is not the culprit,

490
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,400
but at the very least, we know that they didn't act alone.

491
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,540
What happened?

492
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,550
Mom fell in the bathroom.

493
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:29,600
I should've went with her! Please save my mother! Please save her!

494
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,540
Yes, I understand.

495
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,310
Please calm down, and wait for just a moment.

496
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:36,610
Patient, can you hear my voice?

497
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,660
Excuse me,

498
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,410
my mom has Alzheimer's disease.

499
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,810
Patient, you can hear me, right?

500
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,740
Luckily, she's conscious.

501
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:57,590
She's a fall patient, so let's take a CT scan and an X-ray to see if she has any fractures or a concussion.

502
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,440
Mom.

503
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,770
Doctor! Don't you know that patient?

504
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:13,760
The fall patient.

505
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:17,000
I don't think so. Who was it?

506
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,420
Her daughter is a taxi driver.

507
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,960
She's close with Yeong Min, too.

508
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,410
Are they friends with Mr. Yeong Min?

509
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,540
She was on "How is This Possible!"
(T/N: A television show in Korea.)

510
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,830
as the filial taxi driver.

511
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:29,840
I think I did see that.

512
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,820
A filial taxi driver that will never exist again.

513
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,570
Yes, that's her.

514
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,140
She's asleep.

515
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:08,690
How is my mom?

516
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:11,170
Luckily, she hasn't hurt herself badly anywhere,

517
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,560
but she's quite old and has chronic illnesses,

518
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,030
so I think it'd be best for her to be admitted for about two days to keep an eye on her.

519
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:22,760
Thank you. Thank you.

520
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,660
Mom, you need to wake up soon.

521
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,730
I can't live without you, Mom.

522
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:44,820
So let's get better soon,

523
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,410
okay?

524
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,110
Doctor!

525
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,280
Where are you going?

526
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,720
I have some business to take care of.

527
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,680
I'll see you later, nurse Kim.

528
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,140
Nurse Kim, can you come check this out?

529
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,090
Yes!

530
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,470
You want us to investigate nurse Kim Hui Yeon?

531
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,270
What's the reason?

532
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:48,370
Is it because nurse Kim Hui Yeon reported you last time?

533
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,150
That's not it.

534
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:55,960
If it's not that, did you find something suspicious about her?

535
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,600
Don't hold anything back.

536
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,190
There shouldn't be anything unclear in an investigation.

537
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:13,070
On the day of the murder, around 11:10 p.m.,

538
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,790
Nurse Kim Jeong Wu was passing through the Hanju toll gate.

539
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,210
Kim Jeong Wu drove a rental car that day.

540
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:22,000
I went to the rental agency and checked the dash camera of the vehicle before coming here.

541
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,980
That means...

542
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,060
So we at least know that the suspect who left Detective Kang Ji Hyeon in front the house

543
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:32,630
was not Kim Jeong Wu.

544
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:33,850
That's correct.

545
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:37,160
It means that Kim Jeong Wu may have had an accomplice.

546
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:43,100
Also, there's a villa that nurse Kim Hui Yeon owns.

547
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:49,820
What's so strange about nurse Kim Hui Yeon's villa?

548
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,440
Nurse Kim Hui Yeon

549
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:57,700
is from an orphanage, and she even had to get a student loan for nursing school.

550
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:03,150
In addition, the studio apartment that she's living at doesn't belong to her, but rather, is rented.

551
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,190
Don't you think that's a bit strange?

552
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:09,730
Nurse Kim Hui Yeon and Nurse Kim Jeong Wu were colleagues who worked in the same hospital,

553
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,940
and lived in the same studio apartment building, on the same floor.

554
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:18,920
Also, they were close enough to meet up at her villa.

555
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,080
Looking at all of this, Seo Yeong Min, and I,

556
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,970
think Kim Hui Yeon may know Kim Jeong Wu's whereabouts.

557
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:31,760
That's right. Kim Hui Yeon definitely knows where Kim Jeong Wu is.

558
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,900
[The police are the citizen, the citizen are the police.]

559
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,800
I understand, Seonbae,

560
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,710
however, acting on your own is very troublesome for us.

561
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,950
Also, Mr. Seo Yeong Min,

562
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:46,110
I'm sure that I requested last time for you to leave the investigation to us.

563
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:49,200
Can't you understand how Seo Yeong Min feels?

564
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,250
I guess the feeling of losing a precious family member...

565
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,390
is something that a person who hasn't experienced it can't understand.

566
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:00,200
But Seonbae-nim, if something were to happen to Mr. Seo Yeong Min–

567
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,100
I'll be responsible for him, so don't worry about it.

568
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,740
Anyway, what's the progress on investigating private investigator Gu Bong?

569
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,730
I was just about to go there.

570
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:15,400
Good, let's go together.

571
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,460
Seonbae-nim!

572
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,190
Are you coming with us?

573
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,500
Of course.

574
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,650
Yes, Hyung?

575
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,900
What did you say?

576
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,740
Thank you.

577
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:04,770
I should've took better care of her.

578
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:07,960
I'm so sorry.

579
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,260
Why are you sorry?

580
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,700
The fact that you took care of my mother so dearly.

581
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,370
I know it very well.

582
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:23,010
My condolences.

583
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,250
Thank you so much for coming.

584
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,580
You're here.

585
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,410
Ajussi, where's Seok Jin?

586
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:03,480
Eun Su is distracted, so he's taken on the role of chief mourner.

587
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,340
Come on in.

588
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,050
Mr. Yeong Min. Mr. Yeong Min!

589
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,570
What's wrong Ms. Ji Hyeon?

590
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:30,240
I just saw something weird.

591
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,610
Dr. Gyu Jin... laughed.

592
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,020
What?

593
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:40,050
I said Dr. Gyu Jin was laughing.

594
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,820
That's nonsense.

595
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,040
You must be mistaken.

596
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,540
No, I'm not. I'm sure I saw it.

597
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:07,210
My Ji Hyeon started her investigation at Gu Bong investigator's office too.

598
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:10,470
So we should start over from here again.

599
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:15,390
I let you come along because I couldn't just defy your will,

600
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:18,330
but this really is the last time.

601
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:23,490
Is anyone here?

602
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,800
Mr. Gu Bong, are you–

603
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,620
Team Leader...

604
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,620
What's this now?

605
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,270
This is Ji Chang Seok from violent crimes, 2nd team.

606
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,840
There was a murder. Please send the forensic squad.

607
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,520
The location is GB P.I's office, who's currently under investigation.

608
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:17,950
Yes?

609
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:35,350
Gyu Jin, can't we stop now?

610
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:42,910
The police, and Seo Yeong Min, I don't know how much they know.

611
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,240
In the worst case we could...

612
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,780
Noona, that's not going to happen.

613
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:50,730
Don't you trust me?

614
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:01,750
If we make sure to clean up, there won't be a problem.

615
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,800
Seo Yeong Min, and the police,

616
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,970
I'm going to clean up our traces so they can't come near us,

617
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,750
so... don't worry.

618
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,550
You know, right?

619
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:18,790
The only person I trust in this world is you?

620
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,360
Trust me.

621
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:31,390
You scum!

622
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:33,390
Chairman, calm down!

623
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:36,330
It's a disgrace that someone like you is in my bloodline!

624
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:38,460
Just die!

625
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,850
Chairman, Chairman! Please, Chairman!

626
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:29,530
Yes, I'll get rid of it.

627
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,360
Wait...

628
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,770
I should keep one piece of incriminating evidence just in case.

629
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:42,490
♫ I didn't love you with my whole heart ♫

630
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:45,720
♫ I didn't love you ♫

631
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:53,890
♫ I miss the times when we were 'us', like crazy ♫

632
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:57,580
♫ I thought I'd be okay ♫

633
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:03,030
♫ I didn't know I'd miss you now ♫

634
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:09,730
♫ I didn't love you with my whole heart, but I do now ♫

635
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,950
[Delivery Man]

636
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:15,570
You're here, Yeong Min.

637
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:17,030
Why is that person...

638
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:20,030
I see that you have a really old charger.

639
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:24,470
On the last day before he left our home, he read that and left in a hurry.

640
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:28,150
If coincidences keeps occurring, then they're not coincidences.

641
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:36,240
Someone who feels intimidating, but also distant, and someone who's nearby.

642
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,410
Seo Yeong Min is suspicious of you.

643
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:40,760
I couldn't find the original yet.

644
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,030
How about I become the bait?

645
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:47,100
I will submit this memo to the police.

646
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,350
Mr. Yeong Min!
