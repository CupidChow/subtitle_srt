I'll come, too.

I was in a hurry, so I lost the child's backpack,

188

but I heard you kept it safe.

189
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,000

I had a hard time regaining my composure.

The first thing we learn is "patient triage priority," right?

202
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,620
So sometimes, we have to triage our different emotions too

203
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,590
because there are more urgent matters, we have to push aside our sad feelings for a moment.

204

As front-line workers, we do our best to make the right decisions that could mean life or death.

Why are you talking right into my ear?

00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,890
I told you that you'd visit me.

00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,360
Let's go in.

370
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:49,010
By the way, why are ghosts using my taxi?

371
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,240
Right,

372
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,770
if you look at the big picture, ghosts are spirits tied to a specific area.

373
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,610
You can view it as them being tied to a person with whom they're most close with

374
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,940
or places where they still have grievances.

375
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,510
But can they move when they're in your taxi?

376
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,280
It's probably because of the ghost that's stuck to your taxi.

377
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,740
To put it more simply,

378
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,760
your taxi can move ghosts to different places without stopping, is like an express service.

379
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,260
It's like the KTX of the ghost realm.
(T/N: The KTX is a bullet train from Seoul to Busan)

383
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,930
Her memory is lost, and she's stuck to a phone.

384
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,960

Children these days sure are clever.

389

How do ghosts change their clothing?

390
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,890
Easy.

391
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,400
Are you saying they can? How?

392
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Hand it over first.

393
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,500
How do they change?

394
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,940
Naturally. They just need to pass through it.

395
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,960
That's it?

396
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,710
What a waste.

397
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,750
But people hate clothes that ghosts went through,

398
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,480
so keep that in mind.

399
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,980
It's frustrating. I can't even see my own face.

400
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,380
Aren't there any mirrors out there that can reflect a ghost?

401
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,700
What's this mirror?

402
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,430
Why am I not being reflected?

00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:58,470
do I wear the outfit I had on before?

427
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,260
I don't actually know.

428

Do we need to buy the clothing again?

429
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,600
Why are you asking him to buy clothes when you can just wear it?

430
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,630
Because if ghosts like us put in on, people won't buy it.

431
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,990
They don't deserve that.

432

That's true.

433
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,850

434
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,990

Don't talk down to me.

516
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:47,360

00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,910
Do you believe in destiny, too?

524
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,640
Isn't it amazing?

525
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,720
What are the odds of meeting a dead high school friend?

526
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,080
Are you calling that destiny?

527
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:02,060
It's not stranger than running a ghost taxi because a ghost got attached to it.

528
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,660
This is destiny!

529
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,010
Why are you getting so angry?

530
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,870
Everyone and their mother keeps saying destiny.

531
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,170
It'll hurt a bit.

532
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,420
Did you check his blood pressure?

533
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,840
Yes. I did.

534
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,860
It was normal.

535
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,680
Sir, you said you fainted because your head was hurting.

536
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,510
You take blood pressure medicine regularly, right?

537
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,010
Yes.

538
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,290
How did you?

539
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,920
Did you ever feel strange after taking your medicine recently?

540
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:01,260
Well, my prescription was changed, and my body felt a bit strange, and...

541
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,360
Stop, and check the blood pressure again.

542
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,880
I really checked. It was fine earlier.

543
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,030
Give him one Adalat pill.

544
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,330
Okay.

545
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:30,180
- Patient, let's try breathing calmly.
- Okay.

546
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,900
Relax, and breathe in slowly,

547
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,190
now breathe out slowly.

548
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,570
One more time, breathe in slowly,

549
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:42,010
breathe out slowly.

550
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,480
Follow me.

551
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:06,440
Don't you know that there could be brain hemorrhaging or other side effects if the patient's blood pressure rises?

552
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,450
Are you going to take full responsibility if something goes wrong?

553
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,270
- I'm sorry.
- About what?

554
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,110
If you're not sincere, don't apologize.

555
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:24,030
- Sorry?
- Don't come to work thinking, "I just need to get through this one moment."

556
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,680
I'll be watching you.

557
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,290
I sent my child away well.

558
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:32,200
Thank you for checking in on us.

559
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,630
Code blue, code blue.

560
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:40,820
Why do you do that?

561
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,430
"Why do you do that?"

562
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,690
Nurse Kim, can I see the E.R. CPR statistics?

563
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,900
For the past year?

564
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,100
No, ever since Mr. Kim Jeong Wu started working here.

565
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,110
My second bucket list item is:
[Shin Wu's bucket list]

566
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,930
to go on a date at a top-notch restaurant.
[Going on a date at a top-notch restaurant]

567
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,870
Did you reserve a restaurant?

568
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:05,240
Is this the five star restaurant?

569
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,480
It's food delivered from a five star restaurant.

570
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,740
I mean, the decor is important! The decor!

571
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:17,630
I can't just book a restaurant, order food for three, and then eat steak by myself.

572
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:21,200
This feels like a really nice restaurant to me.

573
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,900
Don't you think, Shin Wu?

574
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,100
I think so, too.

575
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,830
But what I'm talking about is music!

576
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,140
What about music?

577
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,820
A perfect restaurant needs music.

578
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,150
There you go.

579
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,180
Do you not even have a speaker?

580
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:49,750
Oh, maybe I should've borrowed the Italian speakers from Seok Jin.

581
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:54,710
Grandma, come have dinner!

582
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:07,520
Wow, Grandma, you're so gorgeous.

583
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,280
Why did my grandson go so out of his way?

584
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,070
Did you order this much just for me?

585
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,220
It must be so delicious.

586
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,450
I want to eat, too.

587
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,210
What is this situation?

588
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,590
Come on, we can't even eat.

589
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:44,020
It's fine if grandma eats at least.

590
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:48,050
Ji Hyeon, you have such a good heart.

591
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,460
Ji Hyeon,

592
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,770
do you like red wine?

593
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,970
I think french wine would suit you.

594
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,610
Do you want to smell it, too?

595
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,430
Okay.

596
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,000
Grandma, how was singing class today?

597
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,790
Should I sing something?

598
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,590
Yes!

606

I really want to drink, too.

607
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:09,210
I think I probably was a great drinker.

608
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,910
Ji Hyeon, even your hands are pretty.

609
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:14,970
I think you'd have done well if you studied piano instead of Kendo.

610
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:17,000
Do you think so?

611
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,930
I know how to read palms. Do you want me to read yours?

612
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,390
Yes.

613
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,940
That's weird your life line is quite long.

614
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,530
Really?

615
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,080
Damn it.

616
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,430
What's with your face?

617
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,510
Is cutting meat for your grandma bothering you that much?

618
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:02,200
What?

619
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,300
No, that's not it.

620
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,970
This is the life line.

621
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,800
What about this?

622
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,180
Mister Driver, I'm older than you, so can I speak casually?

623
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,300
No.

624
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,300
Okay.

625
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,060
Mister Driver, Ji Hyeon's really perfect.

626
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,900
She's pretty, lovable, lovable, and pretty.

627
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,820
Everything is perfect.

628
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,560
What do you think of Ji Hyeon?

629
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,930
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

630
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,590
Is it because you're young?

631
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:43,610
You have no eye for women.

632
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:46,060
I heard all you did was study.

633
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,640
I think you're the one who doesn't know anything.

634
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:54,100
The next bucket list item is a party, right?

635
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,850
- Tonight was a party too.
- Excuse me?

636
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:00,720
We had dinner, and on top of that wine,

637
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,490
interior, lighting, etc. Didn't it feel like a party?

638
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,400
That's a party. Party!

639
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,800
Well, I guess we can say it was.

640
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,260
Since I got to hold Ji Hyeon's hand.

641
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,710
Then the next order of business is...

642
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:21,100
couple rings?

643
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,050
Seriously, I don't get it.

644
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:27,150
They'll disappear if you go to the other side anyways.

645
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,280
I see.

646
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,260
You didn't know that ghosts can go to the other side if we succeed in professing our love to each other, did you?

647
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,110
We'll go up together if Ji Hyeon takes my couple ring.

648
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,010
What?

649
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:45,790
If ghosts profess their love and succeed, they go up together?

650
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:47,440
Yes.

651
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:56,400
Oh, Mr. Yeong Min is here.

652
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,840
Mr. Yeong Min is here, Grandma.

653
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,770
Why aren't you coming in?

654
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,450
You surprised me, you should at least make your presence known.

655
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:11,970
How?

656
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:15,540
"Knock, knock, are you there?" Like that?

657
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:21,060
Why aren't you coming in?

658
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,500
You didn't know that ghosts can go to the other side if we succeed in professing our love to each other, did you?

659
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,590
We'll go up together if Ji Hyeon takes my couple ring.

660
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,770
What do you think of Shin Wu?

661
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:35,330
He's handsome.

662
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:40,050
He's tall, has good body proportions, and he's smart.

663
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:43,480
He looks much better with his glasses off, right?

664
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,510
You must be happy to have met a handsome person.

665
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,670
Of course, I am.

666
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:55,740
It's so nice to have someone who's kind to me,

667
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,580
unlike somebody.

668
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:04,410
Then you two can hold hands and go to the other side together, since you've learned who you are too.

669
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,380
You said you wanted to know your name.

670
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,380
My name is all I know, though.

671
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,350
But

672
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:15,280
do you really

673
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,040
want me to go?

674
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,240
Do whatever you want.

675
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,260
What does it have to do with me?

676
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,000
Why are you saying such hurtful things?

677
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,500
I should be the one that's angry at you.

678
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,270
Why do you think I'm working so hard? It's because of you.

679
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,750
What's because of me?

680
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,720
You thought I wouldn't know that...

681
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,220
Shin Wu's bucket list is dating, right?

682
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,120
Without even asking for my opinion.

683
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:45,030
I was fine with you making the decision on your own accord, I was putting up with it.

684
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:47,590
Because it was for our ghost taxi's business.

685
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:51,280
But...

686
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,840
telling me to go away or whatever,

687
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,880
why are you getting angry at me?

688
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,390
[Seoul]

689
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:17,960
I can't even hold anything.

690
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,770
Should I just go?

691
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,130
Was it these ones?

692
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:36,810
These are couple rings with "Destiny" engraved on the inside.

693
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,040
You must be giving it to your girlfriend, that's so sweet.

694
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,920
I wish you a beautiful love.

695
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,410
What's the chance

696
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,920
of this succeeding?

697
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,710
One-hundred percent.

698
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:54,290
What kind of woman wouldn't like it when you say "you are my destiny."

699
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:56,040
It's 100%.

700
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:00,850
♫ I looked back because of a lonely wind, ♫

701
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:06,490
♫ and I see you everywhere ♫

702
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:11,900
♫  I didn't love you with my whole heart  ♫

703
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:16,060
♫ I didn't love you ♫

704
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:23,260
♫ I miss the times when we were "us," like crazy ♫

705
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,830
♫ I thought I'd be okay ♫

706
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:32,540
♫ I didn't know I'd miss you now ♫

707
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:39,340
♫ I didn't love you with my whole heart, but I do now ♫

708
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:10,430
♫ I didn't love you with my whole heart ♫

709
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:48,380
I'll bring the cellphone.

710
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:12,650
You must've been in a hurry, since you posted saying you'd pay extra.

711
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:14,410
Yes.

712
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:16,580
Thank you.

713
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,040
Ji Hyeon, please accept my love!

714
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,750
Mister Driver,

715
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,140
it's not this way, is it?

716
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,330
♫ To tell you the truth ♫

717
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:30,070
What if Shin Wu spreads bad rumors because of this?
♫ I need you, I need you ♫

718
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,550
Our business will be ruined if that happens.

719
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:35,310
♫ Even if I shake my head ♫

720
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:38,920
I'm telling you, you'll be ruined if you do this!
♫ I need you ♫

721
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,120
I don't care!

722
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,370
♫ As if I'm controlled by magic, ♫

723
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:45,650
I'm already ruined.

724
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:49,570
♫ I'm weird for only looking at you ♫

725
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:53,290
I'm ruined!

726
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:56,820
Because I like you.

727
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,520
♫ Got stuck ♫

728
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,290
♫ Stuck, stuck, stuck ♫

729
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:06,120
♫ It got stuck (My heart got) ♫

730
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,730
♫ Stuck, stuck, stuck, I'm coming to get you ♫

731
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:12,320
♫ Our relationship makes no sense ♫

732
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,770
♫ If it's destiny ♫

733
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:18,020
♫ I'll tell you honestly ♫

734
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:20,190
♫ I fell for you again ♫

735
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:24,710
♫ I, I, I fell for you (My heart fell) ♫

736
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:28,440
♫ I keep going to you ♫

737
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,920
♫ Our relationship makes no sense ♫

738
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,470
♫ If it's destiny ♫

739
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:36,760
♫ I'll tell you honestly ♫

740
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,900
♫ I need you ♫

741
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,510
♫ To tell you the truth ♫

742
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:48,860
♫ I need you ♫

743
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,100
♫ I need you ♫

744
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,870
[Delivery Man]

745
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,170
What are you doing?

746
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:58,000
I won't know unless you tell me!

747
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,280
That bastard.

748
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,500
I can find you that memory.

749
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,000
Do you think it would be a good memory if it's keeping her stuck?

750
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,710
She became a ghost because she has deep grievances!

751
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:08,920
This taxi is my last hope.

752
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,310
If it's a missing person, it's of utmost importance to find them within the golden time.

753
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:15,320
There was a rumor that she hung out with men.

754
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,310
I'm pretty sure they're hiding something.

755
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:19,560
When are you coming back?

756
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,140
I'm not going back until I find Ha Yeol.

757
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,100
Do you miss her that much?

758
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,160
It's not like we've been apart that long.

759
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:31,620
If you want to regain your memory by staying here, you cannot love that person.
