But the fact that my mom passed away

135

You're a victim, too.

137

got a job at Daehun Medical Center,

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,430
and was dispatched as a full-time nurse for Do Gyu Jin's grandfather, Do Sang Ho.

So they've known each other for almost twenty years?

154
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,820

00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,980
I hope he's here.

356
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,760
Oppa!

357
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,330
Oppa!

358
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,140
Mi Kyeong.

359
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:25,780
Oppa, do you know how long I looked for you?

360
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,040
I'm sorry.

361
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,180
I'm sorry, Mi Kyeong.

362
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,170
But... you...

363
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,600
That's right.

364
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,630
I died.

365
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,500
No.

366
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,440
Wh-Why... are you...

367
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,450
How, how come?

368
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,850
A little while after you left,

369
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,350
someone came into the apartment and pushed a syringe into me.

370
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,450
And after I got the shot, I couldn't breathe.

371
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,970
Who did–

372
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,780
Could it be...

373
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,950
Nurse Kim?

374
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,980
Nurse Kim...

375
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,450
Do you mean Kim Hui Yeon?

376
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,750
Yes.

377
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,960
Before I came here,

378
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,560
I asked nurse Kim to take care of Mi Kyeong.

379
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:23,340
I told her the password to the apartment too.

380
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:18,910
The murders that happened up until now were due to Do Gyu Jin, and Kim Hui Yeon.

381
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,860
And they tried

382
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,030
to blame all the crimes on you, Mr. Kim Jeong Wu.

383
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,260
Oh, man.

384
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,410
What?

385
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,220
How?

386
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,700
How could they?

387
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,830
It wasn't enough just killing me,

388
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,020
so they killed Mi Kyeong, and now...

389
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,870
they're trying to blame all of it on me?

390
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,910
Do Gyu Jin, Kim Hui Yeon...

391
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,410
I'm going to destroy them.

392
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,510
I will never forgive them.

393
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,170
No, Oppa!

394
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,330
No, don't do this.

395
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:10,090
I don't want to be apart from you again.

396
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:16,300
Do you know how scared and alone I was after you left?

397
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,720
Don't leave me.

398
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,210
Don't make me leave on my own.

399
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,260
Mi Kyeong.

400
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:38,000
You're going with me, right?

401
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,810
Yes, Mr. Jeong Wu. Go with Ms. Mi Kyeong.

402
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:44,370
Kim Hui Yeon and Do Gyu Jin,

403
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,200
we'll get them. We will.

404
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,410
And we'll make sure they pay for their sins.

405
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,600
Can you promise that?

406
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,300
Your promise that you will get Do Gyu Jin and Kim Hui Yeon and make them pay...

407
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,480
Are you sure you can keep those words?

408
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,590
I promise.

409
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,900
Trust me.

410
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,760
Okay.

411
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,900
I'll trust you.

412
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,690
You're going with me, right?

413
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,480
One second.

414
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,620
There's a recording.

415
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,420
Recording?

416
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,270
When I was going into the cabin Kim Hui Yeon told me about,

417
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:38,320
I felt something was off and unusual, so I made a recording.

418
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,840
And?

419
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,680
I sent it when I was conscious for a moment.

420
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,480
To the cellphone of my grandmother who lives in my hometown.

421
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,170
Would that help?

422
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,030
It will be

423
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,530
a big help.

424
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,920
We can go now, right?

425
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,080
Go to a good place.

426
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:15,070
Thank you for everything.

427
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,040
It's a relief that the two could go together.

428
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,640
Our burden will feel heavier now.

429
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,700
I agree.

430
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,210
Let's go.

431
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,250
And catch Do Gyu Jin.

432
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,240
Should we go in?

433
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,020
Is anyone here?

434
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,570
Where are they?

435
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:37,440
Luckily, Jeong Wu's grandmother didn't delete the voice recording.

436
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,170
Should we give it a listen?

437
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,460
Yes.

438
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,180
Dr. Do Gyu Jin?

439
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,780
What brought you here?

440
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,500
Welcome. I was waiting for you.

441
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,740
For me? Why?

442
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,570
Damn it!

443
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,440
What was that?

444
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,300
I think we should send this to Detective Ji Chang Seok.

445
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,310
Yes, and I'll also send it to Detective Kang Hyeong Su.

446
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,740
Do Gyu Jin.

447
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,060
This will be enough to keep Do Gyu Jin from escaping.

448
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,340
Yes.

449
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,040
See?

450
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,320
I told you there would be another way.

451
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,900
We don't have the original videos,

452
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,050
but this should be enough evidence for Mr. Kim Jeong Wu's murder.

453
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,790
I'll go in and check.

454
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,960
Do you have somewhere to go?

455
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,110
Do you remember the first place you and I did the experiment?

456
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,570
I came because I was told I'd be given a job.

457
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,700
A job in a place like this?

458
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,500
I think I should g-g-go. I should. Go.

459
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,840
This should be quite a lucrative amount.

460
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,580
If you don't feel like doing it, you can go.

461
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,270
Wh-What... is it... that I need to do?

462
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,990
It's a simple experiment.

463
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,720
I'm a doctor, you see?

464
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,380
I'm doing research for treatment purposes.

465
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:50,100
There's enough people do to this, so if you don't want to do it, you can just go.

466
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,250
Th-Th-Then... give a little more money.

467
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,740
N-No, no. It's fine.

468
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,230
I'll do it. I should.

469
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,140
Good.

470
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,960
Nurse Kim, please prepare.

471
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,600
Come this way.

472
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,320
Why do you think he suddenly went into hiding?

473
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,420
Do you think he found out that we discovered the voice recording?

474
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,850
If that's not the case, there's no reason for Do Gyu Jin to go into hiding so suddenly.

475
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:36,310
Or does he have a spy in the police?

476
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,220
That's probably not it.

477
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,660
I only sent the voice recording to Detective Ji Chang Seok and your father.

478
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:46,770
And those two went to arrest him right away.

479
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,960
Even if there was a spy, there wasn't enough time.

480
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,800
Then that means he knew beforehand.

481
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,950
Unless Do Gyu Jin was watching your every move.

482
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,330
Could it be?

483
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,420
He found it.

484
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,750
As I thought.

485
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,920
Do Gyu Jin, listen carefully.

486
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:03,220
I'm going to get you for sure, so get ready.

487
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,690
Is there really a ghost or something?

488
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:35,800
Kim Hui Yeon would definitely know where Do Gyu Jin is.

489
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,990
Of course, she would.

490
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,580
So what are you planning to do?

491
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,220
I'm going to make Kim Hui Yeon go to Do Gyu Jin.

492
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:51,290
In the middle of the night? What is it now?

493
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,880
At this moment, where is Do Gyu Jin?

494
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,720
Why are you asking me?

495
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,230
Her eyes are shaky.

496
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,230
It was under the passenger seat of my taxi.

497
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,500
Probably no one uses this kind of cellphone.

498
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:17,360
I think the owner of this phone is Detective Kang Ji Hyeon.

499
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,060
There's probably incriminating evidence related to the culprit left on this phone.

500
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,750
So what are you going to do?

501
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,740
I'm going to turn this phone in to the police tomorrow morning.

502
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:34,060
They'll unlock it using a password, or use forensics or something to unlock it.

503
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,360
Don't you think something will be found once they do that?

504
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,340
Something like incriminating evidence to arrest Do Gyu Jin.

505
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:52,760
No matter what you guys do, you will never get to Gyu Jin.

506
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,730
Because I won't let that happen.

507
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,810
You're finally revealing your true self.

508
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,040
But, Ms. Kim Hui Yeon, do you know what?

509
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,660
In the end, you were also merely Do Gyu Jin's puppet.

510
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,630
You were a tool for Do Gyu Jin to satisfy his murderous urges.

511
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:25,780
No! You guys just can't understand what Gyu Jin and I mean to each other.

512
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:31,180
What kind of relationship we have, what kind of people we are to each other, you just don't know.

513
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,340
This was your last chance.

514
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:38,280
I feel sorry for you.

515
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,470
It's done.

516
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:01,100
Kim Hui Yeon fell into our trap.

517
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,630
Okay.

518
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,580
Gyu Jin! Gyu Jin!

519
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,000
Gyu Jin.

520
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,330
Gyu Jin, you need to run.

521
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:58,920
What is it?

522
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,310
Your cellphone that has the video.

523
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,870
Seo Yeong Min has it.

524
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:07,630
He said he'll turn it in to the police. If that happens, this location will be found in no time.

525
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:09,640
The original USB.

526
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,500
You know where that is, right?

527
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,010
Yes, I do.

528
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,040
What about it?

529
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,510
Get it and bring it here.

530
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,160
Gyu Jin you don't have the time to waste.

531
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,680
What are you going to do if the police comes!? Gyu Jin–

532
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,670
Noona, just hurry and go get it.

533
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,450
All right.

534
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,470
Be careful.

535
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:39,650
Should I go in first?

536
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,700
One moment.

537
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,660
I don't think we can just wait.

538
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,750
What if Do Gyu Jin runs away?

539
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,130
I'll go in first.

540
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:00,530
No, it's too dangerous.

541
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:02,740
The police will be here soon.

542
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,020
I'll try to buy some time.

543
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,520
You're here.

544
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,800
How did you get here?

545
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,060
Impressive.

546
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:50,150
Do Gyu Jin, you're done. Don't even think about running away.

547
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,700
By the way, I heard that you have my cellphone.

548
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,610
Is that true?

549
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:59,530
I have it, and

550
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:02,150
I'm going to submit it to the police soon.

551
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,470
Do you think you can?

552
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:09,530
Mr. Yeong Min...

553
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,520
Mr. Yeong Min!

554
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,530
What are you doing?

555
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,180
M-Ms. Ji-Ji-Ji Hyeon...

556
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,700
Mr. Yeong Min!

557
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,800
Mr. Yeong Min, are you okay?

558
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,510
Mr. Yeong Min!

559
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:04,240
You...

560
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,350
What?

561
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:06,540
How?

562
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,070
How did you?

563
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,110
You...

564
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:13,760
can see me?

565
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,500
You're Kang Ji Hyeon...

566
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,980
Are you that Kang Ji Hyeon?

567
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:24,560
That's right, I'm Kang Ji Hyeon.

568
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,210
The Kang Ji Hyeon that you murdered.

569
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:28,840
What on earth are you?

570
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,870
Are you really a ghost or something?

571
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,690
Is this what it was?

572
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,110
Wait...

573
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,850
Then does that mean Seo Yeong Min wasn't crazy,

574
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:00,170
and you two were together until now?

575
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,270
Let's check around Do Gyu Jin first.

576
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:07,750
Do Gyu Jin's house, the hospital, and Kim Hui Yeon's apartment.

577
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:12,000
It's nothing. This is your life, Ms. Ji Hyeon.

578
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,930
Hey.

579
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,700
Why are you still here?

580
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,830
I don't know, either,

581
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,840
why I'm here.

582
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,440
However...

583
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,640
I must've been put here to catch garbage like you.

584
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:38,320
We're going to get you no matter what.

585
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,230
Mr. Yeong Min.

586
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,900
Mr. Yeong Min!

587
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:50,390
Mr. Yeong Min.

588
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:52,460
Are you okay?

589
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:06,970
Hey, Seo Yeong Min.

590
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:09,230
Let me ask you just one thing.

591
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:12,040
Do you really like that ghost?

592
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,890
So it's true.

593
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:23,160
Hey! Hey! Hey!

594
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,220
Hey, what are you doing?

595
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,550
You said that this was that ghost's lifeline.

596
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,230
What happens when this disappears?

597
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:32,120
Hey, Do Gyu Jin! Put that down.

598
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,010
Why? I'm so curious.

599
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,980
Do Gyu Jin, I'm begging you. Put that down.

600
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,700
Do Gyu Jin. Please!

601
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,140
Put... put that... put...

602
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,460
I said put that down!

603
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,520
Hey.

604
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,420
If you're going to beg, you should do it politely.

605
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,590
Isn't that right?

606
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,270
You're not showing any desperation.

607
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:16,210
Please, put that down.

608
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:17,690
Please?

609
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:20,230
I'll do anything.

610
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:23,850
Just the cellphone. Just give me back the cellphone.

611
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,470
Please?

612
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,580
I guess.

613
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,650
I killed your mom.

614
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,440
If I got rid of that ghost, too,

615
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,080
you'd be really heartbroken, right?

616
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:43,540
Why are you doing this to me?

617
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:47,510
Why? What did I do to wrong you so much?

618
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:50,920
Do Gyu Jin, no, Dr. Do Gyu Jin.

619
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:54,770
Please, forgive me.

620
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,840
Okay.

621
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,810
Here.

622
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:06,690
Take it.

623
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:16,960
Wait.

624
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,740
I don't think I can do it.

625
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,000
No matter how much I think about it,

626
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:28,650
the expressions of humans who have lost people precious to them...

627
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:32,490
I think I like those faces too much.

628
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:34,100
No.

629
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,600
I'm sorry.

630
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,860
No, no, no!

631
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,220
Mr. Yeong Min.

632
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,540
Ms. Ji Hyeon.

633
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,800
You can't...

634
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,760
Mr. Yeong Min.

635
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:45,340
I'm sorry, Mr. Yeong Min.

636
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:50,630
​​♫  Mindlessly staring into your vacancy ♫

637
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,100
​​♫  Before long, I can feel it ♫

638
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:06,050
​​♫  The wind, lonely like my heart ♫

639
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:12,610

​​♫  I didn't love to the fullest ♫

641
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,950
♫ I didn't love you ♫

642
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:29,290
​​♫  I miss the days we spent together ♫

643
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:31,960
​​♫  I thought I would be fine ♫

644
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:38,490
​​♫  I didn't think I would miss you like I do now ♫

645
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:45,180
​​♫  Because I didn't love to the fullest ♫

646
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:59,430
​​♫  I'm searching for memories without you ♫

647

654
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:50,250
[Delivery Man]

655
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:54,410
Do Gyu Jin has nothing to do with the multiple murder cases.

656
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:58,270
I'm the criminal responsible for the Daehun Medical Center murders.

657
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:02,400
Do Gyu Jin's next target will be you.

658
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,370
I'm so happy that I can give you despair once more.

659
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:09,000
What happened?

660
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,390
An arrest warrant was issued.

661
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,000
Close the case.

662
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,990
Detective Kang Ji Hyeon was transferred to our hospital.

663
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:17,790
Put that down!

664
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:21,200
Listen carefully. No matter what, I'm going to kill you two.

665
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,540
I promised to protect her,

666
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,710
but I couldn't protect her.
