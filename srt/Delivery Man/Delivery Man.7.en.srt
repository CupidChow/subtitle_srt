Right now, you're possessed by a ghost.

183
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,920
- No, no. Maybe it's for the better.
- What do you mean?

184

Maybe she'll be able to move on.

185

Even if they don't fulfill their wishes,

186
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,050
even if they don't resolve their grievances, there's a way to pass on.

Even if it's a ghost that has deep grievances,

188
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,600
they could pass on if love sprouts within their hearts.

189

It seems like wasn't happy about being fired.

208
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,540
What was the reason for firing him?

209
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,790
I fired him because it was discovered that he was stealing hospital drugs.

210
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,560
I think he was waving around a weapon due to resentment toward me.

to tell you the truth,

217
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:50,580
during the interview, I was thinking about whether or not I should've told you,

218
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,850
and I believed that it didn't have anything to do with Detective Kang, so I didn't tell you.

219
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:05,520
Nurse Kim Jeong Wu, he was a bit off.

Could you tell us in detail what you're saying?

221
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,430
He was never ordinary in his actions,

222
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,960
but what was even more strange,

223
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,860
after Nurse Kim Jeong Wu came to our hospital,

224
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,420
the number of patients that died in the emergency room increased dramatically.

225

- Yes?

I told them about nurse Kim Jeong Wu.

229

That I'm suspicious because the number of deceased patients increased after Nurse Kim arrived.

230
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,180

When...

712
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:44,770
Mr. Du Kang appeared at the hospital, why did you do it?

713
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,680
What?

714
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:53,320
You covered me as if you were protecting me.

715
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,660
That was

716
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,310
in case it was an evil spirit.

717
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,550
In case it was an evil spirit...

718
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,440
Is that why you protected me?

719
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:24,270
You... left after leaving the cellphone at home,

720
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:27,010
and you suddenly started being cold toward me...

721
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:32,550
so I was a bit sad.

722
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:41,400
But that's because you're worried I'll pass on, right?

723
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,510
But honestly,

724
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:52,140
that's why I pushed you away, too.

725
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:58,480
But today, after seeing the newlyweds in the emergency room,

726
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,620
I learned something.

727
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:04,740
Even if two people deeply love each other,

728
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:10,070
one day, they'll have to say goodbye.

729

♫ Every day that repeats ♫

730
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,130
People who are still alive have to live like that.

731
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:17,990
How bad would it be for you and me, who's dead?

♫ Nobody cares about it ♫

733
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:24,230
That's true.

734
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,440
Even if two people love each other so much,

735
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,690
they can't be together forever.

742
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,470
I will.

For as long as you want,

744
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:06,510

Why am I still the same?

765
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,220
Are you sure you really love me?

766
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:40,350
Maybe you just love me up to a certain amount?

767
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,090
What does it mean when a spirit doesn't pass on?

768
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:46,650
It's either an evil spirit that can't feel any passion or...

769
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:50,270
I got a call from Detective Kang Hyeong Su. He wants to meet.

770
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,150
Why do I feel this way?

771
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:55,760
Ko Du Kang helped me significantly.

772
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,120
I have nothing more to say about that person.

773
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,530
I'm really sorry.

774
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:03,630
I'll try talking to miss Se Ra one more time.

775
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,440
Why is this here?
