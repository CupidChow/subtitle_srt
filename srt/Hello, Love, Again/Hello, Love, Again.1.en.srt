00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,387


2
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,611
Stop moving!

3
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,779
Is that fart-flavored toothpaste?

4
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,988
My Joy is calling!

5
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:12,989
Your Joy?

6
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,532
Joy! Are you there yet?

7
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,785
Yes, Ethan!

8
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,788
I'm already here. Look.

9
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,373
It's already 10 p.m.,
but the sun is still up.

10
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>Wow!</i>

11
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,628
<i>You're really</i>
<i>on the other side of the world.</i>

12
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,837
Yes!

13
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,382
Joy is here, in Canada!

14
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,135
Wow! Congratulations!

15
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,595
You're really there.

16
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,139
You're there.

17
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,352
I miss my Joy here in Hong Kong.

18
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,021
- We miss you too, Joy!
- We miss you!

19
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,731
- Hey.
- We miss you.

20
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,857
Do you miss us?

21
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,150
Super!

22
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,401
Miss you!

23
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,195
What about me?

24
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,613
Do you miss me too?

25
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,156
No.

26
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,829
I super duper duper miss you.

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,873
- You're like teenagers in love.
- Yes, it is.

28
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,166
Joy!

29
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,377
- Yes, ma'am! Yes!
- Let's go.

30
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,838
My employer is here. I have to go.

31
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,464
Already?

32
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,841
- Bye, Joy!
- Bye, Joy!

33
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,175
- Bye!
- Hey, say goodbye!

34
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,301
Let's go!

35
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,930
- Let's give them their moment.
- Okay.

36
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,182
I have to go.

37
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,809
Bye!

38
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,978
How many more times will we say goodbye?

39
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,399
Until our futures meet again.

40
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,567
Right?

41
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,197
Here.

42
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,409
They said time stops when we don't use it.

43
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,912
Let's start using it to speed up the time.

44
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,291
I can't wait for a future with you.

45
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,335
And we're now making that future happen.

46
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,130
Time starts now!

47
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,886
<i>Bella's bag?</i>

48
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,263
- Yes, sir! Coming!
Thank you!

49
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,181
- Careful. Careful.
Your bag, Bella.

50
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,225
- Bye!
Bye. Bye, sir!

51
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,145
I'll get this for the tax.

52
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,480
It's okay. Bye, sweetie.

53
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,190
Mommy!

54
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,735
Mommy!

55
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,613
Mommy!

56
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,864
Ethan, look!

57
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,407
Let's call that number now.

58
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,617
There's another one here.

59
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,243
- Where?
- Here.

60
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,252
<i>Sorry…</i>

61
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,129
- She might be working overtime.
- Already?

62
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,798
Possible. So, stop overreacting!

63
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,967
I'm worried
she's not resting enough.

64
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,887
You know what a workaholic she is.

65
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,472
Wait!

66
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,473
Wait!

67
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,600
- Wait!
- Maybe she's just hard at work.

68
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,769
Well, she went abroad.

69
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,731
Ethan, congratulations
on your new bar!

70
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:52,815
Thank you.

71
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,026
I told you!

72
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,861
Hey, wait for me!

73
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,196
- Hey!
- Why did you leave me?

74
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,365
- You're weighing us down.
- I'm not!

75
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,366
Let's go!

76
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,034
Whoo!

77
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,578
<i>When will you become a nurse there?</i>

78
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:10,583
Once my contract ends,
I'll apply for a student visa, remember?

79
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,877
<i>That's too long. Hassle.</i>

80
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,462
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

81
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,215
To Boss Ethan!

82
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,218
<i>The bar is open.</i>
<i>Ethan's Joy is finally open.</i>

83
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,512
<i>Yeah!</i>

84
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,766
Come on!

85
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,434
- We're in a hurry.
- Good morning!

86
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,270
- You're not done cooking?
- So slow!

87
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,688
Sorry, ma'am.

88
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,772
Almost ready.

89
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,818
Joy, the stupid tattoo is gone.

90
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,448
Really?

91
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,951
Where's Ethan anyway? I want to see him.

92
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,247
- She can't see me all this time?
- Oh.

93
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,165
- Wait.
- Ethan's here.

94
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,083
Hi!

95
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,377
<i>Carlo is the only stupid one.</i>

96
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,305
Wait.

97
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,556
Wait.

<i>Okay! Happy birthday!</i>

103
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,410
Look.

104
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:31,456
I have noodles here for long life!

105
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,041
You got it on time!

106
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,417
- <i>I don't love you too.</i>
- Yes!

107
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,085
Yes!

108
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,588
<i>I don't miss you.</i>

109
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,339
I don't miss you too.

110
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,848
- Twenty-five percent!
- Our sales?

111
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,016
It increased?

112
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,188
She's sleeping.

113
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,989
Hey.

114
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,324
She's early today.

115
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,784
Wait. We need to double time.

116
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,077
Here, here!

117
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,203
- That'll do!
- It's not done yet!

118
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,829
- Joy, happy…
- It's not glued yet!

119
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,749
Ethan!

120
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,671
Joy?

121
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,342
Joy, what's wrong?

122
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,096
Why are you crying?

123
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,098
What happened?

124
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,892
My boss scammed me, Ethan.

125
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:40,358
She's been deducting my salary,
but she's not paying my taxes.

126
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,610
Isn't her employer Filipino too?

127
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,655
Report her.

128
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,782
She said she'll have me deported.

129
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,784
I'm so scared.

130
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,078
- What should I do?
- <i>Joy.</i>

131
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,163
She's just scaring you.

132
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,625
My uncle said as long as you have
a work permit, you can file a report.

133
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,463
Hello, Ethan?

134
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,882
I ran away from my employer.

135
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,843
Where are you now?

136
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,762
<i>Hello, Joy?</i>

137
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,931
<i>Hello? Joy, what's happening?</i>

138
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,474
Hello?

139
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,353
I found someone who can help me.

140
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,815
Oh, Joy…

141
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,444
Don't worry about me.

142
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,154
I can handle this.

143
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,449
I can do this. I promise.

144
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,411
<i>I will just call you once I've settled.</i>

145
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,047
Juliet, I'll pay next week. Promise!

146
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,757
- I've heard that before.

147
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,967
- Bye, Joy.
Bye.

148
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,844
What did the accountant say?

149
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,095
I got rescheduled again.

150
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,555
Again?

151
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,185
Follow up on your work permit.

152
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,311
Yes, ma'am.

153
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,356
- Hello, Joy?
- <i>Ethan.</i>

154
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,399
Joy, I can't do this anymore.

155
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,026
I'm tired of us living
in two different time zones,

156
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,570
of waiting, of staying up late.

157
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,780
I'm tired of waiting to talk to you.

158
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,700
<i>I can't even hold you.</i>
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

159
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,744
Ethan…

160
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,954
<i>I can't do this.</i>

161
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,000
I know it's hard, but…

162
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,460
I've had enough.

163
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,378
I can't take it anymore.

164
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,089
Don't be like that.

165
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,550
Hello? Ethan?

166
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,639
Ethan, I want to see you.

167
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,890
Hello?

168
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,269
<i>Because Joy…</i>

169
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,564
<i>I'll see you soon! Joy, finally!</i>

170
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,817
<i>I already booked a ticket!</i>
<i>We'll finally see each other!</i>

171
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,653
<i>I can finally hug you!</i>

172
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,154
<i>I can finally kiss you!</i>

173
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,865
<i>Canada, here I come!</i>

174
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,618
I'll see you soon!

175
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,247
I'm so excited, Joy!

176
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,050
<i>Hello, Marie.</i>

177
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,260
Hello, Ainsley?

178
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,594
<i>How's work?</i>

179
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,971
All done!

180
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,598
<i>Already? You're the best!</i>

181
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,725
<i>Efficient as ever.</i>

182
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,977
<i>Of course!</i>

183
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,311
<i>Do you want more?</i>

184
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,771
<i>Definitely!</i>

185
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:27,024
<i>Okay. I have two office buildings</i>
<i>and a bank.</i>

186
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:27,984
<i>Which one do you want?</i>

187
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,486
<i>Just one? No. Give them all to me.</i>

188
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,613
<i>What?! Do you ever rest?</i>

189
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,699
<i>Already a caregiver</i>
<i>yet still wants to be a nurse.</i>

190
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,909
<i>A cleaner who wants</i>
<i>to make it her business</i>

191
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,202
<i>and compete with me?</i>

192
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,579
<i>How much more do you want?</i>

193
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,248
<i>Just get married and settle down.</i>

194
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,458
<i>I have to go.</i>

195
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,544
<i>I'm almost at the airport</i>
<i>to pick up someone.</i>

196
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,753
<i>Let's keep in touch.</i>

197
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,932
After a very long flight,

198
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,101
we're finally here!

199
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,394
Wait a sec!

200
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,152
Shout-out to all Jhim Buddies!

201
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,696
We are now here, in Canada!

202
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,320
Marie!

203
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,531
- Hey!
- Hi!

204
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,241
- I missed you!
- Ethan!

205
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,409
Why did you leave me there?

206
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,121
Joy is here! Joy!

207
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,625
Hey.

208
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,711
You only broke up with Ethan, not with me.

209
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,588
Come here!

210
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,548
How have you been?

211
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,050
You've gotten taller.

212
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,511
Uno, this is Jhim.

213
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,346
I'm her friend, and…

214
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,931
he is her ex…

215
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,935
Excuse me. Come.

216
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,103
Come.

217
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,027
- He's her…
- Friend.

218
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,365
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you too.

219
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,075
- I'm Ethan.
- Uno.

220
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,329
Hello.

221
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,872
Hello.

222
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,376
- Let's go?
- Yeah.

223
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,919
We'll go ahead. Bye.

224
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,003
Goodbye.

225
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,797
"Uno"?

226
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,426
Don't worry, you were "first".

227
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,763
Come on. Don't mind them.

228
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,683
Hello, Jhim Buddies! This is it!

229
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:12,690
As you can see,
I'm already here in Canada!

230
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,152
<i>Joy! Joy!</i>

231
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,403
Joy!

232
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,768
I don't love you.

233
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,647
I don't love you too.

234
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,571
Five minutes.

235
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,781
Five more minutes, please.

236
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,827
Careful.

237
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,246
I might get used to this.

238
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,457
I might not let you go back to Hong Kong.

239
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,086
That's my plan.

240
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,632
To not go back to Hong Kong…

241
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,303
without you.

242
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,022
So, you can rest and be with me.

243
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,235
Ethan…

244
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,445
- This is too much
- I love you too much.

245
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,823
I love you very much, Joy.

246
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,955
<i>There's not a day</i>
<i>that I did not wish</i>

247
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,624
<i>for us to get to our future sooner.</i>

248
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,502
<i>A future with no goodbyes.</i>

249
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,630
<i>And in that future,</i>

250
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,882
<i>I will always be there</i>

251
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,760
<i>to hold your hand</i>
<i>as we see the world together.</i>

252
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,973
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

253
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,979
<i>We don't have to worry about time</i>

254
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,815
<i>because we will spend it together.</i>

255
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,319
<i>You won't have to do things alone…</i>

256
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,737
Faster.

257
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,072
<i>…because I will be there to help you.</i>

258
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,457
<i>We will build our own home.</i>

259
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,210
<i>And we will fill that home</i>
<i>with joy and laughter.</i>

260
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,971
<i>On days when you're too tired</i>
<i>to fight for your dreams,</i>

261
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,976
<i>I will be there</i>
<i>to listen even to your silence.</i>

262
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,900
Ready, set, go!

263
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,489
Not fair! Join in!

264
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:32,598
<i>In that future,</i>
<i>we won't have to sleep alone.</i>

265
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,521
Ethan!

266
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,987
<i>Because we will</i>
<i>always wake up together.</i>

267
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,089
Five minutes.

268
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,593
Okay.

269
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,722
<i>And in that future, Joy,</i>

270
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,683
<i>you have a home in me.</i>

271
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,403
And I promise to make that home warm…

272
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,406
and full of love.

273
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,785
We both promised
to make that future happen.

274
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,166
Joy Marie Fabregas…

275
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,254
I don't love you.

276
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,174
Will you marry me?

277
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,598
Yes.

278
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,184
Yes, Ethan.

279
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,656
Let's go!

280
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,700
- Ethan!

281
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,285
- Here?
No, no. Turn left.

282
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,828
- Turn left.
Turn left.

283
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,539
- Here. Put me down.
- <i>Alberta News Channel.</i>

284
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,207
- Put me down.
- <i>Canada now has 433</i>

285
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,542
- Get me those. My favorite.
- <i>confirmed cases of COVID-19</i>

286
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,210
- Okay, I will.
- <i>and a death toll of eight.</i>

287
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,212
<i>Alberta is declaring</i>
<i>state of public emergency</i>

288
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,298
<i>as premier Jason Kenney announced.</i>

289
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,341
<i>Yesterday, March 16, 2020,</i>

290
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,010
<i>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau</i>
<i>addressed the nation,</i>

291
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,553
- Ethan?
- <i>declaring total lockdown</i>

292
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:38,640
<i>and closure of all borders</i>
<i>in response to rising COVID-19 cases.</i>

293
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,268
<i>This new COVID-19 protocol</i>
<i>restricts entry of foreign nationals.</i>

294
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,980
<i>All non-essential travels outside</i>
<i>the country will also be restricted</i>

295
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,483
<i>until the prime minister</i>
<i>lifts the border restriction.</i>

296
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,110
<i>As the prime minister says,</i>
<i>we're all in this together.</i>

297
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,613
<i>James Winston. Stay safe, Canada!</i>

298
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,201
So, Ethan's your ex?

299
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,334
- Marie?
- Hmm?

300
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,752
Ethan's your ex?

301
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,296
Yes.

302
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,923
What a coincidence.

303
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,843
Yeah.

304
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,933
- So, how was New York?
- Still waiting for you.

305
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,604
The New York offer is still on the table.

306
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,106
It's a smarter move.

307
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,191
Here, you have to study and…

308
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,276
But I'm already on my second term.

309
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,112
Plus two more after that.

310
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,491
In New York, you can pass the NCLEX
and become a nurse.

311
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,118
The pay is better there.

312
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,702
And my mom's the head nurse there.

313
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,746
She will surely help you out.

314
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,790
And you'll go back there next year.

315
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,042
And that's the cherry on top.

316
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,086
Plus…

317
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,212
no Ethan.

318
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,976
Thanks for giving me
a ride from the airport.

319
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,104
Only because you did me a favor.

320
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,438
Ha!

321
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,566
So mean.

322
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,902
Thank you for bringing the goods.
I'll e-transfer the payment, okay?

323
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,071
- Okay.
- Bye!

324
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,623
The US offer, okay?

325
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,375
So persistent.

326
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,085
Don't be long.

327
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,802
They're here.

328
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,347
They're here. They're here. Hello!

329
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,058
Welcome to Canada!

330
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,313
Mark, you didn't tell me
your hubby looks chubbier in person.

331
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,148
I think it's a tie, Auntie.

332
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,357
Tonton!

333
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,984
Help us with the luggage!

334
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,360
Hi, Tonton.

335
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,404
This is my son Tonton!

336
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,322
Smile!

337
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,949
Marie, come here! Meet Aunt Amy.

338
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,868
Oh! Hello.

339
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,119
Welcome.

340
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,121
- Thank you.
- Hey!

341
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,957
The housemates are complete!

342
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,921
Well, well, welcome
to Big Brother Marvin's house!

343
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,505
That's Jambi, our housemate.

344
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,798
She's really loud.

345
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,091
- Is this how she really is?
- Yes.

346
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,510
- Come on in.
- She's perky.

347
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,638
Have some coffee.

348
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,722
I'm sure you're tired.

349
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,351
Shoes off, eh? I don't have a cleaner.

350
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,603
Uncle, we can clean for a very low price.

351
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,896
Twenty-five dollars per hour.

352
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,816
I'm only asking 500 dollars for rent,
you still want me to pay you?

353
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,735
What if I cancel your sponsorship?

354
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,363
I paid a lot for your visa and LMIA.

355
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,950
So, how will my son and I get a LMIA?

356
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,369
We're still finding an employer for you.

357
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,787
We should find you one in six months.

358
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,789
Or else, you'll be in trouble.

359
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,083
You'll be undocumented.

360
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,377
And we don't want that.

361
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,504
You won't have insurance.

362
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,256
You can't get sick.

363
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,590
And no work permit.

364
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,841
Which means you can't work.

365
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,303
In otherwise, nada.

366
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,429
Huh?

367
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,349
How will my son and I survive?

368
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,559
- Cash jobs.
- Under the table.

369
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,769
No tax.

370
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,896
You can start selling,
like what Uncle is doing.

371
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,691
Correct. I buy this
for only half the price.

372
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,942
Once I sell it for the full price,

373
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,778
the 50% sale is mine.

374
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,029
And it's healthy too.

375
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,198
Eh!

376
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,659
You can afford to bring
your siblings here faster.

377
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,203
It's faster if you become a PR.

378
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,247
Beh!

379
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,206
See?

380
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,293
Marie and I, TR to PR after the pandemic.

381
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,877
- What's that?
- Mmm.

382
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,089
From temforary to fer…

383
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,882
- Permanent!
- That one!

384
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,342
- Ah!
- That one.

385
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,011
For us, spousal pathway.

386
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,722
When I first met Marvin, fee… R!

387
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,015
Ha!

388
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,100
Hard, right?

389
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,227
After one year,

390
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,562
that's it.

391
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,105
He's a PR now too.

392
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,232
Ah…

393
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,234
So, what do I do now?

394
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,278
I am not annulled in the Philippines.

395
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,404
Yikes!

396
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,864
You have to be legally single to get that.

397
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,533
But there are other ways.

398
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:10,704
My plan is to find
a Canadian spouse.

399
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,915
You don't need to.
I already sponsored you, remember?

400
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,459
Lonely Canadian Program.

401
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,420
I don't have a family here,
so I can bring relatives here.

402
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,840
It's a good thing you're Canadian now.

403
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,051
This one is just lonely.

404
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,343
Chill.

405
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,763
I'll get my PR status soon.

406
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,599
Eh! Don't forget to pay me!

407
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,435
Did you charge extra, like Marie?

408
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:34,895
Right!

409
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,022
That's just fair.

410
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,231
Right, Amy?

411
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:42,903
She got tired of carrying those
all the way from the Philippines.

412
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:43,862
What about you?

413
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,073
Sir Uno bought
the products and carried them.

414
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,324
What did you do?

415
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,867
Face card.

416
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,996
Sir Uno is the boyfriend?

417
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,957
Nope!

418
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,417
I don't know
what's going on with her.

419
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,044
Uno's a good catch.

420
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,462
What to do?

421
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,963
Her heart is not beating for him.

422
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,840
Maybe she's into girls?

423
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:06,968
Guys,

424
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,221
I'm here.

425
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,690
Okay, she's gone now. What's the tea?

426
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,859
- We don't know.
- We don't know.

427
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,195
She doesn't share much.

428
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,031
Why?

429
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,080
Why are you here, in Calgary?

430
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,758
<i>Your call…</i>

431
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,687
MAMA: HOW ARE YOU, MY DAUGHTER?

432
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,782
<i>What? Joy is there?</i>

433
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,075
In Calgary?

434
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,035
- OMG!
- OMG!

435
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,288
Yes!

436
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,791
- Maybe it's time for part two!
- Part two.

437
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,836
There can't be a part two
because there's already an Uno.

438
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,004
Aw.

439
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,631
- Is Uno the new guy?
- What?

440
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,384
She has a new life now.

441
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,844
I do too.

442
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,555
And I'm here to fix mine.

443
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,849
Don't… Didn't you say…

444
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,523
<i>Shout-out to all Jhim Buddies!</i>

445
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,941
- We'll go ahead, Uncle.
- It's our first day at work

446
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,026
here in Calgary!

447
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,360
Hey, promote my products!

448
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,987
Sure! And, of course,

449
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,240
as always, I am here with my BFF.

450
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,951
Here he is.

451
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,954
If you want to know his name,

452
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,665
send me gifts and buy this.

453
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,667
<i>There!</i>

454
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,461
<i>Oh, right? Hey!</i>

455
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,795
<i>Thank you for the gifts!</i>

456
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,131
<i>Jambibiko, thank you. Thank you.</i>

457
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,762
Marie!

458
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,972
I think I'll have a love life soon!

459
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,683
He looks so good!

460
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,435
Thank you, thank you!

461
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:24,147
He's also here, in Calgary.
We're meant to be!

462
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,900
That's enough. Time to go home.

463
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,361
He has a cute friend.

464
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,155
I'll hook you up,
so your sad life can be a little happier.

465
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,074
Hey, I say take it!

466
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,159
I'm happy with my life.

467
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,995
Aww. I'm so jealous!

468
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,914
- But what about Uno?
- Move.

469
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,833
Filipinos are still the best!

470
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,878
As long as he loves me,
I don't care.

471
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,090
Speaking of the devil.

472
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,549
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

473
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,926
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

474
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,804
- I'll go ahead.
- Take care, Jambi.

475
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,182
Good morning!

476
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,433
Hi, Martha!

477
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,270
Good morning, handsome!

478
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,772
See you, beautiful!

479
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,275
Bye.

480
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,611
You might need the energy.

481
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,196
Right.

482
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,531
Thank you.

483
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,036
Hmm.

484
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,205
You tricked nurse Agatha again.

485
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,792
Well, medicine disrupts the energy flow.

486
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:26,835
Okay.

487
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,422
Oh!

488
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,550
That jade bracelet I gave you
looks beautiful.

489
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,344
Is it working?

490
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,013
Uh.

491
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,306
No success yet.

492
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:45,812
Well, that depends
on what success means to you.

493
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,151
No, no! Here! Here!

494
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,820
Martha, let me do my job, please?

495
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,363
You let me do my job!

496
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,033
As the CEO of this place, I'm in charge!

497
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,492
Okay.

498
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,245
John didn't understand it either.

499
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:06,082
He never liked it
when I put my work and career first.

500
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,627
He didn't understand that
I needed something for myself to be…

501
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,755
to be more than just his lover.

502
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,552
- Marie?
- Hmm?

503
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,262
Did I ever marry?

504
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,222
The truth?

505
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,183
Well, of course, the truth.

506
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,518
No.

507
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,397
Are we going to his funeral now?

508
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,524
Do you want to?

509
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:36,529
No, no. He has his own family now.

510
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,491
Oh! I have a meeting with Finance.
What time is it?

511
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,202
Oh, no! Okay, let's go! Faster!

512
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,838
Hello!

513
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,676
One hot Americano, tall.

514
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,553
For here.

515
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,228
How are you?

516
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,022
How's work? Do you work nearby?

517
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,483
You're on duty.

518
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,653
Okay.

519
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,697
One hot Americano for Joy.

520
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,199
For Marie.

521
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,035
Joy!

522
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,120
Marie.

523
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,208
Yup! Joy is gone.

524
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,045
I can see that.

525
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,423
No, you don't.

526
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:40,343
You don't know me. I don't know you.

527
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,845
We're strangers now.

528
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,791
Are you studying? Nursing?

529
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,502
I was hoping to.

530
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,087
Oh, no. Sorry.

531
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,840
Stay. I'll just work here.

532
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,009
Just continue with what you're doing.

533
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,682
So, you're a nurse now?

534
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,017
You're also a PR now, right?

535
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,897
HCA. Studying to be RN.

536
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,899
You're an HC…

537
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,985
A former DH now an HC…

538
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,446
Then you'll be an RN?
Do you want to complete the alphabet?

539
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,742
- Health Care Assistant.
- Right.

540
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,635
Is that Uno? Your boyfriend?

541
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,430
I'm talking to Filipinos
who need cash jobs.

542
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,266
Cleaners and other side hustles.

543
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,560
Oh! Count me in!

544
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,647
I could use an additional income.

545
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,818
Remember, I bought
your power banks in Hong Kong?

546
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,906
Okay. I'll let you know if something
comes up.

547
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:29,869
How? You don't have my number.

548
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,621
Messenger.

549
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,582
But you blocked me.

550
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,088
Here. Save your number.

551
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,723
Thank you.

552
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,642
You brought back Joy to life.

553
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,602
What?

554
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,855
You're no longer a KJ.

555
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,065
Kill-Joy.

556
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:02,110
Just kidding. Don't mind me.

557
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,180
Hello?

558
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,932
- Hi, Ainsley!
- <i>Hi, Marie!</i>

559
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,726
<i>We got the cleaning job.</i>

560
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,769
Yes!

561
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:40,231
That's great! That's good news!
Thank you so much, Ainsley!

562
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,150
Let me gather my team, okay? Bye!

563
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,776
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

564
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,538
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hello.

565
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,332
- Jambi?
- <i>Yes?</i>

566
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,542
We got the cleaning job.

567
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,754
<i>Oh, wow! Furpect!</i>

568
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,466
<i>Oh, but Marielle and Ryan</i>
<i>moved to Toronto already.</i>

569
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,551
I'll take care of it. Okay?

570
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,761
<i>Okay.</i>

571
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:10,720
I have to go. Bye.

572
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,889
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

573
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,697
IS THIS A SCAM?

574
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,409
YOU ASKED FOR THIS, REMEMBER?

575
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,620
What do you mean? I don't even know you.

576
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,789
Who's that?

577
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,375
A scammer offering me a job.

578
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,504
It could be legit. Let me reply.

579
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,382
No, I'll deal with this scammer.

580
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,927
Go easy on them, okay? They're human too.

581
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:54,931
All right!

582
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,100
Who's gonna volunteer first?

583
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,851
Perfect! Why don't you get started?

584
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:04,732
- Sorry.
- Marie, you only have two terms left.

585
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,609
Hang in there.

586
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:13,992
HOW CAN YOU DO THIS
TO YOUR FELLOW FILIPINOS?!

587
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:14,951
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THOSE IN NEED!

588
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,578
MAY GOD BLESS YOUR SOUL

589
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,666
Is this a joke?

590
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,424
Your loss!

591
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,220
Is it still the scammer?

592
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,722
Yes.

593
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,348
Why don't you answer it?

594
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,766
No, it might be phishing.

595
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,852
Well then,

596
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,147
just come with me to this party?

597
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,773
Karaoke!

598
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,650
That's a waste of time, Jhim.

599
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,738
What if we meet Filipinos
who will give us jobs?

600
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,699
Then, I'm down! Let's go!

601
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,242
Eyy!

602
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,202
This must be it.

603
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,246
We have the right house number.

604
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,331
Wait, let's check.

605
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,708
The party has started.

606
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,669
This is it.

607
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,338
Everybody, they're here!

608
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,549
Jhim Buddy!

609
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,384
Jhim Buddy!

610
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,720
- I'm your biggest fan!
- My Jambibi?

611
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,056
All yours!

612
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,390
Housemates! Come closer!

613
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,184
That's Daisy.

614
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,811
Mark and his husband Marvin.

615
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,396
- And this is…
- No!

616
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,522
No!

617
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,736
Move!

618
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,405
Is she okay?

619
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,492
- This is Ethan, my best friend.
- Hello, good afternoon.

620
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,661
His dimple is as deep as a well.
Many have fallen.

621
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,247
But, of course, you're cuter!

622
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,042
Everybody, please follow Jhim Buddies

623
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,003

- Yes, yes.

624

Be a part of my buddies!

630
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,268
- Hey! You made it!
- Yeah, follow.

631
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,146
- Come here!
- Right.

632
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,524
Excuse me.

633
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,484
- Follow now.
- Excuse me.

634
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,569
Hi!

635
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,905
I'm single!

636
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,908
I mean, I'm Baby. PR.

637
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:22,495
- What a move!
- Baby. I'm a PR.

638
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:25,039
- Do I smell good?
- Yes.

639
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,584
Marie! He's the one
I was telling you about.

640
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,044
This is Jhim, and this is Ethan.

641
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,879
The one I'll hook you up with…

642
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,965
Wai…

643
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,216
They know each other?

644
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,886
They're exes.

645
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,138
What?

646
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,101
Guys, let's go in for a second.

647
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,602
Come on.

648
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,026
Are you following me?

649
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,530
Huh?

650
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,991
How did you know I live here?

651
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,451
I didn't. Jhim just invited me…

652
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,662
Why are you here, in Calgary?

653
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,124
- For work.
- Again?

654
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:13,713
Again.

655
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,008
I'm here to try again.

656
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,803
You didn't survive the first time.

657
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,018
Maybe because I had money then.

658
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,396
I have nothing now.

659
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,026
And just like the others,
Canada is my only hope.

660
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,571
So, this time,
I'll do anything to survive.

661
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,202
I don't believe you.

662
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,788
I don't expect you to.

663
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,084
But I have no choice.

664
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,837
Like you always say,

665
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,632
"Choice is only for those with money."

666
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,260
Now that I have nothing,

667
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,846
I have no choice.

668
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,308
But I have a chance.

669
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,104
A chance to make things right again.

670
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,732
Of all places, why Canada?

671
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,527
It's a big world.
You could've gone anywhere.

672
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,240
You could've stayed in Hong Kong.

673
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,992
So, why here?

674
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,497
I found an opportunity here.

675
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,877
And maybe the universe brought me here
because you're here.

676
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,093
You're so predictable.

677
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,304
Is it wrong to ask for another chance?

678
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,766
I'm sorry,
but I don't give second chances.

679
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,025
Joy, I don't want you back.

680
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,157
The chance that I came here for…

681
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,578
is the chance to fix my life.

682
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,125
If there's anything I'll ask from you,

683
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,379
it's the chance to apologize in person.

684
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,465
That's it.

685
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,011
Joy, I was a complete jerk.

686
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,223
I hurt you so bad…

687
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,479
It was the darkest time of my life.

688
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,109
But that's not an excuse.

689
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,529
There's no excuse for what I did to you.

690
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,743
I'm three years too late.

691
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,332
But if Joy can still hear this,

692
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,545
if there's still
a bit of Joy left in there,

693
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,717
I just want her to know
that I'm really, really sorry.

694
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,060
I have no intention of bothering you.

695
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,566
This is just where I found
an opportunity again.

696
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,029
But don't worry.

697
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,115
I know my place.

698
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,036
I'll be a stranger.

699
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,040
And from now on, I promise

700
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,418
I'll stay far away from you.

701
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,056
- Joy…

702
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,684
I'm sorry, I can't lower the rent.

703
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,354
I'm also in need right now.

704
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:01,565
You've already helped us a lot.

705
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,983
Thank you.

706
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,278
Take care. I'll miss you.

707
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,448
- Call me anytime, okay?
- Okay.

708
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,616
Are you okay?

709
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,867
Yes.

710
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:18,165
<i>Alberta, we are facing</i>
<i>a record surge in COVID-19 cases,</i>

711

Come in. Welcome.

718
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,723
Let me show you the basement.

719
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,225
- Are you okay, Joy?
- Yes.

720
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,937
Please don't touch
the stuff in the room.

721
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,857
Sorry, I don't have storage yet.

722
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,358
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

723
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,955
This is only temporary.

724
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,584
What's important is we're together.

725
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,796
For our families.

726
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,134
<i>Bro, the loan shark</i>
<i>is asking for your payment.</i>

727
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:18,434
I'll take care of it.
Just take care of Papa.

728
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,437
<i>Son, you take care of yourself there.</i>

729
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,898
<i>We'll be fine here.</i>

730
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,156
<i>Okay, bro. We'll just call you again.</i>

731
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:35,743
<i>You're gonna kill me!</i>

732
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,370
- Get out of here!
- Nana! Stop, please!

733
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,997
- Stop! Mom!
- Get out of here!

734
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,042
I can't handle her anymore.

735
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,710
If we can't find a new nurse for her,

736
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,713
we're just gonna have to send her
to a nursing home, okay?

737
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,050
All the nurses chose
to serve at the hospital.

738
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,051
I don't…

739
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,973
Ma'am, I'm a nurse in the Philippines.

740
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,267
Really? Are you registered here?

741
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,856
No, ma'am. But I have experience.

742
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,399
I took care of an elderly

743
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,653
and a child with special needs
in Hong Kong.

744
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,321
I can do the job, ma'am.

745
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,615
Okay.

746
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,077
If I say yes, who's gonna clean the house?

747
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,454
I know someone.

748
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,540
- Ethan?
- Yes?

749
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,625
After that, please clean the bathroom.

750
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,377
- Okay.
- Thank you.

751
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,419
Let's go.

752
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,598
Very good, Nana. Hold on.

753
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,058
One, two, three!

754
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,268
Joy?

755
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,188
Let me see you.

756
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,149
All right, let's just wipe this.

757
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,442
Very good.

758
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,783
Ethan.

759
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,744
I'll do that.
Just take Nana out for a walk.

760
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,912
Go on.

761
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,375
<i>Go away!</i>

762
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,210
- Go away!
- It's Ethan! It's okay.

763
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,628
- Go away!
- Joy!

764
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,963
- Go away!
- What did you do?

765
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:11,964
- Go away!
- Nothing!

766
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,091
Nana, Joy is here.

767
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,759
You're okay. Let's go?

768
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,053
Ready? Very good.

769
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,974
See, just an hour of cleaning

770
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,935
buys us one burger each.

771
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,176
Ethan! Ethan!

772
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,886
- I'm sorry!
- You're okay.

773
00:43:58,969 --> 00:43:59,803
Please clean that.

774
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,388
- I'm sorry.
- Be careful.

775
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,349
- I'm sorry.
- You're okay, Nana.

776
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,558
You're okay.

777
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,062
Okay? Face me, face me.

778
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,990
I was the one who referred you.

779
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,492
It's my name on the line.

780
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:24,036
That was shit, Joy. Real shit.

781
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,955
No wonder no one took that job because…

782
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,124
Because they have a choice!
They have money.

783
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,793
We don't, Ethan.

784
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,431
Ethan?

785
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,434
Someone lent me his account.

786
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,104
I can start the delivery job today.

787
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,357
It's getting colder.

788
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,192
Can you handle it?

789
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,695
I have to.

790
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,161
I'll come home late, okay?

791
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,038
I accepted another cleaning job.

792
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,375
Okay.

793
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,437
<i>You tell your sister</i>
<i>that she'll have another person to feed!</i>

794
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,563
<i>Go on!</i>

795
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,440
How far along are you?

796
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,608
<i>I'm three months pregnant.</i>

797
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,776
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

798
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,404
<i>I didn't mean for this to happen.</i>

799
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,197
<i>Sorry.</i>

800
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,493
All right. I'll send money
for the check-ups.

801
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,912
<i>Sorry, Joy. You should be ashamed!</i>

802
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,373
I have to go.

803
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,317
Hello, Ethan?

804
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,068
Hello, Joy?

805
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,112
I'm lost.

806
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,157
My map is acting up.
I can't find the address.

807
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,617
My phone's about to die too.

808
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:30,162
- Joy!
- Hi, Nana! You're awake.

809
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,205
- Yes?
- Joy!

810
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:35,209
Ethan, take care of it.
Nana's here. I have to go.

811
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,668
<i>Bye.</i>

812
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,888
- <i>How much did you have to pay?</i>
- Seventy.

813
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,684
Please be careful next time, Ethan.

814
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,896
Instead of earning, we're losing.

815
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,329
I heard he's a big shot in Hong Kong!

816
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,707
Is that so?
Boss Manager, here's more!

817
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,003
You're not a boss here, buddy.

818
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,070
Ouch!

819
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,031
Dammit.

820
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,035
Shit.

821
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,414
<i>What if that syringe is infected?</i>

822
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,669
Get up! I'm taking you to the hospital.

823
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:03,213
- Go change! Come on!
- I don't have insurance here.

824
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,550
We'll think of something else.
Let's go. I'll borrow money.

825
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,219
- And lose more money?
- You might get sick…

826
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,346
I can't afford to be sick, Joy!

827
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,182
Forget it.

828
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:17,894
Just forget it.

829
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,773
<i>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau</i>

830
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,775
<i>has voiced his support for Canadians,</i>

831
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:27,571
<i>stating that the government</i>
<i>will "help Canadians financially"…</i>

832
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,948

<i>Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,</i>

833
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,825
<i>we are slowly getting back on our feet.</i>

834
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:35,329
<i>Some international flights</i>
<i>are now allowed, though with restrictions.</i>

835
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,290
<i>Countries like India, the UAE,</i>
<i>Bahrain, and Hong Kong</i>

836
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,292
<i>are now permitting</i>
<i>limited international flights…</i>

837
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,335
You forgot one.

838
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:45,547
<i>…but strict entry restrictions requiring</i>
<i>a quarantine period upon arrival.</i>

839
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,091
Throw it yourself.

840
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,468
- Damn you!
- Bring it on!

841
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:50,636
Damn you too!

842
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,596
That's enough.

843
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,182
Joy, are you mad at me?

844
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,103
Five minutes. Please.

845
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,897
No.

846
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,066
Talk to me, Joy.

847
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,319
Why are you mad at me?

848
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:11,657
Because you could've
just swallowed your pride,

849
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:16,495
so we could feed ourselves
and our families.

850
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,246
Are you taking their side?

851
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,791
I'm not taking anyone's side!

852
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,378
They were wrong, but so were you!

853
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,505
It's wrong to stand up for yourself?

854
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,799
It was wrong
to let your emotions take over.

855
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,678
I know it's tough.

856
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:36,056
It's tough for all of us,
but you have to be a little more patient.

857
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,475
- Someday we'll…
- What "someday"?!

858
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,435
There is no "someday" here!

859
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,480
We can build a life here in Canada.

860
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,232
What kind of life?

861
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:48,068
Cleaning other people's toilets?
Becoming their servants?

862
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,820
Throwing their trash?

863
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,947
And just wiping butts?

864
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,533
"Just"?

865
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,456
Is that how lowly you think of my job?

866
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,419
It's been my job from the beginning.

867
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,797
Joy, from then until now,
is this all you came to Canada for?

868
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,756
No.

869
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,261
But almost everybody who works abroad
starts at the bottom.

870
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,557
- I'm doing all of this for…
- That's you!

871
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,434
If that's what you want, go ahead!

872
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,229
But you were the one who said
that you are more than these jobs.

873
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,940
Joy, I am more than this!

874
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,945
Let's go back home!

875
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,905
I can give you a good life in Hong Kong.

876
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,158
I'm a permanent resident there.
I own a bar there…

877
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,492
That's going bankrupt.

878
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,873
Because instead of being there, I am here.

879
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,792
But here, you can have a good life…

880
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,211
I have no plans of living here, in Canada!

881
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,174
And I have no plans
of going back to Hong Kong.

882
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,185
You said you'd come back.

883
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,231
You promised, remember?

884
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,571
You accepted the ring. You said yes.

885
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,452
I said yes because I love you.

886
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,622
Because I want to be with you.

887
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,125
If that's true,
let's go back to Hong Kong.

888
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:40,555
Did you ask me to marry you,
so you could take me back to Hong Kong?

889
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,981
Did you say yes to make me stay here?

890
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,535
Canada is not for me.

891
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:07,082
And I'm not going back to Hong Kong.

892
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,578
- <i>Marie?</i>
- Uno!

893
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,580
<i>What's up?</i>

894
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,457
I've finally decided.

895
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:54,462
I'm taking the US offer.

896
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,883
You should start working
on your NCLEX application.

897
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,217
Good morning, Ed!

898
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,511
I know, but I still have
to settle some things.

899
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,888
- Good morning, Will!
- Good morning.

900
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,014
Hi, Michael!

901
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:07,517
My jobs, loans, application fees.

902
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,687
I'd offer to help,
but I know I'll only get a,

903
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,731
"No, thank you."

904
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:13,982
Smart!

905
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,861
Nurse Marie, from New York.

906
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,363
Sounds good, eh?

907
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,824
But why such a hurry?

908
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,910
Is he going with you?

909
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,454
Are you two together?

910
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,581
No.

911
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,666
Then why?

912
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,005
Because there's a chance for me there.

913
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,841
To be more!

914
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,428
More happy?

915
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,391
More successful.

916
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,644
More wealthy.

917
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,438
Just like you.

918
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:56,858
Well, I just hope you get to see John
before you leave.

919
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,402
Hey, Martha!

920
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,612
- Hold on.
- Marie.

921
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,740
Amy said Tonton changed his mind.

922
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,742
He's backing out of the job again.

923
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,203
Don't worry.

924
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,579
I'll take care of it.

925
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,415
I already brought your things.

926
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,630
Take this. For protection.

927
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,215
Hmm? From what?

928
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,175
You'll see.

929
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:29,474
Okay. Thank you.

930
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,644
I'll go ahead now.

931
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,437
- Bye.
- Bye.

932
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,231
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

933
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,985
- Who will replace Tonton?
- You'll see!

934
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,988
My gosh, I'm so excited!

935
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,906
Do I look okay?

936
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:48,159
I didn't even get
to doll up for my Jhim Buddy.

937
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,869
You look fine!

938
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,746
Stop being overdramatic!

939
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,498
He's not even here yet.

940
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,917
Late on his first day.

941
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,669
My God!

942
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:58,920
Get it for me, please?

943
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,055
Hello?

944
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,809
Jhim?

945
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,980
Hey, Jhim!

946
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,189
Present!

947
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,945
Uh…

948
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,615
Uhm…

949
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:37,625
I may have accidentally
given you Ethan's number.

950
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,796
Sorry. It's a misunderstanding.

951
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:43,548
I'll go now.

952
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,925
Wait! Ethan!

953
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,845
Joy, do you think
we can include Ethan in the…

954
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,181
The person I talked to was Jhim.

955
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,267
Jhim agreed to do this,
so Jhim will do the job.

956
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:56,811
You don't want it?

957
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,396
Jhim.

958
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:00,273
It's fine.

959
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:06,071
- I do.
- Jhim!

960
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,199
I haven't had my curls done today!

961
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:11,743
It's okay.
You still look pretty, my Jambi!

962
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,045
Poor Ethan!

963
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,379
You turned him away!

964
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,257
He can't do this job.

965
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,467
I know him.

966
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:30,929
Didn't you say you're strangers now?

967
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,181
Then you don't know him anymore.

968
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,390
Judger!

969
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:40,897
Let's all go to the homecare
as companions for the family day!

970
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,358
What will we do there?

971
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:47,153
There are some residents
who have been neglected by their families.

972
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,906
We can be the substitute family.

973
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:53,493
Tonton and I can do that!
He'll come this time. I promise.

974
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,452
Us too?

975
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:57,413
After what you did? No.

976
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:07,674
Marie, come on. So we have companions too.

977
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,844
I'm good on my own.

978
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,181
Happy Sunday, Martha!

979
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,767
I'll be your companion with Marie today.
Is that okay?

980
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,477
Oh, it's more than okay.

981
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,229
- I love it.
- Okay?

982
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,232
Uno, this is Amy.

983
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,276
And this is Tonton. Say hi.

984
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,735
They're my new housemates.

985
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,279
He's so handsome!

986
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,738
Thank you.

987
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,657
He can understand Filipino?

988
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,659
How embarrassing!

989
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:38,246
Hey, you! What are you doing?

990
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:43,042
It's not me. It's Jambi.

991
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,713
She invited Jhim, so I invited Ethan too.

992
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,175
I felt bad for him. He needs a job.

993
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,134
That's right.

994
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,594
Jhim!

995
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,053
- Oh no!
- Ethan.

996
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:54,971
Nice to see you again.

997
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,849
I'm glad you could join us.

998
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:00,727
Martha, these are Marie's friends.

999
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,313
Hello.

1000
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:04,772
Hello, ma'am.

1001
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,649
Good people.

1002
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,404
Martha, are you ready?

1003
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,658
I think I'm gonna want to make
a lot of bracelets today.

1004
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:20,747
This one is for overcoming obstacles.

1005
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:26,503
- And this one?
- Oh, that crystal has chosen you.

1006
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,297
This one is for love and healing.

1007
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:30,965
I want that one.

1008
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,091
No, you keep it…

1009
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,801
- Ma!
- Ma, help!

1010
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,553
She peed!

1011
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,473
Calm down, ma'am. Calm down.

1012
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:41,351
Calm down.

1013
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,186
Can you move a little here?

1014
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,939
Paula, wait.

1015
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,982
It's okay, Paula.
We'll get you cleaned up.

1016
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,692
- It's okay.
- Paula!

1017
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:50,652
You stay here.

1018
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,153
Paula, no!

1019
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,155
- Paula!
- Are you okay, Ethan?

1020
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,950
- Did it get hit?
- No.

1021
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,619
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1022
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,496
- Did it get hit?
- No.

1023
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,665
- Are you sure?
- Let's just clean this up.

1024
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,711
I hope this fits.

1025
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,588
Episodes like these
happen here all the time.

1026
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,090
I'm really sorry.

1027
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:14,300
- No, it's fine.
- Are you sure?

1028
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,052
Jhim, let's go.

1029
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,679
You can stay.

1030
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,264
This is a staff room anyway.

1031
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,473
I don't own this.

1032
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:23,393
You heard her. Keep going.

1033
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,738
Staff looking.

1034
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,156
We're in the staffroom.

1035
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,286
Let's go!
We have one more staff-over.

1036
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:12,066
- Hello.
- Hi there.

1037
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,069
- Oh.
- What can I get for you?

1038
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:18,948
One iced matcha latte to go, please.

1039
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,117
One iced matcha latte. Got it.

1040
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:24,662
He's not here.

1041
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,123
He took the morning shift
so he could accept a side job.

1042
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,958
Because you didn't give him the job.

1043
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,668
I'm not asking.

1044
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,046
I'm just saying.

1045
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,424
And I saw you looking yesterday.

1046
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,346
Just sharing…

1047
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:45,183
About the scar. Wanna know how he got it?

1048
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,602
I'm not asking.

1049
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,812
I'm just saying.

1050
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:53,232
He got stabbed by the triad
because he failed to pay them.

1051
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,692
He almost died.

1052
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:57,445
And remember their house in Cheung Chau?

1053
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,405
It's gone.

1054
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,074
They sold it to pay his debt.

1055
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,159
That's why the brothers got separated.

1056
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:08,247
Now, Ethan is working hard,
so they can be together again.

1057
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,249
Iced matcha latte.

1058
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,836
Thank you. I'm not asking.

1059
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,757
I'm just saying. Hey!

1060
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,468
Joy! Marie! Excuse me. Sorry.

1061
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:21,761
Joy! I mean, Marie!

1062
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,472
Do you want to catch up?
Need a friend today?

1063
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,641
I have a lot of friends.

1064
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,104
- <i>Joy?</i>
- Hello, Jambi.

1065
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,980
Where are you? Let's have coffee?

1066
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:35,858
<i>Oh, sorry. I'm working overtime.</i>

1067
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,446
<i>Sorry, I'm super tired.</i>

1068
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,909
<i>I'm so sorry, Marie.</i>
<i>We have an early shift tomorrow.</i>

1069
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:47,453
Oh. Okay. Next time.

1070
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,129
<i>I'm sorry, bro.</i>

1071
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:41,257
<i>I'm really short right now</i>
<i>with Ria pregnant and everything.</i>

1072
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,258
<i>I'm sorry too.</i>

1073
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,801
Edward, don't worry about it.

1074
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,637
It's my problem, I'll take care of it.

1075
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:51,017
I will save up.
I'll make it up to you eventually.

1076
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,435
<i>Manifesting, bro!</i>

1077
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,854
<i>I'm just here, ready to withdraw</i>
<i>from your account anytime.</i>

1078
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,856
<i>Hey! That's for your tuition fee.</i>

1079
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,775
<i>Of course, I'm a good boy.</i>

1080
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,694
<i>Received! Thank you.</i>

1081
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,781
- Thank you.
- <i>Thank you, bro.</i>

1082
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,908
- You boys take care.
- <i>Take care of yourself too.</i>

1083
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,428
Game!

1084
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,347
- Let's do it again.
- All right.

1085
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,515
Show it to them.

1086
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,355
- Again.
- …just kidding.

1087
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,359
Do you want some drinks?

1088
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:42,401
I'll get some for us.

1089
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,694
Sure.

1090
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,488
Chips. More chips.

1091
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:49,784
- Make some spread. Put it here.
- Oh, here.

1092
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:51,077
Uh…

1093
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,453
You're taking it.

1094
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,288
- Marie?
- Yes?

1095
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:57,583
Can I ask permission from you?

1096
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,253
You and Ethan have broken up
a long time ago, right?

1097
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:07,844
I'm asking because… you know, girl code.

1098
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,388
Is it all right if I date him?

1099
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,353
Definitely.

1100
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:21,524
My gosh! I was so nervous!

1101
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,985
I'm so relieved you're chill with it.

1102
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,571
Because I'm so excited

1103
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:29,866
to offer him the common-law pathway.

1104
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:33,494
We'll live together so he can be a PR.

1105
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:37,248
I'm so excited! Thank you!

1106
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,709
Thank you!

1107
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:40,960
- She's different.
- She's so bold!

1108
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,795
- Straight to the point!
- Amazing!

1109
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,006
- Straight to a pathway!
- Ethan.

1110
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:47,550
Ethan, come here!
I'll introduce you to my mom.

1111
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:50,845
Ma! Pa! This is my Ethan.

1112
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:53,222
Wow! Meet the parents straight away?

1113
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:55,683
Come on!

1114
01:04:55,766 --> 01:05:00,354
Let's eat!

1115
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,481
Do you want some chips, Ethan?

1116
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,151
I don't eat chips.

1117
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,819
Really?

1118
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,029
What about this one?

1119
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:10,197
Cookies.

1120
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,702
Do you want oatmeal or chocolate chip?

1121
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:18,414
- And do you like this drink?
- No.

1122
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:20,041
Here.

1123
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,461
Drink it.

1124
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:27,340
I don't think I can hold it in, Ethan.

1125
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,635
Guys! I'm going to propose right now!

1126
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:31,802
- What?
- What?

1127
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:35,806
Ethan, will you be my common-law husband?

1128
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,100
You'll be a PR.

1129
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,352
I won't charge you.

1130
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,312
It's for free!

1131
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,856
Just be my husband for a year.

1132
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,900
Baby? Baby!

1133
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,902
- Ma?
- Come here!

1134
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:49,278
Ma…

1135
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,948
I'm serious.

1136
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,866
Give me an answer when I come back.

1137
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,786
Wow! Aggressive.

1138
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:58,412
Desperate.

1139
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:01,457
But that's actually a good offer.

1140
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:05,127
If he says yes to Baby,
he'll be trapped forever!

1141
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,213
Trapped, but a PR.

1142
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,883
This is what you've been praying for.

1143
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,886
You'll get your brothers faster.

1144
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,012
Right?

1145
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,181
Dude, no.
You have to live together for a year.

1146
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:20,142
You have to be in an actual relationship
with proof.

1147
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,019
You have to submit pictures.

1148
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,897
Sweet-looking ones, so it's believable.

1149
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,273
And videos too.

1150
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,693
You have to send each other emails
and sweet messages.

1151
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:29,652
Lots of "I love yous".

1152
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:32,405
- Even sexy texts.
- Correct.

1153
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:35,324
- You have to live under one roof.
- One…

1154
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,160
One room?

1155
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,745
One bed!

1156
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,456
They will sleep together?

1157
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:47,086
Does that mean she can hug him?

1158
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:51,048
And… kiss him!

1159
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,175
She can do all sorts of things
to him!

1160
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,013
- And because we're men…
- I'll do it!

1161
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,305
What?

1162
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,269
I'll be your common-law wife.

1163
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:06,480
You're safer with me. We have history.

1164
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:09,233
Guaranteed that there are
no feelings involved.

1165
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,112
Once you're officially
a permanent resident, we can separate.

1166
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,906
And you'll be able
to help me. I need money.

1167
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,408
A fair exchange.

1168
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,827
But Baby offered it for free.

1169
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:23,748
There's a catch though. There's drama.

1170
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,583
Obviously, she has feelings for him.

1171
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:26,792
Unless…

1172
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,879
you like Baby too?

1173
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:34,842
I don't want drama and complications.

1174
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,895
What's going on, guys? What did I miss?

1175
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:48,064
- You missed your chance!
- What?

1176
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:52,318
Ethan said yes to be a common-law husband…

1177
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,487
- Aww!
- of Marie!

1178
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,629
Don't be too loud.

1179
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,640
What about Uno?

1180
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,850
They're not dating.

1181
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:33,025
So… are we back together now?

1182
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:36,821
For a year.

1183
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,283
Copy.

1184
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:50,668
Stupid!

1185
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:51,752
Why?!

1186
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,879
Stupid!

1187
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,340
So weak! Damn! Shit!

1188
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:15,192
Shout-out to my Jhim Buddies!

1189
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:18,696
Leaving now, live in later.

1190
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:21,532
Ethan, pay your debt with interest.

1191
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:23,701
- Yes, Uncle. I'll wire the payment.
- Hey.

1192
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,786
To those who want to claim
my handsome BFF,

1193
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:29,415
I'm sorry, guys. He's already taken. Aww.

1194
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,000
Ehh, Jhim Buddies!

1195
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:33,294
Eyy!

1196
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:36,463
They're on their way!

1197
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,886
Wow! Upgrade!

1198
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,889
- Marie!
- Showering now?

1199
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:05,159
You can do this.

1200
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,456
Marie!

1201
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:11,957
She's coming!

1202
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,500
Hmm, smells good!

1203
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:15,461
- Wow!
- Pretty!

1204
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:16,587
So fresh!

1205
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,172
Frefared!

1206
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:23,177
Hello.

1207
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,596
Hello.

1208
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,890
It doesn't look convincing.

1209
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:29,683
He's right. Do it again!

1210
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:32,561
Hello.

1211
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:36,482
Now that's more like it!

1212
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,818
I'm so giddy.

1213
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:57,044
We need a game plan for your visa.

1214
01:10:57,127 --> 01:11:00,130
We have to impress the IRCC

1215
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:03,092
because they're the ones
approving your visa.

1216
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:06,553
That we're a real couple
and that we love each other.

1217
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:09,974
But that's difficult for me.

1218
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,019
But I'll do it for the money.

1219
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:17,314
Copy. For my PR.

1220
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:20,317
Good.

1221
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:22,903
<i>We need to gather proof</i>
<i>of relationship.</i>

1222
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,405
<i>Like old mementos.</i>

1223
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:27,658
Time stopped, but a lot has happened.

1224
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:30,744
Life must go on. We can't stop.

1225
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,457
Yes, but some things remained.

1226
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,130
Only because they can be pawned.

1227
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:43,048
<i>We need our old photos.</i>

1228
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,134
<i>There's just one problem.</i>

1229
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:47,094
Not even a single photo?

1230
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:48,178
- Lame.
- Right.

1231
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:49,638
- I have lots.
- Oh!

1232
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,433
Okay! Let's see it, eh?

1233
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:57,563
Wow. Look, babe. He has lots.

1234
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:58,981
Bye, love birds.

1235
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:02,151
- He does indeed.
- I'll go ahead too.

1236
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:03,485
Bye!

1237
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,113
<i>But aside from old memories,</i>

1238
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:07,865
<i>we also need to take new ones.</i>

1239
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:10,868
<i>Proof that we're still together</i>
<i>and still in love.</i>

1240
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:13,412
One. Two. Faster!

1241
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,540
Wait! Can you do it again? Sweeter…

1242
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:19,251
- That's enough!
- Just like in Hong Kong.

1243
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:28,761
<i>Everybody must believe</i>

1244
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,888
<i>that we are back together for real.</i>

1245
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:37,603
<i>We must be social media official,</i>
<i>so there are online records.</i>

1246
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:42,733
Hey.

1247
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:45,736
Don't forget this is all fake.

1248
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,490
I know. I'm just fake smiling.

1249
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,951
Now that's a fake answer.

1250
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,876
What a sweet smile.

1251
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:14,515
It smells like…

1252
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:16,600
Hi, Marie!

1253
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:18,185
- Baby!
- What a pity I have to leave.

1254
01:13:18,268 --> 01:13:20,646
The three of us could've bonded!

1255
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:23,065
Fake wife.

1256
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:25,609
Future wife.

1257
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:26,693
Bye.

1258
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:30,656
I better go to work.

1259
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,324
You better shower!

1260
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:45,170
There. Smells like Boracay.

1261
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,757
There you go, Ton.
Smells like the Philippines.

1262
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,008
Smells like jealousy too.

1263
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,593
Correct?

1264
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:52,761
- Correct!
- Correct!

1265
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,263
Correct!

1266
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:57,724
<i>There must be boundaries.</i>

1267
01:13:57,808 --> 01:14:00,519
<i>Let's keep it professional.</i>
<i>We can't get carried away.</i>

1268
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,205
Joy! Are you okay?

1269
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:25,127
Yeah.
I'm just looking for my slippers.

1270
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:36,513
<i>After all, this is just a show.</i>

1271
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:46,899
- Fall season is here. And they're falling.
- Hmm.

1272
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,154
I thought you were still recording.

1273
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:25,938
<i>Say hi to your auntie…</i>
<i>and to your new godfather.</i>

1274
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:30,150
<i>And finally, we have to make it</i>
<i>official to our friends and families.</i>

1275
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:33,779
Bless you.

1276
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:37,741
<i>Ethan,</i>
<i>don't hurt my sister again, okay?</i>

1277
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:40,494
<i>Or else, I'll ask Papa to haunt you.</i>

1278
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:47,084
He died a year after your dad died.

1279
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,380
<i>Joy, you'll be the godmother, okay?</i>

1280
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:52,381
Sure.

1281
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:54,800
<i>Be the godmother</i>
<i>to my soon-to-be baby too.</i>

1282
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:56,218
Hey! You're too young for that!

1283
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:03,058
<i>Joy Marie Fabregas!</i>

1284
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:06,103
<i>From Ma-rinduque!</i>

1285
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:09,106
<i>Ma-ganda!</i>

1286
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:12,359
<i>Ma-talino!</i>

1287
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:14,319
<i>And most of all…</i>

1288
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:17,739
<i>Ma-pagmahal!</i>

1289
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:24,955
<i>Whom we missed very much!</i>

1290
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:28,917
<i>Joy is back!</i>

1291
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:35,841
Joy is back.

1292
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,512
So,are you and Ethan
getting serious?

1293
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,098
I'm just helping an old friend.

1294
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:45,559
He helped me when I was in Hong Kong

1295
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:47,936
wanting to go to Canada.

1296
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,479
And now that I can,

1297
01:16:50,063 --> 01:16:52,024
I'm just helping him in return.

1298
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:55,569
I'm also a friend
yet you won't allow me to help you.

1299
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,074
You are helping me become a nurse.

1300
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:04,661
Trust me.

1301
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:06,997
This is purely business.

1302
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,917
Nothing will stop me from going to the US.

1303
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:16,089
Well, am I talking to Marie,
or am I talking to Joy?

1304
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:20,427
Because both of them seem like
they want two separate things.

1305
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,648
Who's next?

1306
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,483
- Jhim! Jhim!
- Papa Ethan!

1307
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:38,195
- I don't want.
- You can do it!

1308
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:40,280
Remember, we're getting paid here.

1309
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:47,245
Go, Jhim Buddy!

1310
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:48,914
Hello, everyone!

1311
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,708
I am Jhim, and I am Ethan!

1312
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,877
- And we are from Hong Kong!
- Hong Kong!

1322
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:38,839
They all like it.

1323
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:43,802
It's a song about

1324
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:47,222
not giving up on your dream.

1325
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,434
Your life's theme song.

1326
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:53,437
You're almost there, Marie.

1327
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:28,073
Good night.

1328
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:32,035
Good night.

1329
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:53,056
<i>I need to go home!</i>

1330
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:55,141
I need to see John!

1331
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:57,435
Please! I wanna go home! Let me go home!

1332
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,521
Martha, calm down.

1333
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:03,358
I wasted all those years working
and I never saw him!

1334
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:05,277
I just wanna go home!

1335
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,237
I'm stuck here all alone,
and I wanna go home!

1336
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,905
Martha, listen to me.

1337
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:11,283
- I understand.
- No, I…

1338
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:14,077
I spent all those years working.

1339
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,913
I missed so much time with him.

1340
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:18,248
And for what?

1341
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,585
I'm stuck here all alone.

1342
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:23,712
I just want to go home.

1343
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:27,799
I don't want to be all alone.

1344
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,176
I just want to go home.

1345
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:32,304
Please.

1346
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:33,763
But this is your home now.

1347
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:35,515
No, it isn't.

1348
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:36,892
Home is where John is.

1349
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:39,686
I don't want to be alone here.

1350
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:41,313
Just go home, everyone!

1351
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:44,024
Stop working and go home
to your families! Go home.

1352
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:46,693
Let's go home, Mama. I don't like it here.

1353
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:48,695
Here we go again.

1354
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:51,781
Tonton, you'll have a better future here.

1355
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,119
Let him decide for himself, Amy.

1356
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:57,996
You're doing the right thing, Amy.

1357
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,706
Do you really want to raise

1358
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:01,458
your children
in the Philippines these days?

1359
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:05,503
You may earn higher here,
but it's more fun in the Philippines!

1360
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:09,090
For me, whatever supports my family,

1361
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:10,133
that is my home.

1362
01:22:10,216 --> 01:22:11,217
That's why Canada is home.

1363
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:13,887
Careful, sis.

1364
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:15,555
Instead of being a Filipino hero,

1365
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:16,806
you'll be tagged as a traitor.

1366
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,643
But even so,

1367
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:23,313
I still want to go back home.

1368
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:24,814
As soon as I get rich.

1369
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:27,108
The question is, what comes first?

1370
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:28,568
Getting rich or getting old?

1371
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:30,195
Getting rich!

1372
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:32,697
I will not grow old here.

1373
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,157
I'll go back.

1374
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,992
The Philippines is still my home.

1375
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:40,330
For me, my son is my home.

1376
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:42,540
John has my heart.

1377
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,918
He is my home.

1378
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:19,119
Oh!

1379
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,915
You haven't eaten yet?

1380
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:27,419
I was waiting for you.

1381
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:32,716
Why?

1382
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:35,010
Happy monthsary!

1383
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:43,560
Wow!

1384
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:45,854
This is impressive!

1385
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,616
Why?

1386
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:02,037
I just remembered

1387
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:05,081
our first monthsary in Hong Kong.

1388
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,251
Mm.

1389
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:10,712
Yeah.

1390
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:15,884
We had our date on our balcony,
and we only had

1391
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:18,178
noodles and bottled iced tea.

1392
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:22,515
This is definitely a level-up!

1393
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:24,976
Steak and wine!

1394
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:28,563
Which came from your freezer.

1395
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:39,616
You've come a long way, Joy.

1396
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,749
Such an expensive fare coming here.

1397
01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:49,209
Literally,

1398
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:52,754
paid with blood, sweat, and tears.

1399
01:25:02,555 --> 01:25:06,059
The thing I wrote on the railing,
is it still there?

1400
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:08,561
- "Joy is here"?
- Yes.

1401
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:10,563
It's gone.

1402
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:12,982
Apparently,

1403
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:16,402
a permanent marker is no match

1404
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:19,364
for sunlight, rain, and time.

1405
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,245
Joy is not there anymore.

1406
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,334
Because Joy is here now.

1407
01:25:40,426 --> 01:25:42,887
I'm happy for who you have become

1408
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:46,266
and for who you will become.

1409
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:05,827
Okay! We are going to play
monkey-in-the-middle!

1410
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:06,995
- You're the monkey!
- I'm the monkey.

1411
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:08,288
Don't let me touch the ball. Okay?

1412
01:26:08,371 --> 01:26:09,205
- Ready?
- Okay!

1413
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:10,874
Don't let the monkey get the ball.

1414
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:14,752
I'm the monkey.

1415
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,588
Okay. Whoever wins,

1416
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:19,757
I will buy roller blades, all right?

1417
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:30,643
I'll get you some water.

1418
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,979
- Oh, yes, please.
- Thank you.

1419
01:26:33,062 --> 01:26:34,272
Be careful.

1420
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:38,443
- Oh, Martha. The ball.
- Oh, oh.

1421
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:40,236
Pass it.

1422
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,113
Ethan!

1423
01:27:00,423 --> 01:27:01,758
ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY HOME?

1424
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:03,843
ETHAN, WHERE ARE YOU?
WHY AREN'T YOU REPLYING?

1425
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:05,637
ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY HOME?

1426
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:22,070
Dammit.

1427
01:27:31,996 --> 01:27:35,500


1428
01:27:38,878 --> 01:27:39,921
Hello, Edward?

1429
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:08,741
Something wrong?

1430
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:13,788
Papa tested positive for COVID-19.

1431
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:41,357
Hello, Ethan?

1432
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:42,608
<i>Joy…</i>

1433
01:28:43,609 --> 01:28:44,861
<i>Papa didn't make it.</i>

1434
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:47,905
I didn't make it on time.

1435
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:51,951
I was late.

1436
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:56,289
<i>I was too late.</i>

1437
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:58,666
I'm sorry.

1438
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:14,974
I didn't even get to see him.

1439
01:29:31,824 --> 01:29:32,867
Ethan.

1440
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:35,244
Buddy.

1441
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,253
<i>Joy, please.</i>

1442
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:45,838
We get you.

1443
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:49,717
But he really needs you right now.

1444
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:52,595
After his dad's death, his bar closed.

1445
01:29:52,678 --> 01:29:55,640
And that damn triad is threatening him.

1446
01:29:56,432 --> 01:29:59,685
Jhim, if I go there now,
I might not be able to come back here.

1447
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:01,521
<i>Joy, we understand you.</i>

1448
01:30:01,604 --> 01:30:04,482
Mrs. Smith, have you seen Mrs. Campbell?

1449
01:30:04,565 --> 01:30:05,733
Why? Is she missing again?

1450
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:07,485
Yes. Thank you.

1451
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:10,613
<i>You know I haven't secured my status yet.</i>

1452
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:12,949
Don't force her!

1453
01:30:13,032 --> 01:30:14,408
Dammit!

1454
01:30:15,284 --> 01:30:17,662
<i>Stop begging.</i>

1455
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:20,665
Dammit, Joy!

1456
01:30:21,707 --> 01:30:24,919
The world is ending
yet all you think about is yourself!

1457
01:30:29,715 --> 01:30:34,637
<i>Joy, he's just drunk</i>
<i>and going through a lot.</i>

1458
01:30:38,057 --> 01:30:39,892
Dammit!

1459
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:21,601
- Hello, Joy?
- I'm on my way there.

1460
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:25,313
<i>I got the 4 p.m. flight. That's the…</i>

1461
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:42,288
<i>Joy… Joy, I'm so sorry. Joy.</i>
<i>It's not what it seems.</i>

1462
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,709
<i>Joy… Joy, I'm sorry.</i>

1463
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:42,473
- Jhim!
- <i>Hello?</i>

1464
01:32:42,556 --> 01:32:44,350
Are you with Ethan?

1465
01:32:44,433 --> 01:32:47,353
<i>No, they left earlier.</i>

1466
01:32:48,145 --> 01:32:49,647
<i>Maybe he's still with Baby?</i>

1467
01:32:52,316 --> 01:32:53,693
Hmm.

1468
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:55,236
Never mind. He's here.

1469
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:57,029
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

1470
01:32:59,573 --> 01:33:01,409
It's already morning.

1471
01:33:03,202 --> 01:33:05,913
Baby and I talked.
I didn't notice the time.

1472
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:08,124
Wow!

1473
01:33:08,207 --> 01:33:11,877
What did you two do?
Her scent is all over you.

1474
01:33:12,586 --> 01:33:14,755
My baby…

1475
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:16,215
Joy, we just talked.

1476
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:18,509
Then why bother coming home?!

1477
01:33:18,592 --> 01:33:21,595
You should've stayed there
and talked all night!

1478
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:24,265
What kind of conversation
made your hands too busy

1479
01:33:24,348 --> 01:33:27,727
that you couldn't even call or text
to let me know where you are?

1480
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:30,771
I couldn't respond because my phone died.

1481
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:35,026
How convenient that your battery died!

1482
01:33:35,109 --> 01:33:38,529
If I only knew
what you guys were really doing!

1483
01:33:40,364 --> 01:33:41,824
Joy, what are you saying?

1484
01:33:41,907 --> 01:33:45,536
I don't know!
I don't know what I'm saying!

1485
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:49,749
Why are you thinking that way?

1486
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:52,126
What do you want me to think?

1487
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:54,503
That you just stared at each other?
That you just ate?

1488
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:56,255
Or you had coffee? Just said hello?

1489
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:58,132
Did she hug you?

1490
01:33:58,215 --> 01:34:00,509
- Did you kiss her?
- Joy, we just talked.

1491
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:01,802
Don't make me a fool!

1492
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:02,845
I'm not fooling you!

1493
01:34:02,928 --> 01:34:06,390
You did it before, you can do it again!

1494
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,482
- Joy…
- Don't

1495
01:34:14,565 --> 01:34:16,192
you dare come near me!

1496
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:31,582
Damn, Ethan.

1497
01:34:35,711 --> 01:34:38,881
I was willing to stop for you.

1498
01:34:43,135 --> 01:34:44,970
All my plans…

1499
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:48,808
my dreams…

1500
01:34:50,684 --> 01:34:54,814
even my promise to myself
that I will never go back to Hong Kong…

1501
01:34:54,897 --> 01:34:56,649
I was willing to let that all go.

1502
01:34:57,441 --> 01:35:00,152
Just to be with you.

1503
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:05,825
But what did you do?

1504
01:35:31,934 --> 01:35:33,811
So many trains passed by…

1505
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:37,523
One, two,

1506
01:35:37,606 --> 01:35:38,858
three.

1507
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:41,402
Thirty.

1508
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:45,573
For every train that passed by,

1509
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:49,201
I wanted to jump.

1510
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:52,621
Just so the pain would end.

1511
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:01,338
But I told myself, no.

1512
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:07,344
I will not be weak like you.

1513
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:24,987
I'm sorry, Joy.

1514
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:31,160
I'm so sorry.

1515
01:36:31,243 --> 01:36:32,578
I was such an asshole.

1516
01:36:33,245 --> 01:36:35,164
You really are!

1517
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:37,583
You're an asshole!

1518
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:41,170
A stupid asshole!

1519
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:47,218
But I am more stupid because…

1520
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:49,929
here you are again,

1521
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:52,473
and I am here again.

1522
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:57,061
Shit!

1523
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:05,319
Why did I let you into my life again?

1524
01:37:09,031 --> 01:37:10,449
I understand you, Joy.

1525
01:37:14,036 --> 01:37:16,121
That's what I told Baby too.

1526
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:20,042
Baby?

1527
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:25,381
What did you tell her?

1528
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:30,052
That we're ending this.

1529
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:34,890
End?

1530
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:38,185
I talked to Baby

1531
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:40,646
because she said
she would report us to the IRCC.

1532
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:45,109
If she does that,
you'll get in trouble too.

1533
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:51,574
You could lose everything.

1534
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:55,536
And I don't want that to happen.

1535
01:37:58,455 --> 01:38:00,124
So, I told her we're going to end this.

1536
01:38:02,626 --> 01:38:04,128
We're going to stop.

1537
01:38:10,092 --> 01:38:11,051
Why?

1538
01:38:12,928 --> 01:38:14,930
Because she thinks this is becoming real.

1539
01:38:19,893 --> 01:38:21,562
It's becoming real?

1540
01:38:26,483 --> 01:38:27,985
That's not true, right?

1541
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:32,156
No.

1542
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,116
No, she's wrong.

1543
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,327
It's wrong.

1544
01:38:39,788 --> 01:38:41,832
That's why we should make it right.

1545
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:44,835
I don't want to!

1546
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:48,756
- You don't want what?
- I don't know!

1547
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:51,383
What do you want?

1548
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:53,552
I don't know!

1549
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:59,975
I don't like that I'm jealous
because I shouldn't be!

1550
01:39:00,559 --> 01:39:02,686
I don't like that I'm mad
that you're ending this

1551
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:04,772
because I shouldn't be!

1552
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:09,943
I don't like that
I'm happy when I'm with you

1553
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:11,987
because I shouldn't be!

1554
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:16,825
I hate that I don't want to end this
because I should!

1555
01:39:23,457 --> 01:39:24,458
Why?

1556
01:39:30,089 --> 01:39:32,257
Joy, I will only do
what you want me to do.

1557
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:40,849
Do you want me to leave?

1558
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:52,986
Do you want me to stay?

1559
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:02,204
Do you want me back?

1560
01:40:14,383 --> 01:40:15,759
Do you still love me?

1561
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:25,811
I don't.

1562
01:40:30,524 --> 01:40:32,276
I don't love you.

1563
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:49,371
Marie. It's Martha…

1564
01:43:41,214 --> 01:43:43,091
They found this by her bedside.

1565
01:43:44,176 --> 01:43:46,386
She wanted you to have it.

1566
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:12,746
She's with John now.

1567
01:44:35,227 --> 01:44:37,437
Hey. Why so sad?

1568
01:44:39,982 --> 01:44:42,317
Let's just do grocery therapy.

1569
01:44:43,235 --> 01:44:44,403
You can't be sad.

1570
01:44:44,987 --> 01:44:46,571
Joy is back now, right?

1571
01:44:48,031 --> 01:44:50,242
Ethan! Let's go!

1572
01:44:58,458 --> 01:44:59,376
Let's go?

1573
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:02,629
Hmm.

1574
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:03,880
Let's get going!

1575
01:45:05,298 --> 01:45:07,718
- Let me.
- Thank you.

1576
01:45:08,844 --> 01:45:11,096
Oh my! Joy!

1577
01:45:11,179 --> 01:45:12,806
There's a letter from the US embassy!

1578
01:45:12,889 --> 01:45:15,308
I'm sure it's your US visa!

1579
01:45:23,442 --> 01:45:24,985
Um…

1580
01:45:25,068 --> 01:45:27,446
I just realized I'm fully stocked.

1581
01:45:27,529 --> 01:45:28,780
You guys go.

1582
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:38,790
I'm sorry.

1583
01:45:41,209 --> 01:45:43,795
I didn't think it would come this soon.

1584
01:45:46,631 --> 01:45:48,133
I should've told you.

1585
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:52,304
You don't have to tell me anything.

1586
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:57,184
We're not together.

1587
01:46:08,403 --> 01:46:09,863
You'll be a nurse soon.

1588
01:46:12,324 --> 01:46:13,408
Amazing.

1589
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:18,288
Finally, Canada and then America.

1590
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:23,752
That has always been your plan, right?

1591
01:46:35,597 --> 01:46:36,723
How about you?

1592
01:46:43,647 --> 01:46:44,940
I'm staying, Joy.

1593
01:46:49,319 --> 01:46:51,029
My journey ends here.

1594
01:46:58,411 --> 01:47:02,290
I can't leave my responsibilities behind
to chase after other people.

1595
01:47:06,628 --> 01:47:08,255
I have to commit to this.

1596
01:47:11,007 --> 01:47:13,176
For my brothers and myself.

1597
01:47:21,935 --> 01:47:23,937
I want to hold you so bad right now.

1598
01:47:25,856 --> 01:47:27,649
I want to embrace you.

1599
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:33,363
I want to stop you.

1600
01:47:34,865 --> 01:47:36,950
I want to make you choose.

1601
01:47:37,784 --> 01:47:39,744
But I won't do that.

1602
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:46,543
Because we're way past that.

1603
01:48:03,935 --> 01:48:06,438
It's enough
that despite how big the world is…

1604
01:48:09,983 --> 01:48:11,776
our paths crossed again.

1605
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:18,575
It's enough for me…

1606
01:48:19,701 --> 01:48:25,707
that no matter
how far you've already gone,

1607
01:48:29,502 --> 01:48:30,754
once in your journey…

1608
01:48:34,674 --> 01:48:36,218
you stopped for me…

1609
01:48:37,844 --> 01:48:39,179
even for just a while.

1610
01:48:45,268 --> 01:48:48,146
Am I for a love that lasts, Ethan?

1611
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:04,496
I hope you find
the answers to the questions

1612
01:49:04,579 --> 01:49:06,331
that only you can answer.

1613
01:49:12,754 --> 01:49:14,881
And if one day we see each other again,

1614
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:22,764
don't be a stranger, okay?

1615
01:49:25,767 --> 01:49:27,310
You can always say "hello".

1616
01:49:38,488 --> 01:49:40,573
This is the last time I'll say this…

1617
01:49:50,458 --> 01:49:51,626
Goodbye, Joy.

1618
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:40,508
<i>This is so sad.</i>

1619
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:43,428
This is why Tonton doesn't like goodbyes.

1620
01:50:43,511 --> 01:50:46,139
Oh my God! You're leaving now?

1621
01:50:46,222 --> 01:50:48,016
Canada will miss you.

1622
01:50:48,099 --> 01:50:50,101
And so will the people in Canada.

1623
01:50:51,269 --> 01:50:53,521
I'll miss you.

1624
01:51:17,295 --> 01:51:18,963
<i>My dearest Marie,</i>

1625
01:51:19,589 --> 01:51:23,968
<i>the last bracelet I will leave you</i>
<i>is for joy and happiness.</i>

1626
01:51:24,052 --> 01:51:25,929
<i>It's everything you deserve,</i>

1627
01:51:26,012 --> 01:51:28,598
<i>as you have given me</i>
<i>and all those who needed family</i>

1628
01:51:28,681 --> 01:51:29,974
<i>love and care.</i>

1629
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:33,937
<i>Marie, I'm going to John now.</i>

1630
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:37,774
<i>My joy, my home, my</i> tahanan.

1631
01:51:38,441 --> 01:51:41,069
<i>What a beautiful name you have for home.</i>

1632
01:51:41,778 --> 01:51:44,781
<i>A place of peace where one stops crying.</i>

1633
01:51:46,157 --> 01:51:49,077
<i>Where you can come back to</i>
<i>when you're tired,</i>

1634
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,871
<i>afraid, empty, and lonely.</i>

1635
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:55,625
<i>A home that will fill you</i>
<i>with so much love,</i>

1636
01:51:55,708 --> 01:51:56,626
<i>strength, and courage,</i>

1637
01:51:56,709 --> 01:51:59,754
<i>until you're ready to go out</i>
<i>to face the world again.</i>

1638
01:52:01,047 --> 01:52:04,551
<i>A home that embraces you,</i>
<i>no matter who you have become,</i>

1639
01:52:04,634 --> 01:52:07,345
<i>and forgives you when you fail to become.</i>

1640
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:12,350
<i>A home that welcomes you</i>
<i>with the warmest hello,</i>

1641
01:52:12,434 --> 01:52:14,644
<i>no matter how long you've been gone.</i>

1642
01:52:16,396 --> 01:52:18,481
<i>A home where love stays,</i>

1643
01:52:18,565 --> 01:52:21,151
<i>no matter how many times you say goodbye</i>

1644
01:52:21,234 --> 01:52:23,486
<i>and waits for your next return.</i>

1645
01:52:24,863 --> 01:52:27,323
<i>A home where joy can be found.</i>

1646
01:52:29,826 --> 01:52:32,454
<i>Often times, we leave</i>
<i>our homes to become more</i>

1647
01:52:33,163 --> 01:52:35,165
<i>and give more to our loved ones.</i>

1648
01:52:37,959 --> 01:52:40,628
<i>But sometimes we lose ourselves</i>
<i>in doing that.</i>

1649
01:52:41,838 --> 01:52:44,257
<i>And when we finally want to come home,</i>

1650
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:46,718
<i>we realize that no one is there anymore.</i>

1651
01:52:47,427 --> 01:52:49,179
<i>I don't wish that for you.</i>

1652
01:53:24,339 --> 01:53:25,465
Can I see you again?

1653
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:27,800
I love you!

1654
01:53:27,884 --> 01:53:29,761
I don't love you!

1655
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:37,268
Fellow Filipino!

1656
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:41,898
<i>I hope you find your</i> tahanan, <i>Marie.</i>

1657
01:53:41,981 --> 01:53:43,566
<i>And when you do,</i>

1658
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:45,485
<i>I hope you come home.</i>

1659
01:53:50,323 --> 01:53:51,407
Let's go back.

1660
01:53:52,408 --> 01:53:53,660
Are you sure?

1661
01:53:54,827 --> 01:53:55,787
Yes.

1662
01:54:37,203 --> 01:54:38,496
What can I do for you?

1663
01:54:50,675 --> 01:54:51,926
Hello.

1664
01:54:53,928 --> 01:54:54,971
Hello.

1665
01:54:57,432 --> 01:54:59,601
Didn't I promise you

1666
01:55:01,394 --> 01:55:02,562
that I will come back?

1667
01:55:05,773 --> 01:55:08,610
And didn't I promise to wait?

1668
01:55:09,944 --> 01:55:11,529
Now you're back.

1669
01:55:16,743 --> 01:55:18,912
Because you are my home.

1670
01:55:21,664 --> 01:55:23,458
You are my more.

1671
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:29,297
You are my joy.

1672
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:53,696
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1673
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:58,242
<i>please welcome Mr. and Mrs. Ethan</i>
<i>and Joy Del Rosario!</i>

1674
01:55:58,326 --> 01:56:00,119
<i>Some places we stay in forever.</i>

1675
01:56:00,954 --> 01:56:02,956
<i>Some places are mere stopovers.</i>

1676
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:06,459
<i>And there are places</i>
<i>we always come back to.</i>

1677
01:56:07,335 --> 01:56:08,586
<i>Our home.</i>

1678
01:56:09,337 --> 01:56:10,380
<i>Just like people,</i>

1679
01:56:11,255 --> 01:56:12,590
<i>there are those you come back to,</i>

1680
01:56:12,674 --> 01:56:15,093
<i>no matter how far</i>
<i>or long the journey has been.</i>

1681
01:56:16,219 --> 01:56:17,971
<i>That is you, Ethan.</i>

1682
01:56:18,054 --> 01:56:19,347
<i>And that is you, Joy.</i>

1683
01:56:20,223 --> 01:56:21,933
<i>Wherever we go…</i>

1684
01:56:22,016 --> 01:56:24,060
<i>No matter how long we're apart…</i>

1685
01:56:24,894 --> 01:56:26,270
<i>I will come home to you.</i>

1686
01:56:27,063 --> 01:56:30,066
<i>Because from now until the end,</i>

1687
01:56:30,149 --> 01:56:31,693
<i>you are my home.</i>

1688
01:58:34,816 --> 01:58:35,858
It's not yet boarding.

1689
01:58:36,943 --> 01:58:38,027
Joy! Ethan!

1690
01:58:38,111 --> 01:58:39,112
- Can they still make it?
- Yes!

1691
01:58:39,195 --> 01:58:41,656
- Can we still make it?
- Yes!

1692
01:58:41,739 --> 01:58:44,117
- Thank goodness.
- Go on!

1693
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:46,410
Tonton is happy now.

1694
01:58:46,494 --> 01:58:47,495
You made it.

1695
01:58:47,578 --> 01:58:51,249
Thank you very much for everything.

1696
01:58:51,332 --> 01:58:52,667
Take care you two, please.

1697
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:55,795
If we get you an LMIA, please come back.

1698
01:58:55,878 --> 01:58:57,755
It depends on Tonton.

1699
01:58:57,839 --> 01:59:01,717
Because, you know
wherever Tonton finds his joy,

1700
01:59:01,801 --> 01:59:02,885
I'll be there.

1701
01:59:05,012 --> 01:59:08,516
I'm sorry, Canada is not for me.

1702
01:59:08,599 --> 01:59:10,768
That's all right. You're still young.

1703
01:59:12,812 --> 01:59:14,564
You'll find your joy too.

1704
01:59:16,983 --> 01:59:18,067
- Go ahead.
- Okay, hurry.

1705
01:59:18,151 --> 01:59:20,194
- Have a safe flight.
- Take care.

1706
01:59:28,244 --> 01:59:29,704
My Jambi…

1707
01:59:33,374 --> 01:59:34,876
I'll take you home.

1708
01:59:34,959 --> 01:59:37,170
- We'll go ahead.
- Take care.

1709
01:59:39,547 --> 01:59:40,840
Let's go home?

1710
01:59:42,008 --> 01:59:43,843
But I'm already home.

1711
01:59:43,926 --> 01:59:44,927
Where?

1712
01:59:45,928 --> 01:59:47,346
In your heart.
