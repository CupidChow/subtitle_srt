When will you tell everyone the truth?

5
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:24,000
I hope you aren’t brainwashed by Ayan yet.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,147
I’m still the same person.

7
00:00:25,147 --> 00:00:29,800
That notebook is a reminder of someone who has left this world.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,600
if you know who took it,

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,811
please let me know.

10
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:40,609
Are you avoiding me?

11
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:42,078
I’m not.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,756
I just wanted to sit at the stern.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,694
Yeah?

14
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:46,609
Yeah.

15
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:56,014
When you talk to me, look into my eyes.

16
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:02,551
All right.

17
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:57,153
It’s time we go back.

18
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,640
Akk.

19
00:02:20,745 --> 00:02:23,335
Akk, wear your shoes first or your feet might hurt.

20
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,104
Akk!

21
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:29,500
Talk to me.

22
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,260
Let go of me.

23
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:34,119
I don’t want my parents to see us.

24
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:42,242
Why didn’t you let me do it?

25
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,748
Nothing happened there.

26
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,502
I think something happened, Akk.

27
00:02:49,547 --> 00:02:50,741
Your eyes

28
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:53,318
and your body

29
00:02:54,703 --> 00:02:56,121
said something did happen.

30
00:02:58,694 --> 00:02:59,855
If it’s something to you, fine.

31
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:01,955
It’s nothing to me.

32
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:08,213
Are you going to deny everything?

33
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:15,292
You have the right to follow your heart.

34
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:30,441
I choose not to do it.

35
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:32,600
That’s my right too, isn't it?

36
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:34,954
Don’t you talk to me about this again.

37
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:43,399
Akk.

38
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:24,772
Who is it?

39
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:27,195
Me.

40
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:32,303
Shameless.

41
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:36,015
Get out of here before my parents see you.

42
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:37,633
Why, Akk?

43
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,777
You keep saying you’re afraid people will see.

44
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:44,030
What if they do?

45
00:05:44,663 --> 00:05:46,493
Can’t two male friends spend time together?

46
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:50,987
I don’t know.

47
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,763
But I’m not okay with it.

48
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:54,551
Get out now.

49
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:55,407
Hold on.

50
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:58,556
Aren’t you going to ask me why I’m here?

51
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:00,082
Why are you here?

52
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:03,579
Can I borrow your underwear?

53
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,508
What?

54
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:09,186
You’re not so much bigger than me.

55
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,186
I guess we can share.

56
00:06:11,544 --> 00:06:12,417
Can I borrow yours?

57
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:13,374
No.

58
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:14,243
Borrow someone else’s.

59
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:15,989
No, I’m borrowing yours.

60
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:24,200
Don’t just rummage things.

61
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:25,547
I’ll find it for you.

62
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:36,980
Here.

63
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:52,604
Shortstop, let go.

64
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:53,800
Or I’ll punch you.

65
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,467
Look into my eyes, Akk.

66
00:06:58,965 --> 00:06:59,895
Do it.

67
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:03,072
I won’t do it.

68
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:04,817
You must.

69
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:18,875
Now tell me

70
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:20,824
how you feel.

71
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,060
I will tell you my feelings

72
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,209
and you will tell me yours.

73
00:07:59,077 --> 00:07:59,814
Okay?

74
00:08:07,715 --> 00:08:09,594
It feels so good

75
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:13,969
when I get to spend time with you like this.

76
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:23,565
Your face is warm just like a warm cup of coffee.

77
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:31,287
And I love it

78
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,910
when I get to look you in the eyes.

79
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:43,374
I want to kiss you.

80
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:47,827
Can I kiss you?

81
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,081
If you don’t like it,

82
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,592
if you’re not okay, let me know.

83
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:04,856
I’ll stop.

84
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:37,121
Can you tell me now how you feel about me?

85
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:39,820
Can you, Akk?

86
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:01,826
I’m not like you.

87
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:03,225
Do you hear me?

88
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:05,229
I’m not like you.

89
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:07,643
That’s not the answer, Akk.

90
00:10:08,322 --> 00:10:10,322
I didn’t ask if you were like me.

91
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,749
I asked how you feel about me.

92
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:17,571
Can you tell me?

93
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:31,600
I can’t say it.

94
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:33,961
I can’t do it.

95
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:42,085
Okay.

96
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:45,235
I get it.

97
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:48,220
It must be hard for you.

98
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:52,583
But I can wait.

99
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,250
For you, I will wait no matter how long.

100
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:21,515
Wat.

101
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:22,220
Yeah.

102
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,282
Do you remember what you said last night?

103
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,877
What did I say?

104
00:11:26,362 --> 00:11:27,280
You said

105
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:30,480
I’m studying Film.

106
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:31,993
This is my life.

107
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:33,108
Huh?

108
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:35,566
Did I say that?

109
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:37,455
You did.

110
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:38,647
Were you so drunk that you couldn’t remember anything?

111
00:11:39,745 --> 00:11:40,547
Holy shit!

112
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:42,680
I thought it was a dream.

113
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:44,507
Dream, my ass.

114
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:46,066
I recorded a video.

115
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,255
Should I show it to your mom?

116
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:48,117
Hey!

117
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,675
Don’t you dare, Namo!

118
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:52,052
Hey!

119
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,821
Namo!

120
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:54,756
Hey!

121
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:56,482
Don’t.

122
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:10,601
What happened?

123
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:16,642
Namo is making fun of Wat about last night.

124
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,109
Wat is chasing him down.

125
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:21,432
Um.

126
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:26,715
Kan.

127
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,513
Last night you…

128
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:31,376
I slept like a log.

129
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:34,035
Wat’s drink just knocked me out.

130
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,932
You slept like a log too, didn't you?

131
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:38,564
You were drooling in your sleep.

132
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,451
Yes.

133
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,303
I was exhausted.

134
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:47,505
I just drifted off.

135
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,791
I’m done here.

136
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:56,113
I’m leaving.

137
00:12:58,029 --> 00:12:58,952
Um.

138
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:11,904
Another one.

139
00:13:13,194 --> 00:13:14,480
Stop playing.

140
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:22,360
I came to talk about the Judo class.

141
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,395
Do you want to pair with me?

142
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,700
Food is ready.

143
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:39,021
Enjoy.

144
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:40,206
Wow!

145
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:43,245
Finish it all.

146
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:43,952
Sure.

147
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,128
Guys!

148
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:49,787
Can I get a picture first?

149
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:51,060
Just a moment.

150
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:53,971
Youâve been taking photos since yesterday.

151
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:56,343
Just let me do it. Weâre on a trip after all.

152
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:57,780
Look into the camera.

153
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,230
One, two, three.

154
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:02,379
Nice.

155
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,624
One more.

156
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,061
You all look great.

157
00:14:06,448 --> 00:14:08,157
One, two.

158
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:10,283
Perfect!

159
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:12,058
Kan,

160
00:14:12,411 --> 00:14:14,541
can I get another one with the surrounding?

161
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:17,142
Like that.

162
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:18,524
Smile.

163
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:19,808
Great.

164
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,042
And this is the surrounding.

165
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:24,118
Awesome.

166
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:25,273
This guy is just too much.

167
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:40,291
What your parents made is so good.

168
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:42,888
Jackass.

169
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:44,299
Stop playing.

170
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:49,267
Well, itâs really good.

171
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,375
Goodbye.

172
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,605
Drive safe.

173
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:54,325
Of course.

174
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,670
Goodbye, Mom.

175
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:56,976
Bye, Dad.

176
00:14:58,225 --> 00:14:59,259
Come home often.

177
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:00,225
Sure.

178
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:02,491
Take care, Mom, Dad

179
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:03,261
Hold on.

180
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:07,069
You drive and Iâll take photos.

181
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,150
Okay?

182
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:09,811
Youâre useless, my friend.

183
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:10,721
Be our driver.

184
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:14,374
Save up if you can.

185
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:19,464
Sorry.

186
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,547
Aye, why are you huddling Thua?

187
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:34,109
As if heâs not small enough.

188
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:37,341
What am I supposed to do? We donât have that much room back here.

189
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:38,581
Sit on Akkâs lap.

190
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:39,292
Okay.

191
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:40,523
Kan!

192
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,702
How about you ask me first if I want him to sit on my lap?

193
00:15:51,187 --> 00:15:53,328
We can sit like this. Itâs fine.

194
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:58,102
Drive already, Kan.

195
00:15:58,102 --> 00:15:59,372
Itâs uncomfortable back here.

196
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:00,409
Okay, guys.

197
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:02,381
Letâs go.

198
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:18,855
Donât forget we have the mid-term exam next week.

199
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:20,334
Yes, maâam.

200
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:23,369
Be prepared and study hard.

201
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:24,581
And thatâs all for today.

202
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:25,973
Class.

203
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:28,670
Thank you, Teacher.

204
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:33,595
Akk.

205
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:36,182
Let go.

206
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:41,126
Whatâs the matter, Akk?

207
00:16:42,313 --> 00:16:43,843
Ever since we got back from your home

208
00:16:46,202 --> 00:16:47,517
youâve been avoiding me

209
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:49,777
Iâm not avoiding you.

210
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:52,348
Iâm a prefect.

211
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:53,678
Iâve got many things to do.

212
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,797
Iâll go make rounds.

213
00:16:58,432 --> 00:16:59,176
Akk.

214
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:02,856
Store my chair.

215
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:12,183
Kan, Wat, time to make rounds.

216
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:31,560
[Hi. How was your trip? You didnât tell me about it.]

217
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:37,646
[It was good. But there was something not good.]

218
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:42,904
[Whatâs not?]

219
00:17:45,256 --> 00:17:46,340
[Nothing.]

220
00:17:47,014 --> 00:17:51,930
[Do you think people forget everything they do when theyâre drunk?]

221
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,289
The head of class 6/1.

222
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:56,776
When youâre done with your phone,

223
00:17:57,529 --> 00:17:58,267
put it away.

224
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,105
Yes, sir. Iâm sorry.

225
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:02,302
Itâs after school, sir.

226
00:18:02,824 --> 00:18:05,388
He needs his phone to contact his parents.

227
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:07,986
I didnât blame him.

228
00:18:08,947 --> 00:18:09,874
I just said,

229
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,546
âWhen youâre done with your phone, put it away.â

230
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,934
Heâs the head of the class.

231
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:16,555
So he needs to be a role model.

232
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:18,026
But school is over.

233
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:20,899
He canât be head of the class all the time.

234
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:24,180
Donât be too disciplined, or you might lose your damn mind.

235
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,039
Excuse me, sir.

236
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:26,445
Youâre on the school ground.

237
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:28,353
Please be polite.

238
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,642
Letâs go home, son.

239
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:32,741
Goodbye, sir.

240
00:18:44,981 --> 00:18:46,534
[Donât join the protest if you donât want to be cursed.]

241
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,741
Curse, my freaking ass!

242
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:52,049
Is this rubbish still believed in these days?

243
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:58,101
Was anyone impacted by the curse when you went here?

244
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:00,018
I was.

245
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,646
Back then, I was considered a misbehaving student.

246
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:08,931
A misfit.

247
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:11,219
Because I was the victim of that shitty curse.

248
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:15,260
I know youâre in there.

249
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:18,366
Come out to turn yourself in.

250
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:22,496
So you can be free from the Suppalo curse.

251
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:23,938
Come out.

252
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:28,619
The lock.

253
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:36,946
Hey!

254
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,512
Let me out.

255
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:40,874
Let me out, assholes.

256
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:46,576
That curse tale began right after this school founded the Student Prefect Club.

257
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:50,301
Didnât it start way before that?

258
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,292
No.

259
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,105
And do you know

260
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:55,701
who was the first head of student prefects?

261
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:57,670
Who?

262
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,640
Your dear Teacher Chadok.

263
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:23,088
[Whatâs wrong? Why are you avoiding me?]

264
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:25,245
[Iâm worried.]

265
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:21,546
Teacher Chadok.

266
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,193
I checked the round schedule

267
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:28,240
and wanted to see if student prefects are doing their duty.

268
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:31,457
Weâre all doing our best, sir.

269
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:32,865
Good.

270
00:21:34,946 --> 00:21:38,757
But you haven't come in recently to update me about the school situation.

271
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:43,496
Itâs near the exam.

272
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,009
Iâve been studying quite hard.

273
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,386
The School Foundation Day is approaching in a few days.

274
00:21:51,814 --> 00:21:54,120
Take care of the orderliness.

275
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:57,872
Yes, sir.

276
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:02,017
I'm nominating you as the Best Student,

277
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:05,701
who will receive this year's scholarship to further your education in university.

278
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:07,494
Like Mes, your senior.

279
00:22:11,786 --> 00:22:13,574
Take care of everything.

280
00:22:14,385 --> 00:22:16,973
And the scholarship will be yours.

281
00:22:42,523 --> 00:22:43,587
Why didnât you shoot?

282
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:45,017
Timeout.

283
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:46,134
Sub me.

284
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:52,236
Are you okay?

285
00:22:52,382 --> 00:22:53,309
I am.

286
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:54,100
Itâs nothing.

287
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:57,172
What is it?

288
00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:01,221
I came to talk about the Judo class.

289
00:23:02,974 --> 00:23:06,268
I donât think Iâll survive it pairing with Namo.

290
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:09,687
And the test is coming up.

291
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:12,265
So Iâ¦

292
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,381
Do you want to pair with me?

293
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:16,861
What about Namo?

294
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,323
He can pair with Wat.

295
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:20,701
Wat is good.

296
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:21,586
He can help.

297
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:23,458
Fine, then.

298
00:23:24,211 --> 00:23:26,148
Good. Weâre all set.

299
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:27,849
Thank you.

300
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:29,341
Iâm going home now.

301
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,891
How?

302
00:23:31,314 --> 00:23:32,555
Your mom or your dad is picking you up?

303
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,865
My mom.

304
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:35,165
Okay.

305
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,394
Get home safe.

306
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,430
Bye.

307
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:39,635
Um.

308
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:43,599
Iâ¦

309
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:48,281
See you.

310
00:23:57,181 --> 00:23:58,171
Where are you going?

311
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,074
You guys play on. Iâm leaving.

312
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:09,917
[You asked if people forget things they do when theyâre drunk.]

313
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:11,321
[I donât think so.]

314
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:16,613
Thua.

315
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:17,581
Hey.

316
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:20,395
Not playing basketball anymore?

317
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:22,160
No.

318
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:23,488
Itâs late.

319
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:24,741
I think Iâll head home.

320
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:31,410
[I think the same thing.]

321
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:38,868
I guess Akk is messaging me.

322
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:45,146
Why are you smiling?

323
00:24:47,498 --> 00:24:48,354
Am I?

324
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:49,348
Yes.

325
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:50,948
No, Iâm not.

326
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:53,265
Youâre the one grinning to yourself.

327
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:53,951
Who are you talking to?

328
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:55,814
A friend.

329
00:25:00,236 --> 00:25:01,554
Kan, have you seen this?

330
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,249
The World Remembers is announcing their new protest.

331
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:06,020
Again?

332
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:08,084
These guys just never quit.

333
00:25:08,696 --> 00:25:09,942
Donât join them.

334
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,577
Yeah, I know.

335
00:25:13,408 --> 00:25:15,701
You know I hate chaos.

336
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,601
Youâre thinking it right.

337
00:25:20,794 --> 00:25:24,605
I think itâs going to be bigger than any protest theyâve done.

338
00:25:25,845 --> 00:25:28,861
How are the prefects going to handle it?

339
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,092
I donât know yet.

340
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,399
But I donât think Akk will let anyone ruin the school's reputation.

341
00:25:38,207 --> 00:25:39,407
I donât think he will either.

342
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:45,300
Why are you standing on the crosswalk?

343
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:45,925
Come on.

344
00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:49,006
Youâre the one stopping me here.

345
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:50,701
The cars might hit us.

346
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:56,881
Iâm waiting to hear your feelings.

347
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,669
I donât want to see you get hurt.

348
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:00,631
Itâs okay.

349
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:01,848
I can bear the pain.

350
00:26:19,696 --> 00:26:20,699
That’s boring.

351
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:30,212
Aye.

352
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,685
Akk said he’s sick.

353
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:35,326
He’s in the infirmary.

354
00:26:43,113 --> 00:26:43,988
Hey!

355
00:26:44,643 --> 00:26:45,768
Where are you going?

356
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:47,447
Aunt Waree’s class is about to start.

357
00:26:54,602 --> 00:26:55,328
Kan.

358
00:26:56,253 --> 00:26:57,797
I think this is so weird.

359
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,780
Before this, Akk was the one chasing Aye.

360
00:27:00,926 --> 00:27:03,697
Now Aye is chasing Akk instead.

361
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:06,971
It’s not weird.

362
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:10,017
I think I get Aye.

363
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,732
How is he?

364
00:27:35,944 --> 00:27:37,979
He asked for some pills to take and slept.

365
00:27:38,145 --> 00:27:40,259
Please take care of your friend.

366
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,375
Sure.

367
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:42,230
Thank you.

368
00:28:13,045 --> 00:28:15,700
You’re big but sickly.

369
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:05,575
I’m waiting to hear your feelings.

370
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:08,713
Don’t die yet, Big Foot.

371
00:29:53,547 --> 00:29:54,737
Next pair.

372
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,893
Wat, has he recovered?

373
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:05,950
Exactly.

374
00:30:06,027 --> 00:30:06,674
Now.

375
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:07,443
Begin!

376
00:30:12,485 --> 00:30:13,594
Why are you avoiding me?

377
00:30:15,695 --> 00:30:17,434
I’m waiting to hear your answer, Akk.

378
00:30:37,998 --> 00:30:39,786
We’re in Judo class. Focus.

379
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,845
Enough.

380
00:30:45,908 --> 00:30:46,894
Next pair.

381
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,308
Begin.

382
00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:18,870
Ouch!

383
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,804
Damn you, Kanlong.

384
00:31:23,552 --> 00:31:24,421
Let me see.

385
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:28,099
Don’t be such a baby.

386
00:31:30,076 --> 00:31:31,376
I thought you broke your arm.

387
00:31:32,243 --> 00:31:34,979
And why did you pull your punches?

388
00:31:35,234 --> 00:31:36,829
Were you afraid your boyfriend would get hurt?

389
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:42,955
Why?

390
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:44,475
Do you have a problem?

391
00:31:46,454 --> 00:31:49,341
I’m taking Kanlong to the infirmary.

392
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:50,268
Yeah.

393
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,257
Go!

394
00:31:53,486 --> 00:31:55,139
Next pair.

395
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:09,577
Stick out your arm.

396
00:32:12,893 --> 00:32:13,856
It will hurt just a bit.

397
00:32:21,016 --> 00:32:23,016
Your perfume smells nice.

398
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:25,661
You can still smell it?

399
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:27,346
I put it on hours ago.

400
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:30,670
I thought it wore off.

401
00:32:31,807 --> 00:32:33,728
It’s pretty scentful. I can still scent it.

402
00:32:37,983 --> 00:32:39,452
I knew I must pair up with you for the Judo test.

403
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:42,508
So I put some on. I was afraid I’d smell.

404
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:45,243
You’re too much.

405
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:50,083
Kan,

406
00:32:51,394 --> 00:32:54,107
next time, do not go soft on me like that.

407
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,120
And don’t pretend to get thrown because I was capable of it.

408
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:01,726
I don’t want to see you get hurt.

409
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:04,378
It’s okay.

410
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:05,680
I can bear the pain.

411
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:09,228
Besides,

412
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:12,356
I just wanted to protect you.

413
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:24,219
Thua,

414
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,772
are you okay?

415
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:27,774
I am.

416
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:31,509
Are you okay now?

417
00:33:34,627 --> 00:33:35,277
I am.

418
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:37,322
Are you sure?

419
00:33:37,565 --> 00:33:38,543
Yes.

420
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:48,154
My informant told me the consultant of that gang is Ayan.

421
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,200
Have you got any more evidence?

422
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:52,410
Any video,

423
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:53,784
pictures,

424
00:33:54,285 --> 00:33:55,164
or anything.

425
00:33:57,339 --> 00:33:58,382
I’m trying.

426
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:00,643
Try harder, Akk.

427
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,415
You’re the president of the Prefect Club.

428
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:05,652
Yes, sir.

429
00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:10,451
We’ve let this problem continue for too long already.

430
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,267
It’s time to nip it in the bud.

431
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:17,486
Before something worse is going to happen to Suppalo.

432
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:28,313
Akk.

433
00:34:30,009 --> 00:34:33,956
Whatever you decide to do, you know I’m on your side.

434
00:34:34,336 --> 00:34:35,659
Can you leave this school?

435
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:18,286
Stop following me already, Mo.

436
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:27,103
You always catch me.

437
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:29,146
Perfectly fit to be my idol.

438
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:32,516
Don’t make me your idol.

439
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:33,806
Please.

440
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:35,775
Don’t be humble.

441
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:39,486
You’re the best in this school right now.

442
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:42,966
You’re smart and head of the Prefect Club.

443
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,932
Did you hear anything there?

444
00:35:51,587 --> 00:35:52,569
No.

445
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,784
Nothing.

446
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:54,698
I swear.

447
00:35:58,158 --> 00:35:58,756
Alright.

448
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,362
Now go. I’m going back to my dorm.

449
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:02,444
Akk.

450
00:36:04,123 --> 00:36:08,358
Whatever you decide to do, you know I’m on your side.

451
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,631
[“Why did you do that to me, Chadok?”]

452
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:05,666
[I attempted suicide twice (many years ago).

453
00:37:05,813 --> 00:37:09,379
[It could be caused by a great deal of self-disappointment.]

454
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:31,586
I think

455
00:37:32,545 --> 00:37:34,503
it’s time you let Uncle Di go.

456
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:44,582
Not yet.

457
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:52,274
I must know what this school did to him.

458
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:57,696
You think if he’s still here,

459
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:02,288
would he want his dear nephew to do this?

460
00:38:12,037 --> 00:38:14,786
But if we didn’t leave him alone at that moment,

461
00:38:15,937 --> 00:38:19,344
if we could stop him…

462
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:22,468
Aye, stop blaming yourself.

463
00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:25,966
We did our best.

464
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:32,685
You read this journal before.

465
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,778
Didn’t you see he was doing better on his depressive disorder?

466
00:38:51,945 --> 00:38:53,854
And when it was time he wished to go,

467
00:38:57,566 --> 00:38:59,112
we couldn’t stop him.

468
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:02,658
Right?

469
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:31,277
Aye.

470
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,448
You’re not leaving me too, are you?

471
00:39:47,182 --> 00:39:48,145
No.

472
00:39:51,027 --> 00:39:52,518
I won’t leave you, Mom.

473
00:39:56,432 --> 00:39:59,521
That school can’t do anything to me.

474
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:03,603
I love you.

475
00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:06,160
I love you too.

476
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:08,482
Mom,

477
00:40:10,229 --> 00:40:14,282
there’s still one person I’m worried about.

478
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:25,462
Take back your hoodie.

479
00:40:26,937 --> 00:40:28,857
No. You can keep it.

480
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:30,349
I bought a new one.

481
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:32,536
In case you want to wear couple hoodies.

482
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:34,544
Stop bugging me for once, will you?

483
00:40:34,945 --> 00:40:36,332
I’m not bugging you.

484
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:37,294
I’m serious.

485
00:40:37,555 --> 00:40:39,623
You even let me borrow your underwear.

486
00:40:40,132 --> 00:40:41,150
That’s different.

487
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:43,954
I won’t wear it even if you return it to me.

488
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,241
Let’s talk about your business.

489
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:55,788
Can you leave this school?

490
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,015
What the hell are you saying?

491
00:41:01,172 --> 00:41:02,369
I’m being serious.

492
00:41:03,866 --> 00:41:05,321
Ever since you joined,

493
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:07,323
my school has been full of chaos.

494
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,635
The protest is getting bigger.

495
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:12,966
I think if you quit, things will get back to the way there were.

496
00:41:12,966 --> 00:41:16,263
Even without me, your school will never be the same.

497
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:19,893
The problem in your school is with the system.

498
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:23,094
It’s the constructal problem that’s been going on for years.

499
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:25,067
It’s not about any individual.

500
00:41:25,294 --> 00:41:26,477
Don’t you get it?

501
00:41:27,891 --> 00:41:29,279
But if you don’t leave,

502
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,320
the curse will come back.

503
00:41:32,425 --> 00:41:33,178
Hold on.

504
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:38,464
You promised me

505
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,713
you would stop this shit.

506
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:44,635
Who is forcing you?

507
00:41:44,926 --> 00:41:45,842
No one.

508
00:41:46,825 --> 00:41:48,961
I’m just doing my duty. That’s all.

509
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:52,121
Is it Teacher Chadok?

510
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,891
He’s forcing you to do this.

511
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:56,092
No one is.

512
00:41:56,819 --> 00:42:00,589
This is the only way to keep Suppalo rules in place.

513
00:42:01,474 --> 00:42:02,966
Prove it to me then.

514
00:42:03,571 --> 00:42:05,571
Prove it Teacher Chadok didn’t make you do this.

515
00:42:06,604 --> 00:42:07,481
Prove?

516
00:42:07,685 --> 00:42:08,808
How?

517
00:42:29,097 --> 00:42:30,153
I don’t think we should do this.

518
00:42:31,696 --> 00:42:33,207
It’s too risky.

519
00:42:34,224 --> 00:42:35,861
The teachers will be here soon.

520
00:42:36,618 --> 00:42:39,889
Because you won’t admit Teacher Chadok is behind everything,

521
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:42,792
I have to find the evidence myself.

522
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:45,368
Watch the door for me.

523
00:42:46,457 --> 00:42:47,182
Okay?

524
00:42:50,077 --> 00:42:50,789
Fine.

525
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,210
Are you done?

526
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:45,899
Hey.

527
00:43:45,899 --> 00:43:46,711
Thua is here.

528
00:43:57,419 --> 00:43:58,115
Hey.

529
00:43:58,501 --> 00:43:59,442
Akk. Aye.

530
00:44:01,447 --> 00:44:02,753
Are you turning in the assignments, Thua?

531
00:44:03,093 --> 00:44:03,787
Yes.

532
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:05,924
What are you doing here so early?

533
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:09,952
I was just turning in my assignment too.

534
00:44:10,686 --> 00:44:11,878
Why didn’t you leave it with me?

535
00:44:13,492 --> 00:44:15,084
Right.

536
00:44:15,342 --> 00:44:17,138
Why didn’t you hand it to Thua?

537
00:44:17,138 --> 00:44:19,531
So I didn’t have to guard you from copying someone else’s assignment.

538
00:44:21,344 --> 00:44:22,073
Right.

539
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:26,511
Hey!

540
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:28,798
I’m sorry.

541
00:44:29,428 --> 00:44:30,860
- Are you okay?
- It’s okay.

542
00:44:31,225 --> 00:44:32,748
They’re scattering everywhere.

543
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,390
What are you three doing in here?

544
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:09,572
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

545
00:45:09,777 --> 00:45:11,777
All you think about is work?

546
00:45:11,777 --> 00:45:13,608
Don’t you want any good moments with me at all?

547
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:16,339
The World Remembers is stirring things up again.

548
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:21,070
We seek out the truth because the school board lacks integrity.

549
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,270
Every student prefect must be strict on their watch.

550
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,023
We can’t let them protest outside the school.

551
00:45:28,783 --> 00:45:30,086
Did you do it?

552
00:45:30,086 --> 00:45:31,918
Do you really think I want my school to look bad?

553
00:45:31,918 --> 00:45:34,292
Do you realize you’ve changed?
