1
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:20,881
Take care of everything.

2
00:00:21,607 --> 00:00:24,085
And the scholarship will be yours.

3
00:00:24,413 --> 00:00:25,708
Is it Teacher Chadok?

4
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,283
He’s forcing you to do this.

5
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:29,864
No one is.

6
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:38,808
Why are you all here?

7
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,251
We’re here to turn in the assignments.

8
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:53,262
What were you doing just now?

9
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:57,291
We accidentally knocked down these piles of books

10
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:58,383
so we were helping each other put them back.

11
00:00:58,383 --> 00:00:59,290
Sorry, sir.

12
00:01:02,557 --> 00:01:04,314
Everything is back to its place.

13
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:06,760
May you please excuse us now?

14
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:36,040
Why did you drag me out here, Akk?

15
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:37,852
I must talk to that teacher.

16
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:38,991
Calm yourself.

17
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:42,824
Guys, is everything okay?

18
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,143
I’ve got something to talk to Aye…

19
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:49,990
I mean Ayan.

20
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:52,285
Right?

21
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:54,425
Right.

22
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:57,817
Attend class soon.

23
00:02:57,817 --> 00:02:59,125
Otherwise, we'll all lose points.

24
00:02:59,125 --> 00:02:59,851
Yeah.

25
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:10,000
He must be the one behind my uncle’s death.

26
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:12,993
Or else how did this notebook end up in his room?

27
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,024
Calm down.

28
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,894
I asked him before.

29
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:19,078
He said he didn’t take it.

30
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:20,429
And you believed his words?

31
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:23,616
When will you realize he’s dangerous, Akk?

32
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:27,736
Just quit being a student prefect.

33
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:33,457
I can’t.

34
00:03:33,457 --> 00:03:34,792
Why can’t you?

35
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,736
If you want to, you sure as hell can.

36
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,106
Aye, are you alright?

37
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,614
Are you okay?

38
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:11,880
Home alone again?

39
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,555
My mom is out working.

40
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,803
My parents divorced when I was young.

41
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:25,693
I lived with my mom and uncle growing up.

42
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:28,576
You said your uncle passed away.

43
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:32,319
Yeah.

44
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:35,886
Want to see him?

45
00:04:58,272 --> 00:04:59,396
Here he is.

46
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,374
You’re keeping him in your bedroom?

47
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,936
Um.

48
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:21,742
Can you give me a sponge bath?

49
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:23,955
It’s your own body. Do it yourself.

50
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,405
Why should I do that for you?

51
00:05:26,818 --> 00:05:29,207
I’m nice enough to take you home.

52
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:33,615
Are you all right?

53
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:12,890
Where do you keep your medicines?

54
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:14,055
I’ll go get them.

55
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:16,732
In the drawer.

56
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,449
Amitriptyline, for relieving stress.

57
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:29,837
You take these pills too?

58
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,243
You will get better soon.

59
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,201
Take some rest.

60
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:20,582
Can you keep me company?

61
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,472
Can you leave after I fall asleep?

62
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:30,401
I’m not going anywhere.

63
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:31,749
Get some sleep.

64
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,227
When I was at your home,

65
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:01,619
I loved seeing you with your parents.

66
00:09:03,758 --> 00:09:04,834
You’re so cute.

67
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,638
That reminded me of when my family was whole.

68
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:11,161
You don’t let go of my hand.

69
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,752
Your fever is low and you're starting to irritate me again.

70
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:30,696
Shameless.

71
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,732
Do you smell that?

72
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:50,390
Mom.

73
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,530
Hey. You guys are awake?

74
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:56,535
Come. I just made us dinner.

75
00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:57,457
Let’s eat.

76
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,513
This is Akk.

77
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:02,040
Akk?

78
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:02,943
Yes.

79
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:04,344
Sounds unique.

80
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:07,037
Hello.

81
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:08,128
Hi.

82
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,882
You guys must be hungry.

83
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:11,026
Should we get started?

84
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:12,083
Sure, Mom.

85
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:18,735
Eat as much as you can.

86
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:30,624
Akk, does Aye pay attention in class?

87
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:36,680
I think you can guess the answer.

88
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,443
Hey.

89
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,016
Just be nice.

90
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:42,240
Oh, let me guess.

91
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
He’s a wicked student.

92
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:46,080
Ma’am.

93
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:48,805
Super duper.

94
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,729
Right?

95
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:50,410
Right.

96
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,789
In class--

97
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:55,302
My mom’s food is wonderful.

98
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:56,848
Eat more.

99
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,437
It’s great that Aye brings a friend over.

100
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:06,755
I didn’t bring him here.

101
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:08,756
He drove me here.

102
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:10,780
Hold on.

103
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:15,600
You’re sick and asked me to take you home.

104
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:24,080
Oh, Akk.

105
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,018
Is Aye dating anyone?

106
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:28,768
Is he having a crush on anyone at the moment?

107
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,032
Oh, and are you dating anyone, Akk?

108
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:38,764
No doubt.

109
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,227
Look at him.

110
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:41,711
Of course, he is.

111
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,240
Good.

112
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,214
I think that’s good.

113
00:12:45,506 --> 00:12:46,337
Ma’am.

114
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:48,080
No, I’m not.

115
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:50,442
Don’t be nonsense.

116
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:51,457
When did I ever date anyone?

117
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:52,608
Me.

118
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:55,000
You’re dating me.

119
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:23,578
What are you doing?

120
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,532
What kind of dishwashing is this?

121
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,839
Can you promise me one thing, Akk?

122
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,230
please don’t leave Aye behind.

123
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:40,707
My leg still hurts.

124
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:44,021
You’re harassing a sick person.

125
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:46,028
You can get on my nerves.

126
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:47,070
You’re fine.

127
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:55,525
Hand it over.

128
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,476
Oops!

129
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,759
Trying to bug me?

130
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:01,715
No.

131
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:07,457
Are you sure you washed it?

132
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:09,433
The washing bubbles are still there.

133
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:19,846
Akk.

134
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:20,380
Hm?

135
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:30,607
What are you doing?

136
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,046
There’s a bubble on your face.

137
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:35,991
What kind of dishwashing is this?

138
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:37,599
A very mindful kind.

139
00:14:37,782 --> 00:14:38,705
You’re messy.

140
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:40,941
You’ve got bubbles on your arm too.

141
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:42,215
You’re also messy.

142
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,349
Are you picking up a fight?

143
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:47,005
Are you done?

144
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:52,252
I’ll be leaving now.

145
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:53,913
I’ll take you.

146
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:55,509
No.

147
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:57,067
You’re sick.

148
00:14:57,311 --> 00:14:58,336
Take some rest.

149
00:14:58,587 --> 00:14:59,337
I can find my way home.

150
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:03,274
I will take you home.

151
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,262
It’s totally okay.

152
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,581
It’s not.

153
00:15:08,581 --> 00:15:12,008
You took Aye home. We can’t let you leave alone.

154
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:13,484
Right?

155
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:17,830
Thank you then.

156
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:18,888
I’ll go get my stuff upstairs.

157
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:19,581
Sure.

158
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,316
You have such good taste.

159
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,006
Oh, yeah.

160
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,982
Like you.

161
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:49,631
Akk,

162
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,341
thank you for taking care of Aye.

163
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,379
That’s fine. I just…

164
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:58,186
Ever since it happened,

165
00:15:58,478 --> 00:16:00,031
he’s been under depression.

166
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:05,987
But lately, I see his mood’s been lifted.

167
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:09,461
I saw the pills he takes.

168
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:18,941
He’s probably shocked by what happened.

169
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:21,495
I took him to see a psychiatrist.

170
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:24,735
He asked if he could transfer to a new school.

171
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:27,062
I didn’t want to oppose that.

172
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:29,170
I was afraid I’d lose him too.

173
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:32,809
Ma’am.

174
00:16:35,157 --> 00:16:36,741
Aye is going to be okay.

175
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:43,983
Thank you, kid.

176
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:48,703
Can you promise me one thing, Akk?

177
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:51,868
Whatever happens,

178
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,320
please don’t leave Aye behind.

179
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:07,583
Guys.

180
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:10,048
The World Remembers is stirring things up again.

181
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:13,859
Check Twitter.

182
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:21,074
It’s the day to reverse the curse.

183
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:24,108
Find out together who is behind it.

184
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:26,261
When school isn’t a safe place,

185
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:28,674
it’s time we gather outside.

186
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,345
Outside?

187
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,127
I think more people are joining them this time.

188
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:39,824
Look how many people like and retweet it.

189
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:41,308
Right.

190
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:54,091
No.

191
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:58,431
We can’t let those students protest outside the school.

192
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,586
But, principal,

193
00:18:00,854 --> 00:18:03,830
their protest might be so damaging.

194
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:05,269
Not damaging?

195
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:12,718
Don't you realize how much money the alumni club is threatening to take away from us?

196
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:16,083
It's due to your weak discipline enforcement.

197
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:17,549
Think about it.

198
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:22,072
That hashtag is trending in just a few hours.

199
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:28,369
Not long after this, the media is going to make news out of it.

200
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:32,094
How damaging do you think it will be to our school's reputation?

201
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,366
Deal with it.

202
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:39,277
Don’t let the media get involved.

203
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:41,186
- Yes.
- Yes, ma’am.

204
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:46,140
And that student prefect club of yours,

205
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:48,883
if it’s no use,

206
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:51,032
you better terminate it.

207
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:54,887
Manage.

208
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:56,943
Yes, ma’am.

209
00:18:58,341 --> 00:18:59,148
Chadok.

210
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:10,949
Suppalo must remain Suppalo.

211
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:14,137
Take care of it.

212
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,421
I hope you don’t forget who made you who you are today.

213
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:28,524
The school has directed us to keep a careful eye on student protests.

214
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:32,886
Every student prefect must be extra strict on their watch.

215
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:34,682
Strict how?

216
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,463
The school has implemented a new policy that forbids students from mentioning the protest.

217
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:42,585
And if there’re violators?

218
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,933
They will be blacklisted and punished later.

219
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:49,198
Blacklisting its own students.

220
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:51,268
Yes.

221
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:54,762
We must find a way to stop them.

222
00:19:55,422 --> 00:19:56,321
Otherwise,

223
00:19:57,704 --> 00:19:59,581
the school will let someone from outside do it.

224
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:01,469
From the outside?

225
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,575
- Take one.
- Here.

226
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:20,221
Let us all grieve for the loss of the school board’s justice.
Come join us.

227
00:20:20,448 --> 00:20:22,184
Come join us.

228
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:23,434
Hey!

229
00:20:25,094 --> 00:20:28,416
Please join us.

230
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,776
See you.

231
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:31,365
Should we get them now?

232
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:32,959
For what?

233
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:34,329
For handing out armbands?

234
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:37,546
Guys, let’s mourn for it.

235
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,220
Ready?

236
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:48,221
[The World Remembers singing the funeral music.]

237
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:48,819
Wat.

238
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,221
Film them.

239
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,862
I want to know who took the armband.

240
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,823
Are you sure?

241
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:55,781
It’s just for us to see.

242
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,289
I will not send it to the school board.

243
00:20:59,134 --> 00:20:59,853
Okay.

244
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:08,812
Here you go.

245
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:10,362
Please come join us.

246
00:21:10,362 --> 00:21:11,510
Thank you.

247
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:14,581
Many horrible things have happened.

248
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,813
We've been looking for the truth behind it.

249
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:19,165
However, we never catch the bad guy.

250
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:22,224
Because there are never enough serious investigations.

251
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,176
You know why?

252
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:26,334
Why?

253
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:28,827
Because the school board lacks integrity.

254
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:31,541
They never really care to find the one responsible.

255
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,582
True.

256
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,216
Let’s see.

257
00:21:34,216 --> 00:21:37,044
Is any of you here done with the Suppalo curse?

258
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:38,948
If you are, join us.

259
00:21:38,948 --> 00:21:40,771
We have an appointment, guys.

260
00:21:40,771 --> 00:21:42,395
Where?

261
00:21:42,395 --> 00:21:44,341
At the Suppalo Curse Reverse Day.

262
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:46,479
Come and show them our power.

263
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:48,094
That’s awesome, Nian.

264
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:52,621
Those who have the armband, wear it.

265
00:21:53,014 --> 00:21:55,543
If you haven’t got one, come and get it here.

266
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:57,354
Join us, everyone.

267
00:21:58,415 --> 00:21:59,947
Thank you.

Damn.

271
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:28,185
Will we be cursed too?

272
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:32,036
Nian!

273
00:22:32,036 --> 00:22:33,481
Are you all right?

274
00:22:33,481 --> 00:22:34,582
Nian.

275
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:35,740
Are you okay?

276
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:38,513
Nong.

277
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,007
What the heck is this?

278
00:22:40,536 --> 00:22:41,124
Yes.

279
00:22:41,435 --> 00:22:42,398
So dramatic.

280
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:48,035
Was it you?

281
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:50,181
Do you really think I want my school to look bad?

282
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:51,636
Do you like it?

[Suppalo will not endure this anymore.]

00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:05,803
You did it.

293

This fabric banner and this threat post.

294
00:24:10,421 --> 00:24:12,315
Are you this obsessed with the Suppalo curse?

295

Listen to me.

Do you really think I want my school to look bad?

298
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:22,504
That’s not my way.

If not you, then who?

300

Must be someone in this school.

301
00:24:41,582 --> 00:24:43,829
But we can’t trace the IP address on Twitter, can we?

302
00:24:45,374 --> 00:24:47,374
That’s why we need to create a fake link.

303
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:51,457
To make them click through. We will get the IP address from there.

304

If Teacher Chadok sees this, he will surely fall for it.

310
00:25:08,755 --> 00:25:10,961
He doesn’t look like someone who can resist this.

312

Lots of people know how to hide or sham it.

313

If it’s really Chadok, he wouldn’t know how to do that.

346
00:27:49,653 --> 00:27:50,989
Then who?

347
00:27:52,455 --> 00:27:55,444
I thought it was you at first.

348
00:27:56,801 --> 00:28:00,119
I know you’re the one who burned that gang’s leaflets.

349
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:12,576
I just wanted to help you.

350
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,613
It was an easy job. It didn’t hurt anyone.

351
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:21,857
But I’ve not done anything lately.

352
00:28:22,654 --> 00:28:23,465
Mo.

353
00:28:25,195 --> 00:28:28,361
If you’re planning on doing something shitty, don’t.

354
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:29,757
Please.

355
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,219
Akk.

356
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:38,381
Do you realize you’ve changed?

357
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:41,301
I haven’t changed.

358
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,418
You’re wrong.

359
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,246
Seriously.

360
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:46,995
Are you still on the Suppalo side?

361
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,309
What will the student prefects do about the protest?

362
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:01,053
We’re told to collect the names of those who are joining.

363
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:04,497
What if I am?

364
00:29:04,665 --> 00:29:05,875
Will my name be taken too?

365
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:08,848
Heck yes.

366
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:10,865
Why are you joining them anyway?

367
00:29:11,195 --> 00:29:12,436
You’re the head of the class.

368
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:16,047
Besides, don’t associate with those guys.

369
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:23,198
The head of the class whose duties are only to welcome the teachers and turn in assignments?

370
00:29:24,434 --> 00:29:25,350
Not just that.

371
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:27,669
You give me wake-up calls.

372
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,936
You cover for me when I’m late.

373
00:29:30,287 --> 00:29:33,173
More importantly, you’re my report partner.

374
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,237
Even though most of the work is done by you.

375
00:29:40,777 --> 00:29:42,962
I like the report video we shot at Akk’s house.

376
00:29:46,024 --> 00:29:46,890
Do you like it?

377
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:54,515
Yeah.

378
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,498
I do.

379
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:11,218
Someone sent me a friend request on Facebook.

380
00:30:11,995 --> 00:30:13,020
Named Bruce Wayne.

381
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,148
Yeah?

382
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:16,317
Yes.

383
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:20,772
I think I have a good feeling for him.

384
00:30:23,018 --> 00:30:23,872
Are you nuts?

385
00:30:24,758 --> 00:30:26,707
You have a good feeling for someone you haven’t met.

386
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:30,195
I’m surprised by that too.

387
00:30:30,766 --> 00:30:33,796
But I want to see him in person.

388
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:39,564
What if he’s a bad guy who wants to deceive you?

389
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:41,258
Don’t think so.

390
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:44,262
I think I will call him out.

391
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:47,921
If he wants to talk to me, he should do it face-to-face.

392
00:30:48,295 --> 00:30:49,186
Do you agree?

393
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:54,331
Yeah.

394
00:31:06,704 --> 00:31:10,331
If I go to see him, Thua will know how I feel about him.

395
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:11,825
So?

396
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,868
Are you afraid he will reject you?

397
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,334
Why would I be afraid he’d reject me?

398
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:18,115
I’m the girls’ favorite.

399
00:31:19,876 --> 00:31:21,382
But this is Thua.

400
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:23,419
But I’m not ready.

401
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:25,077
Why?

402
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,612
Are you afraid your cool looks will be ruined?

403
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:29,630
Heck no.

404
00:31:30,545 --> 00:31:32,380
I just don’t really know what to do.

405
00:31:36,371 --> 00:31:38,041
How do you feel about him?

406
00:31:40,193 --> 00:31:41,260
You just like him.

407
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:43,332
Or it’s more than that?

408
00:31:45,763 --> 00:31:47,145
I have no clue how I feel.

409
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:53,872
But when he’s out of sight,

410
00:31:56,721 --> 00:31:57,938
I’m so worried about him.

411
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:02,225
When you spend time with him,

412
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,734
do you feel so happy that you forget all the sadness?

413
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,079
I think…

414
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,249
that’s love.

415
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,455
I like when you smile widely.

416
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:38,830
You’re cute.

417
00:33:08,335 --> 00:33:09,643
Took you long enough.

418
00:33:11,852 --> 00:33:13,017
Don’t act like you’re tired.

419
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:15,655
You said you’d track down the intervenor behind that incident.

420
00:33:18,507 --> 00:33:19,624
Get up.

421
00:33:24,274 --> 00:33:26,537
All you think about is work?

422
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,541
Don’t you want any good moments with me at all?

423
00:33:30,386 --> 00:33:31,622
What moments are you talking about?

424
00:33:31,622 --> 00:33:35,771
People dating always create their good moments together.

425
00:33:37,553 --> 00:33:38,553
Who’s dating you?

426
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:40,293
Don’t be a wisecracker.

427
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:42,468
So?

428
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,951
Did the fish take the bait yet?

429
00:33:46,803 --> 00:33:47,627
Not yet.

430
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:50,188
This fish is being cautious.

431
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:51,904
So witty.

432
00:33:52,668 --> 00:33:53,661
Who is he?

433
00:33:55,172 --> 00:33:56,432
What does this person really want?

434
00:33:57,499 --> 00:33:58,639
I have no idea.

435
00:34:00,234 --> 00:34:01,103
Have dinner with me.

436
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:02,688
What? I’m not hungry.

437
00:34:02,688 --> 00:34:03,702
Well, I am.

438
00:34:03,702 --> 00:34:04,490
Eat with me.

439
00:34:05,632 --> 00:34:06,382
No.

440
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:07,226
Come on.

441
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,790
You’re eating with your boyfriend but looking so distant.

442
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:26,254
Are you cheating on me?

443
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:29,683
Are you?

444
00:34:33,646 --> 00:34:35,527
I’m done arguing with you.

445
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:37,546
Eat and go home.

446
00:34:37,546 --> 00:34:38,423
See?

447
00:34:39,024 --> 00:34:40,714
You’re shooing me away.

448
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:41,755
You’re cheating on me for sure.

449
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:44,575
You’re so obsessed with something nonsense.

450
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:47,662
Mr. Nice Mouth has returned.

451
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:49,682
That’s a relief.

452
00:34:49,682 --> 00:34:50,614
What are you talking about?

453
00:34:50,614 --> 00:34:54,733
I see you’re so concerned about the intervenor that you became quiet.

454
00:34:56,023 --> 00:34:57,689
So I tried to get myself yelled at.

455
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:00,189
I’m smart, right?

456
00:35:00,977 --> 00:35:01,808
Yeah?

457
00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:03,192
Should I thank you?

458
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:04,192
Hell yeah.

459
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:08,232
When people do something nice to you, you must thank them.

460
00:35:08,979 --> 00:35:09,901
Got it?

461
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,218
Sure.

462
00:35:12,002 --> 00:35:12,918
Of course.

463
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,874
Certainly.

464
00:35:17,895 --> 00:35:19,115
You like wasabi?

465
00:35:19,402 --> 00:35:20,755
Come here.

466
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:21,953
Yum.

467
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,918
Open your mouth.

468
00:35:23,324 --> 00:35:25,434
Do it. A nice guy must be thanked.

469
00:35:25,434 --> 00:35:25,998
Open it.

470
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:26,498
No.

471
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:27,054
Do it.

472
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:31,089
Yum.

473
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,215
Thank you.

474
00:35:42,883 --> 00:35:43,656
Thank you.

475
00:35:43,656 --> 00:35:44,500
You’re welcome.

476
00:35:47,947 --> 00:35:48,778
Akk.

477
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:51,045
You’re trying to get me.

478
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:51,872
No.

479
00:36:02,997 --> 00:36:03,846
Why are you smiling?

480
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,645
Nothing.

481
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:12,005
I just like it when I get to eat with you like this.

482
00:36:18,158 --> 00:36:20,158
I usually eat alone.

483
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,199
The food doesn’t taste as good as it does now.

484
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:37,440
You just keep rambling.

485
00:36:39,355 --> 00:36:40,152
Just eat.

486
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:44,722
You eat this too.

487
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:56,907
Are you joining the protest?

488
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,425
Yes.

489
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:03,624
The school handles it so poorly.

490
00:37:03,936 --> 00:37:05,291
I think I should do something.

491
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:11,274
But it’s not safe.

492
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:18,474
Do you believe in the curse?

493
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:29,723
Do you want to see me at the protest?

494
00:37:34,513 --> 00:37:36,322
I’ll let you know later.

495
00:37:51,861 --> 00:37:53,097
Are you joining?

496
00:37:53,097 --> 00:37:53,792
I am.

497
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,845
But we should get to class first. Come on.

498
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,235
Are you also joining?

499
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:11,005
I want to see for myself if the Suppalo curse is really potent.

500
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:18,790
Every place has its tale invented to scare people.

501
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,419
It’s the method used to rule people.

502
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:25,667
And who invented it?

503
00:38:26,712 --> 00:38:27,692
I don’t know.

504
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:35,661
What I do is the tale inventor must get the benefit from it.

505
00:38:39,773 --> 00:38:40,606
I’m taking off.

506
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:41,678
Um.

507
00:38:52,183 --> 00:38:55,258
I don’t know what to tell yet.

508
00:38:56,793 --> 00:39:00,727
Filmmakers always start with something they want to tell.

509
00:39:01,393 --> 00:39:04,348
There are so many things in my head right now.

510
00:39:04,565 --> 00:39:07,568
I just don’t know how to convey them.

511
00:39:08,648 --> 00:39:15,806
How about we start with favorite movies, books, news, or stories of people close to you?

512
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,913
What or who is your inspiration?

513
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:24,407
I like a screenplay that someone wrote.

514
00:39:24,684 --> 00:39:26,111
His name is Nut.

515
00:39:26,368 --> 00:39:27,962
He writes indie film screenplays.

516
00:39:28,887 --> 00:39:30,171
What's his work like?

517
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,726
He likes to play around with the grey area between tales and reality.

518
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:39,544
Interesting.

519
00:39:39,617 --> 00:39:41,354
You can start from there.

520
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:42,884
Sure.

521
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,790
And what’s the story you want to tell?

522
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:51,405
I’m interested in what’s happening in our school.

523
00:39:52,954 --> 00:39:56,291
The protest and the Suppalo curse.

524
00:40:15,073 --> 00:40:18,291
The School Foundation Day is approaching in a few days.

525
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,559
Take care of the orderliness.

526
00:40:22,424 --> 00:40:26,525
Every student prefect must be extra strict on their watch.

527
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:30,517
The school has implemented a new policy that forbids students from mentioning the protest.

528
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,790
[You freaking misfits, you have it coming.]

529
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,022
The school board lacks integrity.

530
00:40:58,791 --> 00:40:59,475
Don’t.

531
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:00,437
I can help myself.

532
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:02,558
No one cares what we do.

533
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:04,701
It’s just a friend helping a friend up.

534
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,560
You’re overthinking it.

535
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:07,485
Come on.

536
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:15,804
Hey!

537
00:41:15,804 --> 00:41:16,914
Aye!

538
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:19,768
What the heck are you doing?

539
00:41:20,742 --> 00:41:22,432
I haven’t got to swim yet.

540
00:41:22,904 --> 00:41:23,925
Swim with me.

541
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:30,651
Hey!

542
00:41:41,014 --> 00:41:42,025
What are you smiling at?

543
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:44,170
I smile because you smile.

544
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:51,501
I like when you smile widely.

545
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:53,292
You’re cute.

546
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,172
I’m not cute.

547
00:41:55,689 --> 00:41:56,949
I’m solemn.

548
00:41:57,158 --> 00:41:59,158
The president of the prefect club, you know?

549
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,359
Are you opposed to your own cuteness?

550
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:05,250
I am not cute.

551
00:42:05,698 --> 00:42:06,673
You wanna fight me?

552
00:42:06,864 --> 00:42:07,889
You’re cute.

553
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,547
Picking up a fight, huh?

554
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,099
Get this.

555
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,213
Am I still cute?

556
00:42:15,714 --> 00:42:16,412
You are.

557
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,163
Shut up, Shortstop.

558
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:20,796
I’m not following your order, Big Foot.

559
00:42:47,288 --> 00:42:48,691
We’re in school.

560
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:21,078
I’ve been wearing an inappropriate uniform.

561
00:43:21,551 --> 00:43:23,551
Why am I not affected by the curse yet?

562
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:24,887
Watch it.

563
00:43:25,245 --> 00:43:26,052
Why?

564
00:43:26,262 --> 00:43:27,412
What are you gonna do to me?

565
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:29,575
Like you’re so scary.

566
00:43:30,228 --> 00:43:31,894
When will you stop teasing me, Shortstop?

567
00:43:31,894 --> 00:43:32,696
I will never stop.

568
00:43:34,439 --> 00:43:35,289
Aye.

569
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:43,679
Don’t look at anyone else like this.

570
00:43:45,044 --> 00:43:45,922
I’m jealous.

571
00:44:04,884 --> 00:44:06,120
Who’s screaming?

572
00:44:12,656 --> 00:44:13,438
Nian.

573
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:22,943
[Jumnong, Jumnun, Jumnian]

574
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:30,691
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

575
00:44:30,691 --> 00:44:32,223
Do you see what’s happening?

576
00:44:32,223 --> 00:44:34,644
Are you going to let the school do this to us?

577
00:44:34,644 --> 00:44:35,829
You’re students.

578
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:37,533
Your duty is to study.

579
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:39,678
Why is growing up so tough?

580
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:41,878
Sometimes, I just don’t want tomorrow to come.

581
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:44,987
Until tomorrow comes, let me hold your hand like this.

582
00:44:45,217 --> 00:44:46,477
Should we go out?

583
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:50,653
I’m glad it’s you.

584
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,549
Kiss my cheek.

585
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,982
I want a good moment this morning.
