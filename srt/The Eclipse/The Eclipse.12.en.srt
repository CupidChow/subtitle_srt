1
00:00:19,611 --> 00:00:21,774
Beliefs determine what people do.

2
00:00:22,493 --> 00:00:29,787
Some people even believe that their own thoughts and actions are the only ones that are right.

3
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:32,223
Like me before I met you.

4
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,431
There is no evidence of any support for the protesters, ma'am.

5
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:43,632
I believe they act independently.

6
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:46,497
Troublemakers.

7
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:50,096
Invite the students' parents to come see me.

8
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:51,652
Yes, ma'am.

9
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:54,745
What about Akk and Thuaphu?

10
00:00:55,342 --> 00:00:57,559
Did you form a committee to investigate the situation?

11
00:00:58,043 --> 00:00:58,733
Yes.

12
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:01,499
I asked Teacher Sani to take care of it.

13
00:01:01,902 --> 00:01:03,565
The committee will all be here tomorrow.

14
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,268
How shameful.

15
00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:13,285
They are not cautious at all.

16
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:45,683
What the hell are you looking at?

17
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:51,841
Why do I need to pair up with a nerd like you?

18
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,943
It's not fun at all.

19
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,106
Next time, don't protect me like that again.

20
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:03,434
I'm used to it.

21
00:03:06,081 --> 00:03:09,888
Whatever they say about me, I don't care.

22
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,060
I don't want to see you get hurt like that again.

23
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:24,877
Cut!

24
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:26,626
Good.

25
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,498
How was our acting there?

26
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:34,298
Did you film us?

27
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:36,394
Yes.

28
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:43,370
Let's start again.

29
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,762
Am I doing it well?

30
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,531
Yes, you are.

31
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:49,517
How is it going, everyone?

32
00:03:55,064 --> 00:03:57,227
Look here.

33
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:00,488
How are you, Wasuwat?

34
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:02,075
Are you getting what you want?

35
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,127
Ah, I am.

36
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:06,096
Do you want to have a look?

37
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:09,240
I will watch it once it's done.

38
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:11,411
Is this the last scene already?

39
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:13,551
Not yet.

40
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:16,312
We will be filming it on the rooftop.

41
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:17,110
But'¦

42
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:19,543
we must wait for the solar eclipse.

43
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:22,912
Ah, tomorrow afternoon?

44
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:24,124
That's right.

45
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:27,101
What is it, ma'am?

46
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:32,482
The committee will arrive tomorrow morning to investigate Akk and Thuaphu.

47
00:04:33,503 --> 00:04:36,758
So, how will he be able to act in my short film?

48
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:46,134
May we come in, please?

49
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:10,553
Every chaos that happened was caused by you two.

50
00:05:11,421 --> 00:05:12,763
How disappointing.

51
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:18,193
One is the president of the prefect club.

52
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,430
The other is the head of the class.

53
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:24,213
How could you ruin Suppalo's reputation like that?

54
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:33,685
There's also the short film, Miss principal.

55
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:38,240
And you are making a short film,

56
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:45,323
exposing your own sexual abnormality to the world.

57
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:49,393
I don't mind if you're not embarrassed.

58
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:59,943
But you're announcing that Suppalo chose flawed people to be student leaders.

59
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,527
May I?

60
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:09,660
I don't think the short film and students' sexual preferences

61
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,094
are what we should discuss here.

62
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,573
And the word 'abnormality' you used'

63
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,347
I think'¦

64
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:17,226
let's just move on to the matter, Teacher Waree.

65
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:29,337
Today's discussion is the punishment for students who fabricated the Suppalo curse situation, ma'am.

66
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:32,432
This is a serious matter.

67
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:38,090
What is the school's mandated punishment for this, Teacher Waree?

68
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:48,340
The punishment is either a one-semester suspension or expulsion, ma'am.

69
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,253
This is the climax

70
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:05,053
because the characters finally accept what they are.

71
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,143
Kan.

72
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:21,848
Yeah.

73
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:23,357
Help the actors read their lines.

74
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:25,614
Come on.

75
00:07:25,614 --> 00:07:27,366
Before the solar eclipse happens.

76
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:32,340
Do you remember your dialogue?

77
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:34,247
I do.

78
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:40,136
Wat!

79
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:41,239
Look.

80
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:44,114
Come on.

81
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,465
Guys, stand by.

82
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:53,420
Slate!

83
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,896
Scene 2, Cut 1, Take 1.

84
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:59,153
And'¦action.

85
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:27,135
Wat.

86
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:28,887
Aren't you gonna cut here?

87
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:32,555
All these times,

88
00:08:32,843 --> 00:08:35,414
I have carried all heavy issues on my shoulders.

89
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:41,230
But now I don't care.

90
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:45,580
If I could freely choose to do anything,

91
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:49,850
I'd choose to tell you'¦

92
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,644
I'¦

93
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:01,343
Are you alright?

94
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:21,273
I can't do this.

95
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,583
My real life isn't like your movie.

96
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:30,499
I can't accept it as easily as the character can.

97
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:40,579
Akk.

98
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:45,260
I love you.

99
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:50,658
And I want you to love yourself too.

100
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,823
Do you get it?

101
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:00,712
This is normal.

102
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,612
It's so normal.

103
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:06,926
It is our nature that is the same as everyone else's.

104
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:10,129
Don't give a shit about what they think.

105
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,547
At least,

106
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:16,357
we're normal in each other's eyes and that's all.

107
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:22,583
I know.

108
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:27,301
But I can't do it.

109
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,654
I really can't.

110
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:33,604
Akk.

111
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:44,583
I'm sorry.

112
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:21,696
Hi, there.

113
00:11:25,713 --> 00:11:26,830
There, there.

114
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:31,655
I ruined everything.

115
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:36,403
It's okay.

116
00:11:41,605 --> 00:11:43,523
I ruined Wat's film.

117
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:47,344
Everybody understands.

118
00:11:48,773 --> 00:11:50,664
Wat asked me to tell you that

119
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:52,570
don't worry.

120
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:54,635
He will take it from there.

121
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:58,610
Why am I such a troublemaker?

122
00:12:07,414 --> 00:12:08,843
You're not, Akk.

123
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:28,661
What is this?

124
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:33,813
The revised student punishment protocol, 2005 edition.

125
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:37,233
It doesn't change anything.

126
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:43,213
As our student punishment protocol references the Revolutionary Council's proclamation in 1972.

127
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:44,646
That's true.

128
00:12:44,646 --> 00:12:48,930
We've been referencing the proclamation as well as the 2000 edition of the punishment protocol.

129
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,682
But there is a change to the 2005 edition.

130
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:54,238
What change?

131
00:12:54,483 --> 00:13:00,534
Suspension and expulsion are no longer permitted under the 2005 edition proclamation.

132
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:07,207
What remains are warnings, probation, and point deductions.

133
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:08,498
This is absurd.

134
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:13,407
That means we have no right to punish students who have committed serious violations?

135
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:15,579
No.

136
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,848
Those two students must be suspended for one semester no matter what.

137
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:25,138
If we do that, the students and their parents may sue us, citing this proclamation.

138
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:27,526
Our school's reputation will be ruined even more.

139
00:13:27,863 --> 00:13:31,605
I understand what they did was wrong.

140
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:33,337
Should we do this instead?

141
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:38,468
Give them a brief suspension as punishment.

142
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:42,138
This suspension will allow them to find a way to improve their behaviors.

143
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,749
The rules have changed, Miss principal.

144
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:48,350
If we want Suppalo to still stand,

145
00:13:49,118 --> 00:13:52,043
Suppalo must adjust.

146
00:14:16,764 --> 00:14:17,864
What is this now?

147
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,932
My resignation paper.

148
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:36,335
Thank you for everything.

149
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,846
I'm sorry, Akk,

150
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:44,537
for everything.

151
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:50,493
Thank you so much, Ayan.

152
00:15:58,503 --> 00:16:00,309
I think you should have them, sir.

153
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:44,578
Are you sure you can handle it by yourself?

154
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:24,976
I'm sorry for causing the truck to hit you.

155
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:32,055
I'm sorry too for everything I did.

156
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:56,902
I'll see you later,

157
00:17:58,914 --> 00:17:59,672
friend.

158
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:06,095
Are you staying at your dorm or what?

159
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:07,455
I'm going home.

160
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:11,956
Safe trip home.

161
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:13,148
My dad will be here soon.

162
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:14,700
See you.

163
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:36,266
Are you ready?

164
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:53,135
Hey.

165
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:54,483
Hello.

166
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:55,006
Akk.

167
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,591
Aye, you came too?

168
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,691
I just have nowhere else to go.

169
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:01,470
Mom, let me help.

170
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:26,743
Are you sure you can handle it by yourself?

171
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,158
Akk.

172
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:03,939
I got suspended from school.

173
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:12,637
We know.

174
00:20:14,142 --> 00:20:16,155
The school informed us yesterday.

175
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:18,306
When you're ready,

176
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:22,743
we would love to hear the story from you again.

177
00:20:28,672 --> 00:20:30,672
I did something so terrible.

178
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:34,792
I don't even know

179
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,499
if those people will forgive me at all.

180
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,682
Akk,

181
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:15,274
how many significant persons do you believe you have in your life?

182
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:18,346
Come again, Dad?

183
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:22,047
How many significant people do you have in your life?

184
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:27,766
Dad,

185
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:30,488
Mom,

186
00:21:34,137 --> 00:21:35,210
Kan,

187
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:36,731
Wat,

188
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:39,205
and'¦

189
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:44,792
Kan, Wat, and Aye called us yesterday.

190
00:21:45,492 --> 00:21:46,631
Everyone was worried about you.

191
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:51,458
They said when you're ready, call them back.

192
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:55,534
That means those three already forgave you.

193
00:21:57,452 --> 00:21:58,038
As for Mom and I,

194
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:01,338
we were never mad at you.

195
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,239
Ever since you were born,

196
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:05,756
you've always been our pride.

197
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,138
But I might disappoint you.

198
00:22:16,598 --> 00:22:18,442
There's one more thing

199
00:22:22,264 --> 00:22:23,353
I've never told you before.

200
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:33,407
I'¦

201
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:38,767
I'¦

202
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:44,316
Whatever it is repressed inside, say it.

203
00:22:44,316 --> 00:22:45,192
Say it, Son.

204
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,962
Let Mom and Dad know it.

205
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:01,662
I like men.

206
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:06,322
I like men.

207
00:23:10,212 --> 00:23:12,039
I know you two would be so regretful.

208
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,037
Not at all.

209
00:23:13,295 --> 00:23:15,369
I never regret it.

210
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,369
I only care for you.

211
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:21,759
You must have been bearing it for so long.

212
00:23:22,992 --> 00:23:24,792
You finally have the courage to let it out.

213
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,492
Well done, Son.

214
00:23:40,982 --> 00:23:42,750
Do you regret it?

215
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,113
No.

216
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,526
You're my son.

217
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:46,604
Our son.

218
00:23:57,238 --> 00:23:58,087
Let's eat.

219
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:01,780
We don't get to gather very often.

220
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,339
Start.

221
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:03,258
Okay.

222
00:24:07,156 --> 00:24:08,726
Good, as always, Mom.

223
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:21,790
Ma'am. Sir.

224
00:24:23,184 --> 00:24:24,192
Hm?

225
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:33,792
If Akk and I aren't just friends,

226
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,555
would you hate the idea?

227
00:24:45,915 --> 00:24:46,603
Aye.

228
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,081
Not friends.

229
00:24:52,715 --> 00:24:54,715
What are you two then?

230
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:11,163
We are boyfriends.

231
00:25:14,422 --> 00:25:15,691
We've been together for a while.

232
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:22,106
Is that true, Akk?

233
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,019
It is true, Dad.

234
00:25:37,237 --> 00:25:38,590
We can't possibly

235
00:25:41,602 --> 00:25:43,592
hate someone our son loves.

236
00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:51,435
Eat more.

237
00:25:51,435 --> 00:25:52,948
Here, Aye.

238
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:56,629
Thanks for taking care of our Akk.

239
00:25:59,035 --> 00:26:01,137
My turn.

240
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:03,927
I thank you too.

241
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:07,240
What is this?

242
00:26:08,492 --> 00:26:09,698
You don't give me food.

243
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:10,659
You only give it to'¦

244
00:26:11,051 --> 00:26:12,128
Their son's boyfriend.

245
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:13,317
I'm their son's boyfriend.

246
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:17,568
Alright. I'll give you more than I gave Aye.

247
00:26:17,568 --> 00:26:18,747
You got two.

248
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,508
Hug me tight.

249
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,362
In case you have a nightmare again tonight.

250
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,205
You did so great telling your parents the truth.

251
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,227
I guess because I have you.

252
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,757
So I have the courage.

253
00:26:58,495 --> 00:27:00,219
Have you talked to Wat and Kan?

254
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:03,330
No.

255
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,540
I'm too afraid to confront them.

256
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,492
I messed up their short film.

257
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,463
Don't think too much.

258
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:13,925
It can't be that bad.

259
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:24,057
Come on.

260
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:26,988
Come on what?

261
00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:32,851
You're cheeky.

262
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:37,741
I mean come on. Let's go to bed.

263
00:27:38,218 --> 00:27:40,218
I drove all day today.

264
00:27:40,682 --> 00:27:41,492
I'm tired.

265
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:43,949
Tired already?

266
00:27:44,117 --> 00:27:46,117
I thought tonight we were gonna'¦

267
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:46,745
Gonna what?

268
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:49,053
Nothing.

269
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:49,591
Akk.

270
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,655
Akk.

271
00:27:51,282 --> 00:27:52,193
What is it?

272
00:27:52,193 --> 00:27:53,512
Let's get some rest.

273
00:27:54,452 --> 00:27:55,328
Akk!!

274
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,797
Let's sleep.

275
00:27:56,797 --> 00:27:57,648
I'm already asleep.

276
00:27:58,092 --> 00:27:59,310
Say it.

277
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:01,105
No. I'm sleeping.

278
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,630
Akk.

279
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:05,791
Don't pretend to sleep.

280
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:08,761
Tell me what we were gonna do.

281
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:09,307
No.

282
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:10,506
Akk!

283
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:11,937
Enough.Just go to sleep.

284
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:12,745
Akk!

285
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:14,510
Tell me what you were saying.

286
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,183
Go to sleep. You're being loud.

287
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:20,132
Okay.

288
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,942
I will sleep.

289
00:28:32,273 --> 00:28:33,062
Aye.

290
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:34,619
Aye.

291
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,156
Are you sleeping?

292
00:28:39,862 --> 00:28:40,727
Come here.

293
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,220
Let's cuddle.

294
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:45,906
Come on.

295
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:53,564
Hug me tight.

296
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:55,981
In case you have a nightmare again tonight.

297
00:29:07,086 --> 00:29:08,165
Trying to mess with me?

298
00:29:35,545 --> 00:29:36,216
Continue.

299
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,331
Continue what?

300
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,636
I won't hold back anymore.

301
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:36,760
Why open the curtain?

302
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,606
Took you long enough to wake up.

303
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:43,116
Are you tired?

304
00:30:47,977 --> 00:30:49,203
How about we do it again and see?

305
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:50,621
You're the one tired.

306
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:58,230
Aye!

307
00:31:00,196 --> 00:31:01,736
Go take a shower.

308
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:06,350
Aye.

309
00:31:07,678 --> 00:31:11,566
I used to dream of sailing to the edge of the sea.

310
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:13,013
Really?

311
00:31:13,174 --> 00:31:13,985
Let's go.

312
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:16,547
Akk, Aye.

313
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:24,995
Guys.

314
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,459
What brings you all here?

315
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:33,086
Your home is as lovely as these guys bragged.

316
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,055
What did you brag about?

317
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,150
I just said your mom's food tastes so good.

318
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,350
Her son tastes so good too.

319
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,870
Easy there.

320
00:31:42,488 --> 00:31:43,680
Have you guys eaten?

321
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,310
We haven't.

322
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,259
Let's go eat then.

323
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:45,855
Come on.

324
00:31:51,652 --> 00:31:54,030
Miss, aren't you getting in the water too?

325
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,188
I don't think so.

326
00:31:55,464 --> 00:31:57,139
I'll just watch them from here.

327
00:31:58,246 --> 00:32:00,246
It's so good to be teenagers.

328
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,911
Kids have their own problems to deal with.

329
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:09,158
They are not as carefree as we think.

330
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,650
Yes, there. There's a fish around that rock.

331
00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:20,068
What's the surprise?

332
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:21,801
Calm down, man.

333
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,678
It's nothing. Don't be scared.

334
00:32:26,202 --> 00:32:28,018
Aye, unblindfold him.

335
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:38,225
What is this?

336
00:32:38,682 --> 00:32:39,777
My film is done.

337
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,211
Let's watch it.

338
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:44,530
Make it quick, Wat.

339
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:47,215
But I ruined that scene.

340
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:49,475
Just watch it first.

341
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,089
'Kad?'

342
00:33:00,003 --> 00:33:02,256
Another word for 'solar eclipse.'

343
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:11,009
Stop the Suppalo curse.

344
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:13,143
Find the one responsible.

345
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,990
Who sent you to mess with this school?

346
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:16,183
Your old school?

347
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:20,967
School should be a place where we can express our opinions.

348
00:33:22,194 --> 00:33:23,711
The curse again?

349
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:29,475
Next time, don't protect me like that again.

350
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:32,198
I'm used to it.

351
00:33:38,699 --> 00:33:39,458
What is it?

352
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,057
I'm afraid you'd disappear again.

353
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,899
My real life isn't like your movie.

354
00:33:57,665 --> 00:34:00,333
I can't accept it as easily as the character can.

355
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,350
We're normal in each other's eyes and that's all.

356
00:34:21,897 --> 00:34:22,790
Wat.

357
00:34:23,705 --> 00:34:26,150
Didn't you delete that scene?

358
00:34:27,225 --> 00:34:28,511
You were so sincere.

359
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,150
How could I delete it?

360
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:35,540
You did a great job, Wat.

361
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:42,946
Thank you, Teacher,

362
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:45,294
for keeping me from getting lost.

363
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,150
Cheers!

364
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:56,719
Get closer.

365
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,022
I'll go grill these.

366
00:35:01,022 --> 00:35:02,167
Just a moment.

367
00:35:03,616 --> 00:35:05,063
Are you drunk?

368
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,112
Come on.

369
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:14,469
What is it?

370
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:19,990
Since we are all here tonight,

371
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:24,084
I, Mr. Kanlong, along with Mr. Thuaphu,

372
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,790
have an announcement to make.

373
00:35:26,197 --> 00:35:27,069
What announcement?

374
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,270
We, from now on, will come out in the open.

375
00:35:39,128 --> 00:35:41,350
Aren't you open enough as you are now?

376
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:46,637
Coming out doesn't require just our courage.

377
00:35:47,307 --> 00:35:52,507
We need an understanding and supporting community and family as well.

378
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:56,961
We are lucky you guys understand us.

379
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,126
We thank you too, Teacher Sani.

380
00:36:03,158 --> 00:36:05,066
Since this is a special occasion,

381
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,710
we prepared a special show for you all.

382
00:36:15,971 --> 00:36:20,158
'ª From someone whom I meet for the first time 'ª

383
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:25,529
'ª Words suddenly resound in my mind 'ª

384
00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:30,932
'ª Saying that you are the one for me 'ª

385
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:35,668
'ª And I can't even find the reasons 'ª

386
00:36:35,668 --> 00:36:37,860
Are you going back to school?

387
00:36:38,828 --> 00:36:39,705
Of course, I am.

388
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:49,756
I have friends and a teacher who always support me.

389
00:36:50,111 --> 00:36:50,973
I'm not afraid.

390
00:36:51,825 --> 00:36:52,825
What about me?

391
00:36:54,216 --> 00:36:55,610
Am I not your supporter?

392
00:36:58,077 --> 00:37:00,505
Yeah, I know.

393
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:02,586
Without you,

394
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:08,215
I have no idea how I'd get through all that.

395
00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:15,999
'ª I know it right away at the first glance 'ª

396
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:22,902
'ª You're the one I've been waiting for 'ª

397
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,221
Where's everyone?

398
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:40,810
They all went to bed.

399
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,950
It's just us here.

400
00:37:44,052 --> 00:37:45,246
And why are you here?

401
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:47,323
I can't get up.

402
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:49,110
You're sleeping on my legs.

403
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,552
That's your reason?

404
00:38:10,283 --> 00:38:11,546
Was that enough to be my reason?

405
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,655
No.

406
00:38:57,494 --> 00:38:58,579
Hello.

407
00:39:13,483 --> 00:39:15,284
- Hello, Teacher.
- Hi.

408
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:23,692
Our Youth Rights Club is currently accepting new members.

409
00:39:23,692 --> 00:39:25,783
Come and join us.

410
00:39:25,783 --> 00:39:27,305
Everyone is welcome.

411
00:39:27,305 --> 00:39:29,164
Scan the QR code here.

412
00:39:29,384 --> 00:39:30,890
This is our e-book.

413
00:39:39,987 --> 00:39:41,814
Welcome back to school, guys.

414
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,673
Download our e-book here.

415
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:46,559
Akk,

416
00:39:46,856 --> 00:39:47,874
Thua.

417
00:39:49,295 --> 00:39:51,172
Take our leaflets too.

418
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:54,467
Come and join us, everyone.

419
00:39:58,173 --> 00:39:58,949
Here.

420
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,395
I'm returning them to you.

421
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,223
But Uncle Di

422
00:40:03,223 --> 00:40:04,827
Di would want his nephew to have them more.

423
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:06,836
Don't worry.

424
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:09,917
Di will always stay in my heart.

425
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,490
I met Mes yesterday.

426
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,622
How is he doing?

427
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:23,598
He's a uni student now. Must be so cool.

428
00:40:25,952 --> 00:40:27,532
He's dealing with his depressive disorder.

429
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:29,312
Taking a one-year break from uni.

430
00:40:32,145 --> 00:40:36,393
His dad said he couldn't fit into the new society.

431
00:40:37,306 --> 00:40:40,887
It's probably because our school hurt him so much.

432
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:49,067
[Student Prefects]

433
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:50,563
Every battle,

434
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:52,515
even a small one
[School is worthwhile when its students recognize their own worth.]

435
00:40:53,123 --> 00:40:55,667
leads to a change eventually.

436
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:59,712
Today, Suppalo's rules, which had been maintained for over a century,

437
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:02,359
have undergone some changes
[Suppalo's Rules]

438
00:41:02,509 --> 00:41:05,398
in order to fit into the modern age.

439
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:10,807
From this moment on, I quit being a student prefect

440
00:41:11,371 --> 00:41:13,050
and take this opportunity to repent myself.

441
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:15,361
According to our agreement,

442
00:41:16,087 --> 00:41:23,154
the one who qualifies to be the new student prefect is

443
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:25,730
Mr. Namo Thamrongtham.

444
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,305
Congratulations.

445
00:41:32,305 --> 00:41:33,109
Thank you

446
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:41,350
As for the new club president,

447
00:41:41,558 --> 00:41:45,535
which, for the first time ever, was selected by our votes,

448
00:41:46,057 --> 00:41:49,738
the result is in my hands now.

449
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:55,189
Congratulations to the new prefect club president,

450
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,847
Mr. Wasuwat Kongkiat.

451
00:42:11,677 --> 00:42:12,798
Congratulations.

452
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:14,557
Thank you.

453
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:37,813
Shit. What's the answer?

454
00:42:38,546 --> 00:42:39,582
So freaking tough.

455
00:42:41,946 --> 00:42:42,784
Kanlong.

456
00:42:43,673 --> 00:42:44,466
Yes, ma'am.

457
00:43:16,543 --> 00:43:21,115
I read historical anecdotes on the website you mentioned before.

458
00:43:21,271 --> 00:43:23,665
There are many interesting topics there.

459
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:30,492
If this historian writes more articles, share with me the link.

460
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:34,398
Yes, ma'am.

461
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:42,721
You have 20 minutes left.

462
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:46,872
Took you so long to finish the exam.

463
00:43:47,651 --> 00:43:48,602
You couldn't do it, could you?

464
00:43:48,775 --> 00:43:50,343
I was reviewing my answers.

465
00:43:50,542 --> 00:43:51,776
It's called being careful.

466
00:43:52,531 --> 00:43:54,112
I beat you for sure this time.

467
00:43:54,497 --> 00:43:55,607
No way.

468
00:43:55,607 --> 00:43:56,831
Of course, I beat you.

469
00:43:57,078 --> 00:43:58,485
I went full-on this time.

470
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,711
You know when I get serious, I always win

471
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:02,937
Bla bla bla.

472
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:04,177
What a bragger.

473
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:05,463
Are you done here?

474
00:44:06,994 --> 00:44:07,780
I am.

475
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:14,648
Let's go.

476
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:37,338
The exam is over!

477
00:44:37,338 --> 00:44:39,504
Welcome, school break!

478
00:44:52,932 --> 00:44:54,733
Time to let your uncle go.

479
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:09,278
Goodbye, Uncle.

480
00:45:11,429 --> 00:45:14,886
Goodbye, Teacher Dika.

481
00:45:58,478 --> 00:45:59,292
Are you ready?

482
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:12,747
Last time, you were the only one that pinned it for me. It's not fair.

483
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,119
This time, we do it for each other.

484
00:46:27,735 --> 00:46:28,672
I like it.

485
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:32,530
It's like we're exchanging wedding rings.

486
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:45,622
Hug me.

487
00:46:54,401 --> 00:46:56,030
Your body is so warm, Big Foot.

488
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:06,333
I want to kiss you.

489
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,194
Can I kiss you?

490
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,636
Of course.

491
00:47:14,182 --> 00:47:15,491
I want to kiss you too.

492
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:33,551
I love you.

493
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,074
Do you know

494
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:28,676
how much I like it when the sky is clear like this?

495
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:34,001
I do.

496
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:36,175
I like it too.

497
00:48:37,265 --> 00:48:38,536
The sky?

498
00:48:39,699 --> 00:48:40,426
Um.

499
00:48:45,037 --> 00:48:49,732
But I like it more when you're next to me, Akk.

500
00:49:25,252 --> 00:49:32,305
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

501
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,641
Is there any news on that new kid?

502
00:49:37,613 --> 00:49:39,910
I think he's come to mess with our school.

503
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:42,305
Ever since he joined,

504
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:43,481
The World Remembrance

505
00:49:51,096 --> 00:49:52,478
- Should I push you again?
- Yes.

506
00:50:00,429 --> 00:50:01,785
- That's it?
- Yes.

507
00:50:05,155 --> 00:50:06,338
I'm sorry, my friend.

508
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:07,498
Why are you apologizing?

509
00:50:08,641 --> 00:50:09,651
Sorry.

510
00:50:09,651 --> 00:50:10,715
That was the wrong throwing.

511
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,122
Napkins, please.

512
00:50:15,732 --> 00:50:16,440
No.

513
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,524
I will stay here in front of the student welfare department.

514
00:50:18,524 --> 00:50:19,418
But it's nice and cold there.

515
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,611
It's good. I like it.

516
00:50:25,611 --> 00:50:26,604
You like personality?

517
00:50:26,604 --> 00:50:27,671
I like him. As if!

518
00:50:27,867 --> 00:50:28,708
What?

519
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:29,473
What a bad joke!

520
00:50:29,918 --> 00:50:30,704
Kan.

521
00:50:32,717 --> 00:50:33,974
This is you being fit already?

522
00:50:36,554 --> 00:50:37,862
Guys.

523
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,444
Is everything going well for the school foundation day?

524
00:50:44,444 --> 00:50:45,484
Well'

525
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:50,332
You'll be working with Teacher Dika.

526
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:53,289
Teacher Dika, advise him.

527
00:50:53,535 --> 00:50:54,943
I shouldn't do the hand gesture?

528
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,007
I'm stretching my shoulders.

529
00:50:58,007 --> 00:50:58,909
I'm not tense.

530
00:51:01,356 --> 00:51:02,702
Sorry. Did I hurt you?

531
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,554
Sorry.

532
00:51:09,058 --> 00:51:09,900
Is it good?

533
00:51:10,888 --> 00:51:11,651
No.

534
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,425
Bro, he said it wasn't good.

535
00:51:13,425 --> 00:51:15,146
I didn't. I was gonna say, 'Nosy!'

536
00:51:15,564 --> 00:51:24,213
But you're announcing that Suppalo chose unsuitable people to be student leaders.

537
00:51:24,213 --> 00:51:25,668
Flawed was the word.

538
00:51:25,668 --> 00:51:26,715
Yes, flawed.

539
00:51:28,723 --> 00:51:30,996
I should've said, 'Mr. President' as well. Sorry.

540
00:51:30,996 --> 00:51:33,448
Yes, so they know who I am.

541
00:51:33,448 --> 00:51:34,666
- Mr. President.
- Give me the title.

542
00:51:35,704 --> 00:51:37,704
Welcome to what is it? I forgot.

543
00:51:41,742 --> 00:51:42,762
What is it?

544
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,285
Cut!
