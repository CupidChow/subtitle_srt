5

Teacher.

6
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:23,599
I’d like to ask if the Prefect Club can watch Ayan’s behavior instead.

7
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:24,464
Thua.

8
00:00:24,464 --> 00:00:26,947
Whatever problem you have, you can always talk to me.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,046
Hey.

10
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:29,421
Are you following me?

11
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:30,447
Watch out!

12
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:46,574
We’re here.

13
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:47,844
What are we doing here?

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,906
I want coffee.

15
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:50,000
Then go by yourself.

16
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:51,019
I’ll wait in the car.

17
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:52,145
You can’t.

18
00:00:52,498 --> 00:00:54,102
Of course, I can. Why not?

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,125
What the hell do you think you’re doing?

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,922
If you don't come with me,

21
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:28,961
I’ll post this photo.

22
00:01:33,732 --> 00:01:35,918
You can’t post it, Ayan.

23
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:38,115
What say you?

24
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:41,190
If you don’t come with me right now,

25
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:42,745
I’m posting it.

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,489
I’ll come.

27
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:48,077
But you have to delete it.

28
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:50,140
Okay.

29
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,000
Welcome to Café for All.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,421
Oh, hello, Aye.

31
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:17,960
Thank you for coming back here.

32
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,057
Of course.

33
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:20,251
Oh?

34
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,480
You were here the other day, weren’t you?

35
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:26,251
I think you’ve got the wrong guy.

36
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:28,440
I doubt it.

37
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,325
You were here with a good-looking friend.

38
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:30,941
Weren’t you?

39
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:37,466
Never mind that. Just make yourselves at home, Aye and…

40
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:38,967
Akk.

41
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:40,253
His name is Akk.

42
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,528
Akk.

43
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:42,661
Nice to meet you.

44
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:43,424
Yes.

45
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:44,575
Make yourselves at home.

46
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:45,172
Yes, Golf.

47
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:46,042
I’ll send a staff to take your order soon.

48
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:46,646
Please.

49
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:47,453
Thank you.

50
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:51,104
So?

51
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,527
Can you just admit you followed me here?

52
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,322
I didn’t follow you here.

53
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,687
I just saw a lot of reviews about this place.

54
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:09,100
So I asked Kan to come here.

55
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:11,546
I gotta give it to you, Akk.

56
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,404
You slithered out of that, alright.

57
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,373
Stop talking.

58
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:16,287
Give me your phone.

59
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:17,445
I’m deleting that photo.

60
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,171
Nope.

61
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:21,920
Don’t be a pain.

62
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:23,529
I came in here with you.

63
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:25,272
Now you keep your word.

64
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,033
I’ll delete it.

65
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,474
I told you to delete it.

66
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:47,423
Why the hell did you send it to me?

67
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:49,185
I deleted it off my phone.

68
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:51,105
But on yours,

69
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,293
you can decide for yourself if you want to delete or save it.

70
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,752
Of course I’m deleting it.

71
00:04:55,752 --> 00:04:56,930
Why would I save it?

72
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,122
Okay.

73
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:06,961
Why are you taking me here?

74
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,166
I know

75
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,852
that you talked to all the teachers not to gang up on me.

76
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:24,044
I talk to the teachers all the time.

77
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:25,622
You’re overthinking it.

78
00:05:26,763 --> 00:05:29,414
I don’t know why you helped me.

79
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:31,419
But, well…

80
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,449
Thank you.

81
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:42,356
I didn’t know “thank you” was part of your vocabulary.

82
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:46,841
Oh, I’ve got loads of vocabulary, actually.

83
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:49,791
Why don’t you try and find out more?

84
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:56,537
Stop messing with me.

85
00:05:58,563 --> 00:06:00,000
Take me back.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,975
I have work to do.

87
00:06:02,422 --> 00:06:03,445
Golf.

88
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,167
One more of this, please.

89
00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:08,945
Are you deaf?

90
00:06:08,945 --> 00:06:10,092
I said I have to go back.

91
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:11,178
I have work to do.

92
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:15,140
Bottoms up.

93
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,398
[You’re paired with me for tomorrow’s Judo class.]

94
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:49,786
[Yeah.]

95
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,640
Hi, Mom.

96
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:08,799
Did you turn it on?

97
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:09,703
Okay.

98
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:11,081
Now do you see the long button?

99
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:12,394
Click the space bar.

100
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,020
Yes.

101
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,240
Now click on a right click.

102
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,102
There’ll be a menu bar appearing.

103
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:18,912
Yes.

104
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:21,063
Now double click it.

105
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:22,626
Yes.

106
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:23,580
Look at him.

107
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:26,400
The school forbids using phones.

108
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,464
But he’s still using it.

109
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:29,128
Kan.

110
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:32,011
Just let him be.

111
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:34,507
But he’s breaking the rule.

112
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:36,109
Didn’t you hear him?

113
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:39,493
It sounds like he’s teaching an adult how to use a computer.

114
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:42,441
I think it could be something very important to him.

115
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,333
Now I feel guilty.

116
00:07:48,197 --> 00:07:49,907
You’re being weird today, Akk.

117
00:07:50,356 --> 00:07:51,039
Yeah.

118
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:53,008
But I agree with you.

119
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,987
We can’t just judge people without hearing their reasons.

120
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,566
Now I feel really guilty.

121
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,288
You make me look bad.

122
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,817
I’m really sorry.

123
00:08:10,817 --> 00:08:12,406
But no one is home right now.

124
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:13,942
My mother really needed to use the computer.

125
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:14,740
So I—

126
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,623
It’s okay.

127
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,759
But next time you have an urgent need to use your phone,

128
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:23,443
contact the Student Welfare Dept. or the Prefect Club.

129
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:25,387
I will.

130
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:26,394
Thank you.

131
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,205
Really weird.

132
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:34,288
Yep.

133
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:35,701
Totally weird.

134
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,440
But not bad. I like it.

135
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:38,543
His change?

136
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:40,000
Him. As if!

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,757
Wait, what?

138
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:42,177
I was asking seriously, man.

139
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,425
You’re the weird one.

140
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:43,933
Me?

141
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:44,775
He’s the weird one.

142
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:45,408
You are.

143
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:45,989
Okay, then.

144
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:46,850
Oh, Kan.

145
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,350
What?

146
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,784
Pair with me for Judo class.

147
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:50,217
Of course, my man.

148
00:08:50,527 --> 00:08:52,240
I promise to go easy on you, Wat.

149
00:08:52,426 --> 00:08:53,183
You’d better.

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,255
By the way, Akk.

151
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:56,975
Who will you pair with?

152
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:58,713
Who else but Aye?

153
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,877
He promised the teacher he would train with Aye.

154
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,723
Didn’t you?

155
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:07,139
I guess so.

156
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:10,244
What a burden.

157
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:11,758
He never learns what I teach him.

158
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,168
You guys go ahead.

159
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:16,633
I have something to submit to a teacher.

160
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:17,471
Sure.

161
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:17,971
Okay.

162
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,026
- See you.
- See you, man.

163
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,000
You’ve always been so unyielding.

164
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:47,149
Why did you let them do this to you?

165
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:58,253
You won’t be mean to me like they are, will you?

166
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:08,819
Give me your phone.

167
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:10,000
I’m deleting that photo.

168
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,215
I told you to delete it.

169
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:15,313
Why the hell did you send it to me?

170
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,040
I deleted it off my phone.

171
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:20,229
But on yours,

172
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,439
you can decide for yourself if you want to delete or save it.

173
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:33,904
Why didn’t you reply to my texts?

174
00:10:52,057 --> 00:10:53,405
You said you’d delete it.

175
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:56,911
I–I’m deleting it right now.

176
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:04,095
Why are you smiling?

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,793
Nothing.

178
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:09,601
Why aren’t you at the dojo?

179
00:11:09,761 --> 00:11:11,295
You’re paired with me.

180
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:12,417
Did you forget?

181
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,498
Judo isn’t a one-man sport, you know.

182
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:19,188
Who asked you to act up so much that no one wants to pair with you?

183
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,036
So you’re not deleting it?

184
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:27,983
I am.

185
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:31,228
Wait.

186
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,030
What now?

187
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:36,369
If you’re going to delete it, can you do it somewhere else?

188
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:39,502
Don’t do it in front of me.

189
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,809
I will.

190
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:58,005
Akk.

191
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:02,892
Are you really not going back to class?

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,785
Yeah.

193
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:06,304
If you do this, our whole class will be in trouble, too.

194
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:09,897
Where have you been?

195
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:12,456
I went to get Aye.

196
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:13,508
I didn’t want him to miss another test.

197
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:15,087
What’s the matter?

198
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:40,787
One, two, three, four.

199
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:44,330
Five, six, seven, eight.

200
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,517
Louder!

201
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,866
One, two, three, four.

202
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:51,520
Alright, one!

203
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,506
You bastards, do it in sync!

204
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:56,305
Two!

205
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,490
In sync!

206
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,995
Or else I’ll start again.

207
00:13:01,995 --> 00:13:02,797
Four!

208
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:04,753
Five!

209
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:11,516
Get ready for the next one.

210
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:14,448
Do it with more rigor!

211
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:15,449
Get ready.

212
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,603
Don’t dawdle. Start again!

213
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:20,310
One!

214
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,167
Two!

215
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:26,611
Too slow! Faster.

216
00:13:26,611 --> 00:13:27,410
Three!

217
00:13:29,745 --> 00:13:32,765
Do it in sync or I’ll start from the top.

218
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:34,588
Keep your core tight.

219
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:35,317
Four!

220
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:39,334
Do it properly!

221
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:41,034
Five!

222
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:11,481
You jerk.

223
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,219
You took my notebook, didn’t you?

224
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:14,985
What the hell?

225
00:14:15,217 --> 00:14:16,261
I didn’t.

226
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:17,623
If it’s not you, then who?

227
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:18,763
I don’t know.

228
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:19,842
But I didn’t take it.

229
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:21,232
If you don’t give it back to me,

230
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,808
I’m telling everyone what this stupid school did.

231
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:26,063
Stop sprouting nonsense.

232
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:27,030
All of you.

233
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:32,544
Do you want to know what the curse of this stupid school actually is?

234
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:34,590
I told you to shut up!

235
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,023
Give it back to me, jerk!

236
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:39,674
I didn’t take it!

237
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:40,746
- You did, Akk.
- Stop it.

238
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,102
Stop it, both of you.

239
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:44,769
Stop!

240
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,526
I said stop!

241
00:14:46,526 --> 00:14:47,245
Now!

242
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:55,263
You bastards.

243
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,315
Now I have to report this to the Principal.

244
00:14:58,363 --> 00:14:59,330
Teacher,

245
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:01,568
please don’t report it.

246
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,344
I’m begging you.

247
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,878
Why didn’t you think before you threw that punch, then?

248
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:08,320
You can punish me all you like.

249
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:09,905
I’m asking for one thing.

250
00:15:10,582 --> 00:15:12,026
Don’t report it to the Principal.

251
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Or else I’ll lose my scholarship.

252
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,347
Fine.

253
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,502
I won’t.

254
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:25,623
Only because you’re an alright student

255
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,452
who always looks out for others.

256
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:29,227
Thank you.

257
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:31,652
Well…

258
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:34,202
What do you need me to do?

259
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:35,430
I’ll do anything.

260
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,866
Not only you.

261
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:40,706
Both of you.

262
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:56,069
Hey, Akk.

263
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:57,479
Aye.

264
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:00,299
So what the hell was that all about?

265
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:03,702
Ask your friend.

266
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:10,956
Well, what is it?

267
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:13,166
It’s nothing.

268
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,555
You’re normally much calmer than this.

269
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:18,417
But when it comes to Aye, you always get so hasty.

270
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,240
It’s nothing.

271
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:22,258
Nothing, my foot.

272
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,330
I said it’s nothing.

273
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:26,053
Kan,

274
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:29,540
let’s talk about this later.

275
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:32,609
I don’t think Akk wants to talk right now.

276
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:34,919
I’ll be back.

277
00:16:35,987 --> 00:16:38,028
Akk, where are you going?

278
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,792
What’s the matter with him?

279
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:52,112
What is it, Akk?

280
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:54,234
Is Teacher Chadok here today?

281
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:57,560
Teacher Chadok went to a seminar in Bangkok.

282
00:16:58,254 --> 00:16:59,291
Since when?

283
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,204
He left yesterday.

284
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:04,238
But he did tell me to call him if there's any emergency.

285
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,422
Do you have something urgent you need to talk to him about?

286
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:11,109
No.

287
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:12,436
Thank you, Teacher.

288
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:13,548
Bye.

289
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:19,887
You took my notebook, didn’t you?

290
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:21,177
I didn’t.

291
00:17:21,177 --> 00:17:22,615
If it’s not you, then who?

292
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:30,205
I wonder who stole Aye’s notebook.

293
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:33,185
Yeah, I want to know, too.

294
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,866
Would be nice if it’s a “who.”

295
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,675
I’m afraid it might be the curse of Suppalo.

296
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:44,670
Damn it.

297
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:46,411
You gave me goosebumps.

298
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:52,765
I think Aye always carries that notebook with him at all time.

299
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,375
I bet he’s feeling really bad right now

300
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,817
for losing it.

301
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,522
You look so concerned about him, Thua.

302
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:06,989
Oh, Akk.

303
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,418
Where have you been?

304
00:18:09,302 --> 00:18:10,168
Nowhere.

305
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:13,689
He hasn’t come back to class

306
00:18:14,836 --> 00:18:15,911
ever since he got into a fight with you.

307
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:26,663
Attention!

308
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:29,587
Hello, Teacher.

309
00:18:30,102 --> 00:18:31,638
We’re having a quiz today.

310
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:36,239
I’ll let you study your notes for 15 minutes.

311
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,620
Then we’ll begin.

312
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:40,101
Yes, ma’am.

313
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:41,235
Where’s Ayan?

314
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:49,828
Start reviewing.

315
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:23,631
What are you doing sleeping here?

316
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:29,751
None of your business.

317
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,044
I’m here to get you back to class.

318
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,978
We had a quiz just now.

319
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,456
If there’s another in the afternoon class, you’ll miss out again.

320
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:49,105
Are you really not going back to class?

321
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:50,241
Yeah.

322
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:54,378
If you do this, our whole class will be in trouble, too.

323
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,207
Yeah. I know.

324
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:57,663
I’ll be back.

325
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,028
Just let me sleep a little longer.

326
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,687
Where have you been?

327
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,133
I went to get Aye back to class.

328
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:32,158
I didn’t want him to miss another test.

329
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:34,781
Why? What’s the matter?

330
00:20:35,842 --> 00:20:36,712
Nothing.

331
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:38,808
I just came to see you.

332
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:41,705
I’m afraid Aye might talk you into joining that gang.

333
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:43,668
Oh, that.

334
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:46,180
Let’s get back to class.

335
00:21:14,788 --> 00:21:15,884
Alright, let’s go.

336
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,539
Take a bite, Singto.

337
00:21:36,193 --> 00:21:37,172
Singto, eat.

338
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,233
Singto.

339
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:45,088
I’m not buying you food anymore.

340
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:46,776
You arrogant bastard.

341
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:07,483
I really didn’t take your notebook.

342
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:14,031
I know I want it.

343
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:15,924
But it isn’t me this time.

344
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,089
I know it’s not you.

345
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,646
You were with me the entire time.

346
00:22:26,226 --> 00:22:28,087
But I got really angry so I…

347
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,481
I didn’t think it through.

348
00:22:32,196 --> 00:22:33,808
Was that an apology?

349
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:36,299
If you think so.

350
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:39,435
Wait.

351
00:22:45,301 --> 00:22:47,463
You threatened to tell everyone about the school’s curse…

352
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:49,274
What did you mean by that?

353
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:54,543
Does the student prefect title mean that much to you?

354
00:22:54,891 --> 00:22:55,607
Yes.

355
00:22:56,178 --> 00:22:57,714
It allows me to help this school.

356
00:22:58,647 --> 00:23:03,312
Here I thought you wanted the Best Behavior quota to get into college with a scholarship.

357
00:23:04,186 --> 00:23:05,189
That, too.

358
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:09,998
In my opinion, something like that doesn’t suit you at all.

359
00:23:12,969 --> 00:23:13,839
Why?

360
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:16,406
Am I such a wimp in your opinion?

361
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:21,432
Why must you act all tamed just to get some rewards from those people?

362
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:25,691
Is it wrong of me to do whatever it takes to get the same privilege as everyone else?

363
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,731
Someone who was born with such privilege like you

364
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,284
can move school whenever you want.

365
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:30,682
What would you understand?

366
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,136
What the hell?

367
00:23:52,788 --> 00:23:55,182
Son, I’m sorry.

368
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:57,418
The timer is a little off.

369
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:00,346
Are you alright?

370
00:24:00,513 --> 00:24:01,786
I’m not alright, sir.

371
00:24:01,786 --> 00:24:02,814
I’m soaked.

372
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,216
But I am alright, sir.

373
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:12,950
Hey!

374
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:16,820
Wait for me.

375
00:24:18,703 --> 00:24:19,795
And?

376
00:24:20,212 --> 00:24:23,808
Does it trouble you that this is the way we are?

377
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:26,225
Wasuwat.

378
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:28,388
What’s the matter?

379
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:36,088
In my opinion, this kind of thing suits you more.

380
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:53,746
Do I have to go now, Dad?

381
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,306
Can’t I go tomorrow?

382
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:58,202
Your aunt is leaving soon.

383
00:24:58,602 --> 00:24:59,559
She’s waiting.

384
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:01,305
You have to go now.

385
00:25:01,923 --> 00:25:02,541
Yes.

386
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:08,284
It won’t ever dry soon enough.

387
00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:24,990
What are you doing?

388
00:25:25,478 --> 00:25:26,577
Take my jacket.

389
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:27,792
You’re in a hurry, aren’t you?

390
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:30,389
I’ll take yours to the laundry.

391
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:31,430
I’ll return it tomorrow.

392
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:34,119
Think fast or you’ll be late.

393
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:42,252
Want me to give you a ride?

394
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:43,539
No need.

395
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:44,456
I can go by myself.

396
00:25:50,543 --> 00:25:51,616
In my opinion,

397
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,007
this kind of thing suits you more.

398
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:56,185
No way.

399
00:25:56,497 --> 00:25:57,663
I don’t want to be like you.

400
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:00,122
But you haven’t even tried.

401
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,473
How’d you know you don’t?

402
00:26:04,935 --> 00:26:05,941
I just know it.

403
00:26:06,312 --> 00:26:08,165
Give that to me. I’ll do the laundry myself.

404
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:09,807
I said give it to me.

405
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:41,017
Give it to me.

406
00:27:18,794 --> 00:27:20,052
Why does it have to be you?

407
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:46,654
Oh, hell!

408
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:48,680
Doesn’t he know what a turn signal is?

409
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,568
What the hell?

410
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:51,821
I need to teach him a lesson.

411
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:53,764
Honey, just forget it.

412
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:55,573
Yes, Dad.

413
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,324
Just forget it.

414
00:27:56,324 --> 00:27:57,202
It’s alright.

415
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:58,171
Oh,

416
00:27:58,913 --> 00:27:59,873
you’re here, too?

417
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:02,099
And here I thought it was just the two of us with all the silence.

418
00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:05,472
I’m sorry. I was thinking.

419
00:28:05,841 --> 00:28:08,173
You’re a man. You don’t need to think so much, Thuaphu.

420
00:28:08,547 --> 00:28:11,348
You’re too soft. That’s why you’re always bullied.

421
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:15,561
I have to go. Bye.

422
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:17,912
Wait, darling.

423
00:28:27,848 --> 00:28:28,449
You faggots!

424
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:30,296
And?

425
00:28:30,469 --> 00:28:33,855
Does it trouble you that this is the way we are?

426
00:28:34,536 --> 00:28:35,989
So you don’t know?

427
00:28:36,205 --> 00:28:37,883
Know what?

428
00:28:38,078 --> 00:28:40,196
It does trouble all of us.

429
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:44,251
Wherever I go, everyone asks

430
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,775
if I go to a faggot school.

431
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,593
Everyone else tries to uphold the school’s reputation.

432
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:54,864
But you lot only destroy it.

433
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,202
It would be nice to disappear.

434
00:29:35,412 --> 00:29:39,853
[It would be nice to disappear.]

435
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:45,900
Ever since I remarried,

436
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:49,834
I’ve never seen you express any feelings.

437
00:29:50,676 --> 00:29:51,327
I thought…

438
00:29:52,676 --> 00:29:54,674
nothing was wrong.

439
00:29:55,518 --> 00:29:57,049
Nothing is wrong, Mom.

440
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,220
Dad is…

441
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:02,959
nice to me.

[Accept]

446
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:47,449
Who is it?

00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:55,225
[Thuaphu. You?]

448
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:03,920
[I’m Bruce Wayne. Nice to meet you.]

[Student Welfare Department]

450
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:33,206
Wasuwat.

451
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:33,850
Yes?

452
00:31:34,974 --> 00:31:35,983
What’s the matter?

453
00:31:37,076 --> 00:31:39,063
Err, Teacher.

454
00:31:40,113 --> 00:31:44,358
You told me the other day that I don’t look like I enjoy class.

455
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:46,127
Actually…

456
00:31:47,466 --> 00:31:48,507
I like films.

457
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:53,449
But not the blockbuster type.

458
00:31:53,949 --> 00:31:56,105
I mean another type of film.

459
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,018
Indie films?

460
00:31:59,346 --> 00:32:00,157
Yes.

461
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:01,710
You know about that?

462
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:07,245
I happen to have a cinephile friend who’s into indie films.

463
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:09,490
That’s nice.

464
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:13,835
Did you talk to your family about your interest?

465
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:20,460
They said it’s nonsense.

466
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,843
They said it’s not a good job.

467
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:26,763
It’s not as stable as something like being an engineer.

468
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:31,835
Isn’t it hard being a teenager?

469
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:36,484
But you know what, Wasuwat?

470
00:32:37,735 --> 00:32:41,551
You don’t always need to do as others expect of you.

471
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,255
Well, I’m off to class.

472
00:32:49,274 --> 00:32:49,976
Yes.

473
00:32:50,406 --> 00:32:51,606
Thank you.

474
00:33:03,654 --> 00:33:05,224
How is the situation?

475
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:08,786
The group supporting The World Remembers is gaining momentum.

476
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,052
Stop it.

477
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:15,047
Isn’t this an obvious abuse of power, student prefect?

478
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,487
Why did you want to be a student prefect?

479
00:33:18,912 --> 00:33:20,170
Why’d you want to know?

480
00:33:50,431 --> 00:33:52,431
Has it really been only three days?

481
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,287
And that Kala-guy wants us to do this for a whole month?

482
00:33:57,683 --> 00:33:58,894
His name’s Kalakul.

483
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:01,301
You’ll be in trouble if he walks in here and hears you make fun of his name.

484
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:08,232
Have you found your notebook?

485
00:34:09,602 --> 00:34:10,427
No.

486
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:14,582
Akk.

487
00:34:17,012 --> 00:34:18,873
Why did you want to be a student prefect?

488
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,181
I told you.

489
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:24,511
It’s the only position that allows me to help this school.

490
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:26,310
No, not that.

491
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:29,413
I want to know what got you interested.

492
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,374
What inspired you, that kind of thing.

493
00:34:32,132 --> 00:34:33,294
Why’d you want to know?

494
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,247
No reason. I just want to know.

495
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:46,804
When I first started here,

496
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:49,024
it felt like I had a sign on my forehead labelling,

497
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:50,850
“country bumpkin.”

498
00:34:51,212 --> 00:34:53,583
I got bullied a lot for that.

499
00:34:54,215 --> 00:34:56,215
I lost control and punched them in the face.

500
00:34:57,788 --> 00:34:58,757
You?

501
00:34:59,132 --> 00:35:00,163
Yeah.

502
00:35:00,637 --> 00:35:04,169
After that, I was taken to the Student Welfare Department.

503
00:35:04,573 --> 00:35:07,641
I met Teacher Dika, the assistant teacher of the Department.

504
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,715
The one your old school stole away.

505
00:35:11,852 --> 00:35:13,689
My life got turned around after that.

506
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:14,386
Because he was just…

507
00:35:14,386 --> 00:35:15,301
- so understanding.
- understanding.

508
00:35:23,943 --> 00:35:24,932
What happened next?

509
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:28,292
Teacher Dika was an assistant teacher to Teacher Chadok.

510
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,640
So Teacher Chadok took me to see Mes.

511
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:33,197
He was the previous student prefect.

512
00:35:33,815 --> 00:35:35,815
Is everything alright for the Srisuppalo event?

513
00:35:35,815 --> 00:35:36,898
Yes, sir.

514
00:35:37,129 --> 00:35:38,224
Is there anything else left to do?

515
00:35:38,634 --> 00:35:41,261
Only to compile a list of some students.

516
00:35:41,261 --> 00:35:41,879
Alright.

517
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:43,809
You can consult Teacher Dika about that.

518
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:44,779
Teacher.

519
00:35:45,175 --> 00:35:46,074
I’ll leave it to you.

520
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:46,757
Yes.

521
00:35:49,962 --> 00:35:50,737
Hello, teachers.

522
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,425
Akk, isn’t it?

523
00:35:53,924 --> 00:35:54,632
Yes.

524
00:35:55,092 --> 00:35:57,406
This is Mes, Head of the Prefect Club.

525
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:01,639
Hello.

526
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,292
You know what, the first time I met him,

527
00:36:07,563 --> 00:36:08,957
it just sort of clicked.

528
00:36:09,328 --> 00:36:10,700
I wanted to be like him.

529
00:36:13,457 --> 00:36:16,130
So that was how your obsession with this stupid school came from.

530
00:36:17,673 --> 00:36:19,394
If you don’t stop disrespecting my school,

531
00:36:20,258 --> 00:36:21,817
I’m going to wrestle you to the ground, Shortstop.

532
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:31,287
I could kiss you again, Big Foot.

533
00:36:34,238 --> 00:36:35,402
Stop it.

534
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:43,584
How is Teacher Dika doing?

535
00:37:04,203 --> 00:37:05,184
I have to go.

536
00:37:05,184 --> 00:37:07,812
My mother asks me to do something for her.

537
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:25,102
I said stop filming.

538
00:37:25,521 --> 00:37:27,521
Ouch! Look!

539
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:28,487
Teacher!

540
00:37:30,346 --> 00:37:34,064
Stop making a ruckus if you don’t want to be in trouble.

541
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:36,201
Help, y’all.

542
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:38,929
Look at this. This teacher is threatening me.

543
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:39,750
I can’t do this.

544
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,197
We can’t keep living like this.

545
00:37:41,197 --> 00:37:42,943
We need more people for the protest next time.

546
00:37:42,943 --> 00:37:46,412
- Come out and join us, everyone.
- Hey, help me out.

547
00:37:46,412 --> 00:37:48,598
They’re doing it again.

548
00:37:49,658 --> 00:37:51,147
Help, all of you. Help!

549
00:37:51,148 --> 00:37:52,509
I said stop recording!

550
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:54,638
Nun.

551
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:56,127
My phone…

552
00:37:57,564 --> 00:37:58,728
This is too much.

553
00:37:58,728 --> 00:38:00,167
You’re going too far.

554
00:38:26,383 --> 00:38:33,305
[The World Remembers: Dear all Suppalo students, come out to protest under the campaign #ProtestAgaistTheCurse.]

555
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:34,149
[The teacher is going too far.]

556
00:38:34,149 --> 00:38:36,899
[Let’s see if the curse can really hurt you.]
[What is the executive even doing?]

557
00:38:38,265 --> 00:38:42,812
[The faggots are the problem. Hope the curse got them dead.]
[I hope the ghosts of all Suppalo past students kill them!]

558
00:38:43,984 --> 00:38:48,532
The gang is using social media to gather support from outside of school.

559
00:38:48,736 --> 00:38:50,572
Teacher Chadok is still at the seminar.

560
00:38:50,866 --> 00:38:53,412
But he told us to take care of this matter as soon as possible.

561
00:38:53,412 --> 00:38:54,485
Yes, ma’am.

562
00:38:55,201 --> 00:38:56,806
How is the situation?

563
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:59,269
There are three groups of opinions right now.

564
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:03,219
The group supporting The World Remembers is gaining momentum.

565
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:05,527
But the group supporting the school is still bigger.

566
00:39:06,634 --> 00:39:08,054
And the third group?

567
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:10,759
It’s the silent group who’s not taking sides.

568
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:15,751
If we let this grow, I’m afraid there might be a riot.

569
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:18,865
Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.

570
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:22,812
If the curse of Suppalo comes back, then we can stop them.

571
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:24,905
The curse again?

572
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:28,602
But they got cursed already.

573
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:30,137
Yes.

574
00:39:31,187 --> 00:39:32,630
First, their stuff started disappearing.

575
00:39:32,948 --> 00:39:34,484
Then, they got into some little accidents,

576
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,831
and then some car accidents.

577
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,072
According to the legend, there’s one more incident left.

578
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:40,992
Getting burned.

579
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,155
This is such a banger.

580
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:49,622
It’s really pretty, isn’t it?

581
00:39:49,622 --> 00:39:50,305
Yeah.

582
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:54,697
Nong.

583
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,981
Once you finish this sign, can you make another one for me?

584
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:58,794
Which one do you want?

585
00:39:58,794 --> 00:40:00,306
The “Stop violence” one.

586
00:40:00,412 --> 00:40:01,932
I think it needs more.

587
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,145
I’ll get right to it.

588
00:40:03,145 --> 00:40:04,934
Art and craft is my thing.

589
00:40:05,253 --> 00:40:08,692
Damn, who’s as great as you?

590
00:40:08,692 --> 00:40:10,337
You’re pretty and talented.

591
00:40:10,337 --> 00:40:11,995
It’s nothing to brag about, sis.

592
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:14,038
Make way, please. Let a sister pass.

593
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,401
Move.

594
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:16,347
You wench.

595
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,607
Be careful. Just go around us.

596
00:40:18,607 --> 00:40:19,643
But I wanted to walk past here.

597
00:40:19,643 --> 00:40:21,598
Did you think this was a fashion show, Nian?

598
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:25,571
Hey!

599
00:40:27,196 --> 00:40:28,147
Stop it.

600
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:32,171
Isn’t this an obvious abuse of power, student prefect?

601
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:33,695
I am not abusing my power.

602
00:40:34,368 --> 00:40:35,572
This is a warning.

603
00:40:35,572 --> 00:40:36,472
Out of concern.

604
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
I don’t want the curse going after you again.

605
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:40,838
Curse?

606
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:45,612
Stop using some stupid urban legend to scare us off.

607
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:46,838
There is no such thing as a curse.

608
00:40:47,707 --> 00:40:48,610
We are…

609
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:50,380
not afraid.

610
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:52,970
What are you being so stubborn for?

611
00:40:53,072 --> 00:40:54,747
Give that back.

612
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:57,069
He ruined it.

613
00:41:11,038 --> 00:41:13,433
Thua, did you get this message?

614
00:41:17,313 --> 00:41:21,519
[Don’t protest if you don’t want to be the next victim of the Suppalo curse.]

615
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:22,401
What is this?

616
00:41:22,757 --> 00:41:23,457
I don’t know.

617
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:38,179
Nong, why didn’t you turn the light on?

618
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,142
But I could see just fine.

619
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:44,165
Gosh, I am so tired.

620
00:41:44,422 --> 00:41:45,620
Look at this.

621
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,397
Come on.

622
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,690
It won’t be too long now.

623
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:50,579
Maybe our school will be a better place.

624
00:41:51,906 --> 00:41:52,827
Guys.

625
00:41:52,827 --> 00:41:53,906
What now, Nong?

626
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:55,495
Look at this.

627
00:41:56,228 --> 00:42:02,500
The comments supporting our campaign double from last time, guys.

628
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,976
Oh, I am so glad.

629
00:42:03,976 --> 00:42:06,500
So many people are supporting us.

630
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:13,852
Tomorrow, we’ll make the school reconsider those outdated rules.

631
00:42:15,914 --> 00:42:17,357
Just a little further, guys.

632
00:42:18,607 --> 00:42:19,539
A little further.

633
00:42:19,794 --> 00:42:21,675
Let’s make this worth all the insults from our parents.

634
00:42:22,264 --> 00:42:25,123
Make it worth being unfollowed by so many friends.

635
00:42:25,123 --> 00:42:28,923
Make it worth being a freak in the teachers’ opinions.

636
00:42:30,229 --> 00:42:31,142
I really believe it.

637
00:42:31,584 --> 00:42:32,671
Tomorrow…

638
00:42:34,211 --> 00:42:35,329
will be better than this.

639
00:42:37,627 --> 00:42:38,497
Nian,

640
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:39,905
Nong…

641
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:42,331
Fight or flee?

642
00:42:43,306 --> 00:42:44,456
Fight or flee?

643
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:45,882
Fight!

644
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:47,103
Yes!

645
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:50,289
Nong.

646
00:42:50,289 --> 00:42:51,861
Nun.

647
00:43:50,532 --> 00:43:51,882
[Just because it’s a long-time rule]

648
00:43:51,882 --> 00:43:53,066
[doesn’t mean it should continue.]

649
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,278
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

650
00:44:32,653 --> 00:44:35,814
Is it you who’s brining the Suppalo curse back?

651
00:44:36,253 --> 00:44:37,645
The eclipse is coming.

652
00:44:37,645 --> 00:44:38,812
I don’t want you to get caught up in that curse.

653
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:39,909
How could I?

654
00:44:40,593 --> 00:44:42,129
I just want them to stop.

655
00:44:42,438 --> 00:44:43,718
I don’t want to hurt anybody.

656
00:44:45,189 --> 00:44:47,560
What would you do if someone got killed?

657
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,899
If I can’t do it, everyone will be disappointed in me.

658
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,551
There’s no best way out.
