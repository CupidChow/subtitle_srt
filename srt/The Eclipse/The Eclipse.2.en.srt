4
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:18,690
You, newbie.

5
00:00:20,662 --> 00:00:22,520
Why are you not wearing Suppalo’s school uniform?

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,756
I don’t want to.

7
00:00:23,872 --> 00:00:25,000
But you must.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,078
It's the rule.

9
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:27,699
I’m a prefect.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,480
My duty is to make everyone follow the rules.

11
00:00:30,878 --> 00:00:32,287
I followed the new kid.

12
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:33,884
He was acting so shady.

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,621
An old issue remains unsolved. A new issue arises.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,720
You’ve been following me everywhere.

15
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:40,296
Are you into me, prefect?

16
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:41,308
Shameless,

17
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,147
what’s your goal?

18
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:54,701
Kan,

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,632
do you really need so many stickers?

20
00:00:58,163 --> 00:00:59,585
Of course.

21
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:00,894
All right, then.

22
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:08,247
Honor the uniform, Kan.

23
00:01:08,857 --> 00:01:10,739
Why so many?

24
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:15,320
This is from Praew, a drum major from Nisachon all-girls school.

25
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:20,424
This is from Alice, a volleyball player from Harrow International School.

26
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:25,942
And the one right on my heart is from Khao Tu, the best student in the province.

27
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:28,824
Wow! My friend is just so hot.

28
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:32,924
And you?

29
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:35,173
Aren’t you going on a date with anyone this evening?

30
00:01:35,353 --> 00:01:37,919
I heard a girl sent you a present.

31
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:40,000
I’m not going anywhere.

32
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,569
I’m a student. I came here to study.

33
00:01:42,982 --> 00:01:44,864
Other things are nonsense to me.

34
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:45,799
How dare you!

35
00:01:46,557 --> 00:01:48,746
Are you saying I’m nonsense?

36
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:50,770
I am not.

37
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:56,065
Seriously, don’t you like anyone at all, Akk?

38
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,916
Right.

39
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,259
Tell me.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,269
Speak into the microphone here.

41
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,663
Speak.

42
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:10,272
Open your eyes and see.

43
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:12,760
We’re in an all-boys school.

44
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:14,724
Who would I like?

45
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:15,521
What?

46
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,213
Wat likes the security guard.

47
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:18,016
Right.

48
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:18,684
What the heck?

49
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,212
No?

50
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:26,329
You’ve been following me everywhere.

51
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,618
Are you into me, prefect?

52
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:51,142
What does this statement of Juliet mean?

53
00:03:51,142 --> 00:03:53,407
“He will make the face of heaven so fine.”

54
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:55,542
“That all the world will be in love with night.”

55
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:58,047
“And pay no worship to the garish sun.”

56
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:02,312
It means Juliet is so drunk in love.

57
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,588
She thinks Romeo is her big love.

58
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:07,654
Interesting, Thuaphu.

59
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:09,496
Teacher,

60
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:13,621
have you got your own Romeo yet?

61
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,226
If not,

62
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,400
you can be drunk in love with me.

63
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:24,160
Boo!

64
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,786
I’ve seen lots of terrific comedians end up in terrible tragedy, Kanlong.

65
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:41,145
The time is up.

66
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:43,581
We will continue Romeo & Juliet in the next class.

67
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:45,895
I wish you all happiness with all kinds of love.

68
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,898
Class.

69
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:49,285
Thank you, Teacher.

70
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:53,720
How are you holding up?

71
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:58,623
Teacher Sani just put you in tragedy.

72
00:04:58,623 --> 00:04:59,622
How did you like that?

73
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,880
Teacher Sani isn’t my type.

74
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:05,787
There are lots of girls in my night school.

75
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:07,912
Hey.

76
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,760
The report is done.

77
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,427
You turn it in.

78
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:13,639
Thanks.

79
00:05:18,564 --> 00:05:19,668
And you, Akk?

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Does a quiet man like you talk to lots of girls?

81
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:26,171
I don’t care about that stuff.

82
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:28,213
Are you sure?

83
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,113
You’re so hot.

84
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:32,224
You know nothing, Namo.

85
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:34,218
Akk is a hermit.

86
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:37,163
He will keep his virginity to himself forever.

87
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:41,873
Stop teasing him about this.

88
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:43,035
Poor him.

89
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,869
Is it true you’re a virgin?

90
00:05:51,578 --> 00:05:52,597
Time to make the rounds.

91
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,883
I’m checking the places.

92
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:55,716
Let’s go.

93
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,870
I can go alone.

94
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,158
I’m coming with you. Wait.

95
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:04,493
Is he mad because we said he’s a virgin?

96
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:05,664
I guess so.

97
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:07,547
Good. I’m pretty lazy right now.

98
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,520
[Student Welfare Department]

99
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:34,816
You did very well on the test.

100
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:38,404
But if we are to hire you,

101
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,894
you must take on one more role.

102
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,506
Will you accept that condition?

103
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:45,889
What role?

104
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,821
You will be an assistant in the student welfare department

105
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:50,246
replacing the one who just quit.

106
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:57,690
But I never…

107
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,827
Just follow the instructions of Teacher Chadok,

108
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:02,019
the Head of the Student Welfare Department.

109
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:11,824
You can do it, Sani.

110
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:25,370
Singto.

111
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,633
Singto, yum yum.

112
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:37,175
With dogs, you’re always smiley.

113
00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:43,801
There’s one dog that won't get to see me smile.

114
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:47,187
What are you doing here?

115
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:50,760
Are you here to consult this dog since you started school three weeks late?

116
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,000
Just pet the dog.

117
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,840
Don’t turn into one.

118
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:03,408
Wait a minute.

119
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:05,400
Did you follow me here?

120
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:06,725
What are you planning to do?

121
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:07,906
Ambush me?

122
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:11,995
I’ve got something to ask.

123
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:14,325
What?

124
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:19,276
So you’re…

125
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:22,025
You’re still a virgin?

126
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:24,350
Are you really a virgin?

127
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,005
Shut up!

128
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:29,438
So it’s true.

129
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:36,300
Shut your mouth or I’ll punch it until it bleeds.

130
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:40,073
The same rule applies.

131
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:42,300
You punch me.

132
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:43,750
I…

133
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:48,154
Psychopath.

134

[Student Welfare Department]

135
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,622
Is there anything you need?

136
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:25,945
Nothing.

137
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:29,113
Why are you wearing this?

138
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:30,497
It’s against the rule.

139
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,776
Wearing accessories isn’t permitted either.

140
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:39,963
Are you new?

141

Yes, sir.

142
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:43,434
Take it off.

143
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:46,359
Tell your legal guardian to get it back later.

144

No.

145
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:51,268
Someone I love gave it to me.

146
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,493
Keep it then.

147
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:00,909
But you will be punished.

148

You will be assigned social service.

Yes, sir.

Do you realize what you did is wrong?

00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,096
Are you guys with me?

174
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:33,251
Issues like this remind me of Teacher Dika.

175
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:36,858
If he was still here, he’d be able to deal with those rule breakers.

176
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:38,910
Can we stop talking about that traitor?

177
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,290
I don’t want to hear it.

178
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:27,200
Don’t you even think you can blind people, authoritarian.

179
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,320
You’re violating my rights.

180
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,345
What rights?

181
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:36,314
Guys, can you lend me a hand?

182
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:38,080
Boyfriend?

183
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,039
Guys, our leaflets are all gone.

184
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:06,202
There are also gone from the board upstairs.

185
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:09,272
Are we really being punished by that curse?

186
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,869
Stop it, both of you, Jumnian and Jumnong.

187
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:13,635
The curse, my ass.

188
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:16,215
Of course, the school board wanted them gone.

189
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:18,645
It’s scary anyway.

190
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:21,467
Perhaps…

191
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:24,547
There.

192
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:25,964
Speaking of the devil.

193
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:28,449
Sorry. What does that mean?

194
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:29,700
Meaning the one doing this is here.

195
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:33,898
Don’t you even think you can blind people,

196
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:35,241
authoritarian.

197
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:37,167
We’re not scared of you.

198
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:38,564
Bring it on.

199
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:42,756
And he’s gone.

200
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:44,438
It must be him.

201
00:13:44,438 --> 00:13:45,426
Where are they?

202
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:47,247
I spent hours putting them up.

203
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:48,551
Not ready?

204
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,748
What do you mean not ready?

205
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,685
I gave you guys a week to do the assignment.

206
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:55,818
It’s a team project.

207
00:13:56,105 --> 00:13:58,827
If you can’t handle this small task, what can you do in life?

208
00:14:02,046 --> 00:14:03,068
I’m so sorry, Teacher.

209
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:06,430
As the head of the class, I take full responsibility.

210
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:10,098
If you want to deduct scores, deduct mine.

211
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:14,417
I’m so disappointed in you, Thuaphu.

212
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:17,673
And in all of you.

213
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,354
The students in the best class are so misbehaving.

214
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,193

215
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,454
Thank you, Teacher.

216
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:27,684
Where are you going, ma’am?

217
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:30,138
Ask your friends.

218
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:35,218
Kan, where have you been?

219
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:36,894
And where is the presentation file?

220
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:37,978
Here.

221
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,422
Why didn’t you turn it in for us?

222
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:41,204
The whole class just got scolded.

223
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:42,707
I…

224
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:44,505
Thua took all the blame for you.

225
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:47,714
Don’t be so dramatic.

226
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:49,267
I’m okay.

227
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:52,378
You guys hand me your next assignments.

228
00:14:52,378 --> 00:14:53,318
I’ll turn them in for you.

229
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:57,164
What?

230
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:02,170
I bought you snacks.

231
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:05,581
I know you like them.

232
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:06,652
And they’re pink.

233
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:08,709
I tried and it’s good.

234
00:16:11,226 --> 00:16:12,198
I am sorry.

235
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,676
Tell me why you were late today.

236
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,975
I had a fight with 11th graders.

237
00:16:27,762 --> 00:16:28,738
11th graders?

238
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,478
Are you nuts?

239
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,378
You’re a student prefect.

240
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:34,388
You’re not a bully.

241
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:39,789
What was it all about?

242
00:16:41,597 --> 00:16:42,461
Not your business.

243
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:44,122
I’m going to play football.

244
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,095
He’s not answering.

245
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:53,578
Can I join you?

246
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:54,834
Sure.

247
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:55,552
Come on.

248
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:56,938

You do?

251
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:32,224
Want to smoke so much that you have to do it now?

252
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:35,663
Do you even have evidence?

253
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:37,783
You think I’m that stupid?

254
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,861
You dumped it in the toilet.

255
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,129
The smell is still here.

256
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:44,122
Nice nose.

257
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:47,067
Just like a dog’s nose.

258
00:17:49,163 --> 00:17:50,638
That’s how you speak with your senior?

259

Which class are you in?

260
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:55,498
You don’t need to know which class.

261
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:58,352
But I know your name is Kanlong from class 6/1.

262
00:17:58,352 --> 00:18:00,827
And the head of the class is a fag.

263
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:05,695
What did you just say?

264
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:07,986
Did you just hit my friend?

265
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:09,505
Did you just hit my friend?

266
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,140
Ouch!

267
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,378
He was trying to protect you, Thua.

268
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:24,912
I rushed back to class.

269
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:27,141
I thought he would follow me.

270
00:18:28,238 --> 00:18:30,658
But I guess he went to the infirmary first. That’s why he’s late.

272
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:35,723
Don’t tell anyone about this.

273
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,258
Or Kan might get kicked out of the Prefect Club.

274
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,193
Okay.

275

276

If you want me to share, ask nicely.

277
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,314
I don’t want to hear the music. I’m taking them from you.

278
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:24,181
You’re in a classroom. You can’t use earphones.

279
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,343
But it’s break time. We don’t have class now.

281
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:33,027
Give them back.

282
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:39,987
I’m curious about one thing.

283
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,618
Why did you ask Mr. Sit about the accident and the former student welfare assistant?

284
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,877
None of your business.

The rights to my asset and my body?

288

No. Is Teacher Dika your boyfriend?

00:23:23,715 --> 00:23:27,202
Do you think we students should still wear school uniforms?

342
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:28,581
Are you talking back to me, Ayan?

343
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:31,382
You’re a student. You must abide by textbooks.

344
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:34,927
I agree with you, ma’am.

345
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:57,134
♪ Tired of loving someone secretly? ♪

346
00:23:57,677 --> 00:24:01,926
♪ Tired of missing that person one-sidedly? ♪

347
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,928
♪ I wanted to pretend I didn’t know ♪

348
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:07,617
Oh,

349
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:09,225
 shit!

350
00:24:11,514 --> 00:24:12,673
What the hell happened?

351
00:24:12,673 --> 00:24:13,785
Did you get burnt by hot water?

352
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,858
The Japanese movie by my beloved director is showing in Bangkok.

353
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,791
Do you want to catch it with me?

354
00:24:22,526 --> 00:24:23,472
- No.
- No.

355
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:25,294
I think I’ll pass.

356
00:24:25,428 --> 00:24:28,337
Your favorite movies always put me to sleep.

357
00:24:28,524 --> 00:24:29,538
I don’t get them.

358
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:30,253
True.

359
00:24:30,253 --> 00:24:31,518
We like mass movies.

360
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:34,016
We just can’t relate to indie movies.

361
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:39,077
Are you letting me go by myself?

362
00:24:40,951 --> 00:24:41,632
- Yes.
- Yes.

363
00:24:50,411 --> 00:24:52,140
What an unloyal friend!

364
00:24:52,912 --> 00:24:54,912
You’re not going with me.

365
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:55,590
Go by yourself.

366
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,047
I don’t want to watch it.

367
00:24:58,846 --> 00:24:59,935
Did you just hit me?

368
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:01,243
That’s enough, you assholes.

369
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:02,777
Wat,

370
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:06,018
are you sure you can grab your ticket before Bangkokians?

371
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:17,195
The Country Development Plan by People's Party originated in General Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena’s era.

372
00:25:17,914 --> 00:25:22,163
It gradually evolved into Thai Nationalism Policy under the government of Field Marshal Plaek.

373
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:25,166
Any of you know what he did back then?

374
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,318
Wasuwat!

375
00:25:32,307 --> 00:25:33,384
Are you hearing me?

376
00:25:33,888 --> 00:25:34,513
I am.

377
00:25:36,124 --> 00:25:37,061
Teacher,

378
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:39,870
you are loud and clear.

379
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,791
Of course, he hears you.

380
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,174
Kanlong,

381
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:47,916
People who have been well-educated by their families

382
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:51,267
know they shouldn’t interrupt when adults are not speaking with them.

383
00:25:53,826 --> 00:25:54,619
So?

384
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:57,175
What were Field Marshal Plaek’s policies?

385
00:25:58,531 --> 00:25:59,220
Such as…

386
00:26:00,868 --> 00:26:04,991
the cultural revolution that required the wearing of hats.

387
00:26:05,473 --> 00:26:06,436
Why wearing hats?

388
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:11,545
To symbolize equality?

389
00:26:13,102 --> 00:26:14,294
Equality?

390
00:26:15,613 --> 00:26:17,565
In the ‘Mala Nam Thai’ era?

391
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:27,379
The Mala Nam Thai Plan was established to bring Thais up to the same level of civilization as western nations.

392
00:26:27,614 --> 00:26:31,224
He was a dictator and a nationalist. Why would he want equality?

393
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,727
What is it?

394
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,551
Wat’s answer isn’t wrong.

395
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,890
Not wrong?

396
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:50,290
The rich’s hats and the poor’s hats were made of different materials, to begin with.

397
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,999
Do you think having anything covering the skulls makes everyone equal?

398
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,696
What a dumb answer.

399
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:03,310
It’s true Field Marshal Plaek was a dictator.

400
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:06,024
But he was a member of People’s Party.

401
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:13,009
And we can’t deny that he was against the old power and reclaimed equality for citizens.

402
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:15,183
Stop it, Ayan.

403
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:23,586
Do you think we students should still wear school uniforms?

404
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,824
Of course.

405
00:27:25,134 --> 00:27:26,647
To maintain orderliness.

406
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:28,967
The same goes for wearing hats.

407
00:27:29,672 --> 00:27:31,672
Nothing different to wearing school uniforms.

408
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:36,053
It creates equality and reduces inequality.

409
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,017
More importantly, Teacher,

410
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:42,855
school uniform originated in Field Marshal Plaek’s era,

411
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:45,508
the one you just called a dictator.

412
00:27:45,972 --> 00:27:47,308
Are you talking back to me, Ayan?

413
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:48,340
No.

414
00:27:49,286 --> 00:27:50,898
I’m just sharing the information.

415
00:27:51,204 --> 00:27:55,163
Telling you that historical ideals cannot be summed into a single concept.

416
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,012
Referencing the information I searched here.

417
00:28:05,992 --> 00:28:11,269
Information on the internet where anyone can edit it as they please?

418
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,515
You’re a student. You must abide by textbooks.

419
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:20,883
I agree with you, ma’am.

420
00:28:24,364 --> 00:28:26,364
I think Wasuwat’s answer is wrong.

421
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,308
Ayan’s answer is also wrong.

422
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,479
Since we’re studying from the textbook,

423
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:35,331
we should discuss what’s stated in the textbook.

424
00:28:37,538 --> 00:28:40,404
Textbooks aren’t martial law.

425
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:45,084
And good education should be receptive and open to development.

426
00:28:45,084 --> 00:28:48,599
Not putting us in a frame and judging who is right or wrong.

427
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:49,756
Right, Teacher?

428
00:28:51,404 --> 00:28:52,558
Am I right?

429
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:58,226
I still stand that Wasuwat’s answer is wrong, and so is Ayan’s.

430
00:28:58,226 --> 00:28:59,724
I said stop!

431
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:06,410
I’m not judging who is right or wrong today.

432
00:29:06,629 --> 00:29:13,050
However, you must pair up and do the report on Field Marshal Plaek, which is due next Monday.

433
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:17,596
You must reference at least 15 textbooks.

434
00:29:23,438 --> 00:29:24,415
Class.

435
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,183
Thank you, Teacher.

436
00:29:35,932 --> 00:29:38,184
Are you happy putting everyone in trouble?

437
00:29:50,425 --> 00:29:51,671
What the heck did you do?

438
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:52,425
Hey!

439
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,764
Why did you take the teacher’s side instead of Wat’s?

440
00:29:58,493 --> 00:29:59,741
Do you want the best student title?

441
00:30:00,672 --> 00:30:01,948
Calm down, Kan.

442
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,370
Akk has his reasons.

443
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:07,174
Why are you protecting him?

444
00:30:09,637 --> 00:30:10,474
I’m sorry.

445
00:30:12,495 --> 00:30:14,495
I just didn’t want things to go too far.

446
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:18,650
Kan.

447
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,143
Have you forgotten our rule?

448
00:30:21,698 --> 00:30:26,284
We promised if we had a conflict, we would resolve it the same day.

449
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:27,154
We wouldn’t leave it overnight.

450
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:29,530
I don’t want to talk to him.

451
00:30:30,189 --> 00:30:30,764
Hey!

452
00:30:31,985 --> 00:30:34,528
Akk was helping me.

453
00:30:35,284 --> 00:30:38,486
He was making Teacher Waree think she had a backup.

454
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:42,273
You know people her age hate to lose faces.

455
00:30:42,684 --> 00:30:43,910
It’s a big deal.

456
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:49,280
Is that true, Akk?

457
00:30:51,478 --> 00:30:52,101
Um.

458
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,992
He was trying to help, and so was Ayan.

459
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:00,764
But they chose different methods.

460
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:07,510
So you’re willing to be the bad guy just to protect your classmates?

461
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:10,527
Damn you!

462
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:16,548
Come to think of it,

463
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,866
Aye was pretty cool.

464
00:31:19,636 --> 00:31:21,636
He was totally talking back to Aunt Waree.

465
00:31:23,122 --> 00:31:25,122
Not as cool as Akk, my dear friend.

466
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:27,621
Right, Akk, my beloved friend?

467
00:31:32,372 --> 00:31:33,431
I’m sorry.

468
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:41,406
Why didn’t tell me earlier?

469
00:31:58,146 --> 00:31:59,370
What are you doing with my jacket?

470
00:32:06,714 --> 00:32:07,756
What’s wrong, Big Foot?

471
00:32:08,415 --> 00:32:09,373
You’re tense.

472
00:32:09,882 --> 00:32:10,644
Ouch!

473
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:13,007
You want it now, Shortstop?

474
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:14,387
Yes, Big Foot.

475
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:16,352
If you don’t stop, I’ll kick your ass.

476
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:06,532
What are you doing with my jacket?

477
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:14,153
I was wondering if you forgot it and if I should keep it for you.

478
00:33:16,943 --> 00:33:18,943
Why did you leave your belongings unattended?

479
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:26,763
Drink up.

480
00:33:27,153 --> 00:33:28,204
Singto, do you want some?

481
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:29,173
Singto.

482
00:33:30,163 --> 00:33:31,225
Singto.

483
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:32,844
Singto.

484
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,502
Do you want this?

485
00:33:33,502 --> 00:33:34,127
Singto.

486
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:37,353
Are you finished?

487
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:40,699
The dog doesn’t want it so it’s yours.

488
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:42,058
You eat it.

489
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:43,461
Singto.

490
00:33:44,765 --> 00:33:45,892
Show the dog how to eat.

491
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,963
You do it.

492
00:34:01,061 --> 00:34:02,061
Why are you looking at me?

493
00:34:04,452 --> 00:34:05,452
Say what you want.

494
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:11,494
Nothing.

495
00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:15,794
The dog is pretty cute,

496
00:34:17,654 --> 00:34:18,645
wouldn’t you say?

497
00:34:26,162 --> 00:34:27,413
Hey, wait.

498
00:35:06,757 --> 00:35:09,034
Why do I need to do the report with a nerd like you?

499
00:35:24,044 --> 00:35:24,846
Next time,

500
00:35:25,595 --> 00:35:27,714
do not protect me like that again.

501
00:35:28,314 --> 00:35:29,404
I’m used to it.

502
00:35:30,314 --> 00:35:32,867
I don’t care if they want to bully me.

503
00:35:36,215 --> 00:35:38,215
I just don’t want to see you get hurt again.

504
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:57,836
Let’s begin.

505
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:21,876
Ayan,

506
00:36:23,874 --> 00:36:24,913
where are you going?

507
00:36:26,815 --> 00:36:27,817
What is it, sir?

508
00:36:28,034 --> 00:36:31,085
You must take makeup tests to catch up with your friends, got it?

509
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:33,885
And you can’t remember a damn technique.

510
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:36,744
Guys,

511
00:36:37,517 --> 00:36:41,659
I need a volunteer to train and help him learn.

512
00:36:50,735 --> 00:36:51,938
I volunteer, sir.

513
00:36:54,064 --> 00:36:54,795
Yeah.

514
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,523
I knew you’d volunteer, Akk.

515
00:36:57,046 --> 00:37:00,592
This evening, you two practice the basic techniques you just learned.

516
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,731
Come here.

517
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,428
Hold here.

518
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:14,702
The other hand.

519
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,928
That’s it?

520
00:37:18,928 --> 00:37:19,706
Yes.

521
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,142
Bastard.

522
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,262
Do you need to throw me so hard?

523
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:31,713
Stay focused.

524
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:35,014
I’m focused.

525
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,181
Get up.

526
00:37:43,874 --> 00:37:44,600
Up.

527
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:50,550
Come here.

528
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:52,350
Come closer.

529
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:56,485
You throw me this time.

530
00:37:57,886 --> 00:37:58,752
Do it.

531
00:37:59,179 --> 00:37:59,942
Okay.

532
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:01,566
Right position.

533
00:38:05,272 --> 00:38:05,961
Go on.

534
00:38:06,154 --> 00:38:06,985
I’ll go now.

535
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:07,485
Go.

536
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:15,697
That’s all you got?

537
00:38:29,634 --> 00:38:30,999
You’re weak, Shortstop.

538
00:38:34,883 --> 00:38:35,893
Will you let me go?

539
00:38:36,376 --> 00:38:37,076
No.

540
00:38:38,278 --> 00:38:39,988
I said let me go.

541
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,752
If you want to be free, try to squirm free.

542
00:38:43,002 --> 00:38:44,132
Suppose you can do it.

543
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:57,311
What’s wrong, Big Foot?

544
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,328
You’re tense.

545
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:03,510
Hm?

546
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:08,503
I’m taking off.

547
00:39:08,962 --> 00:39:10,503
Just realized I’ve got something to do.

548
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:20,085
Why do you slouch?

549
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:28,604
If you don’t want to, you don’t need to help me.

550
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,074
I don’t want anyone in the class to fail

551
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:32,975
or our average score will be less than other classes.

552
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:37,419
Can I borrow your shampoo?

553
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:38,634
I forgot to bring mine.

554
00:39:45,878 --> 00:39:46,708
Shower gel too.

555
00:39:47,312 --> 00:39:48,482
I haven’t used it yet.

556
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,491
I know.

557
00:39:50,491 --> 00:39:51,166
Come on.

558
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:59,694
Ouch!

559
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,206
You want it now, Shortstop?

560
00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:03,935
Yes, Big Foot.

561
00:40:05,457 --> 00:40:06,600
Yes what?

562
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,573
You asked if I wanted it.

563
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:09,852
I said yes.

564
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,674
Should I go into your room right now?

565
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:13,688
No.

566
00:40:14,268 --> 00:40:15,973
f you don’t stop, I’ll kick your ass.

567
00:40:15,973 --> 00:40:17,100
Just take a shower.

568
00:40:26,446 --> 00:40:29,968
You’re tough on the outside.

569
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:31,804
But on the inside…

570
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,246
Will you stop or not?

571
00:40:38,874 --> 00:40:41,078
I know you came to mess with my school.

572
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:46,238
But your method isn’t working on me.

573
00:40:47,601 --> 00:40:48,188
Yeah?

574
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:49,166
Yeah.

575
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:24,702
Why did you even volunteer to help him, Akk?

576
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:36,167
We are students, not prisoners.
[Students are not prisoners.]

577
00:41:36,615 --> 00:41:38,615
No to school uniform.

578
00:41:38,615 --> 00:41:40,308
Give us back the freedom.

579
00:41:40,308 --> 00:41:41,713
Give us back our rights.

580
00:41:41,713 --> 00:41:43,183
No to school uniform.

581
00:41:43,183 --> 00:41:44,769
Give us back the freedom.

582
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:45,827
Give us back our rights.

583
00:41:45,827 --> 00:41:46,841
Give back!

584
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:47,865
Give us back!

585
00:41:47,865 --> 00:41:48,589
Hey.

586
00:41:49,035 --> 00:41:50,383
Why are you guys making noise?

587
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:52,546
It’s break time.

588
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:56,375
Because it’s break time, we’re making a statement now.

589
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:58,504
We’re not bothering any class.

590
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:00,184
Right.

591
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:02,425
And we have the right, don’t we?

592
00:42:03,342 --> 00:42:05,342
But you are violating the others’ rights.

593
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:07,834
I don’t think we are.

594
00:42:08,098 --> 00:42:10,581
Kan, Wat, take them.

595
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:12,911
Hey, what are you doing?

596
00:42:12,911 --> 00:42:14,131
These are ours.

597
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,926
You have no right to do this.

598
00:42:15,926 --> 00:42:16,611
Give that back.

599
00:42:16,611 --> 00:42:17,748
Stop causing trouble.

600
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:21,794
If you aren’t scared of us, be scared of the curse.

601
00:42:21,794 --> 00:42:24,376
But you don’t have the right to take our stuff.

602
00:42:24,924 --> 00:42:25,858
We do.

603
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:27,474
We are student prefects.

604
00:42:27,474 --> 00:42:28,461
We have the right.

605
00:42:38,571 --> 00:42:40,474
Don’t you butt in, Ayan.

606
00:42:47,074 --> 00:42:48,554
Let’s call it a day.

607
00:42:48,675 --> 00:42:49,832
This is enough to make their heads spin.

608
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:51,345
Sure.

609
00:42:54,103 --> 00:42:56,103
Nong, Nian, that’s it for today.

610
00:42:56,103 --> 00:42:56,801
Let’s go.

611
00:42:57,212 --> 00:42:58,185
Wait.

612
00:42:58,741 --> 00:42:59,985
May I have that back, please?

613
00:43:00,112 --> 00:43:00,832
May I?

614
00:43:00,832 --> 00:43:01,637
Thank you.

615
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:11,926
What did you speak to them?

616
00:43:12,602 --> 00:43:14,448
I spoke a normal human language.

617
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:17,925
Not a power-crazed language like yours.

618
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,702
Take it from here, guys.

619
00:43:33,255 --> 00:43:34,035
Hey!

620
00:43:34,252 --> 00:43:35,472
Time to go.

621
00:43:35,472 --> 00:43:37,080
Back to class.

622
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,197
To your classes.

623
00:43:45,169 --> 00:43:45,957
Ayan.

624
00:43:47,914 --> 00:43:49,319
What’s your deal with them?

625
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:49,922
Reveal it.

626
00:43:51,731 --> 00:43:56,702
You really want to know about that or want to have some alone time with me?

627
00:43:57,741 --> 00:43:59,234
What a narcissist.

628
00:43:59,662 --> 00:44:01,517
Who would want to be close to you?

629
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:02,273
Why not?

630
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:05,190
What can be a problem if you’re close to me?

631
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:23,995
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

632
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:29,036
It’s time we intensify our protest.

633
00:44:29,387 --> 00:44:34,594
I’m going to wreck Suppalo and they’ll make up for the shit they did, Uncle.

634
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:40,624
I came to warn you to watch out for Aye.

635
00:44:43,594 --> 00:44:46,488
Are you afraid to be alone with me?

636
00:44:46,488 --> 00:44:49,517
When you’re beat, you’re pretty cute.
