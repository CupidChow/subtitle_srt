1
00:00:18,623 --> 00:00:26,027
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

2
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:29,430
The protest video in our school is now on the internet.

3
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,731
People are tweeting about it.

4
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:36,482
Do you realize how damaging this could be to our reputation?

5
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:39,122
From now on, if you see students using their phones in school,

6
00:00:39,262 --> 00:00:40,283
take it from them.

7
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:43,891
Got it?

8
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:48,679
Then I’m gonna need to send them a sign saying their threat didn’t work.

9
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:51,704
It’s time we intensify our protest.

10
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:52,456
Fight!

11
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:55,773
We demand the bad guys to be punished.

12
00:00:55,773 --> 00:00:57,501
If they don’t go themselves, move them.

13
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:03,591
I attended the meeting in the city for a few hours.

14
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:04,956
How did you let it happen?

15
00:01:04,956 --> 00:01:06,839
I will deal with this as soon as possible, sir.

16
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:08,423
Give us one more chance, Teacher.

17
00:01:08,423 --> 00:01:09,786
What are you going to do?

18
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,001
I’m going to find the evidence and expose him.

19
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,495
Wait and see.

20
00:02:01,673 --> 00:02:05,467
I’m going to find the evidence and expose his plan to ruin our school.

21
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:08,840
If I find it, he’ll be expelled.

22
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:10,872
Where will you find it?

23
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,717
Aren’t you taking a shower?

24
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:42,951
You go ahead.

25
00:02:43,307 --> 00:02:45,000
I’ll just cool down a bit more.

26
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,596
You want a problem?

27
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:11,547
You didn’t close your locker properly.

28
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:14,206
The notebook was falling. I just stored it for you.

29
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:14,943
Yeah?

30
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:17,865
Move. I’m going to take a shower.

31
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,191
Hey!

32
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:36,513
Why are you here?

33
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,450
Were you stealing my stuff there?

34
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,311
I said no.

35
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,033
Get out.

36
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:43,521
People might get the wrong idea if they see us.

37
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:45,887
It’s normal for two male friends to take a shower together.

38
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:47,684
Haven’t you done it?

39
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,785
I do it with close friends only.

40
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:51,021
You’re not.

41
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:52,793
I don’t want to be close to dummies like you guys.

42
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:54,101
Then get out.

43
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:55,814
That’s my stuff.

44
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,000
Get your stuff and go.

45
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:32,128
Yes.

46
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,491
I have received complaints from teachers and many students

47
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:57,574
about the misbehaviors of the new student named Ayan.

48
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:03,168
I knew this student was going to be reported one day.

49
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,360
Is he the one who transferred from Parot School?

50
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,136
He is.

51
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:12,254
He likes to raise troubling questions in class.

52
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:14,664
I didn’t realize the other teachers are facing the same issue.

53
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:15,351
Yes.

54
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:17,204
We all are.

55
00:06:17,497 --> 00:06:19,404
I suppose it’s a trend for the new generation.

56
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:26,196
You mean the trend of being arrogant, aggressive, inappropriately know-it-all?

57
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:28,970
You speak our minds, Teacher Waree.

58
00:06:30,527 --> 00:06:32,876
What do you require us to do, Teacher Chadok?

59
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:36,389
We are teachers.

60
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,950
Of course, we need to give him some polishing.

61
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:41,239
Right?

62
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:45,000
For a student with high self-confidence like Ayan,

63
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:47,851
we must show him that

64
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:51,734
behind an able man, there are always other able men

65
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,876
[The way of thinking of philosophers in the 18th century.]

66
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:02,881
From what we studied,

67
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:11,110
can anyone name any well-known philosophers in the 18th century?

68
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:12,731
Ayan.

69
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,537
Answer that.

70
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:24,342
Thomas Hobbes.

71
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:26,497
What’s his ideal?

72
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:31,831
You only know the name. You didn’t really study.

73
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,719
Every human has the liberty and the freedom to engage in any activity

74
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:44,481
that produces disorder.

75
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:48,092
Therefore, they agree to find themselves the ruler

76
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:51,778
in order to bring peace to society.

77
00:07:53,841 --> 00:08:00,000
Which means there must be the ruler and those who are ruled.

78
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,140
That’s the nature of society.

79
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:03,744
Sit down.

80
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:07,838
Sit back down. Why are you standing?

81
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:15,189
But the ruler in Hobbes’s opinion must come from the power that is given by the people.

82
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,659
Not by force.

83
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:21,850
I didn’t ask.

84
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:26,486
If you want to answer that much,

85
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:29,866
tell me what Montesquieu’s principle is.

86
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,815
The separation of powers into three branches,

87
00:08:33,823 --> 00:08:37,788
The Legislative Branch, the Executive Branch, and the Judicial Branch.

88
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,875
What about John Locke?

89
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:43,289
You can’t answer it.

90
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:56,999
Freedom and liberty are fundamental human rights that all humans are born with.

91
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:59,551
That’s his ideal.

92
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:06,222
You’re interesting, Ayan.

93
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:14,288
Having a student like you in class makes the class a lot livelier.

94
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:18,420
I guess we need to do questions and answers like this more often.

95
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:26,894
What are the synonyms of the word ‘Phra Arthit?’ (The sun)

96
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:28,357
Ayan.

97
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:33,881
Suriya, Tinakorn, Tiwakorn.

98
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:36,308
And the synonyms of ‘The moon?’

99
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:38,141
Ayan, answer it.

100
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:43,185
Is substance X's boiling point higher than that of substances Y and Z?

101
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:45,163
Yes, it is.

102
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,483
And why is substance X soluble in water?

103
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:51,121
Can I answer that?

104
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:54,377
So, Ayan?

105
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:00,000
The teachers were so harsh on Aye today.

106
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:01,376
Right.

107
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,835
I laughed at first.

108
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,153
He’s so cocky. I thought he deserved it.

109
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:09,564
But the old lads wouldn’t stop.

110
00:10:09,955 --> 00:10:11,769
Now I feel guilty I laughed.

111
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:17,815
Do you think someone is behind this hardship on Aye?

112
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:24,074
I don’t know.

113
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:27,604
You guys go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.

114
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:29,164
Yeah.

115
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,334
Hi, Akk.

116
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:36,719
Hello, sir.

117
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:44,689
I’d like to ask you a question, sir.

118
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:46,163
What is it?

119
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,868
Do you know about Ayan being tested in class by all the teachers?

120
00:10:58,412 --> 00:10:59,470
You do?

121
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:02,100
We’re giving him a chance.

122
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:04,212
If he can adjust,

123
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:07,255
he will be one of the Suppalos completely.

124
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:09,093
If not,

125
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:12,312
then he will know he doesn't belong here.

126
00:11:13,124 --> 00:11:13,752
But…

127
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:14,775
Why but, Akk?

128
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:16,973
What’s the matter with you?

129
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:20,957
Or you’ve been brainwashed by Ayan too?

130
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:24,468
No, sir.

131
00:11:25,097 --> 00:11:25,893
Akk.

132
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,348
We have Suppalo guidelines and rules to follow.

133
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:30,825
Keep that in mind.

134
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:34,889
Yes, sir.

135
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:48,079
Are you so in love with me?

136
00:11:48,522 --> 00:11:49,889
You keep staring at my face.

137
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:52,688
Nonsense.

138
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,014
You knew about it, didn’t you?

139
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,929
About what?

140
00:11:55,524 --> 00:11:57,314
About the teachers picking on me.

141
00:11:58,411 --> 00:11:59,464
Aye.

142
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,391
I have no clue what you’re doing.

143
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,061
But if I were you,

144
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:06,284
I’d stop.

145
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,540
- Or…
- I won’t stop.

146
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:55,656
Ayan.

147
00:12:57,324 --> 00:12:58,008
Answer it.

148
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:09,339
You do know?

149
00:13:10,362 --> 00:13:11,850
We’re giving him a chance.

150
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:14,200
If he can adjust,

151
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,053
he will be one of the Suppalos completely.

152
00:13:18,024 --> 00:13:18,895
If not,

153
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,231
then he will know he doesn't belong here.

154
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:51,279
Are you so in love with me?

155
00:13:53,324 --> 00:13:54,835
You keep staring at my face.

156
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:57,337
Nonsense.

157
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,535
You knew about it, didn’t you?

158
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:21,576
About what?

159
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,135
About the teachers picking on me.

160
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,036
How would I know?

161
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:36,827
Yeah?

162
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:42,999
This is not you at all.

163
00:14:45,326 --> 00:14:47,039
You normally don’t yield easily.

164
00:14:48,503 --> 00:14:50,503
Why did you let them do that much to you?

165
00:14:58,017 --> 00:14:59,802
It’s the only way to know

166
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:06,406
how your school dealt with someone who disagreed.

167
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,760
Who are you talking about?

168
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,968
Who did this school deal with?

169
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:14,494
No one.

170
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,228
I’m just saying.

171
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,889
Tell me.

172
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:19,203
Stop talking.

173
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:20,620
I’m tired.

174
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,452
You won’t be so mean to me too, right?

175
00:16:58,862 --> 00:17:01,759
(I don’t want it anymore. You take it.)

176
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:25,022
Yes, Mom.

177
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:27,488
Yes.

178
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,769
Sure.

179
00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:33,319
Hey.

180
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:35,725
Are you okay there?

181
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,652
Still in school?

182
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:40,724
Yeah.

183
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,592
Your mom isn’t picking you up?

184
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:45,042
You want a lift?

185
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:46,251
It’s okay.

186
00:17:46,969 --> 00:17:48,552
She has to run an errand.

187
00:17:48,892 --> 00:17:49,874
My dad will come instead.

188
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:51,789
Oh!

189
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:54,395
Your dad who’s an alumnus here as those guys said?

190
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:56,578
Um.

191
00:17:57,648 --> 00:18:00,007
He wanted me to go here, like him.

192
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:07,052
Are you okay?

193
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:09,087
I am.

194
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:11,725
Are you though?

195
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,862
Tough day today.

196
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:17,963
Pretty tough.

197
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,696
But I’m…

198
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:22,797
okay now.

199
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,159
Aye.

200
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,947
I have no clue what you’re doing.

201
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,722
But if I were you,

202
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:37,001
I’d stop.

203
00:18:42,903 --> 00:18:44,167
- Or…
- I won’t stop.

204
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:47,964
Fine.

205
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,172
Be careful then.

206
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:53,521
Bye now.

207
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:55,688
Thua.

208
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:58,587
Don’t forget our appointment this Sat.

209
00:19:00,883 --> 00:19:01,545
Um.

210
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:09,251
Why am I even doing this?

211
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:11,874
Just do it. It’s one way to help our school.

212
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:18,833
Follow him.

213
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,425
Who do you think he’s meeting?

214
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:21,956
The World Remembers gang?

215
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:25,213
Maybe he’s afraid of being watched in school.

216
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,041
That’s why he’s meeting them outside.

217
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:29,897
I think they’re planning the next protest.

218
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:33,461
Planning the protest in a coffee shop?

219
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:35,285
Isn’t it weird?

220
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:38,178
Maybe he’s meeting his lover.

221
00:19:59,858 --> 00:20:02,693
Without those protesters, this place looks like a school again.
[STUDENT PREFECT CLUB]

222
00:20:03,464 --> 00:20:06,706
They were threatened and punished by Teacher Chadok.

223
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,731
I think they’ve learned the lesson now.

224
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:13,699
If nobody messes with their heads again, things should be peaceful.

225
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:15,949
No one will.

226
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,082
Ayan was done pretty bad.

227
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,540
But let me guess.

228
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:24,013
The gang was dealt with already.

229
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:27,141
The teachers’ next target should be Aye.

230
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:29,857
That method won't work.

231
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:33,670
Why did you hit the table?

232
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,494
What method do you suggest?

233
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:39,431
I don’t know yet.

234
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:44,165
But if we know why he joined this school, we might know how to handle him.

235
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:50,781
I know it.

236
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:53,954
We found nothing because we only follow him inside school.

237
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,939
What if we follow him outside school?

238
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:00,937
Like when you went to his house yesterday?

239
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:01,963
Yes.

240
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,121
But we’re following him every day, weekdays and weekends.

241
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:06,322
What about public holidays?

242
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:07,480
That too.

243
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:12,083
Are you guys free this weekend?

244
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:17,050
I have the Indie Movie Festival to get to.

245
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,188
I already bought the ticket.

246
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:19,500
Sorry, man.

247
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:20,994
You got away with it.

248
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:24,098
It’s down to you now, Kan.

249
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,506
Don’t look at me. I have tutoring classes.

250
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,625
Are you my friend, Kan?

251
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:36,859
Don’t drag our friendship into this.

252
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,136
I really do have extra school.

253
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,886
I need to take care of the girls as well.

254
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:41,747
Please.

255
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
Kan, my dear friend.

256
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:47,703
Wat, my beloved friend.

257
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,715
Yes, Mom.

258
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:10,049
How are you doing, Aye?

259
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:12,094
Good.

260
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:14,621
What is it?

261
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:19,819
I saw the news about the protest in your school.

262
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:23,404
People won’t stop sharing about it in the parents' group chat.

263
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,717
You don’t take any part in it, do you?

264
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:28,514
The protest happened before I joined.

265
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:31,059
Because the system is broken.

266
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:36,075
Without me, this thing will happen eventually.

267
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:36,761
Aye,

268
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:39,058
I think this is too risky.

269
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,192
Stop it.

270
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:43,756
Don’t get involved with it anymore. Let it go.

271
00:22:44,284 --> 00:22:45,129
No.

272
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,707
I won’t let Uncle Di die for nothing.

273
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:03,619
Why am I even doing this?

274
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:06,327
Just do it. It’s one way to help our school.

275
00:23:06,944 --> 00:23:08,099
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

276
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:11,573
There. He’s leaving.

277
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,535
Follow him.

278
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:24,597
Come on. We might lose him.

279
00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:25,620
I know.

280
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,307
Who do you think he’s meeting?

281
00:23:49,442 --> 00:23:50,665
The World Remembers gang?

282
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:54,833
Maybe he’s afraid of being watched in school.

283
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,587
That’s why he’s meeting them outside.

284
00:23:59,677 --> 00:24:01,677
I think they’re planning the next protest.

285
00:24:03,306 --> 00:24:06,458
Planning the protest in a coffee shop?

286
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:08,157
Isn’t it weird?

287
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,930
Maybe he’s meeting his lover.

288
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:13,943
I’m curious now.

289
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:16,251
Let’s go.

290
00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:17,283
All right.

291
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:24,223
Welcome to Café for All.

292
00:24:24,223 --> 00:24:25,447
Hi, Aye.

293
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,600
Welcome.

294
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,540
Hello, Golf.

295
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,389
Hello.

296
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:30,431
The ones you’re meeting are here.

297
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:32,602
Alright.

298
00:24:32,602 --> 00:24:33,668
Thank you, Golf.

299
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,367
Hi, Mom.

300
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:37,233
Hi

301
00:24:37,654 --> 00:24:38,759
Did I keep you waiting?

302
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,705
Not at all.

303
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:44,271
Welcome.

304
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:50,379
Welcome to the café of diversity.

305
00:24:51,107 --> 00:24:51,835
Yes.

306
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,347
That’s a long name.

307
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:55,284
Your first time here, isn’t it?

308
00:24:55,758 --> 00:24:56,407
Yes.

309
00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:57,853
It is.

310
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:01,116
The first time is usually exciting.

311
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:01,870
It’s normal.

312
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:03,779
You can go pick your seats.

313
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:06,539
And the staff will take your orders shortly.

314
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,693
Sure.

315
00:25:07,828 --> 00:25:08,538
Please.

316
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,924
Thank you.

317
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:13,937
Wow!

318
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:16,608
It is indeed the café of diversity.

319
00:25:17,802 --> 00:25:18,524
Right.

320
00:25:18,908 --> 00:25:19,597
Hey,

321
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,491
if we stay on, will we be stereotyped too?

322
00:25:23,206 --> 00:25:24,164
Let’s leave.

323
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:26,291
Kan, hold on.

324
00:25:26,823 --> 00:25:29,884
If you leave now, you won’t know who Ayan is meeting.

325
00:25:32,255 --> 00:25:33,100
Come on.

326
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,250
There.

327
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:41,647
Thua.

328
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:43,350
Hide.

329
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,919
The café is really cute.

330
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,170
It’s so comfortable in here.

331
00:25:57,837 --> 00:25:58,843
It is, Mom.

332
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:01,026
Glad you and Thuaphu like it.

333
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:05,499
How are you doing in the new school?

334
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:06,678
Must be quite tough to adjust.

335
00:26:08,281 --> 00:26:09,628
Not at all.

336
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,139
Thuaphu helps a lot.

337
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,887
Thuaphu is always a helper.

338
00:26:19,906 --> 00:26:21,567
He really is a great man, Mom.

339
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:27,473
But he likes to keep what he feels inside

340
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,197
just to make other people comfortable.

341
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:33,812
Aye.

342
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:39,456
And he’s playing a hero.

343
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:40,173
Kan,

344
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,767
be quiet.

345
00:26:42,286 --> 00:26:43,259
Thua,

346
00:26:44,256 --> 00:26:46,098
whatever you think or feel,

347
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:49,100
you can talk to your mom.

348
00:26:54,673 --> 00:26:56,063
Is it about Dad?

349
00:26:58,523 --> 00:26:59,859
No, Mom.

350
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:01,731
It’s nothing.

351
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,236
Aye is just rambling.

352
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,030
Ever since I remarried,

353
00:27:09,888 --> 00:27:13,098
I’ve never seen you express any feelings.

354
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:14,568
I thought…

355
00:27:15,672 --> 00:27:17,792
nothing was wrong.

356
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:20,230
Nothing is wrong, Mom.

357
00:27:21,385 --> 00:27:22,427
Dad is…

358
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:26,049
nice to me.

359
00:27:28,173 --> 00:27:31,347
But…it’s his method, isn’t it?

360
00:27:33,477 --> 00:27:35,816
He is so different from your real dad, isn’t he?

361
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:43,521
I know my son is patient and strong.

362
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,577
But you have the right to express your feelings.

363
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:58,778
No matter how busy I am,

364
00:28:02,863 --> 00:28:04,583
if it’s about you,

365
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:07,844
I will always listen.

366
00:28:09,094 --> 00:28:10,304
Do you understand?

367
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:11,282
I do.

368
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:16,141
Thank you, Aye,

369
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:18,682
for finding a way to tell me about this.

370
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,902
Of course.

371
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:26,139
I’m so sorry if I crossed the line.

372
00:28:29,148 --> 00:28:30,186
It’s totally okay.

373
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,789
I know you meant well to Thuaphu.

374
00:28:40,945 --> 00:28:44,571
Should I cancel my appointment so that we can continue chatting?

375
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:46,726
Please don’t.

376
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,094
You’ve got work to do.

377
00:28:48,452 --> 00:28:50,859
We can continue this at home.

378
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,050
Are you sure?

379
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,090
Please look after him.

380
00:29:00,264 --> 00:29:01,085
Of course.

381
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:09,377
Thua must have felt very uneasy.

382
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,593
Right.

383
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,519
Did he tell you anything at all?

384
00:29:27,656 --> 00:29:28,614
Are you okay?

385
00:29:29,562 --> 00:29:30,965
I am.

386
00:29:33,183 --> 00:29:36,267
I thought it was going to be the end of the world at first.

387
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,004
I’m so relieved now.

388
00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:46,717
Drink up.

389
00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:48,339
They serve really good stuff here.

390
00:29:48,837 --> 00:29:49,669
Agree.

391
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,860
Really good.

392
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:55,348
Do you come here a lot?

393
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,120
Yes.

394
00:30:04,556 --> 00:30:08,769
Someone close to me used to take me here a lot.

395
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:11,764
Used to?

396
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:15,416
You guys aren’t close anymore?

397
00:30:23,795 --> 00:30:24,739
He’s dead.

398
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:28,347
I’m sorry.

399
00:30:30,254 --> 00:30:31,130
It’s fine.

400
00:30:34,829 --> 00:30:36,659
Are you going anywhere after this?

401
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:42,058
Yes.

402
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:49,917
Teacher.

403
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:52,233
May I please talk to you?

404
00:30:52,975 --> 00:30:53,898
About what?

405
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:57,059
About Ayan.

406
00:30:58,669 --> 00:30:59,432
Hey.

407
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:02,299
What did you just say to Aunt Waree?

408
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:03,819
Are you following me?

409
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,739
Just like when you and Kan were following me on Saturday,

410
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,749
You’re wrong.

411
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:09,028
I didn’t follow you.

412
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,564
Hey.

413
00:31:11,106 --> 00:31:12,282
Just confess already.

414
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:16,797
Hey, look out!

415
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:10,430
Remember this, Aye.

416
00:33:11,203 --> 00:33:12,532
You’re special.

417
00:33:13,621 --> 00:33:15,621
Don’t even think you have no one.

418
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:18,364
You'll always have me.

419
00:33:58,506 --> 00:33:59,587
Thua.

420
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:01,788
Hey, Kan.

421
00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:04,467
You skipped class too?

422
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,229
Yeah.

423
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:07,648
Just one day.

424
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:11,060
Are you here by yourself?

425
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:13,386
I came with my mom.

426
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:15,721
But she already left for work.

427
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:21,809
Come on.

428
00:34:22,825 --> 00:34:23,731
Let’s go for a walk.

429
00:34:25,907 --> 00:34:26,646
Yeah.

430
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:33,044
Hey.

431
00:34:33,044 --> 00:34:33,865
What?

432
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,407
Let’s have some ice cream.

433
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:37,795
Ice cream?

434
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,373
Why are you in the mood?

435
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,501
Oh, just come.

436
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,291
Are you still mad at me?

437
00:34:52,395 --> 00:34:53,505
I’m not mad at you.

438
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,861
Then why don’t you talk to me these days?

439
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,713
Because you’re uncomfortable when I’m around.

440
00:35:01,672 --> 00:35:02,345
I…

441
00:35:02,345 --> 00:35:03,237
I get it.

442
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:10,246
You don’t like people to judge you just like when they judge me.

443
00:35:23,356 --> 00:35:24,077
Thua.

444
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:25,574
Yeah?

445
00:35:26,705 --> 00:35:29,769
Whatever problem you have, you can always talk to me.

446
00:35:43,915 --> 00:35:45,359
Damn it! It’s melting.

447
00:35:46,118 --> 00:35:47,111
You should eat fast.

448
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:50,173
Do it.

449
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:52,621
Whoa! I can’t stop it now.

450
00:35:53,954 --> 00:35:55,664
Here. Let me wipe it.

451
00:36:05,735 --> 00:36:06,711
Damn.

452
00:36:09,556 --> 00:36:12,466
My mom said my dad still complains about me skipping extra school.

453
00:36:13,348 --> 00:36:14,792
They’re just complaining.

454
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,747
They love you so much anyway.

455
00:36:16,863 --> 00:36:18,404
That’s why they spoil you like this.

456
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:31,589
Do you think Thua and Aye are so close?

457
00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:35,174
How would I know?

458
00:36:38,854 --> 00:36:41,072
You followed Aye today. What did you get?

459
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,627
Did he meet up with The World Remembers?

460
00:36:45,722 --> 00:36:46,604
No.

461
00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:48,772
He didn’t meet anyone.

462
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,976
He just placed a white rose at the edge of the cliff.

463
00:36:53,038 --> 00:36:53,913
Why?

464
00:36:55,944 --> 00:36:57,069
I don’t know.

465
00:36:57,958 --> 00:36:59,958
Does a white rose ring any bell though?

466
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:09,632
- Teacher Dika.
- Teacher Dika.

467
00:37:10,551 --> 00:37:12,201
I remember now.

468
00:37:12,518 --> 00:37:14,349
Teacher Dika likes white roses.

469
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:16,542
I saw him have the white rose pot behind his desk until…

470
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:18,340
Until he moved to Parot school.

471
00:37:23,688 --> 00:37:26,679
How are Aye and Teacher Dika connected?

472
00:37:28,718 --> 00:37:31,081
I used to think they were dating.

473
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:33,679
And Aye joined our school to get revenge for his boyfriend.

474
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:37,209
You’ve been watching too many soap operas, Akk?

475
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:39,361
That plot is really crappy.

476
00:37:40,575 --> 00:37:41,463
Hold on.

477
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:46,032
What if Teacher Dika was the one who took him to the café?

478
00:37:50,158 --> 00:37:52,400
But Aye said that person was dead.

479
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,199
Right.

480
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:21,301
Teacher.

481
00:38:27,922 --> 00:38:29,146
May I please talk to you?

482
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:30,502
About what?

483
00:38:34,494 --> 00:38:35,938
About Ayan.

484
00:38:39,802 --> 00:38:42,044
He’s been behaving lately.

485
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,150
May I please ask you to stop punishing him like that?

486
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,096
What did you say?

487
00:38:50,373 --> 00:38:55,927
I’d like to ask if The Prefect Club can watch his behavior instead.

488
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:57,157
Can we?

489
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:03,941
Actually, I don’t want to punish Ayan that badly.

490
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:08,841
Are you sure you can have him under control?

491
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:10,827
I am.

492
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:12,468
I must do it.

493
00:39:16,696 --> 00:39:17,876
He’s your duty then.

494
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,654
Thank you, ma’am.

495
00:39:34,934 --> 00:39:35,572
Hey.

496
00:39:36,805 --> 00:39:38,505
What did you just say to Aunt Waree?

497
00:39:40,763 --> 00:39:42,231
Are you following me?

498
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,266
Just like when you and Kan were following me on Saturday,

499
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,243
student prefect.

500
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:49,518
You’re wrong.

501
00:39:49,615 --> 00:39:50,550
I didn’t follow you.

502
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:52,236
Hey.

503
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:53,959
Just confess already.

504
00:39:57,135 --> 00:39:58,505
Hey, look out!

505
00:40:17,863 --> 00:40:18,968
Aren’t you gonna let me go?

506
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:23,505
You want to hug me?

507
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:28,030
I just pulled you away from that bike.

508
00:40:28,171 --> 00:40:29,456
I didn’t want to hug you.

509
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,283
Sure about that?

510
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:32,657
Damn you.

511
00:40:32,657 --> 00:40:34,256
If you’re not thanking me for my help,

512
00:40:34,572 --> 00:40:35,968
stop talking.

513
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:39,264
Come here then.

514
00:40:40,422 --> 00:40:41,193
To where?

515
00:40:41,362 --> 00:40:42,155
Just come.

516
00:40:42,155 --> 00:40:43,505
Where? I’m making rounds.

517
00:40:43,505 --> 00:40:44,633
Come on.

518
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,155
Let’s go, Akk.

519
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,945
I can walk myself.

520
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:11,552
Don’t.

521
00:41:12,084 --> 00:41:13,233
I can do it myself.

522
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,786
You get used to being my car really fast.

523
00:41:17,295 --> 00:41:18,422
Used to, my ass.

524
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:21,350
It’s just buckling up.

525
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:29,093
Where are you taking me?

526
00:41:30,205 --> 00:41:31,196
What are we doing?

527
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:32,175
Is it far?

528
00:41:32,175 --> 00:41:33,258
What time will we come back?

529
00:41:49,563 --> 00:41:50,497
We’re here.

530
00:41:51,563 --> 00:41:52,847
What are we doing here?

531
00:41:55,787 --> 00:41:56,858
I want a coffee.

532
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,247
Go get it then.

533
00:41:58,505 --> 00:41:59,562
I’ll wait in the car.

534
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:00,892
You can’t.

535
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:03,068
Of course, I can. Why can’t I?

536
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:41,779
What the hell are you doing?

537
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:58,505
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

538
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,121
In my opinion, you’re not fit for that.

539
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,319
Someone born with privileges like you won’t understand.

540
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,928
If we let the conflict go bigger, I’m afraid we will eventually fight each other.

541
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:11,906
What is it, Akk?

542
00:43:11,906 --> 00:43:13,293
Isn’t Teacher Chadok here?

543
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:15,989
Is the student prefect title that important to you?

544
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:17,328
It allows me to help this school.

545
00:43:17,418 --> 00:43:20,772
You’re being tamed just to get the reward from those people?

546
00:43:20,772 --> 00:43:24,250
Is it so wrong if I try hard to get the privileges that other people do?

547
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,282
You faggies!

548
00:43:25,282 --> 00:43:26,296
So?

549
00:43:26,296 --> 00:43:29,473
So what if we are? Are you hurt?

550
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,838
Men won’t think too much, Thuaphu.

551
00:43:31,938 --> 00:43:34,518
You’re girlish. That’s why you’re always bullied.

552
00:43:34,971 --> 00:43:38,035
If the curse is back, they might stop.

553
00:43:38,725 --> 00:43:40,096
Let’s not stop fighting.

554
00:43:40,096 --> 00:43:44,328
We will make this school consider changing its obsolete rules.

555
00:43:44,328 --> 00:43:46,387
I will expose what this shitty school did.

556
00:43:46,387 --> 00:43:47,590
I told you to stop!

557
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:48,665
Stop!

558
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,672
What is it?

559
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:54,972
I’m afraid Aye would talk you into joining that gang.

560
00:43:57,002 --> 00:44:00,211
In my opinion, you are fit for this more.
