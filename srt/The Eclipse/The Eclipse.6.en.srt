How is the situation?

5
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:23,879
The group supporting The World Remembers is gaining momentum.

6
00:00:25,778 --> 00:00:26,742
Hey!

7
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:28,103
Stop it.

8
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:31,839
Isn’t this an obvious abuse of power, student prefect?

9
00:00:32,084 --> 00:00:32,826
You jerk.

10
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:34,431
You took my notebook, didn’t you?

11
00:00:35,043 --> 00:00:36,207
What the hell?

12
00:00:36,207 --> 00:00:37,151
I didn’t.

13
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:38,410
If it’s not you, then who?

14
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,847
Would be nice if it’s a “who.”

15
00:00:40,486 --> 00:00:42,182
I’m afraid it might be the curse of Suppalo.

16
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:55,808
I pledge to uphold Suppalo rules and regulations.

17
00:00:57,637 --> 00:01:00,852
With rules comes honor.

18
00:01:01,316 --> 00:01:04,423
With rules comes honor.

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,063
The first rule of being good student prefects is

20
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:11,422
be selfless.

21
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:15,354
You aren’t just you anymore.

22
00:01:15,954 --> 00:01:17,585
You’re the representative of us all.

23
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:28,332
New student prefect,

24
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:29,457
are you ready?

25
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:31,093
I am.

26
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:53,889
With rules comes honor.

27
00:01:58,213 --> 00:02:01,341
With rules comes honor.

28
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:05,000
With rules comes honor.

29
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:15,639
With rules comes honor.

30
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,376
Akk!

31
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:44,348
Don’t butt in.

32
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:45,137
Akk.

33
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:47,259
You’re seriously doing this?

34
00:03:00,184 --> 00:03:01,120
Who’s there?

35
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:32,815
Who’s there?

36
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:25,148
Do you think she’s gone?

37
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:28,580
She should be waiting just out front.

38
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:39,578
What are you doing?

39
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:50,851
Hello.

40
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:52,099
Hello, teacher.

41
00:05:53,116 --> 00:05:54,140
I’m Ayan.

42
00:05:55,233 --> 00:06:02,094
I’m not sure if I mistakenly included my History assignment in your English assignment this evening.

43
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:04,865
Ah, I don’t know.

44
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:08,200
If I find it, I’ll hand it to Teacher Waree for you.

45
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:11,657
I still need to work on it a little more.

46
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:13,866
Or Teacher Waree will yell at me.

47
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:17,611
May I please ask you to check it for me?

48
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:27,846
All right.

49
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,160
I’ll take a look.

50
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:31,892
Yes, ma’am.

51
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,007
Thank you.

52
00:06:52,024 --> 00:06:53,068
Oh, it’s you.

53
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:55,609
So you’ve come back.

54
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:56,822
Right.

55
00:06:57,299 --> 00:06:59,133
I’m here to work on some documents.

56
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:05,560
Why are you still here?

57
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,499
Ah,

58
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,783
I came to look for a student's assignment.

59
00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:11,177
He mistakenly turned in the wrong one.

60
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,130
I’ll be leaving now.

61
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:16,597
Goodbye, sir.

62
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:52,533
[Teacher Sani]

63
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:56,040
It’s Teacher Sani.

64
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,065
Yes, ma’am.

65
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:07,421
I couldn’t find your assignment.

66
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,123
Maybe you left it somewhere else?

67
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,900
Ah!

68
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:13,640
It’s with Akk.

69
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:15,930
He just called and told me.

70
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:18,501
I was about to call you, Teacher.

71
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Okay then.

72
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:36,836
Almost busted.

73
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:43,213
Thank you.

74
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,921
I’ll go home then.

75
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,136
Hold on.

76
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:53,050
We’ve got something to talk about.

77
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:04,384
Akk.

78
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,138
Akk.

79
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,739
Are you the one who brought back the Suppalo curse?

80
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:20,739
What are you saying?

81
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:22,042
The truth, Akk.

82
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:25,628
Can you tell me the truth?

83
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,361
You can talk to me.

84
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,446
If I want to expose you,

85
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:36,535
I’d have done it the first day I met you.

86
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:45,211
I saw you wait until Mr. Sit went to his room.

87
00:09:48,524 --> 00:09:49,591
And you did it.

88
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,075
When the pickup truck started moving,

89
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:57,623
you went back to take the prefect role,

90
00:09:58,534 --> 00:09:59,644
the rule keeper role.

91
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:07,291
The more I trace it,

92
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:10,049
the clearer I see

93
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:15,571
that the one who brought back the Suppalo curse

94
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,468
is you.

95
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:25,489
Can you tell me the truth, Akk?

96
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,333
I don’t want the school's reputation to be ruined

97
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:30,720
while I’m the head of the Prefect Club.

98
00:10:30,894 --> 00:10:32,177
I mean I’m worried.

99
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:35,000
You know what Aye is like.

100
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:39,959
Hey!

101
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:42,054
What’s the matter?

102
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:08,039
Why did you do it?

103
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:16,370
To uphold Suppalo's rules.

104
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:21,256
Can you tell me the truth, Akk?

105
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:29,589
I don't want the school's reputation to be ruined

106
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,844
while I'm the head of the Prefect Club.

107
00:11:35,197 --> 00:11:37,197
You maintain goodness

108
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:39,197
and peace

109
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:41,682
by doing all those shitty things, Akk?

110
00:11:41,682 --> 00:11:42,813
I just wanted them to stop.

111
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:53,467
I never wish to hurt anyone.

112
00:11:56,704 --> 00:12:00,602
But what you did was a crime.

113
00:12:02,032 --> 00:12:03,727
What if someone died?

114
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:05,848
What would you do?

115
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:10,922
Could you take responsibility?

116
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,680
I just try to do my best.

117
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:48,785
I want everything to turn out the best.

118
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:53,578
I just want things to be great.

119
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:54,741
Akk.

120
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,267
Akk, look at me.

121
00:12:57,856 --> 00:12:58,887
Look into my eyes.

122
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:00,606
Look into my eyes.

123
00:13:01,854 --> 00:13:02,710
Akk!

124
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:04,276
Akk!

125
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:06,573
Look into my eyes.

126
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,670
Nothing is the best.

127
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:18,951
You can't carry all the school problems on your shoulder.

128
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:22,064
Do you get it?

129
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:24,482
But I must do it.

130
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:27,654
If I can't do it,

131
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:30,362
everyone will be disappointed in me.

132
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:32,375
Screw those people.

133
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:35,887
Can you just not give a shit about them?

134
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:39,695
Put yourself first, Akk.

135
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,301
I can't!

136
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:45,482
Akk.

137
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:04,615
Once you say you care about other people's feelings,

138
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:09,922
it means you are disregarding your own feelings.

139
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,402
But I can't.

140
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,202
Because I'm a student prefect.

141
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:44,251
You're allowed to be weak.

142
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,374
At least with me.

143
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:00,362
It's okay, Akk.

144
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:23,772
I have to go.

145
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:26,508
Akk.

146
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:36,886
Akk.

147
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,906
Akk, wait up.

148
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:43,405
Talk to me.

149
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,069
What do you want from me?

150
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:46,588
Tell me.

151
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:50,162
Did Teacher Chadok order you to do all that?

152
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:52,647
Did he, Akk?

153
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:56,870
No.

154
00:15:58,122 --> 00:15:59,271
I did it of my own free will.

155
00:16:00,513 --> 00:16:01,458
He has nothing to do with it.

156
00:16:01,953 --> 00:16:03,836
Why are you protecting him?

157
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:05,362
I'm not.

158
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:08,382
It's all me.

159
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:09,700
What the heck is wrong with you, Akk?

160
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:11,681
Have you been brainwashed?

161
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:16,544
You must stop it.

162
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:19,836
Or I'll expose you.

163
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:23,761
Do you want your life to be ruined?

164
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,031
Don't tell anyone.

165
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:29,602
I don't want my parents to be disappointed.

166
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:31,046
Promise me then.

167
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:33,496
Can you do it?

168
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,622
Give me your word.

169
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:43,203
Fine.

170
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:44,682
I'll stop.

171
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:46,630
Happy now?

172
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,332
Return me my notebook.

173
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:53,562
What notebook now?

174
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:55,855
You said you believed I didn't take it.

175
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:57,711
I used to believe so, Akk.

176
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,449
But from what I saw today, I changed my mind.

177
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:03,299
What?

178
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:04,598
What is wrong with you?

179
00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:11,727
Hey!

180
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:13,147
What's the matter?

181
00:17:14,794 --> 00:17:15,762
I'¦

182
00:17:20,362 --> 00:17:23,955
Does your stomach usually rumble this loud when you're hungry?

183
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:44,221
[Grilled Chicken, Papaya Salad, Grilled Fish.]

184
00:17:59,942 --> 00:18:00,771
Wat!

185
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,200
Hey, Teacher.

186
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,650
Lucky for us the rain has stopped.

187
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,322
Or we wouldn't get any table.

188
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:15,076
True.

189
00:18:21,258 --> 00:18:23,258
You seem to like this type of food.

190
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:25,362
Very much.

191
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:29,385
I don't usually get to eat this kind of food.

192
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:32,185
Why not?

193
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,236
My mom is pretty health-conscious.

194
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:40,765
She only eats clean and healthy food.

195
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:48,466
Why are you out filming by yourself?

196
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,682
Whenever I'm out filming,

197
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:57,060
Akk and Kan always refuse to come along.

198
00:18:58,385 --> 00:18:59,302
Yeah?

199
00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:00,104
Yes, ma'am.

200
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,506
Oh, Teacher,

201
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:06,349
I'm learning how to use a video editing program.

202
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:08,362
Do you want to see my edited video, ma'am?

203
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:10,336
Of course.

204
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:11,558
Let me show you.

205
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,225
Here.

206
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:35,211
I've never seen this side of the student prefect team.

207
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:40,031
Actually, we're nutheads.

208
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:43,939
I can imagine Kanlong as one.

209
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:45,798
Akk, on the other hand.

210
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:47,376
Didn't expect it.

211
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,854
Akk is bonkers when he's surrounded by close friends.

212
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,147
What is he like? Akk, I mean.

213
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:05,475
He's a good leader.

214
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:08,395
He always puts other people before himself.

215
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:12,066
But he can be a little weak-minded sometimes.

216
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:16,689
Especially with Teacher Chadok, isn't it?

217
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:17,679
Right.

218
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,943
Teacher Chadok is his idol.

219
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,443
Is that so?

220
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:29,242
I want to know more about your group.

221
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:31,537
Can you tell me more?

222
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:34,315
Absolutely, ma'am.

223
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,627
Drink this.

224
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:03,246
Thank you.

225
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,754
We're almost done.

226
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:09,281
Try to memorize them.

227
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,659
So that you can answer questions when we have the presentation.

228
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,012
Yeah.

229
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,578
I think we have too many assignments to do.

230
00:21:16,238 --> 00:21:18,707
Why don't the teachers just talk before assigning us homework?

231
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:22,799
It's our duty.

232
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:24,264
We must do it no matter what.

233
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:29,713
Because it's our duty, you're here working at my house.

234
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:34,631
Because all your family members went out of town,

235
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:37,933
you tricked me to come and keep you company.

236
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:41,620
Smart enough to be the head of the class.

237
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,788
It's good we're here.

238
00:21:44,495 --> 00:21:46,120
It's near the eclipse.

239
00:21:46,663 --> 00:21:49,002
If you stay in school, you might be cursed.

240
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:51,598
I'm not a protestor. Why would I be cursed?

241
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:53,555
Because you're always with Aye. I'm jealous.

242
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,218
I mean I'm worried.

243
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,008
You know what he's like.

244
00:22:20,363 --> 00:22:21,367
Hi, Mom.

245
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:24,917
Is that so?

246
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:28,013
Okay, Mom.

247
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:32,885
What is it?

248
00:22:35,245 --> 00:22:36,009
Nothing.

249
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:40,362
My mom can't pick me up so my stepdad will.

250
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:44,212
But you said you're uncomfortable around him.

251
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:48,930
Yeah.

252
00:22:58,655 --> 00:22:59,488
Hide.

253
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:00,655
Do it!

254
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,147
What are you doing?

255
00:23:09,147 --> 00:23:09,800
Wear it.

256
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,202
If he is doing anything, let me know.

257
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:14,432
I heard that.

258
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,787
When you eat,

259
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:41,525
you leave out your student prefect aura.

260
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:47,139
Can you not poke your nose in my business for once?

261
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,785
Mr. Nice Mouth has finally come back.

262
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:53,689
This is so you.

263
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:58,571
You finished. Go home.

264
00:23:58,693 --> 00:23:59,555
What are you waiting for?

265
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,769
Waiting for you to take me to my notebook.

266
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,567
Notebook again?

267
00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:09,457
Don’t you understand human language?

268
00:24:11,024 --> 00:24:12,902
You must take me to every place to look for it.

269
00:24:13,123 --> 00:24:14,007
In school.

270
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:15,307
The locker area.

271
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,547
Your dorm.

272
00:24:18,134 --> 00:24:19,291
What is your problem?

273
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:23,753
I’ll turn every place upside down until I find it.

274
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:24,981
Okay?

275
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:35,512
That’s my meatball.

276
00:24:35,738 --> 00:24:36,448
You want it back?

277
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:38,653
Take it from my mouth.

278
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:43,081
Spit it out.

279
00:24:56,491 --> 00:24:58,247
This is complimentary.

280
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,142
You’re two growing boys. Eat as much as you can.

281
00:25:00,507 --> 00:25:01,775
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

282
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,709
Continue bickering. It’s cute.

283
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:08,922
Are you guys just a ship or real?

284
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,922
Auntie, he and I are friends.

285
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:17,282
More than friends.

286
00:25:18,232 --> 00:25:19,866
- More than friends.
- More than friends.

287
00:25:20,134 --> 00:25:22,683
More than friends, less than lovers.

288
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,916
Cute.

289
00:25:23,997 --> 00:25:25,082
More than friends.

290
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:26,099
Make yourselves comfortable.

291
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:27,641
- Sure.
- More than friends.

292
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:29,912
Aunties.

293
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:32,468
We really are friends.

294
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:34,217
Don’t be shy.

295
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:35,201
I’ve seen a lot.

296
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:35,874
Aunties!

297
00:25:50,305 --> 00:25:51,967
Come on. Share that meatball.

298
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:01,319
What?

299
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:03,302
The three Jums are here.

300
00:26:06,157 --> 00:26:06,845
Oh,

301
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:08,380
they’re with their boyfriends.

302
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:10,280
Stop it.

303
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:12,208
What do you think you’re doing?

304
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,634
Do you want them to know we came together?

305
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:16,368
So?

306
00:26:16,653 --> 00:26:17,882
What’s the problem if they know?

307
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:20,840
Come here.

308
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:22,463
Akk, where are you taking me?

309
00:26:22,463 --> 00:26:23,156
Akk!

310
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:29,864
Hide.

311
00:26:30,402 --> 00:26:31,185
Hide!

312
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:32,195
Do it.

313
00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:45,096
Nian, Nong, take different tables.

314
00:26:45,198 --> 00:26:46,578
We don’t share the same table tonight.

315
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:56,209
Your body is pretty warm.

316
00:26:58,813 --> 00:26:59,943
You’re such a pain.

317
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,416
Aren’t you afraid anymore?

318
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:04,428
Come closer.

319
00:27:05,622 --> 00:27:07,500
After we get away from here, you’re in trouble.

320
00:27:09,645 --> 00:27:10,913
Get down.

321
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:21,350
Can you share it?

322
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,533
Sure.

323
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,169
Thua, have you finished?

324
00:27:39,378 --> 00:27:40,366
Hurry up.

325
00:27:40,854 --> 00:27:41,866
Yes, Dad.

326
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:51,182
Hello, sir.

327
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,878
Let’s go. Your mom is waiting for dinner.

328
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,890
If he is doing anything, let me know.

329
00:28:04,243 --> 00:28:05,206
I’ll deal with him for you.

330
00:28:05,206 --> 00:28:06,243
I heard that.

331
00:28:07,298 --> 00:28:08,563
Who is dealing with who?

332
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:11,740
Sorry.

333
00:28:13,412 --> 00:28:14,722
Hurry. Your mom is waiting.

334
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:16,086
Yes.

335
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,424
[Once you get home, let me know.]
[Did your stepdad say anything?]

336
00:28:38,424 --> 00:28:39,341
Was that your boyfriend?

337
00:28:40,582 --> 00:28:41,360
No.

338
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:44,554
Just admit it.

339
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:46,020
We live in a new age here.

340
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,882
How was school?

341
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,726
Just the same.

342
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,324
Can I turn on the radio?

343
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:00,967
Yeah.

344
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:04,409
(Hi, everyone.)

345
00:29:05,115 --> 00:29:08,562
(Tonight's short news is on the solar eclipse.)

346
00:29:09,171 --> 00:29:13,043
(For those of you who are waiting to see the solar eclipse…)

347
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:13,845
Just turn that off.

348
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:17,025
This nonsense solar eclipse thing.

349
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:20,669
(National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand is advising…)

350
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:21,411
Sure.

351
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,421
Let’s go home.

352
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,352
Wat, Thua’s dad is freaking intimidating.

353
00:29:34,716 --> 00:29:36,065
Do you think he will hurt him?

354
00:29:37,283 --> 00:29:40,504
Thua seems soft but he’s not stupid.

355
00:29:41,102 --> 00:29:42,553
He can surely survive.

356
00:29:42,903 --> 00:29:43,869
Don’t worry about him.

357
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:45,066
I can’t help it.

358
00:29:45,187 --> 00:29:47,513
You should have seen his stepdad like I just did.

359
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:51,242
You seem so worried about Thua these days. It’s weird.

360
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:54,211
Weird?

361
00:29:54,353 --> 00:29:55,560
No, I’m not being weird. Just typical me.

362
00:29:55,815 --> 00:29:59,042
You didn’t even want to walk past him back then.

363
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:03,002
You were so afraid people would say you two are the legendary boyfriends.

364
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:04,176
What are you rambling about?

365
00:30:04,443 --> 00:30:06,545
Just work on your nonsense short film, man.

366
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:07,660
Bye.

367
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:20,962
Kanlong, stop!

368
00:30:20,962 --> 00:30:22,283
You needed your wife to rescue you?

369
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,282
Thua, be gentler.

370
00:30:27,787 --> 00:30:29,441
Don’t you move.

371
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:40,848
Kan, seriously.

372
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:45,550
Are you actually angry with those guys or me?

373
00:30:56,016 --> 00:30:57,568
How can I be angry with you, Thua?

374
00:31:13,857 --> 00:31:14,593
What are you doing?

375
00:31:14,593 --> 00:31:15,633
Just wear it.

376
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,830
Why?

377
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,754
Just wear it.

378
00:31:18,812 --> 00:31:19,672
Why?

379
00:31:20,232 --> 00:31:22,282
You disguise yourself and talk to the guard.

380
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:23,875
I’ll be on the other side.

381
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,571
Okay?

382
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,879
Let’s go.

383
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:35,570
Come here.

384
00:31:37,026 --> 00:31:37,842
Where?

385
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:40,277
Ayan, come here.

386
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:43,312
Mister.

387
00:31:46,181 --> 00:31:47,006
Who is it?

388
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:54,456
I forgot my assignment due tomorrow inside.

389
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,762
Can I go inside and grab it?

390
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:58,244
Sure, prefect.

391
00:31:58,522 --> 00:31:59,887
But please make it quick.

392
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:02,800
If the head of the guards finds out, I’ll be in trouble.

393
00:32:02,997 --> 00:32:03,782
Of course.

394
00:32:04,494 --> 00:32:05,442
Let me get the door for you.

395
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,131
Please hurry up.

396
00:32:14,396 --> 00:32:15,239
Thank you so much.

397
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,458
You made it like a diamond heist.

398
00:32:22,203 --> 00:32:23,837
You come with me. You can just walk in.

399
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,151
Right. You’re so smart.

400
00:32:25,538 --> 00:32:26,730
Lead the way then.

401
00:32:34,643 --> 00:32:35,556
Spread out your arms.

402
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,437
What are you doing?

403
00:32:37,437 --> 00:32:38,556
Just spread out your arms.

404
00:32:41,848 --> 00:32:43,929
You must open your friends’ lockers too.

405
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,180
How can I do that? I don’t have the keys.

406
00:32:46,377 --> 00:32:47,950
How could you open mine then?

407
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,857
I told you I didn’t take it.

408
00:33:27,775 --> 00:33:29,776
Why would you want my notebook?

409
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,271
I wanted it but I didn’t take it.

410
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:37,331
Nobody in this damn school can be trusted.

411
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,649
Why is the notebook so important to you?

412
00:33:49,838 --> 00:33:51,151
Take me to the lockers.

413
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:07,186
Open yours.

414
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:33,440
We should go.

415
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:34,932
Not yet.

416
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:37,880
You must open your friends’ lockers too.

417
00:34:39,156 --> 00:34:40,374
How can I do that? I don’t have the keys.

418
00:34:40,374 --> 00:34:41,712
How did you open mine then?

419
00:34:42,152 --> 00:34:43,166
You forgot to lock it.

420
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:44,010
I did?

421
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,014
Yes, you did.

422
00:34:45,137 --> 00:34:46,758
- Meow!
- Shit!

423
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:49,868
Why so jumpy?

424
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,349
It’s just a cat.

425
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:52,495
And you’re such a big guy.

426
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,906
I’m not jumpy.

427
00:34:56,218 --> 00:34:59,023
I shouted to scare it away so that it won’t mess with anything in here.

428
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:00,100
Oh, yeah?

429
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,867
Yeah!

430
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:02,832
What about that hug?

431
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:04,481
Hug, my ass!

432
00:35:04,907 --> 00:35:06,431
I was protecting you.

433
00:35:06,853 --> 00:35:08,095
I was afraid it would scratch you.

434
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,610
Wow!

435
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:14,028
You’re just perfect to be the head of the Prefect Club.

436
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:16,385
Outstanding.

437
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:17,737
Time to go.

438
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:19,144
Wait.

439
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:21,912
If I can’t find it in places,

440
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,047
it’s probably on your body.

441
00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:26,268
What are you getting at now?

442
00:35:26,513 --> 00:35:27,557
Spread out your arms.

443
00:35:30,115 --> 00:35:31,071
What are you doing?

444
00:35:31,189 --> 00:35:32,422
Just spread out your arms.

445
00:35:45,696 --> 00:35:47,009
Enough already.

446
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:01,890
Have you found it, prefect?

447
00:36:03,551 --> 00:36:04,484
We have.

448
00:36:04,484 --> 00:36:05,551
We’re about to leave.

449
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:07,019
All right.

450
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:11,035
Are you happy now?

451
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:11,733
No.

452
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:14,659
You must take me to one last stop.

453
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:19,906
Lock that locker.

454
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:00,872
Put them all back to their places.

455
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:05,032
If you don’t want me to go through your stuff, tell me where it is.

456
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,387
I told you I don’t have it.

457
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,432
Just go home.

458
00:37:15,761 --> 00:37:17,122
I said I don’t have it.

459
00:37:17,552 --> 00:37:18,545
Go home already.

460
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,144
I won’t go

461
00:37:20,511 --> 00:37:22,032
until I find it.

462
00:37:22,134 --> 00:37:23,073
I’ll crash here tonight.

463
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:25,752
If you don’t cooperate,

464
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:28,906
I’ll reveal your story.

465
00:37:32,232 --> 00:37:34,090
Why are you so stubborn?

466
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:44,154
Yes, Mom.

467
00:37:44,154 --> 00:37:45,989
We will do a group report at home.

468
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:48,835
Wat also said he’d film some kind of video there.

469
00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:55,782
Hold on a second, Mom.

470
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,048
Hi, I’m back.

471
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:06,949
It’s going to be four of us.

472
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:10,845
I think I might be one day ahead of them as I want to help you prepare the guest rooms.

473
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,122
We will spend one or two nights.

474
00:38:14,093 --> 00:38:15,002
Yes.

475
00:38:15,618 --> 00:38:16,709
I miss you guys.

476
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:18,139
See you.

477
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:20,988
You’re a cutie when you talk to your parents.

478
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,792
You’re not like that with me.

479
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,088
Are you my parent?

480
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:36,141
That’s your spot.

481
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:36,772
Sleep.

482
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:52,438
Turn off the light. I’ll sleep now.

483
00:39:03,355 --> 00:39:04,752
Stay away. You’re giving me goosebumps.

484
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:24,839
You refuse to let me sleep in the same bed

485
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:27,419
because you’re thinking dirty, aren’t you?

486
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:31,839
I’m not.

487
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:35,674
Then let me sleep here.

488
00:39:36,245 --> 00:39:37,629
Go ahead.

489
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:02,211
Come any closer and I’ll punch you.

490
00:40:03,892 --> 00:40:04,872
Will you?

491
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,423
(I’ll kiss you.)

492
00:41:02,867 --> 00:41:03,778
Uncle.

493
00:41:15,905 --> 00:41:16,768
Uncle.

494
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:50,309
No!

495
00:41:53,126 --> 00:41:54,060
Uncle!

496
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,249
Uncle.

497
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:10,232
Don’t!

498
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,637
Uncle!

499
00:42:13,008 --> 00:42:13,883
Uncle!

500
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:16,132
Uncle.

501
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:24,481
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

502
00:44:25,155 --> 00:44:28,672
Sometimes I wonder why those people don’t think like us.

503
00:44:28,672 --> 00:44:30,427
The prefects’ duty

504
00:44:30,427 --> 00:44:33,174
is to do whatever it takes to make Suppalo remain Suppalo.

505
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,977
I hope you don’t forget that.

506
00:44:35,121 --> 00:44:36,932
Do you remember what you said to me?

507
00:44:36,932 --> 00:44:38,194
You’re allowed to be weak.
