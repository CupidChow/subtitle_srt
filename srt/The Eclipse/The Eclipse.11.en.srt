1
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:21,852
So the Suppalo curse is back?

2
00:00:22,084 --> 00:00:23,772
I’ve got something to talk to you about.

3
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:25,242
Do you really not see

4
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:28,090
that you’re encouraging this bad system to continue?

5
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:29,601
I’m wondering

6
00:00:30,432 --> 00:00:32,772
if Teacher Chadok was the reason he died.

7
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:00,595
I thought you wouldn’t come.

8
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:06,084
What do you think you’re doing?

9
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:19,975
What are you doing?

10
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:04,122
What did Teacher Chadok do exactly?

11
00:02:05,744 --> 00:02:08,466
Probably the same thing he does to you and Teacher Sani.

12
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:10,436
What thing?

13
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:16,744
Forcing you and Teacher Sani to believe in Suppalo’s rules.

14
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:20,192
Especially you.

15
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:22,714
He’s even brainwashed you to do it.

16
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,282
But all those things,

17
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:26,993
they were all my doing.

18
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,532
He didn’t order me to.

19
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:30,786
Are you sure?

20
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:38,491
He might not say it directly.

21
00:02:38,763 --> 00:02:40,763
But he gives you signs.

22
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:48,715
What have I done?

23
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:51,440
It’s okay.

24
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,677
What have I done?

25
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:58,159
It’s okay.

26
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,957
If I just disappear from this world…

27
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:05,996
Akk.

28
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:24,046
Don’t you think like that.

29
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:29,132
Don’t disappear.

30
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:34,489
Please do not disappear.

31
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:40,698
Akk.

32
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:43,913
Without me, all these things wouldn’t have happened.

33
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:45,533
Akk.

34
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:55,641
Akk.

35
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:02,997
You can change.

36
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,252
Thank you for keeping me company as a boyfriend.

37
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:23,508
What?

38
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,332
People just say, “Thank you for keeping me company.”

39
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:26,200
Well.

40
00:04:27,112 --> 00:04:28,132
We are boyfriends.

41
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,694
I won’t go back to be your friend.

42
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:31,298
No way.

43
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:34,212
You just keep rambling again.

44
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,785
I’m going to sleep.

45
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:38,549
Akk.

46
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,242
Hm?

47
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:40,432
Don’t move over.

48
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:43,452
Get closer to me.

49
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:45,332
The bed is huge.

50
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:46,607
Back on your side.

51
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:47,506
No.

52
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:50,212
If you want to sleep like this, I’ll sleep like this too.

53
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:51,008
Aye.

54
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:52,722
It’s hot. Get off me.

55
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:53,275
No.

56
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:54,792
Aye.

57
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:02,494
Why are you so stubborn, Shortstop?

58
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:08,592
To get your attention like this, Big Foot.

59
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:21,596
Kiss me.

60
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,660
No.

61
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:24,907
Come on.

62
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:29,859
Do you want to sleep?

63
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,026
Are you happy now?

64
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:44,229
That’s enough.

65
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,671
Aye!

66
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:47,330
The last spot.

67
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:02,077
What are you going to do about tomorrow?

68
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:04,023
It’s the school foundation day.

69
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:15,102
I have no clue.

70
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,502
Can we just skip tomorrow?

71
00:06:27,824 --> 00:06:29,218
Can I borrow your suit?

72
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:34,498
And your armband?

73
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,778
I’ll get one from my locker.

74
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:44,675
Are you scared?

75
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:53,331
But you’re getting the Best Boy award today.

76
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:00,306
I used to want that award so much.

77
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,295
But now…

78
00:07:04,236 --> 00:07:06,446
I think that piece of paper is worthless.

79
00:07:28,964 --> 00:07:30,172
What are you doing?

80
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:31,510
I can do it myself.

81
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:33,610
I want to do it for you.

82
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:36,678
Now

83
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,540
Your pin has its own story created by me.

84
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:43,705
What?

85
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:45,544
It’s just a school pin.

86
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:46,694
No.

87
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:51,262
It isn’t just a school pin.

88
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:59,080
It’s my school pin I pinned for you,

89
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:02,972
the person I love.

90
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,697
And, going forward,

91
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,156
regardless of who does anything to you,

92
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:15,481
you'll always be the same Akk for me.

93
00:08:16,572 --> 00:08:17,547
Forever.

94
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:30,590
Hello, sir.

95
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,567
Hello.

96
00:08:53,492 --> 00:09:00,710
The sponsorship from the alumni association will be discussed in the next meeting, won’t it, sir?

97
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:02,330
Yes.

98
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:07,066
But it also depends on the event held today, principal.

99
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:29,724
Today's ceremony has been Suppalo's tradition for more than a century.

100
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:37,873
Everyone, please recite the pledge with pride.

101
00:10:33,672 --> 00:10:39,865
I pledge to adhere to Suppalo rules above all else.

102
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:42,546
As I realize that

103
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,131
with rules comes honor.

104
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:54,624
with rules comes honor.

105
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:58,484
with rules comes honor.

106
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:02,548
with rules comes honor.

107
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:31,065
Thank you.

108
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:35,689
I will look into that for you.

109
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,946
We’re so thankful for your continued sponsorship, sir.

110
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:41,061
Thank you, principal.

111
00:11:58,164 --> 00:11:59,758
Deal with them.

112
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:01,566
Yes, ma’am.

113
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:15,472
Aren’t you scared of the Suppalo curse?

114
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:18,692
We just want the school to take responsibility for what happened.

115
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,309
You better tell the truth.

116
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:21,930
Thua.

117
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,735
Stop talking.

118
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:25,332
It’s time we see the last boss.

119
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:38,594
Stop the Suppalo curse.
Find the one responsible.

120
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:41,210
Protesting inside the school is strictly prohibited.

121
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:42,408
You are in breach of the rule.

122
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:44,186
What are you doing?

123
00:12:44,186 --> 00:12:46,193
Donât you care at all about the school's reputation?

124
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,599
Teacher, should we talk to them in the Student Welfare Department room?

125
00:12:52,591 --> 00:12:53,553
Student prefects,

126
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,838
take them.

127
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:55,873
Security guard!

128
00:12:58,426 --> 00:12:59,407
Let me go.

129
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:00,749
We have the right to protest.

130
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:02,746
We have the right to find the truth.

131
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:03,854
Let me go.

132
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:05,017
Let go!

133
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:05,939
You canât do this to us.

134
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:07,207
Let us go!

135
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:08,485
You canât do this to us.

136
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:11,184
Let us go!

137
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:12,057
Release the students!

138
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:14,909
Let the students go.

139
00:13:17,273 --> 00:13:19,273
Stop treating us like weâre prisoners.

140
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:21,879
Release the students!

141
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:23,050
Thua.

142
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:30,024
Release the students!

143
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:32,322
Arenât you scared of the curse?

144
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:33,819
You, a bunch of misfits.

145
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:43,679
- Misfits!
- Release the students!

146
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,092
Arenât you going to do anything, Akk?

147
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:49,751
- Misfits!
- Release the students!

148
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:50,555
Enough!

149
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,347
Arenât you scared of the Suppalo curse?

150
00:13:56,747 --> 00:13:57,514
No.

151
00:13:58,026 --> 00:14:01,026
We just want the school to take responsibility for what happened.

152
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:03,445
Not just the school.

153
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:09,294
The student prefect club must take responsibility as well.

154
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:12,689
Because you guys took part in this conspiracy with the school.

155
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:16,683
You made up stories and used them to scare us.

156
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:22,273
Youâre head of the class.

157
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:24,915
Youâve been a well-behaving student.

158
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:27,550
Why are you siding with these unruly students?

159
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:32,089
Iâm just doing my duty, Teacher.

160
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,581
What are you saying, Thua?

161
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:37,879
You can't just accuse us.

162
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:39,270
We had nothing to do with that.

163
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,138
Thua,

164
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:43,757
one topic at a time, will you?

165
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:47,506
Can we just help The World Remembers first?

166
00:14:47,506 --> 00:14:48,889
Donât stop me, Aye.

167
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,586
Are you afraid to hear what Iâm saying?

168
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:53,116
Are you?

169
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:56,226
Itâs not that, Thua.

170
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:58,762
I just donât want you to accuse people

171
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:00,541
without evidence.

172
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,920
Youâre my evidence, Aye.

173
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:06,443
The most credible witness here is you.

174
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:10,066
You know who brought back the curseâ¦

175
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:11,398
No.

176
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:13,862
Who invented it.

177
00:15:14,153 --> 00:15:14,992
Itâs Akk.

178
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:18,551
Thua, stop!

179
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,132
Stop protecting him, Aye.

180
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,349
Heâs done many terrible things to you.

181
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:24,335
Oh, right. Actually,

182
00:15:25,702 --> 00:15:28,157
you two are secretly dating.

183
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:34,818
I respect your love.

184
00:15:35,723 --> 00:15:37,409
But I wonât put up with this.

185
00:15:38,195 --> 00:15:43,647
You canât just use your love as an excuse to cover your wrong.

186
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:44,494
Thatâs not right.

187
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:50,441
Akk.

188
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:53,673
You better confess you did it.

189
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:58,326
You didnât do it alone, did you?

190
00:16:01,223 --> 00:16:03,402
Someone was backing you up, right?

191
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,871
My stepdad told me the curse began when Teacher Chadok was a student here.

192
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:16,411
And he became the student prefect president.

193
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:19,403
There was a solar eclipse happening that year, just as now.

194
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:23,614
Many scary tales about the curse had been told among students.

195
00:16:24,075 --> 00:16:27,420
Students were terrified and paranoid.

196
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:30,375
They used the curse to eliminate those who had opposing viewpoints.

197
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,100
The student prefect club was the army.

198
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:37,365
And the head of the student welfare department was the one behind them.

199
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,882
Thuaphu, youâre a student.

200
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,928
You canât just accuse your teacher like that.

201
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,468
I did it.

202
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:52,237
I did everything by myself.

203
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,026
No one else was involved.

204
00:16:55,784 --> 00:16:56,443
Akk,

205
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,577
you donât have to say anything now.

206
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:01,100
He has to.

207
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,786
Aye, stop protecting him.

208
00:17:04,644 --> 00:17:07,066
So are you two really dating?

209
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:13,888
An act.

210
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:16,741
This is all an act.

211
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:18,693
Act?

212
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,451
What act?

213
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,746
A short film.

214
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:27,687
Iâm making a short film for a contest.

215
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:32,568
Itâs about two students in an all-boy school secretly dating.

216
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:33,897
Thatâs right.

217
00:17:34,614 --> 00:17:37,726
I can confirm that. Iâm working behind this short film.

218
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:38,572
Right, Aye?

219
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:42,672
Yes.

220
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:45,846
Put that aside for now, Wasuwat.

221
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,609
Teacher.

222
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:49,843
Letâs handle the protest first.

223
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:51,164
Yes.

224
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:55,026
We will investigate what happened today and the day you guys protested outside the school too.

225
00:17:55,178 --> 00:17:56,797
The principal is waiting to hear the result.

226
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,075
Of course.

227
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,020
Follow me to the Student Welfare Department.

228
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,412
You are free to speak your mind.

229
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,622
I will protect you.

230
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:19,869
Yes, maâam.

231
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:10,286
Thank you.

232
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:13,977
Are you okay?

233
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,406
I ruined everything.

234
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:45,418
Think of it as

235
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,161
you ruined the old bad things.

236
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,736
And start fresh with something better.

237
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:55,331
Sounds good?

238
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,520
You think so?

239
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:04,292
But the principal has now ordered a committee to investigate it.

240
00:21:06,254 --> 00:21:07,268
Donât overthink it.

241
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,136
Are you sad to quit the student prefect club?

242
00:21:40,106 --> 00:21:45,064
With or without the armband, youâre still Akk.

243
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,478
You know that, right?

244
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:02,788
[Wat: Come to the student welfare department now!]

245
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:16,668
Thua.

246
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:18,805
Why are you doing this?

247
00:22:22,192 --> 00:22:23,986
I just want everyone to tell the truth.

248
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:31,332
Kan.

249
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:34,251
Wat.

250
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,546
Thank you for what you did there.

251
00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:40,249
You lied to me.

252
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:42,386
You lied about the curse.

253
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:43,950
Kan, stop.

254
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,435
You guys must be so disappointed in me, right?

255
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,398
About what?

256
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,488
I donât care who you like.

257
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,266
What I do care is what you did.

258
00:23:07,624 --> 00:23:09,243
Donât fight now.

259
00:23:09,707 --> 00:23:10,417
Wat.

260
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,685
Kan.

261
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:14,747
You learned the truth from Thua.

262
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,186
Someone is behind Akk.

263
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:31,817
Letâs go.

264
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:35,020
Itâs time we see the last boss.

265
00:23:43,415 --> 00:23:45,168
Do you remember this necklace?

266
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:47,459
It belonged to my uncle.

267
00:23:48,186 --> 00:23:49,805
Iâm sorry, sir.

268
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,982
I only asked for those involved.

269
00:24:04,782 --> 00:24:06,520
You’re not. Leave this room, Ayan.

270
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:10,736
Of course, I’m involved.

271
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:14,187
Do you remember this necklace?

272
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:17,712
It belonged to my uncle.

273
00:24:19,643 --> 00:24:22,058
I’m Teacher Dika’s nephew.

274
00:24:27,743 --> 00:24:29,167
Why are you telling that to me?

275
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:32,282
Do you have any idea of how he is?

276
00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:35,840
Do you know?

277
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:40,508
Your uncle joined the rival school.

278
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:42,095
My uncle killed himself!

279
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:47,547
He did it because of your teacher.

280
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:55,693
You remember that journal he had, don't you?

281
00:24:57,241 --> 00:24:58,803
You killed my uncle.

282
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:02,640
Just like you are killing Akk and Teacher Sani now.

283
00:25:07,185 --> 00:25:08,609
Why did you do it?

284
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:10,324
Why did you kill my uncle?

285
00:25:10,324 --> 00:25:10,982
Aye.

286
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,478
No one would ever kill someone he loves, Ayan.

287
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,984
I’m sorry, sir.

288
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:20,091
When Teacher Dika first joined this school,

289
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,640
A drama was beginning.

290
00:26:30,511 --> 00:26:32,788
Student welfare teachers were quitting.

291
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:33,838
Hello.

292
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,480
Hi.

293
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:40,766
Thank you for having me.

294
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,671
So the school board asked every new teacher to help out in the department.

295
00:26:50,463 --> 00:26:52,647
This is the manual for student welfare teachers.

296
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:54,080
Take a look.

297
00:26:54,749 --> 00:26:55,488
Thank you.

298
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:05,498
Dika and I were secretly dating.

299
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:19,671
We were planning to get married in secret and move in together.

300
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:22,018
I don't want the one in the middle. Let’s take the one on the left.

301
00:27:22,121 --> 00:27:23,729
It looks great.

302
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:25,014
What about the house?

303
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:26,686
What house?

304
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,524
The one we just looked at.

305
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:34,672
Chadok.

306
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:37,489
Are you messing with me?

307
00:27:40,252 --> 00:27:44,511
I know things between us are tough.

308
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:48,623
But I promise I’ll do my best.

309
00:27:57,689 --> 00:27:59,505
Let me show the ring.

310
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:03,666
One, two, three.

311
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:11,840
What the hell are you doing in my school?

312
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:27,712
I felt bad about it.

313
00:28:29,344 --> 00:28:31,270
You’re teachers.

314
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:33,565
You must be role models for students.

315
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:40,385
You guys can do whatever shit you want anywhere else.

316
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,740
But not here at Suppalo.

317
00:28:46,197 --> 00:28:47,160
Miss principal.

318
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:50,240
Can you please give us one more chance?

319
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:54,486
You will always get a chance.

320
00:28:55,806 --> 00:28:56,840
Listen to me!

321
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,815
But you must stand by our school.

322
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:24,103
I used all the connections I had to transfer Dika to Parot School.

323
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,632
He was waiting for you at Parot.

324
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:29,454
But you chose to stay at Suppalo.

325
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:40,818
After that, Di and I were still together.

326
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:46,766
Until he went to treatment for his depressive disorder.

327
00:29:49,647 --> 00:29:51,486
He started to write those journals.

328
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:57,836
I didn’t want anyone to find out.

329
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:02,500
So I ripped those pages out.

330
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:09,004
I didn’t think…

331
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:12,138
my action would

332
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:18,679
urge Dika to do that.

333
00:30:48,735 --> 00:30:49,651
Teacher Chadok.

334
00:30:54,441 --> 00:31:00,268
Why do we let these absurd rules and systems hurt us so much?

335
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:20,031
I’m leaving.

336
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:21,985
My mom is here.

337
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:23,601
Thua.

338
00:31:25,023 --> 00:31:26,447
Don’t you think you should clear things up with me?

339
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,368
In crime movies,

340
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,342
the bad guy always confesses in the end.

341
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:38,151
Aren’t you going to confess anything?

342
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:41,340
The Eclipse account.

343
00:31:48,092 --> 00:31:50,000
Don’t you go around accusing people like that.

344
00:31:50,437 --> 00:31:51,653
Listen to what he has to say then.

345
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:55,515
I really was the one who owned that Eclipse account.

346
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,146
And you were the one creating that fabric banner to scare The World Remembers gang.

347
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:03,264
You threatened the protesters on Twitter.

348
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,324
You burned their doll.

349
00:32:05,701 --> 00:32:07,171
Why did you do it, Thua?

350
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:09,604
I thought you were neutral.

351
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,041
I used to be neutral.

352
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:17,470
I did all those curse things after you because I didn’t want things to just die out.

353
00:32:17,585 --> 00:32:18,340
Thua.

354
00:32:18,668 --> 00:32:19,666
Kan.

355
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:21,567
Kan!

356
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,174
I’m sorry, Kan.

357
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:25,439
I had to do it.

358
00:32:26,132 --> 00:32:28,063
So that everyone would tell the truth.

359
00:32:30,053 --> 00:32:33,944
What you did is not different than what Akk did.

360
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:36,482
I know.

361
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:40,946
I just couldn’t take it that once Akk and Aye got together,

362
00:32:40,986 --> 00:32:42,986
they helped each other cover the truth.

363
00:32:45,155 --> 00:32:49,050
Do you really think you can fix it by letting it go away quietly?

364
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:54,374
So you caused me to misunderstand Akk again

365
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,517
You’re the one who took my uncle’s journal.

366
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:02,967
It’s you Thua.

367
00:33:04,758 --> 00:33:08,320
Once Akk and I made up,

368
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,800
you changed your target.

369
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,840
To teacher Chadok.

370
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:17,347
I saw it, Thua.

371
00:33:18,084 --> 00:33:21,168
You were leaving the journal with the pile of assignments.

372
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:26,786
After I read your uncle’s journal,

373
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:32,430
I was sure the one behind Akk is Teacher Chadok.

374
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,266
So I made use of your rage.

375
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:38,556
Why?

376
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:39,670
Why did you do it?

377
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,965
Kan, enough!

378
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:42,028
This is not you at all.

379
00:33:42,028 --> 00:33:43,260
This is me!

380
00:33:45,794 --> 00:33:51,840
I did it because it’s the only way to make everyone tell the truth.

381
00:33:53,172 --> 00:33:55,356
Everyone just has to admit it.

382
00:33:55,623 --> 00:33:57,946
So the lies and the tales can be gone.

383
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:00,514
Can you just not care about other people?

384
00:34:00,824 --> 00:34:02,478
Why do you care so freaking much?

385
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:14,366
What should I do to you?

386
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,565
Do as your duty tells you.

387
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:21,000
If I tell…

388
00:34:21,553 --> 00:34:22,689
I’m okay.

389
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,840
I’m willing to accept the consequences.

390
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,767
I chose to do it.

391
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:31,052
I knew it.

392
00:34:32,351 --> 00:34:33,416
I can’t.

393
00:34:33,623 --> 00:34:34,765
But you must.

394
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:38,710
Thua.

395
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,681
I hate to see Aye covering for Akk like this.

396
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:47,431
You don’t have to do the same for me, Kan.

397
00:34:56,773 --> 00:34:57,573
Got it.

398
00:35:01,354 --> 00:35:02,370
I’m going home.

399
00:35:03,554 --> 00:35:05,162
My mom has been waiting.

400
00:35:05,782 --> 00:35:06,612
Wait.

401
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,762
Why did you change so much?

402
00:35:15,002 --> 00:35:16,172
I think I just feel ashamed

403
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:20,800
seeing younger students make such sacrifices and then be threatened.

404
00:35:22,476 --> 00:35:27,727
I think every change requires sacrifice.

405
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,552
If my bad action could change anything at all,

406
00:35:38,268 --> 00:35:39,438
it was worth it.

407
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,275
What are you thinking about?

408
00:36:22,272 --> 00:36:23,843
You didn’t ask me to come along.

409
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:27,150
Why did you follow me here?

410
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:28,966
To keep you company, as a boyfriend.

411
00:36:38,662 --> 00:36:39,463
What are you thinking?

412
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:49,646
I’m just thinking beliefs have a huge influence on us humans.

413
00:36:49,736 --> 00:36:50,555
Exactly.

414
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,382
Beliefs determine what people do.

415
00:36:57,117 --> 00:37:04,218
Some people even believe that their own thoughts and actions are the only ones that are right.

416
00:37:06,387 --> 00:37:10,123
Sometimes, that violates other people’s rights.

417
00:37:13,127 --> 00:37:14,591
Like me before I met you.

418
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:18,536
Actually, you changed me too somehow.

419
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:20,096
Me?

420
00:37:20,353 --> 00:37:21,122
Yes.

421
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:24,607
Before this, I liked to stereotype people.

422
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:32,283
When I saw people like you, I would flag immediately that I hate this guy.

423
00:37:32,512 --> 00:37:33,464
I hate this type of person.

424
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,084
We are totally different.

425
00:37:37,984 --> 00:37:38,723
True.

426
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:49,568
About this morning,

427
00:37:50,557 --> 00:37:51,443
what are you going to do?

428
00:37:57,202 --> 00:37:58,881
You and you

429
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,340
must be actors in my short film.

430
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:02,491
No.

431
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:04,480
If you don’t do it,

432
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:09,395
people will think Wat, Kan, and Aye are lying to cover what you did.

433
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:10,577
Yes.

434
00:38:11,097 --> 00:38:12,368
He got a point.

435
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:17,523
By the way, how did you end up in our meeting?

436
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:21,635
I want to work with you.

437
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:22,545
Please.

438
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,545
Let me join the team.

439
00:38:26,257 --> 00:38:27,678
What do you say, director?

440
00:38:29,736 --> 00:38:30,412
Okay.

441
00:38:31,505 --> 00:38:34,736
But you can’t just go around and do anything without telling us again.

442
00:38:37,327 --> 00:38:40,613
I told them you continued doing the fake curse after me.

443
00:38:43,513 --> 00:38:44,736
I’m sorry.

444
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:50,710
I promise if I get accepted, I won’t do that again.

445
00:38:53,603 --> 00:38:54,264
Fine.

446
00:38:55,357 --> 00:38:56,656
You gave us the promise.

447
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:02,097
Thua, you’re a good writer.

448
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:04,010
Write the script for me.

449
00:39:04,836 --> 00:39:05,442
Sure.

450
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:07,230
But isn’t it a documentary movie?

451
00:39:08,336 --> 00:39:09,496
You want me to add the fictional part to it?

452
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:10,870
Yes.

453
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:12,406
I think it would make it more interesting.

454
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:15,148
What should the story be about?

455
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,416
How about you and Kan?

456
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,714
Me and Kan?

457
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:22,383
Yeah.

458
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:25,296
And Akk and Aye.

459
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,275
Me too.

460
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:30,704
I’ve never written a screenplay before.

461
00:39:31,144 --> 00:39:33,256
I don’t know if it will be good.

462
00:39:33,392 --> 00:39:34,290
It’s okay.

463
00:39:34,736 --> 00:39:35,838
I’ll help you.

464
00:39:36,377 --> 00:39:37,927
I’m the director’s assistant anyway.

465
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,470
Hold on.

466
00:39:40,056 --> 00:39:41,920
If I agree to be in your film,

467
00:39:42,704 --> 00:39:45,051
that means I’m announcing to the world

468
00:39:46,123 --> 00:39:46,981
that I am…

469
00:39:46,981 --> 00:39:48,372
A BL film actor.

470
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:50,112
I think that’s great.

471
00:39:50,593 --> 00:39:53,436
It’s Thailand’s soft power.

472
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:00,138
I think I will do it.

473
00:40:01,017 --> 00:40:03,146
Wat and Kan helped me after all.

474
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:05,023
Um.

475
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:07,483
Before we play any roles,

476
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,366
let’s play in the water first.

477
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:12,877
In the water?

478
00:40:16,426 --> 00:40:17,416
Aye!

479
00:40:17,931 --> 00:40:19,481
Get down here.

480
00:40:31,836 --> 00:40:34,873
Hey, do you want me to add anything to this scene?

481
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:38,610
I think it’s okay.

482
00:40:41,546 --> 00:40:44,561
Are you going to write the part where I asked you to be my boyfriend but told you to keep it a secret?

483
00:40:46,006 --> 00:40:47,161
I think I am.

484
00:40:47,868 --> 00:40:49,356
Are you okay though?

485
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:51,342
If not…

486
00:40:51,342 --> 00:40:52,328
I’m okay.

487
00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:54,077
Go ahead.

488
00:40:56,096 --> 00:40:56,855
Ah.

489
00:41:08,587 --> 00:41:09,519
Guys.

490
00:41:10,998 --> 00:41:14,552
If you want to stare, stare away.

491
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,082
If you have any questions for us, ask away.

492
00:41:22,557 --> 00:41:25,050
You guys want to know what we are?

493
00:41:25,592 --> 00:41:27,849
Kan, keep it down. Don’t bother other students.

494
00:41:48,916 --> 00:41:50,402
We are boyfriends.

495
00:41:57,103 --> 00:41:58,342
You don’t look convinced.

496
00:41:59,506 --> 00:42:00,606
I’ll show you with this hug.

497
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:10,216
You still don’t look very convinced.

498
00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:11,549
I’ll show you with this cheek kiss.

499
00:42:14,393 --> 00:42:15,298
Enough.

500
00:42:16,978 --> 00:42:18,856
It was not convincing enough, was it?

501
00:42:19,573 --> 00:42:20,475
I’ll just prove it with this kiss.

502
00:42:20,475 --> 00:42:21,536
That’s enough.

503
00:42:21,536 --> 00:42:22,555
Enough.

504
00:42:23,017 --> 00:42:23,881
Sit down.

505
00:42:23,881 --> 00:42:24,588
This is embarrassing.

506
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:33,485
You two face each other.

507
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:39,255
Imagine the person in front of you to be the one you love the most.

508
00:42:39,563 --> 00:42:41,936
Now close your eyes.

509
00:42:42,073 --> 00:42:44,480
Touch each other’s faces.

510
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,551
Picture him as the most important person in your life.

511
00:42:54,206 --> 00:42:54,983
Aye.

512
00:42:55,476 --> 00:42:56,699
Focus.

513
00:42:57,436 --> 00:42:57,500
Yeah.

514
00:42:58,286 --> 00:43:02,686
Now slowly open your eyes.

515
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,839
And tell him how you feel.

516
00:43:11,296 --> 00:43:11,720
I love you.

517
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:14,948
More and more every day.

518
00:43:19,012 --> 00:43:21,176
Aye, what are you saying?

519
00:43:21,176 --> 00:43:22,195
The camera is rolling.

520
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:23,465
Akk.

521
00:43:26,997 --> 00:43:28,290
Who sent you to mess with this school?

522
00:43:29,002 --> 00:43:30,216
Your old school?

523
00:43:36,256 --> 00:43:37,246
What are you doing?

524
00:43:37,644 --> 00:43:39,138
Your pin tilts.

525
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,092
Let me fix it for you.

526
00:43:41,864 --> 00:43:47,027
So you’d look like The Prefect Club president again.

527
00:43:50,248 --> 00:43:51,266
Cut.

528
00:43:53,366 --> 00:43:54,541
Good acting.

529
00:43:55,188 --> 00:43:55,891
Right, Thua?

530
00:43:55,891 --> 00:43:56,494
Yeah.

531
00:43:56,494 --> 00:43:57,359
Great job.

532
00:43:58,173 --> 00:44:02,176
The next scene will be filmed at the school’s bleachers.

533
00:44:04,485 --> 00:44:05,345
We acted so well.

534
00:44:06,074 --> 00:44:07,107
It wasn’t that difficult.

535
00:44:08,204 --> 00:44:08,940
No.

536
00:44:09,736 --> 00:44:11,296
So did you fall for me first?

537
00:44:14,376 --> 00:44:16,012
Don’t be ridiculous.

538
00:44:18,215 --> 00:44:19,929
You liked me first.

539
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:20,922
I liked you later.

540
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:25,962
What are you smiling at?

541
00:44:28,512 --> 00:44:31,992
It’s the very first time you said you like me.

542
00:44:35,577 --> 00:44:36,441
Sounds very nice.

543
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:38,885
Shut up.

544
00:44:41,157 --> 00:44:41,923
All right.

545
00:44:44,212 --> 00:44:46,212
This way I can listen to your heartbeat closely.

546
00:44:47,156 --> 00:44:48,127
It’s clear.

547
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:53,204
Thump, thump, thump.

548
00:44:56,953 --> 00:44:57,661
Aye.

549
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:58,398
What?

550
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,239
You like it.

551
00:45:04,385 --> 00:45:06,176
Stop talking.

552
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:19,326
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

553
00:45:19,882 --> 00:45:23,576
Every battle leads to a change.

554
00:45:23,576 --> 00:45:28,029
If we want Suppalo to still stand, it must adjust.

555
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:32,400
If I could choose anything, I would choose to tell you…

556
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,608
Hug me tight.

557
00:45:33,908 --> 00:45:35,150
In case you have a nightmare again tonight.
