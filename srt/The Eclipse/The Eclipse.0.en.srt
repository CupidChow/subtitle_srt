1
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:27,929
Suppalo School’s pride is in your hand, Akk.

2
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:35,784
Because our school has rules, we have pride.

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,121
To be honest, this is really unexpected for me.
[THANWARIN SUKAPISIT, DIRECTOR]

4
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:45,226
I heard that Prapt just released this novel.

5
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:47,476
I bought it to read.

6
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:50,404
After reading it, I felt that I wanted to make it into a series.

7
00:00:50,404 --> 00:00:51,616
I really like it.

8
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:54,067
The name itself makes me curious.

9
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:56,365
What does the name mean?

10
00:00:56,459 --> 00:01:00,758
It makes me feel like exploring from the beginning.

11
00:01:00,758 --> 00:01:03,040
The author himself is famous,

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:11,892
and personally, I like his writing because it is filled with mystery

13
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:13,376
and involves politics.

14
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:15,606
It also raises questions for society.

15
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:17,792
I contacted the publisher,

16
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:21,880
and they said someone else had already purchased the license.

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,171
At that time, I was also working on proposing a new project for GMMTV.

18
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:30,673
I presented my project to P’Aof.

19
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:34,592
P’Aof handed me this novel, telling me,

20
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:39,615
“I have this project. I think it suits you.”

21
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,018
And it’s this novel, The Eclipse.

22
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,407
I was like, “seriously?”

23
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:46,086
This is what I wanted to do.

24
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:47,926
It's the novel I enjoy reading,

25
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:49,890
and I want to see it in a series version.

26
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,407
It talks about beliefs and our identities.

27
00:01:55,407 --> 00:02:01,720
Of course, we all have some shared experiences at school.

28
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:14,816
We question the reasons behind what we hold onto or believe in, whether they are forced on us by others or come from our beliefs.

29
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:21,972
One day, we realize that those beliefs are no longer reliable

30
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:28,084
and start to question if we really are who we believe we are.

31
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:30,835
This is why I want to make this series.

32
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:32,030
I’m a student prefect.

33
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,190
My duty is to make everyone here follow the rules.

34
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,652
You’re a student. You must abide by the textbook.

35
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:41,224
Good education should be receptive and open to development.

36
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:49,088
These two characters are shaped by different ideals and beliefs.

37
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:52,731
Undoubtedly, when they meet while they have different goals,

38
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:54,723
conflicts stir up.

39
00:02:54,723 --> 00:03:01,403
These conflicts make both of them grow up and learn.

40
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:06,820
They will open their minds to accept opinions or beliefs

41
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,986
they have never believed in before.

42
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,768
The story happens in a high school.

43
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:17,978
I think ideology is one thing,
[FIRST KANAPHAN AS AKK]

44
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:20,329
but learning to accept who we are is another thing.

45
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:28,306
because Akk grows up being fostered by outdated norms.

46
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:32,894
That makes Akk believe that those things are correct and that everyone must abide by the rules.

47
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,439
Wearing uniforms is the right thing to do.

48
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,806
Students mustn’t wear accessories or use mobile phones at school.

49
00:03:36,806 --> 00:03:37,583
He believes these actions are right

50
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,582
until Ayan steps into the school.

51
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:43,027
This character gradually unlocks these things

52
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:46,546
and makes Akk question whether these norms are really right.

53
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:47,669
But he doesn’t force him to believe so.

54
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:53,566
He gradually unties them to make Akk question their righteousness.

55
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:55,898
Don’t let things go out of hand.

56
00:03:57,492 --> 00:03:58,408
Yes, Headmaster.

57
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:04,745
You mustn’t forget that.

58
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:29,806
Akk is calm but hides his feelings well.

59
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:33,947
He doesn’t show how he feels.

60
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:36,540
He doesn’t express if he feels okay or not.

61
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,881
He looks calm and simple.

62
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:41,125
He may look strict from the outside,

63
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,551
but, in fact, many things are hidden inside of him.

64
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:47,222
At school, Akk is the head of the Student Prefect Club.

65
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:52,186
He must make everyone at school follow the rules.

66
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:56,573
This character is 100% different from who I am.

67
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:59,360
For example, while I’m just fooling around,

68
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,858
Akk will be calm, not showing any feelings.

69
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:09,129
This character is obviously in contrast with me.

70
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:11,988
Similarities between Akk and First?

71
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:16,599
It's more about the inside of us rather than our outer character.

72
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,867
I mean, we both hide our feelings.

73
00:05:21,282 --> 00:05:24,743
We keep them to yourselves, waiting for the day they all explode at once.

74
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:27,784
When I feel good, I hide it inside.

75
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:29,042
When I feel bad,

76
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:30,849
I’ll think, “It’s fine. Just let it go.”

77
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:33,686
Until one day, we will reach the point where all these things explode.

78
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:37,397
I think this is what we have in common, and it helps me relate to this character.

79
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:39,608
I’ll work now.

80
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:40,488
No more playing.

81
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,967
Enough.

82
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:54,080
Others may think that P’First is playful,
[LOUIS THANAWIN AS THUAPHU]

83
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,609
but his character in this series is totally different.

84
00:05:56,609 --> 00:05:59,010
To be honest, I think P’First himself is not that playful.

85
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:00,841
He is serious.

86
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:02,789
He is serious when it comes to working.

87
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:05,135
He worked hard preparing for this series.

88
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,511
He has that student prefect vibe,

89
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:09,121
which is suitable for controlling others.

90
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:11,731
He is the head of the student prefect team.

91
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:14,513
He is the leader of Neo and AJ.

92
00:06:14,513 --> 00:06:16,426
The headmaster has selected him.

93
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:18,819
Headmaster Chadok assigns him to keep an eye on other students.

94
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:21,080
If any of them breaks the rule, he must report it to the headmaster.

95
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,298
If there’s a student protest, Akk must take control of the situation.

96
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,723
I think P’First is on top of it.

97
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:27,007
This character suits him very well.

98
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:29,223
To be honest, First is talented.
[KHAOTUNG THANAWAT AS AYAN]

99
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,128
His acting?

100
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:32,963
He can take any role.

101
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:36,247
Yes. I saw him act before.

102
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:38,537
But this time, we get to act together.

103
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:41,262
I have to say he is talented.

104
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,855
He’s a competent actor.

105
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:46,184
If my partner can’t direct his emotion to me well enough,

106
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,977
then I won’t be able to receive it either.

107
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:55,000
You aren’t going to stop, are you?

108
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:08,043
I have to praise First for that.

109
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,851
After we finish shooting any scene,

110
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:15,217
he will tell me, “Hey, let’s go check the monitor.”

111
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:18,253
Usually, I don’t do that.

112
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:19,412
I don’t do that at all.

113
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:21,999
After I finish my scene, I don't check the monitor.

114
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:25,887
But when I work with First,

115
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,760
he asks me to join him.

116
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,935
Everyone will step back.

117
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:30,724
He will try to get through.

118
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:32,329
But you’ll tell others to move.

119
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:34,486
Move.

120
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:37,036
Stick to the designated markings, kids.

121

The first one is …

Don’t use that one.

Ready?

125
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:53,468
Let’s go.

126
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:54,520
Let’s finish in the first take.

127
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,803
You’ve been following me everywhere.

128

Are you into me, student prefect?

I play Ayan in this series.
[KHAOTUNG THANAWAT AS AYAN]

130

This character looks mysterious and complicated.

131
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:17,928
He doesn’t believe in what he thinks is wrong.

132
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:24,603
He doesn't believe in unreasonable things.

133
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:28,840
He is bold and ambitious.

134

One more time.

135
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,473
Maintain your emotions.

Action!

They suck.

You have no right to speak of them this way.

139

What right do you have to talk about Suppalo’s rules this way?

140
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:42,283
You suck.

141
00:08:58,716 --> 00:09:01,470
Ayan is a grade 12 student.

142
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,879
He has just moved to Suppalo School,

143
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,506
where Akk is currently studying.

144
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,755
Ayan moves to this school to dig for the truth.

145
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:14,961
He’s here to search out the truth about his uncle’s death.

146
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:22,944
Ayan changes the mindset of those who have a different ideal.

147
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:25,142
I’m here already.

148
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:26,941
They must pay for what they did.

149
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:33,327
I’m keeping an eye on that new student.

150
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:36,326
He acts so suspicious.

151
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:38,203
I’m very excited.

152
00:09:38,392 --> 00:09:43,592
When I first knew that I'd be taking this role,

153
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:44,454
I was so excited.

154
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:46,490
I really want to play this role

155
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,497
because I think it’s difficult and challenging.

156
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:54,876
But after joining the workshop,

157
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:56,688
I found it pretty scary.

158
00:09:58,105 --> 00:09:58,875
Yes.

159

But now I've adjusted myself to it.

I’m familiar with this character now.

161

P’Khaotung has superb acting skills.
[LOUIS THANAWIN AS THUAPHU]

162
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:08,383
He's such a competent actor.

163
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:11,956
When he acts, responds,

164
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:13,543
and directs his emotion to me,

165
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:15,707
I can receive and sense that he really feels it.

166
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:17,429
Khaotung is good at playing in dramatic scenes.

167
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:19,974
He is seriously good at making himself cry.

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,589
He can even control his tears to fall on one side at a time.

169
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,970
I think that skill is just on another level.

170
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,157
I’m stunned.

171
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
From seeing his skill,

172
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,020
I think his acting already excels.

173
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:32,800
But when I get to work with him,

174
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:37,279
I have to admit that his skills go beyond what I expected.

175
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:41,540
In the scenes when we needed to give and receive emotions,

176
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,675
I could feel an intense impact.

177
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:47,573
Khaotung is very good at directing his emotions to me.

178
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:54,424
Khaotung usually doesn’t have any problem with dramatic scenes.

179
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:59,816
He doesn’t need my help. He can handle it alone.

180
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:01,598
But I can’t.

181
00:11:02,348 --> 00:11:03,463
I can’t go to that extent.

182
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,348
In some scenes,

183
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:06,296
I feel touched, and I can handle it on my own,

184
00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:07,737
but in some scenes,

185
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:12,045
it’s difficult for me to access my character’s emotions.
Khaotung helps me with that.

186
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:14,034
He gives his emotions which I receive.

187
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:16,251
Sometimes, he goes too extra.

188
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:17,998
For example, in a scene in that I had to cry,

189
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:22,743
he directed his emotion toward me so strongly that he was becoming Khaotung, trying to help First.

190
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,399
The director told Khaotung that he went too far.

191
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,312
It felt like he was the real Khaotung who was helping First.

192
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,590
He suggested that Khaotung relax his emotion a bit so that he could remain as Ayan.

193
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,000
It's really touching for me.

194
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:41,331
Suppalo school is a private all-boys school that has long been reputable.

195
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:43,399
When a solar eclipse is near,

196
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,486
a curse falls on Suppalo students who violate the rules.

197
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,145
No school uniform! No school uniform!

198
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,981
That curse again?

199
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:07,881
At first, they planned to assign me a funny role.

200
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:09,198
But I told them that

201
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:12,129
such a character would be too similar to other characters I have played before.

202
00:12:12,425 --> 00:12:15,556
I was watching Neo play his scene in front of the monitor.

203
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:20,440
I couldn't stop myself even once from saying, “Neo, you’re handsome.”

204
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:22,647
Thuaphu is the class president.

205
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:28,939
Those who look at him from the outside or don't know him personally will think he's calm.

206
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,608
Action!

207
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:31,438
Hey, stop!

208
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:32,848
Stop.

209
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:34,467
Needed your wife to rescue you?

210
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,079
I know you’ve come to mess with my school.

211
00:12:56,548 --> 00:13:01,319
It’s the only way to know how your school handles people who disagree with it.

212
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:04,925
Ayan, do you like Thua or Akk exactly?

213
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,999
I play the role of Kanlong.

214
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:09,971
Actually, his character…

215
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:15,485
What we can obviously see, he’s hot-headed.

216
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:16,587
He loves his pals.

217
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:20,282
His outer appearances…

218
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:24,022
Well, the script describes him as a popular kid.

219
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:29,302
When he’s among people, he acts cool because he’s the center of attention.

220
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:37,219
At first, they planned to assign me a funny role.

221
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:38,383
But I told them that

222
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:41,265
such a character would be too similar to other characters I have played before.

223
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,582
Because I have starred in many series this year.

224
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:45,677
So I asked them to adjust my character.

225
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:52,382
I wanted it to contrast with my own character. No more hilariousness or so much comedy.

226
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:59,119
I needed to change my voice to speak and the way I walk.

227
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:00,388
Tired.

228
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:02,235
He was so great.

229
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,244
He could make me mad.

230
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:08,384
He’s good.

231
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:11,421
It was a hot scene, huh?

232
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,989
Yes. The weather is hot.

233
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:15,661
Boiling hot.

234
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:17,861
The weather and the co-star made it so hot.

235
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:23,968
Kanlong is not a complete difference. He’s just a different side of me.

236
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:27,166
Like when I’m with my parents, I’m in a different mode.

237
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,043
With other people, a different mode.

238
00:14:29,324 --> 00:14:33,487
Kanlong is just one of many modes I have in life.

239
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:37,818
It’s challenging because I must make people believe the character really feels it.

240
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:39,294
He’s pretty calm.

241
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:45,015
Because I have my own obvious character.

242
00:14:46,223 --> 00:14:48,862
So I must erase that.

243
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:53,947
In the first queues, I was kind of lost a little about what Kanlong should be.

244
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:59,464
The director said I was too calm. I forced it too much. Sometimes, I couldn’t control it.

245
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:05,801
I didn’t know what was right because I wanted to show the differences between him and the characters I’d played before.

246
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:07,076
It was so fun.

247
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:08,923
The more I played, the more fun it got.

248
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,870
I was thinking.

249
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:16,495
It wasn’t the time to smile widely yet.

250
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,516
Neo is still Neo.

251
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:23,306
In scenes with a student prefect, AJ…

252
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:26,668
If they’re supposed to be funny, he could do it just fine. He went full-on.

253
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:30,329
But for serious scenes, people didn’t see the serious Neo very often.

254
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,558
Me neither.

255
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:34,594
But I got to see that in this series. He had his serious side as well.

256
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:37,209
His looks became more serious.

257
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,167
When he loves, he loves.

258
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:43,156
When he isn’t okay, he shows it.
When he disagrees, he shows it too.

259
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:46,766
People haven’t got to see this version of Neo yet. Neither have I.

260
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:49,653
People haven’t got to see this version of Neo yet. Neither have I.

261
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:54,093
Please look forward to seeing how he acts. It’s completely changed.

262
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:55,212
Sassy.

263
00:15:55,212 --> 00:15:59,077
Neo is a wicked kid.

264
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:02,802
He likes to mess with this person and that person all the time.

265
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:07,438
What’s funny is that he knows his camera angle.

266
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:14,648
When he films a series, he turns his perfect angle to the camera.

267
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:17,685
I was watching Neo play his scene in front of the monitor.

268
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,459
I couldn't stop myself even once from saying, “Neo, you’re handsome.”

269
00:16:23,264 --> 00:16:24,273
Where is P’Jade?

270
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:28,385
Staff: P’Jade, someone wants to prank you.

271
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:31,358
- Boo.
- Argh!!

272
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:33,787
Staff: I’ve got goosebumps.

273
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:36,850
Thuaphu is the class president

274
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:39,817
of all 12 graders in Suppalo School.

275
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:41,422
Greet the teacher.

276
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:44,310
Hello, teacher.

277
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:49,236
Those who look at him from the outside

278
00:16:49,236 --> 00:16:53,322
or don't know him personally will think he's calm.

279
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:56,184
He doesn’t talk very much.

280
00:16:56,184 --> 00:17:00,933
But deep down, I think Thuaphu is quite complicated.

281
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:04,157
His mind and his actions are complex.

282
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:10,481
There are two parties in the school against each other.

283
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:15,893
Does my character agree with the school? The answer is not really.

284
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:18,885
But does he agree with the protesters? Not really either.

285
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:23,131
He doesn’t put himself at risk.

286
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:26,475
He just wants to perform his duty. Stay in the middle.

287
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:27,986
Director: And…action!

288
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:28,916
Kanlong, stop!

289
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,363
Stop it!

290
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:32,075
Needed your wife to rescue you?

291
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:34,119
Hey!

292
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,119
What’s interesting about him?

293
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:44,708
He changes his character depending on whom he’s with.

294
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,991
When he’s with those school prefects, he’s calm and quiet.

295
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:59,442
In scenes with P’Khaotung who plays a new kid and seeks the truth about the school curse,

296
00:17:59,442 --> 00:18:04,008
Ayan knows that Thuaphu doesn’t really agree with the school rules that much.

297
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:08,122
Ayan is skeptical but decides to get close to Thuaphu because he’s been a student here for so long.

298
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:10,915
It’s the first time I work with Louis.

299
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,949
He’s a very good actor.

300
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,071
His facial expressions, his gestures, his eyes.

301
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:22,424
I don’t have many stories of Louis to tell because he’s a nice kid.

302
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:26,915
To me, Louis is like a little kid, a very young kid.

303
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:32,056
He isn’t actually that young but I filter him as a little brother all the time.

304
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:34,573
I adore him because he has these vibes…

305
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:39,075
What do you call it? Child-like vibes. So I think he’s adorable.

306
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,385
You’re so great at ROV.

307
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:45,893
Ah! Heavy.

308
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:48,711
I should be the one who carries you.

309
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:51,635
Keep the emotion.

310
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:53,467
Happy?

311
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:54,810
Angry.

312
00:18:55,713 --> 00:19:00,416
Kanlong and Thuaphu have known each other since middle school.

313
00:19:00,836 --> 00:19:04,851
But after they get closer, they get teased.

314
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:07,440
“Do you guys like men?”

315
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,438
Something like that.

316
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:13,085
And Kanlong doesn’t want to get teased.

317
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,079
So he kind of fades away.

318
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,124
But deep down, I feel like they are close.

319
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:28,186
It’s so challenging for a guy who has liked girls and dated girls forever.

320
00:19:28,712 --> 00:19:35,848
One day, he has to come out to his friend that he likes men.

321
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:41,213
He’s very manly. His friends are all boys.

322
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:45,723
Something like this is very hard to say.

323
00:19:45,941 --> 00:19:51,119
Even for the real me. If I was in that situation, I’d have no idea how it would turn out.

324
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,500
I discussed with Neo how we’d portray it to make people feel what we feel.

325
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,136
We worked together.

326
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:02,081
Neo decided to change his character.

327
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,119
What we’ve seen in other series won’t happen here.

328
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,544
He said he wanted to differ it and I thought it was a good idea.

329
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,710
We both changed our characters.

330
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:20,756
When we had love scenes and moments, we decided to go serious.

331
00:20:20,756 --> 00:20:22,790
If they love each other, they love each other.

332
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:27,129
It’s like I put my whole heart into it when I act with Neo.

333
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:29,216
I let myself go freely.

334
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,482
What we have been keeping will be ruined

335
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:34,605
just because of an outsider who doesn’t have faith in it.

336
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:37,531
Don’t you think we’re now in a modern age?

337
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,519
It doesn’t make sense to cling to obsolete rules.

338
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,510
I told you to stop!

339
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,769
Needed your wife to rescue you?

340
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,659
Apart from First, Khaotung, Neo, and Louis,

341
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:57,104
we also have AJ, Ployphach, and Pawin.

342
00:20:57,104 --> 00:21:01,992
These three are so hard-working.

343
00:21:01,992 --> 00:21:05,160
They are beyond my expectation.

344
00:21:05,762 --> 00:21:08,352
Besides these young stars, we also have highly experienced ones.

345
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:12,239
We have Yai Watcharakiat and Sai Charoenpura.

346
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:14,735
Everyone is…how to say this?

347
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:18,869
Just hearing their names and seeing their faces make us feel intimidated.

348
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:25,118
They have the aura of intimidation. Right?

349
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:32,125
But the youngsters give their best too. They fight with their auras.

350
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:38,712
Sai and Yai give put everything when working with the young ones.

351
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:43,825
And the young ones fight back. Not that kind of fighting.

352
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:48,527
I mean when they had scenes together, they fought with all their skills and abilities.

353
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:50,142
And it was so fun to watch.

354
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,444
It was unexpected.

355
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:56,623
I was afraid at first for the young actors if they’d feel stressed out working with big names.

356
00:21:56,623 --> 00:22:02,446
But when they did, the work turned out perfect and super interesting.

357
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:13,775
We will witness the argument on ideals from both sides, from highly-experienced actors like Sai or Yai and the young ones like First and Khaotung.

358
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:15,558
It’s incredible.

359
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:21,619
There’s a scene where Ayan raises his hand to answer the teacher’s question.

360
00:22:22,682 --> 00:22:24,338
It isn’t a normal question and answer.

361
00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:30,737
It’s a mental fight to see who is stronger.

362
00:22:31,244 --> 00:22:32,605
That’s what I felt.

363
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:42,510
In that scene, the teacher is trying to intimidate Ayan using her power, but not in the right way.

364
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:46,279
He keeps talking back over and over.

365
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:48,506
He thinks he is right.

366
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:50,916
P’Sai plays the role of a teacher.

367
00:22:51,192 --> 00:22:54,765
She’s so strict. Everyone is scared of her.

368
00:22:55,102 --> 00:22:58,478
I was scared of her too at first because she looks fierce.

369
00:22:59,054 --> 00:23:01,840
Her postures and gestures are intimidating when she doesn't speak.

370
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,765
Even without any facial expression, she looks cold already.

371
00:23:05,765 --> 00:23:07,289
I went, “Hello, P’Sai.”

372
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:09,505
She was like “Oh, hi!”

373
00:23:09,505 --> 00:23:12,698
She is actually so nice. She is very friendly.

374
00:23:12,698 --> 00:23:14,663
But after “3 2 1 action!”

375
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:18,319
She goes, “Where is your homework? Why didn’t you do it?”

376
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,456
“Answer this question.”

377
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:22,449
She was into her character. She was fierce.

378
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:25,859
Everyone, including the extras, was tense and scared of her.

379
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:30,992
When she acts, she has this aura of…

380
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:34,189
a headmaster or a strict teacher.

381
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:36,799
She can handle any scene.

382
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:40,158
I have scenes with Teacher Chadok, Teacher Waree, and the parents.

383
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:46,889
With Teacher Waree, we don’t actually argue because I’m an obedient student.

384
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:49,795
So we don’t exactly crash.

385
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:56,677
He’s basically the one that stops Ayan from crashing with the teacher.

386
00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:59,930
So scenes with Teacher Waree aren’t that emotionally intense.

387
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:02,733
However, I have many scenes with Teacher Chadok.

388
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:07,484
He gives cold and icy vibes.

389
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:11,574
When Akk is with him, Akk feels tense and stiff.

390
00:24:11,574 --> 00:24:22,061
Chadok has the power, the voice, and the dialogue that show that he’s superior.

391
00:24:22,575 --> 00:24:25,656
In scenes with Chadok, you’ll see he’s speaking above me.

392
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,487
I don’t mean I’m being oppressed.

393
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:36,119
I mean there are clear places where he stands and where I stand.

394
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,596
I don’t stand a chance of arguing with him.

395
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,467
Maybe what we’ve been keeping, the rules and the long-standing reputation,

396
00:24:45,993 --> 00:24:49,074
is ruined because of an outsider who doesn’t have faith like that new kid.

397
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:53,250
Scenes with highly-experienced actors are dramatic scenes where gets confused in his thoughts.

398
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,645
It’s not like he goes full-on about what he thinks. Akk isn’t like that.

399
00:24:58,378 --> 00:25:00,378
They are mostly dramatic scenes.

400
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:06,119
For some dramatic scenes, they didn’t plan the beginning to be so intense because there’s always tension towards the end.

401
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:09,997
But the parents conveyed it so well and it got me so far.

402
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:13,974
The end of the scene had to be even bigger.

403
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:20,382
That magic moment the parents sent to me was so great.

404
00:25:20,382 --> 00:25:26,137
That magic moment the parents sent to me was so great.

405
00:25:26,928 --> 00:25:29,665
I could really feel it from the actors who play the parents.

406
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:32,650
Make yourself at home.

407
00:25:34,027 --> 00:25:35,267
See you in the morning.

408
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:37,575
Good night, Mom and Dad.

409
00:25:37,575 --> 00:25:40,110
Good night.

410
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:48,359
The scene I don’t want you to miss

411
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:53,594
is when First and Khaotung have a fight.

412
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:58,581
You will see love and…

413
00:25:58,885 --> 00:26:06,119
their looks that say I hate you but I love and care for you.

414
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,753
When I was directing this scene, I squealed a little.

415
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:12,850
Staff: We should include this in the series.

416
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:15,661
Staff: There. He’s smiling.

417
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,077
What the heck…are you doing?

418
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:50,533
You’re so weak, Shortstop.

419
00:26:51,988 --> 00:26:53,082
What’s wrong, Big Foot?

420
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,043
You’re tense.

421
00:26:55,598 --> 00:26:57,802
I had to take Judo classes for this series.

422
00:26:57,802 --> 00:27:02,947
In the series, Akk is the best when it comes to Judo.

423
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:07,361
Of the entire class, he’s the best Judo player.

424
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:10,923
But in real life, I’m the weakest in class.

425
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:24,272
We can’t be good at everything.

426
00:27:25,304 --> 00:27:28,568
That’s the contrast between First and Akk.

427
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:35,297
But it’s okay because the fighting and throwing scenes were designed to look realistic.

428
00:27:35,297 --> 00:27:40,347
I must give the credit to Khaotung because I was never the one who got thrown.

429
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,862
Khaotung was.

430
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:58,457
Every time we threw each other, there’s a risk of getting hurt.

431
00:27:58,457 --> 00:28:00,322
I was hurting his ribs and tummy.

432
00:28:00,907 --> 00:28:03,018
Khaotung got all the credits.

433
00:28:03,908 --> 00:28:05,908
He was so patient.

434
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:11,890
There was one cut where I needed to throw him so hard.

435
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,064
And Khaotung needed to scream like he’s in real pain.

436
00:28:15,064 --> 00:28:20,562
I couldn’t even tell whether it’s Khaotung or Ayan who’s hurting.

437
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:22,950
Once I threw him, I was like, “Are you okay?”

438
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,428
It turned out that cut couldn’t be used.

439
00:28:26,428 --> 00:28:30,979
Because I didn’t know if Khaotung was hurt or his character was.

440
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:33,963
Good.

441
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:37,518
That’s it.

442
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:39,635
That’s it.

443
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:54,264
The scenes I don’t want you to miss,

444
00:28:54,575 --> 00:28:59,715
are when First and Khaotung have a fight.

445
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:03,775
Each time they confront, there’s a chemistry.

446
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:13,461
We can clearly see that, whether it is a confrontation about ideologies or different beliefs, they are enemies.

447
00:29:13,606 --> 00:29:19,713
But when they confront, we will see love and…

448
00:29:20,364 --> 00:29:27,511
their looks that say I hate you but I love and care for you.

449
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:31,945
When I was directing these scenes, I squealed a little.

450
00:29:32,721 --> 00:29:33,589
Staff: And…

451
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:35,316
Staff: Okay.

452
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:38,642
Staff: We should include this in the series.

453
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:41,428
Staff: There. He’s smiling.

454
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,798
P’First and P’Khaotung are close friends.

455
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:01,568
I feel like they had been waiting to collab.

456
00:30:01,654 --> 00:30:07,723
Now that they are, their chemistry is flowing because they are close.

457
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:11,718
They are not afraid to act. They express whatever they want.

458
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:15,518
Since they are so close, everything syncs.

459
00:30:15,652 --> 00:30:18,581
The roles and the characters fit them perfectly.

460
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:23,693
P’First is serious and P’Khaotung’s character likes to challenge.

461
00:30:23,895 --> 00:30:26,638
P’Khaotung is so cool in the series.

462
00:30:27,198 --> 00:30:30,870
I don't think anyone has ever seen P'Khaotung in this character before.

463
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:33,321
P’First in this character either.

464
00:30:33,395 --> 00:30:37,643
When they act together, there’s some chemistry that makes us go “Hey!”

465
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:40,044
There’s something.

466
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:43,972
First and I entered the showbiz around the same time.

467
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:47,305
And this is the first time we get to seriously work together.

468
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:48,549
Right.

469
00:30:49,487 --> 00:30:53,296
We had wondered when we would get to collab.

470
00:30:53,296 --> 00:31:02,245
We didn’t have to get paired up. We could just be on the same show or same scenes.

471
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,658
I’ve always wanted to work with First.

472
00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:07,339
Don’t you miss me?

473
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:08,902
I do. Happy now?

474
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:10,960
I do. Happy now?

475
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,954
Now let me go.

476
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,038
That’s enough. Let me go.

477
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:17,855
Put one arm right here and the other goes higher.

478
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,187
Now let me go.

479
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:25,716
Let me go. I have work to do.

480
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:28,924
Give us the script, please.

481
00:31:29,114 --> 00:31:33,548
I learned that I was going to work with Khaotung from P’Som, our manager.

482
00:31:33,548 --> 00:31:34,806
We have the same manager.

483
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,717
I was happy and excited.

484
00:31:37,717 --> 00:31:38,456
But…

485
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,364
How to put this?

486
00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:42,075
It’s happiness and excitement.

487
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:49,053
I was already glad to work with him but everything was clearer after we actually worked together.

488
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:53,766
It was clearer after we had scenes together and directed the emotions to each other.

489
00:31:55,224 --> 00:31:57,224
How happy was I?

490
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:59,127
It’s been 5 years.

491
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:02,250
When I was told to act in dramatic scenes, I jumped right into it.

492
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:04,328
I could do it just fine.

493
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,775
That’s how delighted I was.

494
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:12,817
I have no idea how to explain this feeling for everyone to understand.

495
00:32:13,843 --> 00:32:16,828
It’s gladness that it’s him.

496
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:20,214
It feels great to get paired up with him.

497
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:22,879
We’ve got one click already.

498
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:25,187
It’s me.

499
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,311
I’m checking if the link is right.

500
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:30,979
We’re rehearsing. You don’t have to hit so hard.

501
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,577
[THAT HURTS!]

502
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,133
What do you say after he hits you?

503
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:38,592
That’s violence.

504
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:41,679
This is authoritarianism.

505
00:32:42,013 --> 00:32:46,918
Yes. You’re on your phone and you’re staring at him.

506
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:51,886
Mostly, for dramatic scenes.

507
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:57,441
Before those scenes, he would walk right to me and hold my hand.

508
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:59,687
Rubbed my arms and shoulders.

509
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:02,820
That helped a lot.

510
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:08,703
I could feel the energy he gave me.

511
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:14,012
That scene became a lot easier for me.

512
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:16,825
My technique was to get physical.

513
00:33:17,336 --> 00:33:22,086
Before dramatic scenes, I’d hold his hand.

514
00:33:23,491 --> 00:33:27,907
I feel like when we touch, we connect.

515
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:29,948
We did connect.

516
00:33:30,781 --> 00:33:33,747
I like it when you open up to me like this.

517
00:33:41,372 --> 00:33:43,112
Can you tell me now

518
00:33:44,154 --> 00:33:45,597
how you feel about me?

519
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:51,804
I think it’s the genre everyone can relate to.

520
00:33:52,173 --> 00:33:58,856
This series will speak for students and those who used to be students.

521
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:02,534
There was a moment the boat was wobbly. It almost sank.

522
00:34:03,852 --> 00:34:05,518
Everything almost fell off.

523
00:34:05,518 --> 00:34:06,162
Everyone was like…

524
00:34:06,642 --> 00:34:10,667
I will never forget that incident.

525
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:13,800
So many deadly scenes out there in the sea.

526
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:16,703
So many tough scenes.

527
00:34:16,703 --> 00:34:21,530
I had like 4-5 scenes where I needed to cry, in one day.

528
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:45,131
I just don’t want things to get out of hand.

529
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,744
When you sleep, you’re pretty cute.

530
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:52,611
I told you to stop!

531
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:56,686
I want to kiss you.

532
00:34:58,407 --> 00:35:02,700
The main locations of the series were the school and Akk’s house.

533
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,980
The story is mainly told through Akk.

534
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,919
That's why we will see the school and Akk’s house most of the time.

535
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:10,939
So many deadly scenes at the sea.

536
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,152
So many tough scenes.

537
00:35:14,152 --> 00:35:18,471
I had like 4-5 scenes where I needed to cry, in one day.

538
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:24,318
Shooting the series at the sea improved my acting.

539
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:29,047
Because the environment, the vibes, the wind, and everything pushed me.

540
00:35:29,803 --> 00:35:34,614
Everything there could be absorbed into the character.

541
00:35:35,464 --> 00:35:39,915
There’s one scene where we shot in the sea.

542
00:35:39,915 --> 00:35:41,645
I had to get on a fishing boat.

543
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,859
It wasn’t a big boat.

544
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:48,039
Not as big as a squid fishing boat.

545
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,431
It was a small fishing boat.

546
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,730
Not too small though. I don’t know how to describe it.

547
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:54,959
It was a scene with First.

548
00:35:55,854 --> 00:36:04,397
Two cameras, cameramen, and the staff were all on the boat too.

549
00:36:05,355 --> 00:36:08,861
The boat was so wobbly.

550
00:36:09,784 --> 00:36:14,145
At that moment, the boat was so wobbly it almost sank.

551
00:36:14,704 --> 00:36:16,426
Everything almost fell off.

552
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:17,163
Everyone was like…

553
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:22,401
What do you call it? We tried to balance it.

554
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:29,245
I will never forget that incident.

555
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,698
One camera is worth a million baht.

556
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:33,500
If two fell off, well…

557
00:36:49,527 --> 00:36:50,191
Thank you.

558
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,951
Bye-bye.

559
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:07,417
Seasick.

560
00:37:08,216 --> 00:37:14,353
I think it’s the series everyone can relate to.

561
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:17,098
Everyone went to high school.

562
00:37:17,098 --> 00:37:20,725
And those who are still in high school know the problems.

563
00:37:20,725 --> 00:37:28,300
Those who finished high school already might share the same experiences. They know how high school affected them.

564
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:35,743
This series will speak for students and those who used to be students.

565
00:37:35,743 --> 00:37:43,760
It will talk about the norms and the ideology crash between people in the old and new generations.

566
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,902
Between teachers and students.

567
00:37:44,902 --> 00:37:46,207
Even between students and students.

568
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:47,384
Everyone goes through this.

569
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:49,853
We all relate to it.

570
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:59,617
What’s more special than the shared experience is the contemporary characters.

571
00:37:59,854 --> 00:38:03,900
I feel like it’s a coming-of-age series.

572
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:13,732
Each one of the characters gradually grows up, learns about each other, and slowly develops.

573
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:16,808
Everyone is slowly polished.

574
00:38:17,738 --> 00:38:25,516
Actually, I think it’s not so far from us.

575
00:38:25,516 --> 00:38:33,026
The Eclipse talks about a whole country minimized in a form of a school.

576
00:38:33,323 --> 00:38:36,897
It shows many aspects and my opinions.

577
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:41,064
Why do the adults think that way and why do the children think that way?

578
00:38:41,427 --> 00:38:46,912
It talks about friendship too.

579
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:51,080
There are disagreements.

580
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,617
What I want you to see in this series is the character of each one of them.

581
00:38:55,742 --> 00:38:59,721
Each character thinks differently.

582
00:38:59,721 --> 00:39:04,120
There were lots of unexpected things happening in the scenes.

583
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,110
Lots of magic moments that were not scripted.

584
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,718
Those moments happened with all the actors I worked with.

585
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:13,059
There was a lot.

586
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:17,510
And they are surely interesting.

587
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,904
These are what’s promising.

588
00:39:20,078 --> 00:39:27,092
Besides the ideals and self-acceptance, magic moments are what you might want to watch

589
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:37,685
I used to be scared of love

590
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:41,947
Scared of disappointment

591
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:48,266
Scared of getting weakened

592
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:51,587
I used to be scared of loneliness

593
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:56,426
Scared of being defeated

594
00:39:56,426 --> 00:39:59,764
But today

595
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,849
The day I meet you

596
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:08,329
The day we stand side by side

597
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:13,307
There’s only one fear left in mind

598
00:40:14,647 --> 00:40:20,604
I’m afraid I’d regret not saying

599
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:28,941
These words inside I’ve been keeping

600
00:40:28,941 --> 00:40:34,802
What if tomorrow we miss each other

601
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:42,263
What if you find someone better

602
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:47,197
Cus every time I see your smile

603
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:48,682
Baby right now

604
00:40:48,682 --> 00:40:52,263
I want that forever, not overnight

605
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:56,689
You are feeling what I’m feeling

606
00:40:56,689 --> 00:40:58,798
Am I right?

607
00:40:58,798 --> 00:41:02,062
The day I meet you

608
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:05,616
The day we stand side by side

609
00:41:05,616 --> 00:41:11,266
There’s only one fear left in mind

610
00:41:12,026 --> 00:41:17,946
I’m afraid I’d regret not saying

611
00:41:17,946 --> 00:41:26,158
These words inside I’ve been keeping

612
00:41:26,158 --> 00:41:32,144
What if tomorrow we miss each other

613
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:39,441
What if you find someone better

614
00:41:43,409 --> 00:41:45,791
In this confusing world

615
00:41:46,352 --> 00:41:50,915
Full of cruel people

616
00:41:50,915 --> 00:41:56,199
You’re the moonlight shining down

617
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:00,921
You changed the gloomy world

618
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:05,163
Putting up the sky full of stars

619
00:42:05,163 --> 00:42:09,605
Now I’m over the moon

620
00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:14,999
I’m afraid I’d regret not saying

621
00:42:15,405 --> 00:42:23,566
These words inside I’ve been keeping

622
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:29,547
What if tomorrow we miss each other

623
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:36,687
What if you find someone better

624
00:43:01,188 --> 00:43:06,426
Please watch The Eclipse every Friday at 8:30 p.m. on GMM 25.

625
00:43:06,426 --> 00:43:09,870
You can also watch the rerun on Viu at 10:30 p.m.

626
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:12,265
The first episode premiers on 12 August.

627
00:43:12,265 --> 00:43:13,276
Please don’t miss it.

628
00:43:13,638 --> 00:43:14,581
Hope you enjoy it.

629
00:43:14,581 --> 00:43:15,082
Please enjoy.

630
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:20,702
Newbie.

631
00:43:20,949 --> 00:43:22,912
Why are you not wearing the school uniform?

632
00:43:24,277 --> 00:43:25,962
You punch me once,

633
00:43:26,963 --> 00:43:28,671
I kiss you once.

634
00:43:33,538 --> 00:43:37,044
Ever since you joined, this school has been full of chaos.

635
00:43:37,044 --> 00:43:38,399
WHEN THE RULE KEEPER

636
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:40,819
That’s the new kid from Parot School named Ayan.

637
00:43:42,173 --> 00:43:43,146
GETS SHAKEN BY THE RULE BREAKER

638
00:43:43,335 --> 00:43:45,537
I know you came to mess with my school.

639
00:43:45,537 --> 00:43:47,216
When a solar eclipse is near,

640
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:50,352
a curse falls on Suppalo students who violate the rules.

641
00:43:55,812 --> 00:43:58,419
Keep an eye on Ayan. Find out what he really wants.

642
00:43:58,419 --> 00:44:00,930
You’re a student. You must abide by the textbook.

643
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:04,984
Good education should be receptive and open to development.

644
00:44:05,302 --> 00:44:06,866
I agree with Ayan.

645
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:09,421
You’ve been following me everywhere.

646
00:44:10,245 --> 00:44:11,986
Are you into me, student prefect?

647
00:44:14,813 --> 00:44:17,946
Akk, do you realize you’ve changed?

648
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,263
What the heck are you doing?

649
00:44:19,886 --> 00:44:21,057
Why are you protecting him?

650
00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:24,045
Needed your wife to rescue you?

651
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:26,826
I don’t want to see you get hurt like that again.

652
00:44:28,108 --> 00:44:28,880
Ayan,

653
00:44:29,195 --> 00:44:30,826
do you like Tua or Akk exactly?

654
00:44:35,216 --> 00:44:36,856
What the heck…are you doing?

655
00:44:41,601 --> 00:44:43,399
You’re so weak, Shortstop.

656
00:44:44,738 --> 00:44:45,904
What’s wrong, Big Foot?

657
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:47,930
You’re tense.

658
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,629
I like it when you open up to me like this.

659
00:45:03,288 --> 00:45:05,063
Can you tell me now

660
00:45:06,155 --> 00:45:07,615
how you feel about me?

661
00:45:11,301 --> 00:45:13,301
I just don’t want things to get out of hand.

662
00:45:13,643 --> 00:45:17,060
When you sleep, you’re pretty cute.

663
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:20,940
I told you to stop!

664
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,931
I want to kiss you.

665
00:45:26,264 --> 00:45:27,994
Can I kiss you?

666
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:38,718
DIRECTED BY TANWARIN SUKKHAPISIT

667
00:45:38,718 --> 00:45:39,699
I miss you.

668
00:45:40,212 --> 00:45:41,426
Kiss my cheek first.
