4
00:00:20,482 --> 00:00:21,640
Is there anything you need?

5
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:24,342
Take it off.

6
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:26,647
Tell your legal guardian to get it back later.

7
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:27,402
Take it off.

8
00:00:27,802 --> 00:00:28,596
No.

9
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:36,098
You’re violating my rights, rule keeper.

10
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,983
Are you looking for something?

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,840
Looking for the table of the traitor who moved to his old school, I guess.

12
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:47,271
I’m sure he’s plotting something bad against our school.

13
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:49,838
And now there’re students protesting.

14
00:00:49,838 --> 00:00:52,687
If they join forces, I’m afraid we can’t handle them.

15
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:57,092
Don’t you even think you can blind people,

16
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:58,172
authoritarian.

17
00:00:58,172 --> 00:00:59,994
Did you get brainwashed by Teacher Dika?

18
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:01,538
You are both rebellious.

19
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,080
That’s why he couldn’t be in this school.

20
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:05,671
You’re tough on the outside.

21
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:06,663
But on the inside…

22
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:08,643
Will you stop or not?

23
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:11,751
Hey, don’t!

24
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:17,559
What did you speak to them?

25
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:21,984
Ayan.

26
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:25,684
What’s your secret deal with them?

27
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:26,440
Reveal it.

28
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:29,725
You really want to know about that

29
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:32,881
or want to have some alone time with me?

30
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:36,062
What a narcissist.

31
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:38,105
Who would want to be close to you?

32
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:40,624
Why not?

33
00:01:41,337 --> 00:01:43,420
What can be a problem if you’re close to me?

34
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:50,371
Nothing.

35
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:51,929
I feel nothing.

36
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:55,200
Don’t come closer. I don’t like it.

37
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:56,443
Really?

38
00:01:57,905 --> 00:01:58,934
Ayan!

39
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:00,470
What?

40
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:03,529
You said you felt nothing being close to me.

41
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:08,390
Don’t come closer

42
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,804
or I’ll hit you.

43
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:15,181
Ouch!

44
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:18,119
Let me see.

45
00:02:20,077 --> 00:02:21,191
There.

46
00:02:21,673 --> 00:02:22,969
You’ve got a splinter.

47
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,509
None of your business.

48
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:29,239
What are you doing?

49
00:02:29,436 --> 00:02:30,200
Give me your hand.

50
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:32,340
What are you doing?

51
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,000
Get the splinter out.

52
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:41,272
Ayan, don’t!

53
00:02:42,636 --> 00:02:43,296
Scared?

54
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,447
Stay put.

55
00:02:45,702 --> 00:02:46,648
I’m not scared.

56
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:48,513
Be still. I’m getting it out.

57
00:03:02,705 --> 00:03:03,445
Hey!

58
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,840
Where’s the ‘thank you?’

59
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:35,571
Naphthalene consists of a fused pair of benzene rings.

60
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:37,683
What’s its other name, students?

61
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,861
Smells bad.

62
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:41,794
What smells bad?

63
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:43,009
Wasuwat just farted, ma’am.

64
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:47,156
Mothballs, ma’am.

65
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:47,999
That’s correct.

66
00:04:57,414 --> 00:04:58,652
What are you staring at?

67
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:00,200
Pay attention.

68
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
[Have you thanked me yet?]

69
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:25,045
It’s not the time.

70
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:27,077
Stay focused.

71
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:44,372
If you can’t abide by the school rules,

72
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:48,254
you will grow up to be law violators.

73
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:50,125
Criminals.

74
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,525
Got it?

75
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:53,984
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:59,928
Today, our representatives will lead us in reciting the pledge.

77
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:02,689
Come in.

78
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:14,831
You’ve got something to say?

79
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:18,498
Well?

80
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:21,240
Or do you want me to invite your parents here?

81
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,320
I…

82
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,157
I what?

83
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,245
Say it.

84
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:35,355
Repeat it until it implants in your subconscious.

85
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,834
Do it!

86
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:43,880
I pledge…

87
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,726
Start over!

88
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:45,987
Together!

89
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:53,835
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,558
Say it again.

91
00:06:55,718 --> 00:07:02,953
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

92
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:05,920
Now, everyone, say it together.

93
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:08,057
Do it!

94
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:15,280
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

95
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,362
One more time.

96
00:07:19,782 --> 00:07:38,605
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

97
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,229
To prevent the curse and bad things from happening,

98
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,779
we must unite as one

99
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,090
and only strictly adhere to Suppalo’s rules.

100
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,155
Got it?

101
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:51,610
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,521
Got it?

103
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:53,675
Yes, sir.

104
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,522
Recite the pledge again.

105
00:07:55,844 --> 00:08:01,948
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

106
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:02,850
Again.

107
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:09,290
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

108
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:29,282
The Prefect Club has awarded our school a long-standing prestigious reputation.

109
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:32,720
You,

110
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,720
as the club's current president,

111
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:40,200
I hope the school's reputation isn’t ruined under your watch.

112
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:42,126
Yes, sir.

113
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:46,422
How is the new kid doing?

114
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,920
I think he came to mess with our school.

115
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:54,320
Ever since he joined, ‘The World Remembers’ gang has never quit protesting

116
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:56,627
regardless of how many times they've been affected by the curse.

117
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:04,254
They have no idea what the curse will do if they keep on being stubborn.

118
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:16,527
(I pledge…)

119
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:17,458
(Start over!)

120
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,720
(I pledge…)

121
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,209
Better keep your phone away.

122
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:28,611
Students aren’t allowed to use it.

123
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:35,627
This school is afraid its students will be smart or something?

124
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,484
We won’t be here for long anyway.

125
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,971
If we can let it slide, we better do it.

126
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:44,375
Let it slide?

127
00:09:45,562 --> 00:09:49,430
So you agree with me that the school rules are trash, don’t you?

128
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,414
I’m not saying that.

129
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:55,331
Whatever you disagree, say it.

130
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:02,981
You have the right to stand by your own opinion.

131
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:05,200
It’s even your duty to do so.

132
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:08,183
Why are you playing it safe?

133
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:09,920
I’m not playing it safe.

134
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:12,022
I’m being neutral.

135
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:13,296
Neutral?

136
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,401
This morning in the meeting room,

137
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:21,896
you weren’t okay that the mean-spirited man publicly humiliated the other students.

138
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:23,111
Were you okay with that?

139
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:27,205
You know it well but choose to stay silent.

140
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:28,629
You care about nothing.

141
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,369
To me, you’re not different than those power-crazed dictators.

142
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,694
I…

143
00:10:34,694 --> 00:10:37,379
Your voice matters.

144
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:41,618
You just need to say what you’re thinking.

145
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,217
Aye.

146
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,164
Aye!

147
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:56,702
Aye, wait.

148
00:10:58,299 --> 00:10:59,176
Aye!

149
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:04,446
What you just said, what does it mean?

150
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,300
Hey! What’s wrong with your guys?

151
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,939
Why making a grumpy face?

152
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:30,458
Don’t tell me you’re jealous of Thua and Aye.

153
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:33,433
You won’t stop accusing me of liking Thua, will you?

154
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:34,610
You want a problem?

155
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:35,653
What?

156
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,279
If you don’t have a crush on him, why are you making that face?

157
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,834
I’m afraid Aye would mess with Thua’s head

158
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:48,100
just like what he did to The World Remembers.

159
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:50,670
Are you sure?

160
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,543
Yes.

161
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:53,760
Ask Akk.

162
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,091
Aye is a head spinner, right?

163
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:56,550
Right.

164
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,400
I don’t know what he’s putting in Thua’s head.

165
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:04,000
If you two want to know, why don’t we go ask them?

166
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:05,584
- No.
- No.

167
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:07,382
What?

168
00:12:07,382 --> 00:12:09,714
You want to know but don’t want to ask.

169
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:12,055
And you think it all in your heads.

170
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,728
I'll ask him later.

171
00:12:14,728 --> 00:12:16,491
We’re making rounds here. Let’s go.

172
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:17,308
What are you waiting for?

173
00:12:19,308 --> 00:12:20,300
Come.

174
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:27,002
Thua. Aye.

175
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:27,821
Kan and…

176
00:12:32,487 --> 00:12:33,514
What’s the matter with them?

177
00:12:34,595 --> 00:12:35,371
Exactly.

178
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:36,654
No idea.

179
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,199
Aye,

180
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,206
you know you can’t say what you said to me to anyone else in this school, right?

181
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:49,659
I know.

182
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:52,642
Okay.

183
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,104
I’ll go to the library now.

184
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,122
Wait.

185
00:12:58,137 --> 00:12:59,351
Are you free this Saturday?

186
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:01,627
Why?

187
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,087
Get it under control, Akk.

188
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:10,416
Don’t let things get out of hand.

189
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,520
So all this is just to threaten us?

190
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,016
The curse doesn’t have hands to do this.

191
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,983
How about we hear what The World Remembers offers and find a way to compromise?

192
00:13:22,496 --> 00:13:24,766
I actually don’t like what that gang is doing.

193
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:28,121
Do you think we can reverse the curse in time?

194
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:33,576
I just came to see who you’re meeting.

195
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:35,637
Who do you think I’m meeting?

196
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:37,363
Aye.

197
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:38,978
What if I’m meeting him?

198
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:40,800
Do I need to be followed?

199
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:42,670
I’m worried about you.

200
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:08,361
Here.

201
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:10,592
Take a look.

202
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:16,269
The protest video in our school is now on the internet.

203
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:17,472
People are tweeting about it.

204
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,636
The parents are not happy about this.

205
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:27,086
Do you realize how damaging this could be to our reputation?

206
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:31,873
We're finding the way to handle this, principal.

207
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,364
Fix it now.

208
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:37,046
We can't afford to lose more sponsors.

209
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:38,267
Do you get it?

210
00:14:38,498 --> 00:14:39,375
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:50,525
What are we going to do, sir?

212
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:55,174
We must take drastic measures.

213
00:14:57,472 --> 00:14:59,927
How about we hear what The World Remembers offers

214
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:02,151
and find a way to compromise?

215
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:04,730
They should know we're listening.

216
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,496
Listening?

217
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:08,732
Listening to those kids?

218
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:12,389
All right then.

219
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,902
You deal with them the way you see fit.

220
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:19,691
As for me, I'll deal with them my way.

221
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,312
The social media age is garbage.

222
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,449
This video has gone viral.

223
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:32,074
From now on,

224
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:34,324
if you see students using their phones in school,

225
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:35,397
take it from them.

226
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:39,124
Got it?

227
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:42,962
Yes, sir.

228
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:45,841
The new kid and that gang, what's the news on them?

229
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:49,005
I do think he's behind the gang's protest.

230
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,885
The other day, he said a few words and they followed his instructions.

231
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:54,489
Get it under control, Akk.

232
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,933
Don't let things get out of hand.

233
00:15:58,734 --> 00:15:59,611
Yes, sir.

234
00:16:23,105 --> 00:16:24,169
What are you looking for?

235
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:25,668
Need some help?

236
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:28,751
It's okay.

237
00:16:29,102 --> 00:16:30,146
I've got everything.

238
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:36,389
You're doing our group report, why didn't you tell me?

239
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:41,145
You always come to sleep.

240
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:42,653
I can do it myself.

241
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:47,041
Do you have any business with me following me here?

242
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:51,685
I just came to see who you're meeting.

243
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,570
Who?

244
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:55,692
Who do you think I'm meeting?

245
00:16:58,497 --> 00:16:59,287
Aye.

246
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:01,887
What if I'm meeting him?

247
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:03,677
Do I need to be followed?

248
00:17:04,164 --> 00:17:05,501
I'm worried about you.

249
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:09,216
I mean'

250
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:11,680
you should watch out for Aye.

251
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,159
The teachers and Akk are suspecting he's messing with our school.

252
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:22,575
And you're afraid I'd be affected by the curse?

253
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:23,864
Like that gang?

254
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,054
Hell, yeah.

255
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:27,824
Your dad graduated here.

256
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:29,552
You should know about this pretty well.

257
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,656
Argh!

258
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:52,969
Is that real blood?

259
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:53,851
[Rules are there to break.]

260
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:54,856
Shit!
[No to school uniform.]

261
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,726
This is scary.
[Uniforms don't make us smarter.]

262
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:57,823
Must be the curse.

263
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,420
When will you guys learn?

264
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,873
Must be the curse.

265
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:02,586
Oh, come on!

266
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:04,192
No way.

267
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,109
The curse, my ass.

268
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,623
Someone is behind this.

269
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,352
Who is?

270
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,462
That's blood.

271
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:17,338
The curse, for sure.

272
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:19,267
Guys.

273
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,002
Is it because we broke the pledge?

274
00:18:59,002 --> 00:18:59,982
Nong!

275
00:18:59,982 --> 00:19:01,134
The pledge, my foot.

276
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:02,588
I saw your fingers crossed when you said it.

277
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:04,229
Are you guys nuts?

278
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,952
Stop being paranoid.

279
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:07,588
Especially you, Nong.

280
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,528
Well, it's really scary.

281
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:12,759
This means what you're doing is working.

282
00:19:14,518 --> 00:19:17,228
It bothers someone's allegiance to Suppalo so much

283
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:19,393
that they threatened you.

284
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:23,293
So all this is just to threaten us?

285
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,620
The curse doesn't have hands to do this.

286
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:30,982
Listen to that and stop being scared, Nong.

287
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:36,283
They just want us to feel frightened and stop protesting.

288
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:37,798
Are you guys frightened?

289
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:45,612
If we are, we would already stop when the flower pot almost fell on us.

290
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:53,865
Then I'm gonna need to send them a sign saying their threat didn't work.

291
00:19:55,329 --> 00:20:00,675
Nong, Nian, it's time we intensify our protest.

292
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:03,603
Fight!

293
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,948
I grouped these papers by rows.

294
00:20:13,948 --> 00:20:15,856
Take the one with your name on it and pass the rest to your friends.

295
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:17,906
Yes, ma'am.

296
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:23,855
That's mine.

297
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:36,529
Are we done yet?

298
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:41,710
Okay.

299
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,961
You have the aptitude test result for the next educational level, correct?

300
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:48,029
I hope it matches the faculty you're leaning towards.

301
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:49,585
It does, perfectly.

302
00:20:53,156 --> 00:20:53,945
Guys.

303
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:01,258
Have you been doing okay these days, Wat?

304
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:04,637
Nothing is wrong.

305
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,539
You can trust me.

306
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,446
I've got nothing to say.

307
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:13,438
My scores are great in every subject.

308
00:21:14,684 --> 00:21:15,601
Right.

309
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:18,037
You're perfect to be a student in the best class.

310
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,081
Nothing seems wrong.

311
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,984
But I don't know why I feel like you're unhappy.

312
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:33,963
Maybe I've been studying so hard that I look tired.

313
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:38,198
True.

314
00:21:38,391 --> 00:21:40,254
12 graders have loads of work to do.

315
00:21:41,152 --> 00:21:41,881
Yes.

316
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:46,438
Is there anything else, ma'am?

317
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,047
I'm meeting Akk and Kan after this.

318
00:21:53,968 --> 00:21:54,900
No.

319
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,509
You are free to go.

320
00:21:59,248 --> 00:21:59,921
Yes, ma'am.

321
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:14,869
The only thing we can do now is keep an eye on them.

322
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,042
See what they're plotting to do.

323
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:22,539
What are you filming me for?

324
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:26,043
Wow! New camera.

325
00:22:26,297 --> 00:22:27,744
Luxurious stuff.

326
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:29,965
Be careful with it.

327
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:32,960
Have you started your enrollment plan for Communication Arts already?

328
00:22:34,552 --> 00:22:35,318
No.

329
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:36,377
What?

330
00:22:36,692 --> 00:22:38,249
Then why did you invest so much in it?

331
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:41,854
I thought you'd use it to film a short film for your portfolio.

332
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:43,551
Are you out of your mind?

333
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:45,287
My parents would murder me.

334
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:48,497
My family tree is full of doctors and engineers.

335
00:22:50,448 --> 00:22:52,334
So we'll be university students next year.

336
00:22:56,546 --> 00:22:59,373
We will finally be free from this insane curse.

337
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,608
I actually don't like what that gang is doing,

338
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:09,270
but I don't want anything to happen to them.

339
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,036
Do you think we can reverse the curse in time?

340
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,204
Of course.

341
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:18,768
We can do it.

342
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:23,787
Film me.

343
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:32,724
Go!

344
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:34,447
Action!

345
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:36,739
1, 2, 3.

346
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:39,073
♫ Hurt because of what you've done ♫

347
00:23:39,073 --> 00:23:41,744
♫ Is better than doing none ♫

348
00:23:41,744 --> 00:23:46,033
♫ You'll be sorry'da da da' ♫

349
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:48,924
♫ Hear what your heart says ♫

350
00:23:48,924 --> 00:23:51,056
♫ Listen and follow all the way ♫

351
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:56,787
I'm going to wreck Suppalo

352
00:23:58,155 --> 00:24:01,376
and they'll make up for the shit they did, Uncle.

353
00:24:01,615 --> 00:24:04,924
We demand the bad guys to be punished.

354
00:24:04,924 --> 00:24:06,134
Find the bad guys.

355
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:06,872
Hey!

356
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:08,451
Get up!

357
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,181
How did you let it happen?

358
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,575
The world has changed.

359
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:15,306
Things are not as easy as they were in our seniors' years.

360
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:17,051
What are you going to do?

361
00:24:20,966 --> 00:24:22,435
I've come to remind you

362
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,791
about the report for Teacher Waree's class that we do together.

363
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,412
Should we do it now?

364
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:28,189
Let's go.

365
00:24:58,138 --> 00:24:59,176
[The principal]

[Akk]

373
00:25:52,754 --> 00:25:53,790
Have you waited for long?

374
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:58,233
No.

375
00:25:59,337 --> 00:26:00,695
If you’re hungry, you can order something first.

376
00:26:01,337 --> 00:26:02,119
My treat.

377
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:04,723
Thank you.

378
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:12,358
Why are you holding that necklace like that, Uncle?

379
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,236
It’s my technique.

380
00:26:23,176 --> 00:26:24,615
What technique?

381
00:26:28,423 --> 00:26:35,242
When I am anxious, not sure who I am, what I’m doing,

382
00:26:37,316 --> 00:26:39,596
I always hold the necklace tight like this

383
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:44,573
and tell myself it’s alright.

384
00:26:45,636 --> 00:26:47,136
Everything will be okay.

385
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:53,359
And it works.

386
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:32,823
I’m going to wreck Suppalo

387
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:38,013
and they’ll make up for the shit they did, Uncle.

388
00:27:50,172 --> 00:27:53,472
We demand the bad guys to be punished.

389
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:59,034
Find the bad guys.

390
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:00,165
- Find the bad guys.
- Guys!

391
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:01,133
Find the bad guys.

392
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,290
Do not lie down here. It’s the hallway.

393
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,570
Let’s take it inside.

394
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:05,749
- Hey!
- Get up!

395
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:08,906
Get up!

396
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:10,004
No!

397
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,221
No.

398
00:28:11,411 --> 00:28:13,211
If the school doesn’t catch the bad guys,

399
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:15,109
that means this school supports crimes.

400
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,679
And we will protest outside school too.

401
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,313
We will tell every media station.

402
00:28:19,605 --> 00:28:23,685
Everyone will know this school uses violence against students who don’t agree with them.

403
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:25,622
We will stay here.We will not go anywhere.

404
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:26,570
We will be right here.

405
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,821
Move to the gym instead.

406
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:30,043
I will give you guys futons.

407
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:30,900
No.

408
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,296
Guys, please get up.

409
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:33,939
No.

410
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:35,296
We will stay here.

411
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,322
We’ll stay right here.

412
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:37,322
We’re not going anywhere.

413
00:28:39,614 --> 00:28:41,614
If they don’t go themselves, move them.

414
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:44,401
Be careful!

415
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:56,207
Let me go!

416
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,887
I attended the meeting in the city for a few hours.

417
00:29:16,613 --> 00:29:18,133
How did you let it happen?

418
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:21,346
I had no idea this was going to happen.

419
00:29:21,438 --> 00:29:24,758
The problem is not that you did know or did not.

420
00:29:24,758 --> 00:29:30,925
The problem is that after this incident happened, why did you take so long to resolve it?

421
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:33,447
I…

422
00:29:37,206 --> 00:29:38,350
I’m sorry.

423
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:43,066
Keep your apology to the principal and the school board.

424
00:29:46,606 --> 00:29:47,586
They were so stubborn.

425
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:50,476
Teacher Sani did her best.

426
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,654
What about you guys?

427
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,426
Did you do your best?

428
00:29:54,846 --> 00:30:00,446
Do the prefect armbands you’re wearing remind you of your duty?

429
00:30:01,857 --> 00:30:03,857
I will deal with this as soon as possible, sir.

430
00:30:04,565 --> 00:30:06,365
Give us one more chance, Teacher.

431
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:20,998
If you can't handle it,

432
00:30:21,578 --> 00:30:24,166
you can quit this prefect club president thing.

433
00:30:25,028 --> 00:30:25,653
I can.

434
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:26,868
I can handle it.

435
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:28,971
I must do it.

436
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:32,595
I know that

437
00:30:33,555 --> 00:30:37,200
you’d always wanted to be a prefect.

438
00:30:37,578 --> 00:30:39,578
But the world has changed.

439
00:30:39,878 --> 00:30:42,418
Things are not as easy as they were in our seniors’ years.

440
00:30:42,618 --> 00:30:43,278
True.

441
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:46,166
Back then, we didn’t dare talk back to the seniors.

442
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,622
Look at things now.

443
00:30:48,462 --> 00:30:50,898
I warned them against smoking, and they punched me.

444
00:30:53,638 --> 00:30:54,350
I know.

445
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,018
But this is challenging.

446
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,530
We are the prefects now.

447
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,468
If we can do it, that’d be really cool.

448
00:31:03,437 --> 00:31:05,037
We’re trying to reason with you here.

449
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:06,234
Aren’t you gonna change your mind, Akk?

450
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:07,470
No.

451
00:31:07,912 --> 00:31:09,426
I don’t change my mind so easily.

452
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:12,422
What are you going to do then?

453
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,762
Are you stalking me?

454
00:32:01,562 --> 00:32:02,208
No.

455
00:32:02,961 --> 00:32:03,884
I’m making rounds.

456
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:08,800
I’ve come to remind you

457
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:11,099
about the report for Teacher Waree’s class that we do together.

458
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:13,601
I don’t want trouble just because you don’t turn it in.

459
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:15,786
Ah!

460
00:32:19,195 --> 00:32:20,184
Should we do it now?

461
00:32:21,364 --> 00:32:22,815
Do the report at my house.

462
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,426
I will work on my part and send you the file.

463
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:27,993
No.

464
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,622
Do it together.

465
00:32:30,258 --> 00:32:31,318
Get it done together.

466
00:32:35,803 --> 00:32:36,845
I said no.

467
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:37,783
Why not?

468
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:43,498
Are you scared of being alone with me?

469
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,400
Scared, my ass.

470
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,420
What can a small guy like you do?

471
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,235
Exactly.

472
00:32:52,894 --> 00:32:53,774
No need to be scared.

473
00:32:54,874 --> 00:32:55,527
Come on.

474
00:33:08,635 --> 00:33:09,299
Oh!

475
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:10,915
Sorry.

476
00:33:10,915 --> 00:33:11,480
Did I hurt you?

477
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,670
What are you doing?

478
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,810
Taking my clothes off for the shower.

479
00:33:38,662 --> 00:33:40,215
When you’re beat,

480
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:42,615
you’re pretty cute.

481
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:01,442
I can walk myself.

482
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:03,713
But you're slow.

483
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:06,238
Keep up.

484
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,000
Are you afraid of me?

485
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:19,829
I’m not.

486
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,402
Take this.

487
00:34:33,844 --> 00:34:34,680
What’s wrong?

488
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:38,944
Why are you tense every time you’re with me?

489
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:40,784
I’m not.

490
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:42,128
Oh, not at all.

491
00:34:42,202 --> 00:34:43,744
Your shoulders are up so high.

492
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:44,736
Not tense at all.

493
00:34:47,175 --> 00:34:48,997
I’m just stretching my shoulders.

494
00:34:48,997 --> 00:34:50,127
I’m not tense.

495
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:52,104
Oh!

496
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:53,757
Sorry. Did I hurt you?

497
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:06,461
What the heck…are you doing?

498
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:15,716
What did you think I’d do?

499
00:35:29,623 --> 00:35:30,998
Why raising your shoulders again?

500
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,220
Just fatigue.

501
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:51,071
Do you live alone?

502
00:35:52,187 --> 00:35:52,984
Yeah.

503
00:35:59,163 --> 00:36:00,806
You’re pretty nosy.

504
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,498
I’m going to take a shower.

505
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:21,889
My skin feels sticky.

506
00:36:22,464 --> 00:36:23,266
Wait.

507
00:36:24,805 --> 00:36:25,668
What?

508
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,458
Do you want to take a shower with me?

509
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,576
Just go take a shower.

510
00:36:30,817 --> 00:36:31,813
Stop wasting my time.

511
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,201
What are you doing?

512
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:47,494
Taking my clothes off for the shower.

513
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:58,673
Why are you doing it here?

514
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,759
Do it in the bathroom.

515
00:37:01,744 --> 00:37:02,519
Hey,

516
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:03,878
it’s my house.

517
00:37:04,817 --> 00:37:06,114
I can take my clothes off anywhere.

518
00:37:11,201 --> 00:37:12,551
That’s not much to show off.

519
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,239
Don’t make me drag you to the bathroom too.

520
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,327
(Wanna come in?)

521
00:37:29,602 --> 00:37:31,044
Just take a shower, Tiny.

522
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,428
(Asshole!)

523
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:39,750
Akk.

524
00:38:41,544 --> 00:38:42,622
What are you doing with my stuff?

525
00:38:44,394 --> 00:38:45,264
Stay out of it.

526
00:40:24,226 --> 00:40:25,710
When you’re beat,

527
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:28,190
you’re pretty cute.

528
00:41:04,747 --> 00:41:05,921
What are you doing to me?

529
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:10,507
If I’m to do something, I won’t do it when you’re asleep.

530
00:41:11,823 --> 00:41:12,647
It won’t be fun.

531
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:18,426
I’m leaving.

532
00:41:18,904 --> 00:41:19,996
Sleepy.

533
00:41:20,629 --> 00:41:22,629
I’ll take it all from here.

534
00:41:23,392 --> 00:41:24,533
Why are you leaving?

535
00:41:25,158 --> 00:41:26,486
It’s late. Crash here.

536
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,150
No.

537
00:41:29,118 --> 00:41:30,315
I told Kan to pick me up.

538
00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:57,229
Did you find anything suspicious?

539
00:41:58,371 --> 00:41:59,116
Not yet.

540
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,687
He was shadowing me. I didn’t have a chance to look.

541
00:42:01,817 --> 00:42:02,621
I’m pissed.

542
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:06,204
If people find out you’re getting close to him, it won’t be good.

543
00:42:06,835 --> 00:42:07,613
I know.

544
00:42:08,148 --> 00:42:09,705
I don’t want to be close to him.

545
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,461
I’m sick of seeing his face.

546
00:42:11,853 --> 00:42:13,362
Really want to kick his ass.

547
00:42:13,362 --> 00:42:14,827
I dislike him too.

548
00:42:14,828 --> 00:42:16,828
Especially now that he’s messing with Thua.

549
00:42:16,924 --> 00:42:18,478
Honestly, I don’t trust him.

550
00:42:18,631 --> 00:42:21,100
If you’re going to kick his ass, kick it one more time for me.

551
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:22,398
Kick hard.

552
00:42:22,984 --> 00:42:24,329
Sure.

553
00:42:24,957 --> 00:42:26,024
Wait and see.

554
00:42:26,352 --> 00:42:29,981
I’m going to find the evidence and expose his plan to ruin our school.

555
00:42:30,268 --> 00:42:33,339
If I find it, he’ll be expelled.

556
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:35,465
Where will you find it?

557
00:43:25,934 --> 00:43:27,131
I volunteer.

558
00:43:29,504 --> 00:43:30,969
What a narcissist.

559
00:43:31,305 --> 00:43:32,984
Who would want to be close to you?

560
00:43:33,805 --> 00:43:34,734
Why not?

561
00:43:35,548 --> 00:43:37,548
What can be a problem if you’re close to me?

562
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:50,925
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

563
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:54,144
I have no clue what you’re doing.

564
00:43:54,356 --> 00:43:56,445
But if I were you, I’d stop.

565
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:58,928
We found nothing because we only follow him inside school.

566
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,243
What if we follow him outside school?

567
00:44:00,487 --> 00:44:02,984
For a student with high self-confidence like Ayan,

568
00:44:02,984 --> 00:44:06,229
we, as teachers, should prepare him some polishing process.

569
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:08,053
You normally don’t yield easily.

570
00:44:08,144 --> 00:44:10,144
Why did you let them do so much to you?

571
00:44:10,674 --> 00:44:12,808
You won’t be so mean to me too, right?

572
00:44:13,624 --> 00:44:15,222
Why don’t you talk to me these days?

573
00:44:15,588 --> 00:44:18,235
Because you’re uncomfortable when I’m around.

574
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:20,057
Is it weird that two male friends take a shower together?
