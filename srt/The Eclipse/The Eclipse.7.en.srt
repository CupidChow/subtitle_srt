Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:22,404
Once you say you care about other people’s feelings,

5
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:24,884
it means you are disregarding your own.

6
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,801
If he is doing anything, let me know.

7
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:28,965
I’ll deal with him for you.

8
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:30,038
I heard that.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,685
I won’t go

10
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:33,349
I won’t go until I find it.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,632
I’ll crash here tonight.

12
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:49,192
Don’t leave me.

13
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:52,462
Uncle!

14
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:55,416
Don’t leave me.

15
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,763
What are you standing there for?

16
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:00,423
It’s my room.

17
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,480
I stand anywhere I want.

18
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:07,388
What did you do to my jacket?

19
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:09,006
What?

20
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:12,888
I washed it.

21
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:21,792
What are you doing?

22
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:25,006
They smell just the same.

23
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:26,129
Are you out of your mind?

24
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:27,853
Of course, they do. They were washed together.

25
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,584
But I like it.

26
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:32,898
Your scent.

27
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,155
You get on my nerves right after waking up.

28
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:42,432
Unlike last night when you cried like a puppy in your sleep.

29
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,567
I did.

30
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:49,333
Um.

31
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,878
Who did you dream of last night?

32
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:57,964
None of your business.

33
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:02,183
Akk.

34
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,561
Don’t forget what you told me.

35
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,686
You will tell everyone what you did.

36
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:16,320
I won’t forget it.

37
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:29,202
Akk?

38
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,654
Yes, sir.

39
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:33,720
I called to tell Ayan I couldn’t find his assignment.

40
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,484
He said Akk took it.

41
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,026
Is that so?

42
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:41,413
These two usually fight whenever they confront.

43
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:45,667
Do you think Akk really took Ayan’s assignment?

44
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,566
That’s pretty unusual.

45
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,000
Yesterday when you were making rounds,

46
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:51,889
was everything okay?

47
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,236
Yes, everything was fine.

48
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:05,000
Nong, Nian, let’s do it.

49
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,907
Check it again.

50
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:08,102
We will take a break in 30 minutes.

51
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:12,826
See if it can still be used.

52
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:15,608
This damn group.

53
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:17,903
When will they learn the lesson?

54
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,432
I didn’t hear you coming, Namo.

55
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:26,970
Why aren’t they punished by the Suppalo curse yet?

56
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:34,203
Do you want the curse back?

57
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:35,798
I do.

58
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:38,435
So that they will learn.

59
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
[Chadok: Come see me. Now!]

60
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:51,484
I’ve got to go.

61
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:52,428
Akk.

62
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,515
Believe me.

63
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,400
The Suppalo curse will be back.

64
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:15,623
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.

65
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:25,439
Teacher Sani said you had the new kid’s assignment with you.

66
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:28,925
Yes.

67
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:30,720
What is it, sir?

68
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,243
Are you close to him now?

69
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:37,738
I hope you aren’t brainwashed by Ayan yet.

70
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:42,332
No, sir.

71
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:43,920
I’m still the same person.

72
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:44,932
Very good.

73
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:47,602
The prefects’ duty

74
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:50,781
is to do whatever it takes to make Suppalo remain Suppalo.

75
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:55,000
I hope you don’t forget that.

76
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:24,291
When will you tell everyone the truth?

77
00:08:29,704 --> 00:08:30,844
Can I have a little more time?

78
00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:32,564
I promise

79
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:35,836
I will tell the truth when I’m ready.

80
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:46,727
I’ll be waiting.

81
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,495
[Bruce Wayne: Aren’t you posting anything today?]

82
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:25,663
[Thuaphu: No. I don’t know what to post.]

83
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:29,736
[Bruce Wayne: Are you doing okay today?]

84
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,674
Thua.

85
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:38,031
Can I talk to you?

86
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:40,000
Of course.

87
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:41,559
I want to take a day off.

88
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:44,124
Where are you going?

89
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:47,374
What should I tell the teachers?

90
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:49,325
That’s okay. I can do that for you.

91
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:50,246
You can?

92
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:51,916
I can.

93
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:53,631
Thanks.

94
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,109
What?

95
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,388
I don’t know.

96
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,903
Hand off it. Let me see.

97
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:09,598
I’ve got hair in your eye.

98
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:20,431
Aye.

99
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,239
What’s up?

100
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:32,870
Do you like Thua or Akk?

101
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,247
What’s up with you?

102
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,169
I’m asking you a question.

103
00:10:39,135 --> 00:10:42,380
If you like Thua, take good care of him.

104
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,562
He likes to keep things to himself.

105
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,001
I like…

106
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:03,525
I like it when you speak up to me like this.

107
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:09,642
But the one you should express your feelings to

108
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:11,636
is Thua,

109
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:12,663
not me.

110
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:16,734
Express what feelings?

111
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,651
No idea.

112
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:20,781
It’s your own feelings.

113
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,492
If you don’t know, who else does?

114
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:35,413
To answer your question,

115
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,872
I don’t like the one you like for sure.

116
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,498
You can breathe now.

117
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Why do they think differently than us?

118
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,650
We’re rule keepers.

119
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,967
We can’t think that way.

120
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,852
Why?

121
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:04,760
You don’t want to call me by the nickname because you’re afraid you’ll be too close to me?

122
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,768
Protesting is a fundamental human right in a democratic society.
[Students have the right to speak up.]

123
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:28,529
You don’t have to agree with us.

124
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:32,040
Just respect our right and liberty to express our opinions.

125
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,928
That’s right.

126
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:33,571
Hey!

127
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:35,316
Liberty, my ass.

128
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:36,973
You guys are outcasts.

129
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:39,219
The Suppalo curse will certainly doom you.

130
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:41,714
Nun, Nian, are you two scared?

131
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,068
We’re not scared.

132
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:47,324
If you’re not, go protest somewhere else.

133
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:48,223
Go!

134
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:50,618
Don’t listen to them.

135
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,165
Keep on protesting.

136
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:54,992
The suit is so damn expensive.

137
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:56,823
Not even suitable for Thailand’s climate.

138
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:57,607
It should be canceled.

139
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:58,331
Right.

140
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:00,088
I don’t want to wear the Suppalo suit anymore.

141
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:04,156
Me neither.

142
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:05,384
It’s so hot.

143
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,162
If you want to wear it, go ahead. But I don’t.

144
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:09,974
That’s so true.

145
00:13:09,974 --> 00:13:12,057
Give us back our freedom.

146
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,856
Give us back our freedom.

147
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:26,928
Quit bothering other people.

148
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:29,555
Your time is up.

149
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:32,269
You can’t just stop us.

150
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:34,448
This is our basic right

151
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:37,168
according to the National Education Act.

152
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:38,064
That’s correct.

153
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:39,791
A school is a safe place

154
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,848
that welcomes everyone

155
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:44,570
and fosters the culture of advocating basic human rights.

156
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,855
Students are free to argue their opinions.

157
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:49,975
As well as on social media.

158
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:53,712
And did you happen to read this statement too?

159
00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:01,373
Students have the right to engage in particular activities as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others

160
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:06,146
or violate school rules which abide by the Ministry of Education.

161
00:14:06,295 --> 00:14:12,135
And now you're infringing on other people's rights to study peacefully.

162
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:15,199
You're also breaking Suppalo rules.

163
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:17,114
Is that right, Teacher Sani?

164
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:19,813
That’s right.

165
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:23,008
But we want to see a good change in school.

166
00:14:23,008 --> 00:14:24,615
Back to your class now!

167
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:28,105
Student prefects, take all their stuff.

168
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:29,535
Do it now!

169
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,038
I’m sorry.

170
00:14:56,534 --> 00:14:57,873
Can we really handle it?

171
00:14:58,408 --> 00:14:59,069
Exactly.

172
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:01,330
The protesters are gaining momentum.

173
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:03,589
More people are taking their side.

174
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:07,448
We have to continue our duty.

175
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:10,549
To be honest,

176
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,220
if we disregard their fierceness and demeanors,

177
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:15,781
I’m starting to get their point.

178
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:16,534
Hey!

179
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,996
We’re rule keepers.

180
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:20,368
We can’t think that way.

181
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:29,688
I can’t help but wonder sometimes.

182
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,408
We are all raised and taught the same way.

183
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:36,145
But why do they think differently than us?

184
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:37,806
No, we aren’t.

185
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:40,882
Think about it carefully.

186
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:45,594
Those who think differently read different books, watch different movies,

187
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:48,657
or appreciate different types of art than us.

188
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,136
Yeah?

189
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:53,408
You are what you eat.

190
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:55,940
What you take builds who you are.

191
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:15,578
1984 by George Orwell.

192
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:17,565
It’s a great book.

193
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,173
Really?

194
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,860
The same author as Animal Farm,

195
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:24,861
which was recommended by someone in power in our country.

196
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,491
Ah!

197
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:27,883
I’ve heard about that.

198
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:29,833
The same author?

199
00:16:30,545 --> 00:16:33,546
This Saturday, there will be a forum on 1984.

200
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:36,409
The speaker is a new-generation Thai writer.

201
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:38,943
Yes.

202
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:49,417
[1984 Forum by Prapt]

203
00:16:54,609 --> 00:17:01,648
1984 is a dystopian novel by a well-known author George Orwell.

204
00:17:01,648 --> 00:17:03,840
It’s a world’s sensational novel.

205
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,703
Translated into many languages.

206
00:17:05,703 --> 00:17:09,064
It has inspired many writers,

207
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:11,829
including the guest speaker whom we invited today.

208
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,710
- Hello, Prapt.
- Hello.

209
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:19,451
Can you please tell us a bit about 1984?

210
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:20,061
Sure.

211
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:32,660
1984 is about a city in the future where the government aims to prohibit citizens from expressing their ideas at all.

212
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,956
They restrict citizens' freedom to think out of the box.

213
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,408
If you do something other than what the government demands,

214
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:41,817
they will find out and you will be punished.

215
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:47,741
Aside from the government, your neighbors are also watching you

216
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,108
to see whether you are breaking any of the government's rules.

217
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:55,387
The action is intended to demonstrate their allegiance and loyalty.

218
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:58,260
To show that they are not rebellious.

219
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:01,885
Where are you going?

220
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,525
Sit here.

221
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,856
Don’t distract other people.

222
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:08,080
Manners.

223
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:15,726
As for the government representative, the citizens respect and kiss his ass without knowing what he really looks like.

224
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:18,467
He's known as Big Brother.

225
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:24,615
Isn’t it romantic?

226
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:28,026
What the heck are you talking about?

227
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,771
How was it?

228
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:34,478
Did the book enlighten you at all?

229
00:18:35,755 --> 00:18:36,486
Um.

230
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,487
Do you think there’s someone in real life who is brainwashed like the main character in the book?

231
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,201
You.

232
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:47,867
You, asshole.

233
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:54,596
I just knew you’re interested in the book I read.

234
00:18:55,604 --> 00:18:57,008
Quit being a narcissist.

235
00:18:58,143 --> 00:19:01,314
The book has been reviewed and it was interesting so I read it.

236
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:02,865
Oh, yeah?

237
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:06,608
Can I see the reviews?

238
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,048
Why should I show it to you, Ayan?

239
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,040
Aye.

240
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:14,759
My nickname is Aye.

241
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,001
The whole class calls me Aye.

242
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,651
You’re the only one calling me by my first name.

243
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,095
I like it this way.

244
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:21,922
Why?

245
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:23,253
Why?

246
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:28,309
You don’t want to call me by the nickname because you’re afraid you’ll be too close to me?

247
00:19:29,645 --> 00:19:30,751
I’m not afraid.

248
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:33,019
Say it then.

249
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:33,810
Of course.

250
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:35,085
‘Shameless.’

251
00:19:35,213 --> 00:19:36,006
Happy now?

252
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:41,585
Are you blushing?

253
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:42,917
None of your freaking business.

254
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,995
He’s here!

255
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:08,928
The head of student prefects. My boy!

256
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:11,982
Why don’t you wear the uniform?

257
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:13,136
You’ll look so good.

258
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:14,500
Come on, Mom.

259
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,631
I’m just coming home.

260
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:19,171
Pon, I can’t go anymore.

261
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:21,266
My son is home.

262
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:24,597
Akk, your nephew.

263
00:20:25,229 --> 00:20:29,038
I’ll make him wear the uniform and take photos with you.

264
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:30,076
Yes.

265
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:32,936
Your dad is bragging too much.

266
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:40,677
[Ayan: You’re enlightened now. Don’t forget it.]

267
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:42,387
[Ayan: Do what you need to do.]

268
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:57,857
Mom.

269
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:05,499
Why are you out here making such a worrying face?

270
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:09,074
Nothing.

271
00:21:09,074 --> 00:21:09,811
It’s just…

272
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:11,249
I’ve been studying a little too hard.

273
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:12,666
I see.

274
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,020
You’ll go to university next year.

275
00:21:15,656 --> 00:21:16,388
That’s right.

276
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:17,805
Keep fighting, Son.

277
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:21,427
I’ll fight!

278
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:22,299
Great.

279
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,619
To make our family proud.

280
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:31,111
You must be tired, Son.

281
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:35,887
A little.

282
00:21:38,408 --> 00:21:40,798
If you’re too tired, let it go sometimes.

283
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:46,100
Mom.

284
00:21:49,485 --> 00:21:50,692
Can I sleep on your lap?

285
00:21:51,532 --> 00:21:52,864
You’re a big boy now.

286
00:21:53,226 --> 00:21:54,937
Still want to sleep on Mommy’s lap?

287
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:22,326
Wat, Kan,

288
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,008
how did he get here?

289
00:22:24,185 --> 00:22:25,608
Why did you transfer to this school?

290
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:27,143
What’s your goal?

291
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:05,704
Hey, guys.

292
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:06,912
Did you have any trouble finding my house?

293
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:08,168
No.

294
00:23:08,168 --> 00:23:09,977
We took the route you shared with us.

295
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:12,212
Let’s get inside.

296
00:23:12,212 --> 00:23:13,898
Okay. Let me grab my bag.

297
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,480
Can you grab it for me?

298
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:24,230
Wat.

299
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,957
Kan.

300
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:26,975
How did he get here?

301
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:28,726
I flew here, duh!

302
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:32,025
He and Mo were waiting for us in front of the school.

303
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:32,897
They aren’t members of any group yet.

304
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:34,804
I couldn’t just neglect them.

305
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:36,412
So I brought them here too.

306
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:40,068
Why didn’t you ask me, you jackasses?

307
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:42,688
Come on. Why are you so serious?

308
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,402
The more the merrier.

309
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:46,008
Right?

310
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:49,028
Let’s get inside. I’m tired.

311
00:23:58,101 --> 00:23:59,234
I flew here.

312
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:16,037
Wat,

313
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:18,625
aren’t you filming videos today?

314
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,036
No. I’m being lazy.

315
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:30,311
Hey, will this do?

316
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,269
I think so.

317
00:24:34,215 --> 00:24:35,713
What did you write down?

318
00:24:35,984 --> 00:24:41,453
All the living things I see around here.

319
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:42,968
Kan.

320
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:44,678
Kan!

321
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:46,829
Are you daydreaming? Look into the camera.

322
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:49,002
Why are you taking so many pictures?

323
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:50,009
Oh, come on.

324
00:24:50,428 --> 00:24:53,227
Wat, is this your rock?

325
00:24:53,318 --> 00:24:54,126
Why?

326
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,437
Because you rock!

327
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,792
Just ignore his bad joke.

328
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:27,269
One, two, three.I’m pumping air in you.

329
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,045
Go on.

330
00:25:31,045 --> 00:25:33,142
Faster.

331
00:25:33,142 --> 00:25:34,199
Inflate him quicker.

332
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,897
Do it quickly.

333
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:40,288
Quickly, quickly.

334
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:43,504
My head is about to explode.

335
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:00,882
I’ll hold the post.

336
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:03,054
You tie the string to the log there.

337
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:07,626
Wat!

338
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,549
Slow down.

339
00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:11,292
I want grilled squid.

340
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:12,785
Grill it yourself.

341
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,181
Guys.

342
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:20,389
We’ll take a rest now.

343
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,931
You guys have fun. Make yourselves at home.

344
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,549
Goodnight, Mom and Dad.

345
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:25,625
Goodnight.

346
00:27:25,795 --> 00:27:26,628
See you guys in the morning.

347
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:28,069
Good night.

348
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:50,281
Take one.

349
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,735
Now what?

350
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,818
A car is going at the speed of 200 km/hr.

351
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:05,391
And?

352
00:28:05,391 --> 00:28:06,211
It’s too fast to brake.

353
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,380
It crashes.

354
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,789
One, two, three. Cheers!

355
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,415
Guys, let’s play a game.

356
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:20,506
What game?

357
00:28:21,236 --> 00:28:24,549
Guess who I am in Suppalo.

358
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:25,989
Let’s do it.

359
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:27,594
Bring it on.

360
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:30,337
Kanlong.

361
00:28:30,337 --> 00:28:31,549
Not yet. I haven’t started.

362
00:28:34,971 --> 00:28:38,774
Suppalo’s reputation is in your hand, Akk.

363
00:28:38,774 --> 00:28:39,699
Yes, sir.

364
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:42,536
Teacher Chadok.

365
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:43,819
You’re right.

366
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,155
You don’t resemble Teacher Chadok at all.

367
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:47,807
Of course, he does.

368
00:28:47,807 --> 00:28:48,685
Or you wouldn’t be able to answer that.

369
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,111
He even looks like him.

370
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:52,442
My chest is so upright. Of course, this is him.

371
00:28:52,442 --> 00:28:54,010
I have no idea why he has to do this.

372
00:28:55,348 --> 00:28:57,348
Next round.

373
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,422
Kanlong,

374
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:12,354
people who have been well-educated by their families…

375
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:13,501
Aunt Waree.

376
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:14,442
Correct!

377
00:29:14,442 --> 00:29:15,692
That wasn’t even close.

378
00:29:15,692 --> 00:29:17,226
Let me show you.

379
00:29:17,226 --> 00:29:18,233
Let’s see.

380
00:29:19,688 --> 00:29:22,144
I’m so disappointed in you, Kanlong.

381
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,835
You’re a student in the best class.

382
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:26,430
I did it better than him.

383
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,199
You’re so bad at it.

384
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:30,705
The next one.

385
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:31,711
You’ll be my cameo.

386
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,105
It’s okay.

387
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:40,826
Take it easy.

388
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,904
There are two sides to every coin.

389
00:29:44,442 --> 00:29:45,592
Teacher Dika.

390
00:29:45,592 --> 00:29:46,442
Correct.

391
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:48,668
Was that good?

392
00:29:48,942 --> 00:29:50,365
Who’s next?

393
00:29:52,072 --> 00:29:53,479
I can’t imitate Teacher Sani.

394
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:56,209
Show us something.

395
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:57,623
You do it.

396
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,550
Ouch! Where are you going?

397
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,216
- You do it.
- Me?

398
00:30:03,526 --> 00:30:04,549
I can’t.

399
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:31,806
Uncle.

400
00:30:42,183 --> 00:30:43,635
I’m sorry.

401
00:30:47,618 --> 00:30:49,367
I will discover the truth as quickly as I can.

402
00:30:52,674 --> 00:30:53,944
I promise.

403
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:28,205
Bottle, bottle, on the table,

404
00:31:28,814 --> 00:31:30,905
who has the most disturbing face of them all?

405
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:33,448
Namo, play by the rule.

406
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:37,774
Aye, you’re here?

407
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,549
We’re about to play Truth or Dare.

408
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,005
Let’s play.

409
00:31:41,005 --> 00:31:41,670
Let’s do it.

410
00:31:47,687 --> 00:31:49,253
The first one.

411
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,542
Ask away.

412
00:31:52,596 --> 00:31:54,152
Do you have someone you like?

413
00:32:04,393 --> 00:32:06,393
I’ll drink. Give it to me.

414
00:32:07,902 --> 00:32:09,110
You’re not bold.

415
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:12,809
Too much.

416
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,802
Here.

417
00:32:18,818 --> 00:32:19,996
Not bad.

418
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,762
My turn.

419
00:32:28,103 --> 00:32:29,278
Wat!

420
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:30,602
Bring it on, Thua.

421
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:32,709
I can answer all your questions.

422
00:32:34,944 --> 00:32:36,373
Which faculty are you applying to?

423
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,349
Why did you ask such a serious question?

424
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:41,982
Film.

425
00:32:42,949 --> 00:32:44,549
I’m studying Film.

426
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,781
What about the faculty your parents chose for you?

427
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:51,323
Screw it.

428
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:53,125
This is my life.

429
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,856
Yes!

430
00:32:54,856 --> 00:32:55,931
I will do whatever I want.

431
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:58,479
Yes!

432
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,023
What a badass.

433
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:02,733
He’s only brave when he’s drunk.

434
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:04,954
When he wakes up tomorrow,

435
00:33:04,954 --> 00:33:08,342
he’s back to being the boy who’s scared of his parents.

436
00:33:08,342 --> 00:33:09,695
I’ll kick you.

437
00:33:09,908 --> 00:33:11,081
Wat, your turn.

438
00:33:11,652 --> 00:33:12,479
Right.

439
00:33:20,256 --> 00:33:21,160
Aye!

440
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:24,615
What should I ask you, Aye?

441
00:33:29,346 --> 00:33:30,869
Why did you transfer to this school?

442
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,820
What’s your goal?

443
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,350
Easy there.

444
00:33:54,706 --> 00:33:56,829
We can’t let him beat us.

445
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:59,343
You’re such a good drinker, Aye.

446
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:01,869
Drink up.

447
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:05,338
Don’t let Aye drink alone.

448
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,499
Cheers.

449
00:36:04,768 --> 00:36:05,732
What’s on your mind?

450
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:23,516
That notebook is a reminder of someone

451
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:27,900
who has left this world.

452
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:35,169
Akk,

453
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:39,134
if you know who took it,

454
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,341
please let me know.

455
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:06,727
You’re allowed to be weak.

456
00:37:09,675 --> 00:37:11,042
At least with me.

457
00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:17,297
You said that to me, remember?

458
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,283
I’m saying the same thing to you now.

459
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:02,572
Did you get any sleep yet, boys?

460
00:38:03,966 --> 00:38:05,247
We did, a little.

461
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,733
Where are you two going this early?

462
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:09,414
We’re going fishing.

463
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:11,160
We head out now and come back in the morning.

464
00:38:13,236 --> 00:38:14,752
Can I come?

465
00:38:15,498 --> 00:38:18,511
I don’t think that’s a good idea.
We’re going further than usual.

466
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:23,252
Akk, you can take your friend out on this boat.

467
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,595
Don’t go too far.

468
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:26,286
Go on.

469
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:28,426
- But Mom…
- Thank you.

470
00:38:28,718 --> 00:38:29,728
Take care of your friend.

471
00:38:44,675 --> 00:38:45,987
Sit tight.

472
00:38:48,751 --> 00:38:49,439
Yeah.

473
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:13,261
You’re looking happy.

474
00:39:15,372 --> 00:39:16,309
I sure am.

475
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:19,514
Your secret island is beautiful.

476
00:39:21,106 --> 00:39:22,553
I told you it’s beautiful.

477
00:39:28,395 --> 00:39:29,337
Akk

478
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:32,444
What will you do about that?

479
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:41,530
Do I need to do anything?

480
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,704
You do.

481
00:39:45,124 --> 00:39:46,986
What you did was wrong.

482
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:50,677
Are you gonna let people continue to believe in the curse?

483
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:57,009
I know.

484
00:40:00,325 --> 00:40:01,893
I just don’t know what I should do.

485
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:04,919
I’m afraid.

486
00:40:06,035 --> 00:40:07,589
I’m afraid everything will change.

487
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:11,965
Akk

488
00:40:13,197 --> 00:40:15,977
It isn’t just me who is looking into this.

489
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,516
Teacher Sani is.

490
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:20,140
The World Remembers group is.

491
00:40:21,215 --> 00:40:25,472
Though I don’t tell people about this, it will be exposed one day.

492
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:33,570
Better confess it before that to save yourself.

493
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:45,775
I have something to thank you for.

494
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:47,760
For what?

495
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,169
The night I had a nightmare.

496
00:40:56,476 --> 00:40:58,077
Thanks for comforting me with your hug.

497
00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:00,265
Weren’t you asleep?

498
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:01,766
I wasn’t.

499
00:41:08,669 --> 00:41:10,197
Your embrace was so warm.

500
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:14,824
Shut up.

501
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:18,355
Get on the boat.

502
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:21,202
Are you running away now?

503
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:23,533
Akk.

504
00:41:25,008 --> 00:41:26,232
Get on the boat.

505
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:29,749
Akk, wait.

506
00:41:30,074 --> 00:41:31,406
Well, hurry up.

507
00:44:15,163 --> 00:44:16,312
Are you avoiding me?

508
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:17,808
I’m not.

509
00:44:18,078 --> 00:44:19,456
I just wanted to sit at the stern.

510
00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:21,463
Yeah?

511
00:44:21,463 --> 00:44:22,300
Yeah.

512
00:44:28,373 --> 00:44:31,571
When you talk to me, look into my eyes.

513
00:44:37,937 --> 00:44:38,670
All right.

I will tell you my feelings

516
00:45:23,447 --> 00:45:25,263
and you will tell me yours.

517
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:29,144
I don’t want you to get hurt because of me again.

518
00:45:29,495 --> 00:45:30,440
It’s okay.

519
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,725
I can bear the pain.

520
00:45:31,725 --> 00:45:34,812
Besides, I want to protect you.

The head of that gang is Ayan.

Can you leave this school?

524
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,341
Whatever you will do, you know I’m on your side.
