4

We can't let those students protest outside the school.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,206
If you're planning on doing something shitty, don't.

6
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:28,743
I want to see for myself if the Suppalo curse is really potent.

7
00:00:30,092 --> 00:00:31,996
Congratulations, senior.

8
00:00:31,996 --> 00:00:32,642
Thank you.

9
00:00:33,646 --> 00:00:35,000
Hey, Akk.

10
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:40,616
Congratulations on the Suppalo Best Boy Award.

11
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:42,669
Freaking cool!

12
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:48,289
Suppalo means "power of goodness."

13
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:51,320
Remember this, Akk.

14
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:56,240
Good deeds will always take you to something good.

15
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,428
Yes, senior.

16
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:02,649
Do you want this award?

17
00:01:09,847 --> 00:01:10,975
Me?

18
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:12,831
Can I even do it?

19
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:15,009
You can.

20
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:18,840
You are the most deserving candidate

21
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,273
for the next student prefect club president.

22
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:25,492
Just believe in Suppalo's rules.

23
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:28,699
And this award

24
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:30,771
will be yours.

25
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:57,167
[10 MINUTES BEFORE THE INCIDENT]

26
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,200
Are you guys ready?
[10 MINUTES BEFORE THE INCIDENT]

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,820
[10 MINUTES BEFORE THE INCIDENT]

28
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,481
We are.
[10 MINUTES BEFORE THE INCIDENT]

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,574
Awesome.

30

[This time, I hope it can make you stop!]

31
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:09,479
Guys.
[This time, I hope it can make you stop!]

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,317
[This time, I hope it can make you stop!]

33
00:02:10,317 --> 00:02:11,396
what?

34
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:12,282
[This time, I hope it can make you stop!]

35
00:02:12,887 --> 00:02:14,887
[Come to the school backyard.]

36
00:02:17,197 --> 00:02:18,043
Look.

[Jumnong, Jumnun, Jumnian]

38
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:40,854
Put your phones away.

39
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:43,200
And don't make a big deal out of it.

40
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:45,548
Suppalo curse.

41
00:02:46,972 --> 00:02:48,120
Stop recording.

42
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,241
No phones!

43
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:50,419
This is an order!

44
00:02:52,527 --> 00:02:55,767
Student prefects, keep your friends from using phones.

45
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:56,750
Yes, ma'am.

46
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,397
Kan and Wat, take care of everything here.

47
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:00,226
I'll go get a fire extinguisher.

48
00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:01,276
Yes.

49
00:03:01,277 --> 00:03:01,964
Guys, no phones.

50
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:02,978
Are you guys okay?

51
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:05,508
We are, ma'am.

52
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,420
We're just shocked.

53
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:09,370
I'm all right.

54
00:03:12,564 --> 00:03:14,265
So the Suppalo curse is back?

55
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,510
I don't think it is.

56
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:17,876
Hey!

57
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:19,065
Put it away!

58
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:27,467
He did it again?

59
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:29,573
I don't know.

60
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:34,344
Akk.

61
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:35,169
Akk.

62
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:36,257
Look.

[This time, I hope it can make you stop!!]

64
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:46,635
Who is this guy?

65
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:54,041
(Attention! Students are prohibited from protesting without school authorization.)

66
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:56,633
(Everyone, back to class.)

67
00:03:56,831 --> 00:04:01,695
(No more protesting in the school area is allowed.)

68
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:08,018
(Anyone who joins or gets involved with the protest will face decisive measures.)

69
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:13,916
Well done, Chadok.

70
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,417
If you succeed, Suppalo will thank you.

71
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:29,962
Go.

72
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:30,894
The show is over.

73
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:32,785
Move your asses back to class.

74
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:37,984
Guys.

75
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:39,858
Did you see?

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,655
Did you see what happened?

77
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:46,219
Will you really let the school do this to us?

78
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:48,998
Enough.

79
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:51,246
Back to your duty.

80
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:52,848
This is my duty.

81
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,098
That's right.

82
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:58,363
It's our duty to protect our own rights and safety.

83
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:03,480
But what you did caused trouble and fear to your friends. Can't you see?

84
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,261
We're being threatened here.

85
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:08,520
Why are you saying we're causing fear?

86
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:13,652
Because your disobedience has brought back the Suppalo curse.

87
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,225
Not true.

88
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:17,873
I think

89
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:19,062
you guys should stop.

90
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:20,640
Please.

91
00:05:20,797 --> 00:05:21,744
Stubborn.

92
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:24,192
You only think about yourselves.

93
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,640
You don't consider the peace and wellness of the majority.

94
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,191
Teacher,

95
00:05:31,854 --> 00:05:33,550
the kids are scared.

96
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,991
How about we discuss this later?

97
00:05:37,107 --> 00:05:37,666
Akk.

98
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:40,258
Yes, ma'am.

99
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:43,636
Guys, we're done here.

100
00:05:43,762 --> 00:05:45,142
Back to your class.

101
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:46,491
Go.

102
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:47,889
All of you.

103
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,727
Leave.

104
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:55,234
Stop the Suppalo curse.

105
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:58,109
Stop the Suppalo curse.

106
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,120
Stop the Suppalo curse.

107
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:03,960
Stop the Suppalo curse.

108
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,807
Stop saying that.

109
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:09,767
Stop the Suppalo curse.

110
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:10,426
I said stop!

111
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:13,738
Stop the Suppalo curse.

112
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:14,620
I told you to stop.

113
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:21,820
Stop the Suppalo curse.

114
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,161
No gathering here!

115
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:29,549
Back to your class!

116
00:06:30,638 --> 00:06:32,702
What about the burn of our puppet?

117
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:35,040
Why did someone want to do this?

118
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:38,200
The school will set up a team for investigation.

119
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,459
What?

120
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,396
Investigation again?

121
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,200
Will the result be just an accident again?

122
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:46,779
Don't worry.

123
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:50,000
Suppalo always provides justice to everyone.

124
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,000
You're hiding out here.

125
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:06,080
What's happening? Should I go check?

126
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,620
Hey.

127
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:08,540
No.

128
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:09,898
Sit back down.

129
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:18,179
Are you okay?

130
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:19,820
Are you all right?

131
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:26,576
What happened today has shaken me.

132
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:31,537
Whatever I used to uphold or believe in

133
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:38,215
has changed.

134
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:08,241
Here.

135
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:29,425
Just like that day.

136
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:32,352
What day?

137
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:34,533
Well…

138
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:36,827
The second semester of the ninth grade.

139
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,566
My mom called in to inform me of my dad's death.

140
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:45,000
The teacher told you to bring me the news.

141
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,288
I was shocked just like today.

142
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:49,765
You were comforting me like this as well.

143
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:52,044
That was so long ago.

144
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,809
You got through it before.

145
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:00,774
About your stepdad, about school,

146
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:03,319
you will get through it too.

147
00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:11,055
When you're being sweet,

148
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:13,816
you're kind of warm like a microwave.

149
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:20,940
Just like my mysterious friend.

150
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,200
That Bruce Wayne guy?

151
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:27,483
Yes.

152
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:33,707
Can you keep a secret?

153
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,485
I can.

154
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:42,305
Maybe…

155
00:09:42,838 --> 00:09:45,880
I think of him as more than a friend.

156
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:48,791
Do you think that's wrong?

157
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:52,837
No.

158
00:09:53,824 --> 00:09:55,824
Having a good feeling for someone isn't wrong.

159
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:01,510
You're right.

160
00:10:03,984 --> 00:10:05,984
I just want to see him in person for once.

161
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,903
Want to know who he is.

162
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:24,116
Will you tell me now how you feel about me?

163
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:40,480
You did a very nice job this afternoon.

164
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:41,868
What?

165
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:46,552
I hope it can stop them.

166
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,273
Then we will finally have peace.

167
00:11:03,006 --> 00:11:03,790
What's up?

168
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:05,389
What's up with you?

169
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:08,916
You said we'd do the report after you're done with your meeting.

170
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:11,751
Shit.

171
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,264
I totally forgot.

172
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:15,549
It's fine.

173
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:16,677
I finished it.

174
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:21,552
I didn't help.

176
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:25,413
Words alone are enough to compensate.

177
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,777
You must treat me to a dessert.

178
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:34,595
This cafe serves better drinks than the last one.

179
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:36,037
Yeah?

180
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:36,787
Yeah.

181
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:40,215
Aye.

182
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:43,897
Has that intervener done anything again?

183
00:11:46,737 --> 00:11:47,472
No.

184
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:50,975
Are you scared?

185
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:55,442
I don't know.

186
00:11:58,575 --> 00:12:00,091
Ever since he stepped in,

187
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:03,671
everything has been so complicated.

188
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:09,408
I used to think things were easier to control.

189
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,849
The world is changing every day.

190
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,488
Who are you to control everything?

191
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:21,552
Mes could do it.

192
00:12:24,296 --> 00:12:26,457
The former president of the prefect club?

193
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:28,552
Your idol?

194
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,704
His time and your time are different.

195
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:40,570
Right?

196
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,921
I don't know.

197
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,272
Aye, don't lie down. Your shirt will be dirty.

198
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:51,726
Dirt can be washed off.

199
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,393
How about you join me?

200
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:55,124
It feels good.

201
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:56,552
No.

202
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:57,222
Come on.

203
00:12:57,222 --> 00:12:58,082
Try it.

204
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:00,838
Do it.

205
00:13:11,702 --> 00:13:13,783
Why is growing up so tough?

206
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:19,774
Sometimes, I just don't want tomorrow to come.

207
00:13:32,108 --> 00:13:33,745
Until tomorrow comes,

208
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,845
let me hold your hand like this.

209
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:48,106
Tonight,

210
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:51,406
I will stay with you.

211
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:07,291
Can't sleep?

212
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,069
Yeah.

213
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:28,485
What are you doing?

214
00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:30,504
Music for sleeping.

215
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:34,468
When I have trouble sleeping, I always listen to this music.

216
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,081
If you want to look at me, just look.

217
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,758
Don't sneak or you might see my bad angle.

218
00:15:00,643 --> 00:15:02,824
You don't have to be a narcissist 24/7.

219
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:03,818
Take a break.

220
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:04,668
It's tiring.

221
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:09,592
You know what?

222
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:13,824
I used to be an introvert.

223
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:16,802
I liked my peace and quiet.

224
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,896
But after I met you,

225
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,896
I got used to being yelled at by you.

226
00:15:28,765 --> 00:15:30,200
I don't like to yell at you.

227
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,359
You just always do something that deserves to be yelled at.

228
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:34,422
Exactly.

229
00:15:36,116 --> 00:15:37,787
I don't get myself either

230
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:42,718
why I like to act that way when I'm with you.

231
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:46,893
Because you like to bug me.

232
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,514
I don't like to bug you.

233
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:56,934
I like you.

234
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,338
There.

235
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:05,512
You just always avoid eye contact.

236
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:08,761
I'm not avoiding eye contact.

237
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:14,540
I will set up a CCTV here so that you can see yourself.

238
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,385
Time to sleep.

239
00:16:17,385 --> 00:16:18,315
We need to get up early.

240
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:20,139
We've got school.

241
00:16:26,143 --> 00:16:26,765
Akk.

242
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:29,151
What now?

243
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:34,319
Will you tell me now how you feel about me?

244
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,317
I…

245
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:49,432
I get you.

246
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,622
When I first found out,

247
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:57,928
it was difficult too.

248
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:05,581
You can't like a bad person like me.

249
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:11,552
You know all the bad things I've done.

250
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:12,535
And…

251
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:28,488
That's my answer.

252
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:37,297
That day when I told my mom we were dating,

253
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:42,426
I meant it.

254
00:17:45,335 --> 00:17:45,966
Akk,

255
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,997
should we get together?

256
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:55,202
Don't be ridiculous.

257
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:57,612
I'm a guy.

258
00:17:58,257 --> 00:17:59,692
And I'm going to sleep.

259
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:10,636
What are you doing?

260
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,190
Don't run away.

261
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,033
Answer me.

262
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:20,622
Akk.

263
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,270
Should we get together?

264
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:32,125
I can do this all night.

265
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:36,386
Akk.

266
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:40,660
Yes.

267
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,118
Fine.

268
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:45,996
What?

269
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,001
Say it clearly.

270
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,413
Should we get together?

271
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:56,940
Will you be my boyfriend?

272
00:18:57,923 --> 00:19:00,312
I don't know. I will sleep now.

273
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,426
Good night, boyfriend.

274
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:19,710
Sleep.

275
00:19:20,718 --> 00:19:21,552
Go to sleep.

276
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:23,335
I'm going to sleep.

277
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:34,279
Aye!

278
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:38,621
What the heck are you doing?

279
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:39,917
Kiss my cheek.

280
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:42,709
Don't let me be the only one who kisses.

281
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:44,792
Or that would mean you're my wife.

282
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:56,171
I've got no news of any protest at the moment, sir.

283
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,518
At least these kids know how to listen.

284
00:20:00,738 --> 00:20:02,128
Keep an eye on them, still.

285
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:03,573
Any movement at all,

286
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,385
inform me immediately.

287
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:20,799
What the heck are you doing?

288
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:22,573
We're in school.

289
00:20:25,302 --> 00:20:26,539
Well, I missed you.

290
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,738
Missed, my ass.

291
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:29,880
We were just together.

292
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,924
Didn't you miss me at all?

293
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,210
I did! Happy now?

294
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,779
Let go.

295
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:40,868
I'm making rounds.

296
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:42,621
Kan and Wat will be here soon.

297
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:45,845
Kiss my cheek first.

298
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,089
Please.

299
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:50,419
Give me a cheek kiss.

300
00:20:52,212 --> 00:20:54,474
I want a good moment this morning.

301
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:02,721
Moment, my foot!

302
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:03,467
No.

303
00:21:06,985 --> 00:21:08,019
Kiss me.

304
00:21:12,714 --> 00:21:14,976
Don't let me be the only one who kisses.

305
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:16,965
Or that would mean you're my wife.

306
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:20,380
Come on.

307
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:29,723
I'm not your wife.

308
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:31,579
You're my wife.

309
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:34,997
That's ticklish.

310
00:21:36,582 --> 00:21:37,972
I like it when you say something like this.

311
00:21:38,816 --> 00:21:40,402
You taught me to.

312
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,461
I'm always the one to blame.

313
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:44,619
Go already.

314
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:45,484
One more time.

315
00:21:46,787 --> 00:21:48,090
Aye, go.

316
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:48,902
One more kiss.

317
00:21:48,902 --> 00:21:49,846
Aye.

318
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:50,847
Akk.

319
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,142
What are you two doing?

320
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,016
Aye was on his phone.

321
00:22:01,281 --> 00:22:03,739
I brought him here to lecture him about the school rules.

322
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:05,104
Right?

323
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:06,928
Right.

324
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:14,099
Don't do this again.

325
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:16,496
If I catch you using it, I will take it.

326
00:22:17,824 --> 00:22:18,508
Got it?

327
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:20,979
Yes, sir.

328
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:23,485
Just leave already.

329
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:32,403
Rules are rules, right?

330
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,518
You're fidgeting somehow.

331
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:36,947
I'm not.

332
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:43,037
Oh.

333
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:46,899
You call him Aye now?

334
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,265
I'm narrowing the gap.

335
00:22:49,265 --> 00:22:50,577
Teacher Sani's advice.

336
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:55,179
Keep on making rounds.

337
00:22:58,034 --> 00:22:58,788
Come on.

338
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:05,219
Narrowing the gap, he said.

339
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:09,975
Guys.

340
00:23:10,411 --> 00:23:11,113
Hm?

341
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,301
Do you think school feels weird today?

342
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:17,487
The protesters aren't here.

343
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:19,546
That's why it's quiet.

344
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:22,819
Doesn't seem like them at all.

345
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:28,134
Do you think they're preparing to protest outside school?

346
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,655
Possibly.

347
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:35,074
They can't protest inside the school so they do it outside instead.

348
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,183
True.

349
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,716
They will not stop this easily.

350
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:48,151
[See you at the protest, Bruce Wayne. I'll be waiting.]

351
00:23:48,151 --> 00:23:49,190
What is it, Kan?

352
00:23:51,612 --> 00:23:53,503
Nothing. It's my family.

353
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,876
I'm going to call my mom.

354
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:04,675
Thua.

355
00:24:08,227 --> 00:24:08,863
Yeah?

356
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:11,418
Come here.

357
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:13,652
Kan, where are you taking me?

358
00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:20,288
Kan, why did you take me here?

359
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:21,915
Are you going to join the protest?

360
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:23,510
Yes.

361
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:24,893
I signed up for it.

362
00:24:26,637 --> 00:24:27,586
I'm not letting you go.

363
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:29,658
Why not?

364
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:31,562
I asked Bruce Wayne to meet me there.

365
00:24:32,242 --> 00:24:35,092
You're head of the class.

366
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,510
You can't do this.

367
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:40,619
Plus, I don't want you to be cursed like those guys.

368
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:45,433
Let's do this.

369
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:50,687
Shoot the ball into the basket and I'll let you go.

370
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:58,160
You know I can't.

371
00:24:58,419 --> 00:24:59,360
It's not fair.

372
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:02,097
'll teach you then.

373
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,071
Fair enough?

374
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:09,981
Elbows up.

375
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:13,125
Left hand holds it right here.

376
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:15,900
Set it up straight.

377
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:18,739
Can you see the basket?

378
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:21,659
I can.

379
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:25,485
When you see it, get down just a little.

380
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:49,664
I think you can shoot now.

381
00:25:57,828 --> 00:26:00,634
And now you have no right to stop me.

382
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:29,575
Hello.

383
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:31,945
No school today.

384
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:33,433
Why did you call so early?

385
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:35,563
I wanted to see your face.

386
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:37,507
Why?

387
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:39,099
Nothing.

388
00:26:40,737 --> 00:26:41,769
Seriously, why?

389
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:48,578
Do you need to go get the names of those who are joining the protest?

390
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:52,991
I'm a student prefect after all.

391
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,530
But it's a day off.

392
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:59,099
You don't have to be a prefect all the time.

393
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:01,058
No.

394
00:27:01,472 --> 00:27:02,487
I can't do that.

395
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:04,411
You can.

396
00:27:05,478 --> 00:27:08,005
Akk, I know you don't want to go.

397
00:27:10,165 --> 00:27:10,947
Should we just run away?

398
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:12,427
To where?

399
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:13,924
Just agree.

400
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,147
I'll pick you up.

401
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:17,323
Don't. I'm not going with you.

402
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:29,099
Guys.

403
00:27:29,443 --> 00:27:34,625
School should be a place where we can express our opinions.

404
00:27:36,214 --> 00:27:38,214
Where we can learn to be ourselves.

405
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:42,073
Not a place that restricts our rights and liberties.

406
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:44,031
Right?

407
00:27:44,489 --> 00:27:45,277
Right.

408
00:27:46,763 --> 00:27:50,289
School should be a safe place.

409
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,779
A place where we can learn to be ourselves.

410
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:54,075
Is that right, everyone?

411
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:55,208
Right!

412
00:27:55,208 --> 00:28:00,839
Suppalo uses the tale to scare us.

413
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:03,090
We're scared to think.

414
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:05,818
To question.

415
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:10,405
They use the curse tale to frighten us.

416
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:12,177
Too afraid to think.
[#suppalo]

417
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:14,099
Too afraid to have different opinions.
[The tale of the old generation is troubling people in the new generation. #suppalo]

418
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,708
Right, guys?
[School or prison? #suppalo]

[#suppalo is trending no.1 with 211k tweets.]

421
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,928
People who run away together don't get on social media.

422
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:27,731
Hm?

423
00:28:37,164 --> 00:28:39,513
You ran away with me or I ran away with you exactly?

424
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,364
You dragged me here.

425
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:45,509
It's called kidnapping.

426
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:47,000
It's a day off.

427

Suppalo uses the curse tale to scare us.

[Bruce Wayne, I'm at the protest. Where are you?]

429
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:04,789
When we're not afraid to think or raise questions,

430
00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:07,762
they accuse us of not loving the school,

431
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,373
not being proud to be Suppalo students.

432
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:23,310
Right?

433
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:25,102
Right.

434
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,786
Did I keep you waiting?

435
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:29,099
Kan?

436
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,857
You can call me Kan Kanlong

437
00:29:35,225 --> 00:29:36,379
or Bruce Wayne.

438
00:29:45,585 --> 00:29:48,718
Will your student prefect title be affected coming here?

439
00:29:49,093 --> 00:29:50,123
Screw it.

440
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:53,836
Not just me who's at risk.

441
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,819
You too, head of the class.

442
00:30:02,155 --> 00:30:02,962
You're right.

443
00:30:05,338 --> 00:30:06,182
Right!

444
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,191
Stop the Suppalo curse.

445
00:30:09,356 --> 00:30:11,269
Find the one responsible.

446
00:30:11,611 --> 00:30:13,259
Stop the Suppalo curse.

447
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:15,083
Find the one responsible.

448
00:30:15,404 --> 00:30:17,251
Stop the Suppalo curse.

449
00:30:17,251 --> 00:30:18,960
Find the one responsible.

450
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:20,760
Stop the Suppalo curse.

451
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,388
Find the one responsible.

452
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,197
Stop the Suppalo curse.

453
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,798
Find the one responsible.

454
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:27,405
Stop the Suppalo curse.

455
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:29,189
Find the one responsible.

456
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,118
Thua.

457
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,737
Are you disappointed I'm Bruce Wayne?

458
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:37,013
I like you.

459
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:55,289
Thua.

460
00:31:03,387 --> 00:31:06,790
Are you disappointed I'm Bruce Wayne?

461
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:13,886
Why would I be?

462
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,808
I'm glad it's you.

463
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:26,265
Last night, I barely got any sleep.

464
00:31:27,158 --> 00:31:28,553
I talked to myself all night.

465
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:32,195
I've got so many decisions to make.

466
00:31:35,881 --> 00:31:37,026
And here I am.

467
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:40,221
I know.

468
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:45,356
Even if you didn't show up, I still needed to thank you.

469
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:49,818
For being Bruce Wayne.

470
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:56,368
And for being you who always take care of me.

471
00:32:05,745 --> 00:32:06,772
I like you.

472
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,423
I've never been like this before.

473
00:32:25,483 --> 00:32:29,862
Do you want to be with someone who says one thing but means another?

474
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:33,820
Someone who is not very nice?

475
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:44,414
I've got something to ask.

476
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:46,503
What?

477
00:32:52,741 --> 00:32:53,873
That night, at Akk's house,

478
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:58,351
did you mean to…

479
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:07,670
kiss me?

480
00:33:16,148 --> 00:33:17,070
Um.

481
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,869
I meant to kiss you.

482
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:25,833
I'm sorry I pretended nothing happened after that.

483
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,908
You must have been very angry.

484
00:33:35,905 --> 00:33:36,791
Then yes.

485
00:33:38,737 --> 00:33:39,535
Huh?

486
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,721
What?

487
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,768
I will be with you.

488
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:49,529
Seriously?

489
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:52,109
Yes.

490
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:54,969
I'm not saying it again. I'm shy.

491
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:38,292
(Stop the Suppalo curse.)
(Find the one responsible.)

492
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:44,377
Did you join the protest?

493
00:34:45,823 --> 00:34:46,725
Um.

494
00:34:47,736 --> 00:34:48,947
Be careful.

495
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:53,141
I heard the Student Welfare Department is collecting names of students joining.

496
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:55,248
Really?

497
00:34:55,248 --> 00:34:56,207
Yes.

498
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:06,390
Turn those videos off.

499
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,506
Class.

500
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:11,551
Good morning.

501
00:35:12,883 --> 00:35:14,357
You are students.

502
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:17,159
Don't take interest in that nonsense.

503
00:35:17,304 --> 00:35:19,304
Your duty is to study.

504
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:24,974
The path Suppalo plans for you has been well considered.

505
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,656
Understood?

506
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,931
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:32,030
Take out the papers from last week.

508
00:35:37,695 --> 00:35:38,512
Akk.

509
00:35:39,853 --> 00:35:40,570
Yes.

510
00:35:41,232 --> 00:35:44,415
You must improve your performance as a student prefect.

511
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,175
We all agreed in the teachers' meeting that

512
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:51,721
since we've had prefects,

513
00:35:51,837 --> 00:35:58,149
this year's prefects have performed the poorest of all in terms of controlling the school situations.

514
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,434
Yes, ma'am.

515
00:36:10,353 --> 00:36:12,036
I'll try harder.

516
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:17,492
Don't let down the one who chose you for the president title.

517
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,244
Yes.

518
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:25,446
Where is Wittawat?

519
00:36:25,762 --> 00:36:27,042
He's on leave.

520
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,367
Going where?

521
00:36:30,206 --> 00:36:31,680
He didn't say.

522
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,372
He just informed me he'd be on leave.

523
00:36:34,837 --> 00:36:37,389
Keep an eye on your friends' leaves.

524
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,932
What is this?

525
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:43,092
These are all the names you got?

526
00:36:49,122 --> 00:36:50,544
I'm trying to look into it, sir.

527
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:55,500
I might need some time.

528
00:36:55,774 --> 00:36:57,485
We don't have that much time, Akk.

529
00:36:58,295 --> 00:37:00,926
The school foundation day is coming up in a few days.

530
00:37:01,557 --> 00:37:05,450
The alumni club and all the parents will be here.

531
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:09,066
If we can't handle this, what should say to them?

532
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,287
You're a student prefect.

533
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:19,019
Perform your duty like you deserve that armband.

534
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,086
What?

535
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:38,086
I've got something to talk to you about.

536
00:37:38,086 --> 00:37:38,915
It can wait.

537
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:41,413
I have an urgent business to attend to.

538
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:09,418
Sir.

539
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:10,932
What?

540
00:38:11,804 --> 00:38:14,120
You've got to stop putting pressure on Akk.

541
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:15,996
What are you talking about?

542
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:21,206
You must have used this method to kill many people.

543
00:38:23,944 --> 00:38:26,838
If you don't know things, you better not speak.

544
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:29,318
Back to your class.

545
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:33,541
Teacher.

546
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:34,169
Ayan!

547
00:38:34,169 --> 00:38:35,360
Come back and talk to me.

548
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,077
Ayan.

549
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:37,457
Stop.

550
00:38:37,457 --> 00:38:39,686
School isn't over yet. You can't leave.

551
00:38:39,905 --> 00:38:40,738
Ayan.

552
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:42,483
- Teacher!
- Ayan!

553
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:44,191
Stop.

554
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,601
School isn't over yet. You can't leave.

555
00:38:54,595 --> 00:38:56,700
How can Teacher Chadok leave then?

556
00:38:58,868 --> 00:39:01,105
Teacher Chadok gave advanced notice of his leave.

557
00:39:01,747 --> 00:39:03,747
We have enough troubles here in this school.

558
00:39:04,246 --> 00:39:06,746
I don't want any more trouble.

559
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,389
Back to your class for now.

560
00:39:11,743 --> 00:39:13,980
Whatever it is, we can talk in a nice manner.

561
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:23,025
Do you really not see

562
00:39:24,093 --> 00:39:26,961
that your attempt at compromise is

563
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:31,153
encouraging the bad system to continue?

564
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,967
The shitty system that kills many people.

565
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:42,954
Your school freaking sucks.

566
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,753
I'm worried about you, Akk.

567
00:41:12,374 --> 00:41:14,479
Don't let anything happen to you.

568
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,490
Do not leave me too.

569
00:41:22,076 --> 00:41:23,314
I'm okay.

570
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:25,652
What's the matter?

571
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:31,794
I'm worried about you.

572
00:41:37,087 --> 00:41:39,429
Seeing you like this reminds me of my uncle.

573
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,780
This school is freaking cold-blooded.

574
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:55,332
I got it now why my uncle did it.

575
00:41:57,276 --> 00:41:58,242
Hold on.

576
00:42:00,206 --> 00:42:01,345
I'm lost.

577
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:05,095
How was your uncle related to this school?

578
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:09,933
He was.

579
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,468
He's Teacher Dika.

580
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:22,457
Hi, Akk.

581
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:24,987
Teacher Dika.

582
00:42:26,512 --> 00:42:27,433
Hello.

583
00:42:28,286 --> 00:42:29,445
Hello.

584
00:42:34,402 --> 00:42:35,561
I thought

585
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,977
he just quit.

586
00:42:43,235 --> 00:42:45,235
I…

587
00:43:13,016 --> 00:43:14,069
It's okay.

588
00:43:24,554 --> 00:43:25,818
It's okay.

589
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:44,634
When you are lost,

590
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:49,180
when you're worried,

591
00:43:51,386 --> 00:43:52,597
or anxious,

592
00:43:53,503 --> 00:43:55,687
my uncle told me to hold on to this necklace.

593
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:58,777
I want you to have it.

594
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:04,581
Right now you need it more than I do.

595
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,560
Aye.

596
00:44:39,402 --> 00:44:40,745
How did he die?

597
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:52,272
I'm wondering

598
00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:58,859
if Teacher Chadok was the reason he died.

599
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:11,684
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

600
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:16,269
Be with me for as long as you can.

601
00:45:16,568 --> 00:45:18,884
You guys want to know what we are?

602
00:45:19,497 --> 00:45:20,717
I'll show you with this kiss.

603
00:45:22,006 --> 00:45:23,680
What are you going to do about tomorrow?

604
00:45:24,562 --> 00:45:25,642
I have no clue.

605
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:28,026
Can we just skip tomorrow?

606
00:45:28,747 --> 00:45:30,510
Do you remember this necklace?

607
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,021
It belonged to my uncle.

608
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:33,787
Stop the Suppalo curse.

609
00:45:33,787 --> 00:45:35,662
We should deal with the protest in school first.

610
00:45:35,662 --> 00:45:36,929
Let's go see the last boss.
