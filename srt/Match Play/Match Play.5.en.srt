1
00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:03,750
Next time,

2
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:05,792
want to go on a date with me?

3
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:12,833
A... A meetup?

4
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,292
Not a meetup. A date.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,792
Next time, I also want to...

6
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,542
hang out with you just like today.

7
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:24,250
Oh, is that what you meant?

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,958
You had me worried for a second.

9
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,125
Sure, I'm down.

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,458
But why did you have
to use the word "date"?

11
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,028
Would it also be nice for
you if I only did this with you?

12
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:48,125
I don't like it when you hang
out with other friends by yourself.

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,850
And I also don't like it when
you get close to other celebrities.

14
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,958
I only want to be the one closest to you.

15
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,848
I've also wondered if you've ever
brought a girlfriend here before.

16
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:01,667
You've wondered?

17
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:04,625
That's even worse.

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,750
It's the absolute...

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,833
You feel bad about canceling
our plans today, right?

20
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,958
Well...

21
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,208
Yeah.

22
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,458
That's why you came all
this way to pick me up...

23
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,875
Right?

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,458
Yeah.

25
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,333
That's right.

26
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,583
That's it.

27
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,042
Isn't this a date?

28
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,375
Then should we just start dating?

29
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:36,958
Huh?

30
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:44,083
"Should we just start dating?"

31
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,625
What are you doing?

32
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,875
What?

33
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,125
It's nothing.

34
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,333
Let's go home.

35
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,833
Wait!

36
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:01,625
Something's definitely up with you.

37
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,333
No, there isn't.

38
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:05,333
I said it's nothing.

39
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,500
So...

40
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,333
Someone confessed their feelings to you?

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,958
It wasn't really a confession, more like...

42
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,167
a proposition?

43
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:15,583
A proposition?

44
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,125
Let's just call it a confession.

45
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,000
Fine, a confession.

46
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,042
So what's the problem?

47
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:25,417
Because everything is a problem.
Or is it a problem?

48
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:27,042
If you like them, say yes.

49
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,292
If you don't, say no. It's that simple.

50
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:31,792
It's not that simple.

51
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,750
Then... when they confessed to you,
were you happy or did you hate it?

52
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,167
When they confessed?

53
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,250
There's your answer.

54
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,500
Huh?

55
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,684
The confession was awkward,

56
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,375
but you don't dislike the person, right?

57
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,542
Wh-Why would you think that?

58
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:02,458
Because if you disliked them, you
wouldn't be agonizing over it like this.

59
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,125
That's true, but...

60
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,958
You... You're really something.

61
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,750
And here I thought it
was something serious.

62
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,667
Come on, let's go home.

63
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,417
Hey.

64
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:22,375
Hmm?

65
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,375
You're older than me, right?

66
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,792
So? Is that why you're calling me "noona"?

67
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,917
To attract someone older,

68
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:33,333
what should I do?

69
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,208
With older people, you
just have to be direct.

70
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,125
Direct?

71
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,875
Just play dumb and go for it.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
If they don't like it, they'll
turn you down, right?

73
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:53,958
What's wrong with you?

74
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,500
Are you in debt or something?

75
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,042
It's nothing like that.

76
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,375
This is killing me.

77
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,250
What's going on with you two?

78
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,667
Why are you sending signals behind my back?

79
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,292
Me?

80
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,208
See? There you go again.

81
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,726
Something's definitely going
on with you two, isn't there?

82
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,083
I said it's nothing.

83
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,008
- I was just with Soo-hyun...
- With Soo-hyun?

84
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,667
I didn't do anything.

85
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,708
It's just one of those things.

86
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,167
What kind of thing?

87
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:30,000
It's just one of those things.

88
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,333
Don't tell me...

89
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:35,667
Hey!

90
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,458
What?

91
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,292
Are you two dating?

92
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,583
What is he talking about?

93
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:46,708
Explain yourself!

94
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,250
No way. If Kim Young-woo hears about this,

95
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,833
the whole company will know.

96
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,708
What about me?

97
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,625
I was just being a good listener to you.

98
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,583
What did I do to deserve this?

99
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:00,958
Nothing.

100
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,833
You did nothing wrong.

101
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,542
I hope you can resolve
this as quickly as possible.

102
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:16,000
Speaking of which, what's with
Kim Young-woo these days?

103
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,708
I don't know.

104
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,583
He's been sulking every day lately.

105
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,917
Here.

106
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,583
That's it. From now on, I'm not taking

107
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,208
anything you give me.

108
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,417
Oh, really?

109
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:40,143
Then all the stuff I've
bought you until now,

110
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:41,226
are you going to spit it all out?

111
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,167
Ah, come on, don't be like that.

112
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,083
Sorry, I didn't know.

113
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:50,500
What?

114
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,375
I didn't know you liked Soo-hyun.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,167
I don't like her!

116
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:57,125
Then what's with this tantrum?

117
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,292
No, I do. I like her a lot.

118
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,208
You said you didn't before...

119
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,875
So what?

120
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:11,542
The more time I spend
with her, the more I like her.

121
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,083
That's how it is.

122
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,292
You spend time with someone,
you naturally start to like them.

123
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,375
That's just how it works.

124
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:33,625
What? So that's what this was all about?

125
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,292
You should've just said so.

126
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:38,125
Says the guy who ran out
in the middle of our meal.

127
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,958
That was because I didn't know.

128
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,667
So who confessed to you?

129
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:48,417
Forget it. It's not Soo-hyun.

130
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,458
Is it someone I know?

131
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,434
It's not someone from our company, is it?

132
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,750
Ah, who could it be?

133
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,458
I think I know who it is.

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,125
First, they're definitely younger than you.

135
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:01,292
Also, you,

136
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:03,542
seem to like people who are a bit childish.

137
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,227
Someone who's open with their feelings.

138
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,042
The type who acts without hesitation.

139
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:10,083
And knows how to be cute and charming.

140
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,750
For example...

141
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,708
someone like me.

142
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,417
Hey! Hurry up and pack so we can leave.

143
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:21,958
So who is it?

144
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,083
Tell me.

145
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,500
- Hurry up!
- Hi everyone!

146
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,625
Huh?

147
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,708
Moon Do-ha.

148
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,292
What brings you here?

149
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:31,083
You didn't reply, so I came.

150
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,750
Reply?

151
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,250
What reply?

152
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,375
The one that Gu Jae-yeon
is supposed to give me?

153
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,750
I get it now.

154
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,500
You two are up to something again.

155
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,667
Right?

156
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,250
Moon Do-ha.

157
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,917
Are you just going to
ask me directly like that?

158
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:00,917
Why not?

159
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:02,500
When else should I ask?

160
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:10,708
Just staying as close "brothers"...

161
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,338
That might be a bit
difficult, don't you think?

162
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,083
I already want something more.

163
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,417
I was confused too, honestly.

164
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:29,625
But while I was waiting for your answer,

165
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,625
I became more sure of my feelings.

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,833
That thing you're "more sure of"...

167
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,500
What does that mean...

168
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,875
No, never mind.

169
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,500
Go on, ask.

170
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:53,042
It's fine.

171
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,667
Stop agonizing over it and just date me.

172
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,208
Honestly, someone at my level...
is a total catch, right?

173
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,875
I'm young and I make good money.

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,292
I'm also talented.

175
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,257
We're in the same
business, and I don't drink.

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,375
For you to say all this about yourself...

177
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,208
It's...

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,375
What? Why are you smiling?

179
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,417
And they say once you find someone cute,
it's all over.

180
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,958
Don't tell me you think
you're cute right now.

181
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,792
Hmm?

182
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,542
Am I not?

183
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,542
You're right.

184
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,875
It's over. You're doomed.

185
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,292
Too close.

186
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:00,500
Huh?

187
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,083
I said [they're] too close.

188
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,375
Should just throw away
the members and quit?

189
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,625
No way.

190
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,893
Moon Do-ha is only like that
because he's been hurt a lot.

191
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,250
He really cares about his members.

192
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,292
Well...

193
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:13,976
They're all still young, so that's why.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,708
It'll get better with time.

195
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,000
What do we do?

196
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,292
I think Gu Jae-yeon turned someone down.

197
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,833
Is that what happened?

198
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,542
It wasn't like that...

199
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,667
Hey! I guessed it right.

200
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:33,042
He hangs out with Moon Do-ha every day.

201
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,458
Would someone in love do that?

202
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:39,250
It's nice that our Kim
Young-woo is so open-minded.

203
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,625
Huh?

204
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,917
Was that a compliment?

205
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,458
You're so dense.

206
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,458
Huh?

207
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,250
Wasn't that a compliment?

208
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,583
Manager.

209
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,958
What brings you here?

210
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,792
Well... there's something I need to tell
you, but it's a bit difficult to bring up.

211
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:07,917
Mr. Gu.

212
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,250
I know you're a kind and sincere person.

213
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:13,708
But Do-ha is a kid
who used to be all about work.

214
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,708
The CEO is very worried.

215
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,667
Worried in what way...?

216
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,851
Well... he used to be the kind of kid
who'd just stay in his dorm after work.

217
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,893
Now he's always running
off somewhere in his free time.

218
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,208
He's been going out more at night, too.

219
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,958
I see the CEO is quite concerned.

220
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,625
I understand what you mean.

221
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,333
But Do-ha...

222
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,833
He's brightened up a lot
since meeting you, Mr. Gu.

223
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,083
That's a relief.

224
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,167
(Incoming call from Moon Do-ha)

225
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:16,167
There's no shoot today.

226
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:17,833
Are you asleep already?

227
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,375
Do-ha, go get changed.

228
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,708
Yes, sir.

229
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:23,958
"My schedule is set."

230
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,518
"I'm going to be very busy for a while."

231
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:28,042
"I'll be focusing on work from now on."

232
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,333
Is Gu Jae-yeon that busy lately?

233
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,250
Yeah, he also took on a new project.

234
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,458
He's also working as
a martial arts director.

235
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,167
Busier than an idol.

236
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:40,042
So where is he now?

237
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:49,167
What are you doing?

238
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,455
I'm waiting for Gu Jae-yeon,
what does it look like?

239
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:55,042
Isn't Moon Do-ha a very busy man?

240
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,125
That's what I'm saying.

241
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,750
No, I'm swamped.
So why isn't he coming out?

242
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,667
Gu Jae-yeon!

243
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,875
Hyung.

244
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,500
Yeah?

245
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,292
Am I annoying?

246
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:12,000
What are you talking about?

247
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,292
Am I the kind of person
who gets on people's nerves?

248
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:16,333
What do you think?

249
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,208
It's the same thing.

250
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,208
Am I not charming?

251
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,833
Same difference. You're charming.

252
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,625
Why isn't he answering his phone...?

253
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,125
"My schedule is set.

254
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,250
I'm going to be very busy for a while.

255
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,625
I'll be focusing on work from now on."

256
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,792
What does this sound like to you guys?

257
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:41,417
It doesn't look good.

258
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:43,208
So he's rejecting me?

259
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,917
Yeah, looks like it.

260
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,976
No, but if he was going to reject
me, he should've just said so.

261
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,833
Why bring up work?

262
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,559
Isn't this just his way of
letting you down easy?

263
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,667
Especially that period.

264
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,250
That period is a little...

265
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,625
Yeah, the period.

266
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,851
If that's what he meant,
he should've used like, three of them.

267
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,750
But there's only one.

268
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,250
Hyung, what's your take?

269
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,667
Well...

270
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:07,208
I'm not so sure.

271
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,083
I change my mind.

272
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,542
It sounds like he really
means to focus on work.

273
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,667
Right? He must actually be busy.

274
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:20,208
Yeah, he must be.

275
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,542
Why would he beat around
the bush and be confusing?

276
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,083
It seems he's genuinely busy.

277
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,250
Speaking of which, I haven't
seen Moon Do-ha around lately.

278
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,208
I know, right? We used
to see him every day.

279
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,625
He said he's busy?

280
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,333
Oh, well...

281
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,458
Right. He is an idol, after all.

282
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,292
Where are you going?

283
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:42,292
To get some water.

284
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:43,250
I'll get it for you.

285
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,917
Why would you get it for me?

286
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,476
What? I can get it for you, can't I?

287
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,125
She left without even looking back.

288
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:53,125
Do you like Soo-hyun that much?

289
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,625
Yeah, she's so cool.

290
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,625
She's the best perk of
working at this company.

291
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,958
(Moon Do-ha)

292
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,750
I told him not to contact me.

293
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,292
What is he doing...?

294
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:16,292
Hyung, aren't you watching this?

295
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,417
What?

296
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,042
Lots of viewers are leaving comments.

297
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:23,250
Everyone must have tuned in
because they're excited for today's guest.

298
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:27,792
Alright, today,
we've invited a special guest.

299
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:30,083
Let's introduce our guest now.

300
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,833
Hello, everyone. I'm Moon Do-ha.

301
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,625
Mr. Moon, it's been a while.

302
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,893
You've been busy, haven't you?

303
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:38,667
Yes, I've been swamped.

304
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:40,667
To be specific,

305
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,708
what and where have you been working on?

306
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,333
A lot of our viewers are very curious.

307
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,333
Well...

308
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,250
I've been working hard on set, of course.

309
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,500
So, Mr. Moon,

310
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,542
what do you usually do
when you take a break?

311
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,708
Well... I'll read my script,

312
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,583
practice my dance moves
so I don't get rusty,

313
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,167
and rest like that.

314
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,708
Oh, come on, don't say that.

315
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,500
What does Mr. Moon do when he's resting?

316
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,292
Be honest and tell us.

317
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,083
But...

318
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,875
I don't really have much experience
with things outside of work.

319
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,458
Ah, wait.

320
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:19,375
Basketball. It's pretty fun.

321
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:24,417
I played basketball on my day off recently,

322
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:25,625
and I really enjoyed it.

323
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,833
Ah, to be young.

324
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,351
Are you good at basketball, Mr. Moon?

325
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,958
I love basketball, too.

326
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,208
No, it's not me.

327
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,458
It's because Mr. Gu Jae-yeon likes it.

328
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,375
I played with Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.

329
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,833
Ah, Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.
You mean the one who...

330
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,833
He's your martial arts instructor, right?

331
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:46,417
Yes.

332
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:50,042
Ah, one moment. Our writer is telling me...

333
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,833
A phone call? Uh, excuse me,

334
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,125
can we get Mr. Gu Jae-yeon
on the phone right now?

335
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,250
Yes, hurry!

336
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,708
We can do that right this second?

337
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,875
