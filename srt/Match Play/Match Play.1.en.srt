00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,243
(Baekseung Action School)

2
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:04,167
Hey, did you guys hear?

3
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:06,417
Jae-yeon's going to train that idol.

4
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:08,083
I heard he's a total jerk.

5
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,958
If you do a good job,
won't this put you on the map?

6
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:12,500
Hello.

7
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,042
I'm Gu Jae-yeon.

8
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:15,583
The director was injured,

9
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,708
so I'll be in charge of training for now.

10
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,333
You're just a substitute,
and you have such an average build.

11
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,292
Can you even teach me properly?

12
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:25,250
I'll just wait for the
director to come back.

13
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,292
If I train you seriously,

14
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:30,833
can you even keep up?

15
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,198
What do you think you're doing?

16
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,167
Then, let's begin the lesson.

17
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,333
Change it.

18
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,333
What?

19
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,625
That weird t-shirt.

20
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,042
The t-shirt is the problem.

21
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:47,250
Come on out.

22
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,375
- Hey...
- Excuse me.

23
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,500
Hey!

24
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:50,833
Let me change your shirt for you.

25
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:51,958
Okay.

26
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,333
Let go.

27
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,458
Let's just be honest with each other.

28
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,375
You don't want to train me anyway, right?

29
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,333
Well...

30
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,958
I'm not exactly thrilled about it.

31
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,083
(Moon Do-ha assaults member)
I heard some things...

32
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:05,958
about you, Mr. Moon Do-ha.

33
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,283
(Is it normal to hit members?)

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,500
But this is a job.

35
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,768
Whether you like it or not, you
do it. That's being a professional.

36
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:13,500
That's exactly the problem.

37
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,375
Professionals work with professionals.

38
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,583
Do you really think you're
qualified to train me?

39
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,458
Push.

40
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:20,583
Dodge.

41
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:21,208
Punch.
Watch your opponent.

42
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,583
Kick.

43
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,000
You did pretty well.

44
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,333
For a beginner.

45
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,708
What? That was nothing.

46
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:30,708
Can I get a refund?

47
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,875
All right, let's pick up the pace now.

48
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,292
What?

49
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,292
Focus.

50
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:37,167
Attack! Defend!

51
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:38,625
Defend.

52
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,750
Dodge.

53
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,167
Focus!

54
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,833
I'm not sure what you mean by "qualified,"
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

55
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,998
But it looks like you won't
be needing that refund.

56
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,750
So, as planned, I'll be
teaching the next class.

57
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,708
No need.

58
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,542
I don't like you.

59
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,542
So either cancel the contract
or get me a new instructor.

60
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:09,917
And the reason is?

61
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:12,208
You're not going to...

62
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,208
throw a tantrum on the
floor like a child, are you?

63
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,208
You really think you can beat me?

64
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,792
I dance for hours every single day.

65
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:24,750
Do you think just anyone can be an idol?

66
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:25,958
So...

67
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:29,458
if I lose, that's your excuse
to get a new instructor?

68
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,958
It's not an excuse.

69
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,603
The instructor simply lacks the skill.

70
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,208
Is there a better reason than that?

71
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,208
First one back wins.

72
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,375
Ten laps.

73
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,375
Ten laps. First one back wins.

74
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Ready...

75
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,417
Go!

76
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,958
You okay?

77
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,167
I heard your answer loud and clear.

78
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,167
Replace him.

79
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:11,500
Do-ha, the filming schedule is all out.

80
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,025
You have to film self-made content
in the action school.

81
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,583
Hurry up and go.

82
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:19,125
Good work today, everyone.

83
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,458
Gu Jae-yeon.

84
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,500
You're filming with Moon Do-ha.

85
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,250
Filming?
Isn't he an idol?

86
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,375
He said he wanted to
film some training footage.

87
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,708
So I said yes.

88
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,833
What else did he say?

89
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,125
Ah, "Ja-con".
[Short for: Self-made content]

90
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,250
Anyway, that day is an outdoor
training session for everyone.

91
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,000
Dismissed.

92
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,792
Good work.

93
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,000
Jak-heon?

94
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,083
Jak-heon.
[He typed the wrong word.]

95
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,833
"To pour wine and offer
it to the gods at a festival."
[Also did not use MZ dictionary.]

96
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,458
What does that even mean?

97
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,417
Twenty-six.
Twenty-seven.

98
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,375
Twenty-eight.

99
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Twenty-nine.

100
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:53,542
Thirty.

101
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,208
Left foot, again.

102
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:56,958
Again. Two.

103
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:57,833
Why is it always "two"?!
Two.

104
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,809
Does that guy not even
know what "self-made content" is?

105
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,083
He's only focused on training?

106
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,667
Let's take a break.

107
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:06,708
That idol's self-made content...

108
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,625
it's for the fans.

109
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,958
How about trying to
be a little nicer to him?

110
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,333
Yes, I understand.

111
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,042
Okay, so you know how I hit you twice?

112
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,417
This time, you subdue me.

113
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:19,708
After you subdue me,

114
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,667
give me two uppercuts.

115
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:23,458
Hit me hard.

116
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,125
Then, when you do the kick,

117
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,375
please go a bit slower.

118
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,375
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

119
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,667
Please focus. The actor could get hurt.

120
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,125
You look exhausted.

121
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,375
What's wrong?

122
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,292
Do you want to take a break now?

123
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,042
What am I going to do with that guy?

124
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,083
Just air the fight scene from before.

125
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,809
We'll just have to deal with the backlash.

126
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,708
(If you don't want to do it, then don't)
(Totally fed up with the world)

127
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:51,708
(Stuntman VS Idol)

128
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,500
Ah! Stop hitting him!

129
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,505
(So cool how he doesn't
go easy on a celebrity)

130
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,250
Wow! It's a celebrity, a celebrity!

131
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,042
Don't be like that.

132
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,000
You're pretty good at
stealing the spotlight.

133
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:02,917
Do-ha.

134
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:05,125
Don't make your instructor too famous.

135
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,000
The CEO said he got an
offer for his own variety show.

136
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,958
People change once they get money.

137
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:11,833
You know how it is.

138
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,042
You're here.

139
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,375
The instructor is later than the student.

140
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,208
Is this what happens when you get famous?

141
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,583
Class doesn't start for another 20 minutes.

142
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,417
So you're not denying you're famous.

143
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,917
Slower, ease up on the power.

144
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:24,458
Good work.

145
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,958
Take ten.

146
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,333
Hello...

147
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,458
Hey, that thing you did...

148
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,833
that ja-con?

149
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,000
It's gone viral.

150
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,000
So...

151
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,750
you got an offer for a variety show?

152
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,167
- Me?
- Yeah.

153
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:45,333
It's my first time, so
I was a bit surprised.

154
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,818
The appearance fee is really high.

155
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,083
That's great.

156
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:51,542
Director.

157
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,167
I...

158
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:54,958
I'm not interested.

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,750
It's not like I earned
this on my own merit.

160
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,167
I want to focus on my team.

161
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:02,667
Hey, you...

162
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,208
Just take it.

163
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,625
No.

164
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:09,542
I'm sorry.

165
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,583
I'm an injured man...

166
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,167
Sorry.

167
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:15,268
I told you to take it! Do you
know how much money that is?

168
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,792
Director, your crutch.

169
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,434
You think you're the only one who matters?

170
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,458
Are we just your backup?

171
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,083
What's wrong with you? Stop it.

172
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:29,708
It's starting again.

173
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,333
It seems like it's starting again.

174
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,309
Let's get a clearer shot of his face here.

175
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,542
Let's adjust it.

176
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,292
Then, like you said earlier,

177
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:37,708
let's add that move in.

178
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,875
Won't that show off the
facial expressions better?

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,042
Senior.

180
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:43,792
Moon Do-ha?

181
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,375
Is there training today?

182
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,333
I came to practice.

183
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,792
At this hour?

184
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,667
What's wrong? Why hasn't he gone home?

185
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,833
He doesn't want to go home?

186
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,417
Come with me for a second.

187
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,083
What's this?

188
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,083
I heard you have trouble sleeping.

189
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,042
Training like that at
night will ruin your health.

190
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:35,322
You should try to get some
rest, even if it's just a nap.

191
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,667
Lie down.

192
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,583
Do you think I came here to sleep?

193
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,417
I don't know much about the idol world,

194
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:51,875
so this might sound presumptuous,

195
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,375
but when you're troubled, you need to rest.

196
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,000
I know perfectly well what I'm like.

197
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,833
Then you clean it up, Moon Do-ha.

198
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,833
You made this mess.

199
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,583
What...?

200
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,583
You know you're talking nonsense, right?

201
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,292
This is training.

202
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,292
Stay here for 30 minutes.

203
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,750
This is workplace harassment, isn't it?

204
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,042
What am I supposed to do?

205
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,833
What are you doing?

206
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,750
My hand just slipped.

207
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,792
Please, just finish what you were doing.

208
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,167
Why did he even spread it all out?

209
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,333
Did Moon Do-ha leave?

210
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,958
Where is he?

211
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,875
He's in special training.

212
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,125
Hey.

213
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,500
Did you sleep well?

214
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:29,167
Well...

215
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,250
I was just resting my eyes.

216
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,125
Want one, Moon Do-ha?

217
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,542
Huh?

218
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,333
I accidentally ordered the wrong thing.

219
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,750
Why would I eat that?

220
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,042
That stuff is so greasy.

221
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,917
I'm leaving.

222
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,042
He must be hungry.

223
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,458
Looks like he really left.

224
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,583
Who knows?

225
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,333
He might come back.

226
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,292
No way!

227
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:56,476
You think that Moon Do-ha
would come back for something like this?

228
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,875
And run all the way back?

229
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:08,917
What?

230
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,167
What is it?

231
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:11,292
What?

232
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:12,917
We weren't talking.

233
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:16,917
No, I was just thinking.

234
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:18,792
If you ordered it by mistake,

235
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,997
then the rest is just going
to be thrown out, right?

236
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,434
Better to give it to someone
than to let it go to waste.

237
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,292
I could've eaten it.

238
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:26,250
Yeah, why order the wrong thing

239
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,042
and make things so awkward?

240
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:36,208
Now that you've eaten, let's burn it off.

241
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:41,542
Moon Do-ha.

242
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,125
Time for a run.

243
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:44,875
Doing okay?

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,333
Again, again.

245
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:47,583
How about it?

246
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,893
Feel like you've burned some of it off?

247
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,667
Who burns off calories like this?

248
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,625
But I thought you were weak.

249
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:55,417
You're a pretty good fighter.

250
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:02,375
Ah, I'm hungry again.

251
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,309
Use this and go buy
whatever you all want to eat.

252
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,208
Awesome!

253
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,792
I'm heading out!

254
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,125
Are you sure?

255
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,542
These kids can eat a lot.

256
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,958
You're not worried
about my wallet, are you?

257
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:36,583
(Transferred 45,000 won to you)

258
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,917
Huh?

259
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:39,917
What's this transfer?

260
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,602
It's for the money the kids just spent.

261
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,875
Why are you sending me this?

262
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,750
Did they spend a lot?

263
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,625
Do you think I can't even afford that?

264
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,893
Can't I do something nice for you?

265
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,958
You're really hurting my pride here.

266
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,250
Just you wait.

267
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,708
Let me take this chance to
show you some generosity.

268
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,125
There's really someone like this.

269
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,833
Bro, did you see you're in the news?

270
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,417
It says a variety show wants you.

271
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:07,822
Bro, are you going to be a star?

272
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,167
Hey, stuntmen don't become stars.

273
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:11,518
Instead of wasting your time here,

274
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,434
you should be getting
ready to be an influencer.

275
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,042
Move. I have a shoot
tomorrow and I'm busy.

276
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,792
Soo-hyun.

277
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:21,750
Did you see my message?

278
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,792
No, I haven't seen it. What's up?

279
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:26,417
Moon Do-ha suddenly
asked me for your picture.

280
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:28,583
My picture?

281
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,875
What for?

282
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,125
I don't know.

283
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,667
Have they started filming?

284
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,583
No, not yet.

285
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,917
It's about to start.

286
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:38,000
Be careful of Actor Yoo Sang-cheol.

287
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,125
You know how it is.

288
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,167
People get jealous of
those who make it big.

289
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,208
Where are you scumbags?

290
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,667
Come on out!

291
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,917
You asshole!

292
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,875
You scumbag!

293
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,083
Cut! Okay.

294
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,833
What do we do?

295
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,750
He's bleeding. Are you okay?

296
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,792
It's real blood. What do we do?

297
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:23,917
I'm fine.

298
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,250
You were supposed to dodge that, you idiot.

299
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:36,875
What's up?

300
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,417
Bro, where are you?

301
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:39,750
Are you in the van?

302
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,083
I'm on set.

303
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,458
Why? Is the director looking for me?

304
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,083
Moon Do-ha is unbelievable.

305
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,667
Hey, are you kidding me?

306
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,917
A food truck...

307
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:49,625
Hey, you expect me to eat this garbage?

308
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,292
Hey, what's with all the noise?

309
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,250
Bro, Jae-yeon.

310
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,292
Look at this. Isn't it amazing?

311
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,101
I should take a picture to show
Park Soo-hyun and brag a little.

312
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,405
(Gu Jae-yeon, the Idol of the Stunt World)
(Save the filming set! [play on words])

313
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,250
Yes, this is Moon Do-ha.

314
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,250
What is all this?

315
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,833
Did you see it?

316
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:15,792
You can spare me the thanks.

317
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:18,417
You think I'm grateful for this?

318
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:19,583
Then what?

319
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,458
What stuntman in the world

320
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,542
hands out lunch boxes
with his face on them?

321
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,042
They don't usually do that?

322
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,125
Of course not. I'm not even the lead!

323
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,583
What's this?

324
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,125
Is this all Gu Jae-yeon amounts to?

325
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,583
Take this seriously.

326
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,167
You're my instructor, after all.

327
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,667
How does this reflect on me?

328
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:41,375
So, what does this have to do with me?

329
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:44,917
Look, even if you're not grateful,

330
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:45,792
do you have to have this attitude?

331
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:48,500
I'll thank you when you do
something worthy of thanks.

332
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:52,417
Bro, are we free?

333
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:53,333
Yeah, what's up?

334
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,458
Where are you going?

335
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,583
Hello?

336
00:14:56,917 --> 00:14:57,792
Hello?

337
00:14:57,917 --> 00:14:59,833
Bro, Moon Do-ha is really something else.

338
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,101
Do you know how many he sent?

339
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,208
Moon Do-ha, the pop idol?

340
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,667
Guess he's got some clout after all.

341
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,083
Bro, at this rate, are you really
going to become a celebrity?

342
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,625
Not just anyone can be a celebrity.

343
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,167
Gu Jae-yeon

344
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,708
"saved the filming set"!

345
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,875
Don't be ridiculous.

346
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,667
Who's here?

347
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,250
The actors were already in a bad mood,

348
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,917
and now all this?

349
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:35,375
But hey, the food is
good, so that's a plus.

350
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,893
Is the taste what's important right now?

351
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:37,750
"Saved the filming set"?

352
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,542
And it doesn't even taste good.

353
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:42,307
What are you saying?
When you're enjoying it while you complain.

354
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,458
Moon Do-ha.

355
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,601
Aren't you busy, Moon Do-ha?

356
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,750
My shoot is coming up, so I
thought I'd drop by and observe.

357
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:49,875
Show me.

358
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,328
Let's see what my instructor
is capable of, shall we?

359
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,000
You scumbag.

360
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,125
Moon Do-ha, when you kick,

361
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,625
you have to hit your
mark precisely. Precisely.

362
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,333
If you get emotional,
someone's going to get hurt.

363
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:13,833
Moon Do-ha.

364
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,208
It's fine. Go ahead and kick.

365
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,375
You scumbag!

366
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,167
A scumbag like you.

367
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,750
