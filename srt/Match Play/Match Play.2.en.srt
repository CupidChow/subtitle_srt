1
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:04,167
Hello everyone, I'm Moon
Do-ha from Challengers...

2
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:05,809
- You have to push me really hard in a sec.
- And say:

3
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:07,268
"I'm really looking
forward to this new project!"

4
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:08,833
What is he doing?

5
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:10,976
They said they're filming
behind-the-scenes footage.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,875
Behind-the-scenes footage?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,018
Right here, we have our...

8
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:15,125
special guest, Mr. Gu Jae-yeon!

9
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,250
Please say hello.

10
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,458
Hello everyone.

11
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,458
I'm Gu Jae-yeon.

12
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,875
Ah, Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,167
There's something I'm
really curious about...

14
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:32,917
In these so-called action movies,

15
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:35,917
do you... actually hit each other for real?

16
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,893
- When you're in the moment...
- things can get more intense than planned.

17
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:41,768
Sometimes you hit harder
than you mean to, right?

18
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,042
Isn't that something you
need to apologize for?

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,667
That bastard...

20
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,417
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

21
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:58,167
Are you messing with me?

22
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,292
Why are you being so unreasonable?

23
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:01,500
Hey!

24
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,167
Watch what you say when
you're in front of the camera.

25
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:13,667
What did I say to deserve that?

26
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,292
I didn't even say anything.

27
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:18,000
What's wrong?

28
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,667
Feeling guilty about something?

29
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:22,417
No... You're an idol, so why act like this?

30
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:24,375
For the measly stunt team?

31
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,250
That what?

32
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,083
Well...

33
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:33,833
But because of that 'measly' stunt team,

34
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,833
your whole career might get ruined.

35
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,542
Right now, I'm...

36
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,809
just so curious about why Mr. Gu Jae-yeon
had to take that beating.

37
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,583
I'm just so curious.

38
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:44,292
And I was just about
to start asking around.

39
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,583
Maybe I was born to be a manager.

40
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,750
How interesting.

41
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,792
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,125
What were you doing a while ago?

43
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,875
Trying to repay a favor?

44
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,542
Consider this my
payment for the fried rice.

45
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,542
Sit still.

46
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:25,542
No but, when my temper flares up...

47
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,542
These things just happen
when you're working.

48
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:28,750
Ah, I'm just...

49
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,333
I'm such a terrible actor, really!

50
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,250
No, I'm truly sorry.

51
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,875
I told you I was busy. Why
did you suggest going there?

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,880
We still have filming
tomorrow, and now this...

53
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,583
Are you tired?

54
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,750
Not at all.

55
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,000
Not tired at all.

56
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,601
Director, you were looking for me?

57
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,083
Oh, Gu Jae-yeon, you're here.

58
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,583
Looks like we're saved now.

59
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,768
Thank you for your hard work.

60
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,042
How's Moon Do-ha?

61
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:33,208
Huh?
I'm asking how he is.

62
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,917
I'm taking over, so I need
to know what I'm getting into.

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,940
He's... should I say, he's the
type to be up for a challenge?

64
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,292
He's a very competitive guy.

65
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,125
Thanks for all your hard work.

66
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,625
Thank you.

67
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,182
The footage should turn out great, right?

68
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:56,750
What's this?

69
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,667
Trying to butter me up now?

70
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,083
But isn't it a little too late for that?

71
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,000
Today is your last day.

72
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,250
Too bad, but what can you do?

73
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,333
That's just how life is...

74
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,750
You have to seize
opportunities when they come.

75
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:25,583
Seriously...

76
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,833
Moon Do-ha.

77
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:31,059
With an injury like this, how
do we handle the insurance?

78
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,883
So, does this count as
a work-related injury?

79
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:34,167
The injury is too minor!

80
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:36,000
You should have been more careful!

81
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,833
By the way, don't
you have a session today?

82
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:42,250
Me?

83
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,250
Yeah, today Moon Do-ha...

84
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,542
Ah...

85
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,507
You're not training
Moon Do-ha anymore?

86
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:50,250
Yeah, I'm free now.

87
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,875
Then can you check my form?

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,375
- Just once!
- Hey, wait a minute.

89
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,833
I said I was going to ask first.

90
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:56,958
I said it first!

91
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:58,125
Just once is fine.

92
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,000
I just need to practice the timing.

93
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,125
So this is where you were.

94
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:05,625
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

95
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,958
So, what exactly is up?

96
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,125
I'm screwed.

97
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:18,208
Good, very good.

98
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,333
Come on, come on.

99
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,625
Good work today. You can go home.

100
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,667
Whoa! Your form is pretty good.

101
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
Are we done?

102
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,375
I usually only train people like that.

103
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,420
Besides, your face
does all the work.

104
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,708
Good work!

105
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,042
But is there a problem with that?

106
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,643
Isn't this the kind of training you wanted?

107
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:40,101
For difficult action scenes,
physical conditioning is essential.

108
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,351
For the time being, Mr. Moon Do-ha

109
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,250
will be training alongside
our team members.

110
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,125
Well...

111
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,833
There's no time, so why bother?

112
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,583
That's enough.

113
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,417
You need to take responsibility.

114
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,268
Because of you, I'm stuck with
this half-assed training.

115
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:55,452
I'm not satisfied, so you
have to take responsibility.

116
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,125
Then starting tomorrow,

117
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,917
I'll contact you.

118
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,583
I'm afraid I can't do that.

119
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:05,500
What?

120
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:11,792
I've already completed the
full handover to the director.

121
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:14,309
And I've already reached an
agreement with the team about this.

122
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,208
What's with this attitude?

123
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,667
Is that any way to treat the person
who brought you food?

124
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:20,917
Ah...

125
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:23,000
Are you saying 'we're even' now?

126
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:31,375
If... outside of the training sessions,
you need my help with anything,

127
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
I'm always willing to help.

128
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,292
Then... you may leave.

129
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:41,042
So, are you free tomorrow?

130
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,458
Tomorrow?

131
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,792
I am.

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,458
Okay, see you tomorrow then.

133
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,167
Why is there so much to film today?

134
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,417
I knew it.

135
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,042
Hyung, you can go ahead.

136
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,792
What are you talking about?

137
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:12,917
The special manager who was
supposed to come today is here.

138
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:17,250
Is that Mr. Moon Do-ha's practice room?

139
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,583
I brought the protective gear...

140
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,625
Should I grab the wrist guards too?

141
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:29,292
What the...

142
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,208
Mr. Do-ha, this...

143
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,934
This was supposed to be for your manager.

144
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:32,833
I couldn't find him.

145
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,333
This is today's filming schedule.

146
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,708
So this was supposed
to go to the manager...

147
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,125
- I don't know where he is...
- Assistant Director?

148
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,542
The manager is here.

149
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,250
Manager!

150
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,893
Where have you been? Hurry
up and go check the wardrobe.

151
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,125
Me?

152
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,833
How can I be a manager?

153
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,542
Why not? Even I've done it.

154
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:54,292
- Um...
- You did say you were always willing to help.

155
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:55,500
I even checked the date.

156
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,042
Is Mr. Moon Do-ha's manager here?

157
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,208
Are you just going to let her be like that?

158
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,643
The standby time has been
extended from 30 minutes to 50.

159
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:03,809
Please check the shooting schedule.

160
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,458
The PD confirmed this
outfit and requested a change.

161
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,792
How can they change it so suddenly?

162
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:11,833
Manager,
you should have stopped them.

163
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,708
He's always like this. I can't work.

164
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:14,667
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:16,125
Ah, seriously.

166
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:16,667
Huh?
Huh?

167
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,250
Huh?

168
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,208
Isn't that the guy from Do-ha's
vlog?

169
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,208
You're right, it is!

170
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,708
Oh my gosh, what do I do?

171
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,500
Could you take a picture with me, please?

172
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,625
W-With me?

173
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,958
Thank you so much!

174
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,518
Manager, please give
me wardrobe option one.

175
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:37,583
Yes.

176
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:40,458
This one... they said it should
be paired with the bracelet.

177
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,750
Yes, understood.

178
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,000
What is this...

179
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,958
Why aren't you answering your phone?

180
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,958
I'm sorry, I was running around like crazy.

181
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,875
Anyway, the wardrobe has been changed.

182
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,875
Please change into this.

183
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,625
Anyone who didn't know better
would think you're a real manager.

184
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,630
Not even my own
has helped me like this.

185
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,417
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

186
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:07,833
What is it?

187
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,250
Yes, we're getting ready
to shoot. Please stand by.

188
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,792
No, please head over.

189
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:15,000
Go on, what is it?

190
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,292
I also... wanted to be in
charge of your training.

191
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,976
But because of the established procedures,

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,417
we can't do it, so...

193
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:23,750
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,667
What was that...

195
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,583
Here, please take good care of this.

196
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,792
You're my manager, after all.

197
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:39,792
Right?

198
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,125
Um...

199
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,917
Do a good job.

200
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,292
Fighting!

201
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,208
Have you ever seen me fail at anything?

202
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,667
Young-woo, Young-woo.

203
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,583
Where did Jae-yeon go?

204
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,292
I don't know. Did he go
out with Moon Do-ha?

205
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:57,875
Did they go for outdoor training?

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,625
Anyway, he is a 'stuntman'
through and through.

207
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,583
Hmm?

208
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,875
To think he'd take an actor outside...

209
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,250
They're outside, all right.

210
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,625
But I doubt it's for training.

211
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,309
(Moon Do-ha and a stunt actor, even visiting
the set?) (Real-time proof of real friendship!)

212
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,958
Jae-yeon?

213
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,250
How's the action school?

214
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,375
Is everything going well?

215
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,042
It's going great.

216
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,167
I'm great at everything I do.

217
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,042
That guy... he's trending again.

218
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,375
Who?

219
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,750
Oh... Gu Jae-yeon.

220
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,583
We didn't do anything, though.

221
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,125
Not you, with another actor.

222
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,833
Huh?

223
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,292
What is it?

224
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,863
Popular Stunt Actor Gu Jae-yeon.

225
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,833
Turns Out to Be Actor Shin
Jun-ho's Original Stunt Double.

226
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,792
It's in the news.

227
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,476
Bro, I think you're actually famous now.

228
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Shin Jun-ho is trying to act all chummy...

229
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,018
Chummy? What are you talking about?

230
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:03,500
He just said we'd worked together.

231
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,708
But is that okay?

232
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,375
Creating buzz without your permission?

233
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,458
Wow, Shin Jun-ho is using you for clout?

234
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,583
Bro, just how famous are you going to get?

235
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,125
Famous? Don't be ridiculous.

236
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,417
It's just temporary.

237
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,542
For something temporary,
it's lasting a while.

238
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,083
Hasn't a lot already changed?

239
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,583
Like... how people around you are reacting?

240
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,792
Nothing like that.

241
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,042
Let's watch together.

242
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Look.

243
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,792
Isn't Jae-yeon way more
handsome than Shin Jun-ho?

244
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:31,333
Of course.

245
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:34,125
Do you like Jae-yeon?

246
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,542
Why am I in such a bad mood?

247
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,542
Hmm?

248
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:00,958
"Hey..."

249
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,458
"Hello, Moon Do-ha."

250
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,253
"You know I haven't
started filming yet, right?"

251
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:10,917
"Yes."

252
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,792
"Is this how you treat people you know?"

253
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:16,708
"Don't tell me before
this job is even over,"

254
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,553
"you're already moving on to someone else?"

255
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:22,559
"If my reputation takes
a hit because of this,"

256
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,000
"will you take responsibility?"

257
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,000
What the...

258
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,750
Why isn't he responding?

259
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,917
"I'll be more careful from now on."?

260
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,667
Hey, hey!

261
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,000
Bro, did you see this?

262
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,667
There's news about Moon Do-ha's movie.

263
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,000
Your name is in it, too.

264
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,583
Oh, really?

265
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,917
Why are you...

266
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,750
Is something bothering you?

267
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,917
Reputation?

268
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,708
Did I do something wrong?

269
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,875
Are you free after your schedule today?

270
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,458
Why?

271
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:21,167
I'd like to treat you to dinner.
That's why I was asking.

272
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:22,932
It's a place an actor I know recommended.

273
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:25,282
It's been a while since I've
had a proper, healthy meal.

274
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,542
So, where did you say you were going?

275
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:34,417
He said it's a place an
actor friend recommended.

276
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,333
Your old classmate is
really well-connected.

277
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,292
Bro, are you going to meet him?

278
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,958
It's not a date, is it?

279
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,601
I'm going to a class
reunion. What's it to you?

280
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,417
So lame.

281
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,434
You seem close with
your old classmates.

282
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,417
Mine went our separate
ways a long time ago.

283
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,958
No... we're not particularly close.

284
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,542
Then why are you going?

285
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,708
This year, they suddenly
scheduled it around my availability.

286
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,583
I'm heading out.

287
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,458
See you, bro.

288
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:02,583
What's wrong?

289
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,625
It's nothing...

290
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,000
He was a little snappy.

291
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,458
Why isn't Gu Jae-yeon here yet?

292
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,476
I absolutely have to get
a picture with him today.

293
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,625
He needs to get here soon.

294
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,500
Oh, hey!
Over here.

295
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,208
Oh, Jae-yeon.

296
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,500
Jae-yeon.

297
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:25,000
Jae-yeon, you doing okay?
What's with all the fame lately?

298
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:26,667
What fame...

299
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,458
Hurry up and ask for a picture.

300
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,667
No, seriously, my girlfriend
said she's a huge fan.

301
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:32,101
I have to get a picture with you later.

302
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,583
What're you saying?

303
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,708
That's true.

304
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,143
You're finally getting close to Moon Do-ha,
so you've got to play your cards right.

305
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,333
What nonsense.

306
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,208
Hey.

307
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,851
How does Moon Do-ha get
along with his group members?

308
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,583
Are they really on bad terms?

309
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,542
Just kidding. I'm not curious at all.

310
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,500
You know I work at an agency, right?

311
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,167
I've seen way more
celebrities than you have.

312
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:56,292
This place, too.

313
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:58,897
It's a spot where production
company execs hang out, you know?

314
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,500
Is that so?

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,042
Sir.

316
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,875
You didn't call the guys here, did you?

317
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,880
How long are you all
going to avoid each other?

318
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:09,250
During your trainee days,
weren't you all thick as thieves?

319
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,625
How did it come to this?

320
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,125
How should I know?

321
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,417
Anyway, my only crime was working too hard.

322
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,875
I don't want to be
forced to meet like this.

323
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,708
Young-woo, are you off work?

324
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,333
I'm about to leave, too.

325
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:24,667
Yeah.

326
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,000
See you at the office.

327
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:27,958
Okay.

328
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:30,958
So why did you...

329
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,583
You and that Gu Jae-yeon guy,

330
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,833
have been creating a lot of buzz, right?

331
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,625
Why are you bringing him up here?

332
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,226
The closer you get to him, the more the
rumors about your group's conflict will grow.

333
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't you get it?

334
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,458
Moon Do-ha?

335
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,958
Huh?

336
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:45,667
Are you on the phone?

337
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,083
Hello?

338
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,167
Moon Do-ha.

339
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,018
Is it okay if you just hang up like that?

340
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,250
How about you?

341
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,833
Who are you with?

342
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,958
Uh...

343
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,292
Don't a lot of celebrities come here?

344
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:06,333
Turns out you came with Shin Jun-ho.

345
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,500
- Who?
- Where is he?

346
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,917
I heard he's got great
proportions in person.

347
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:15,583
No, I'm just... with my classmates.

348
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:17,542
No, but...

349
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:21,625
Why would I come to a
place like this with him?

350
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:26,333
I heard you two are close.

351
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,583
Close? We're not close.

352
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,917
We just worked together last year.

353
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,917
Really?

354
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,458
Yes.

355
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:45,167
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go.

356
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,917
Um, well...

357
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,042
Did I say something wrong?

358
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:03,393
He's only getting some temporary buzz
thanks to Moon Do-ha.

359
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,458
He'll be forgotten soon enough, right?

360
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,792
Why are you so jealous?

361
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:10,250
Enough. Stop talking and let's drink.

362
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,542
Cheers.

363
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:16,833
Done with your call?

364
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,542
You're busy these days, huh?

365
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:20,292
It's alright.

366
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,018
But our class has
produced a real celebrity.

367
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:22,792
It's great.

368
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,708
We finally have a celebrity among us.

369
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:25,875
Hey now.

370
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,500
A stunt actor doesn't count
as a celebrity, does he?

371
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:31,125
Stop it.

372
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,583
I'm right, aren't I?

373
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,750
Do you guys think Gu
Jae-yeon is a celebrity?

374
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,637
Have you said everything you wanted to say?

375
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,917
Is that all you have to say?

376
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Stop gossiping and talking behind my back.

377
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,125
Hey!

378
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,125
Hey... that's enough.

379
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,750
I couldn't stand you even back in school.

380
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,435
Acting like you were doing something so
important, always coming back covered in injuries.

381
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,559
Just to get the girls' attention.

382
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,000
And it's the same today!
Usually, you're nowhere to be found.

383
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,583
Why do you suddenly show
up the moment you get famous?

384
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,500
Sorry, I'm leaving.

385
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,625
Are you happy being in the spotlight?

386
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:20,792
Of course, it's great.

387
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,208
First off, I get more work, which is nice.

388
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,792
Another benefit is...

389
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,500
it automatically filters
out the people in my life.

390
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,333
And lastly...

391
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,500
that idea that I got hurt
"just to get attention"...

392
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,875
where on earth did that even come from?

393
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,708
Hey, Gu Jae-yeon!

394
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,333
You think I know fewer
upperclassmen than you?

395
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,000
Just stop!

396
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,125
What's your problem?

397
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,542
Where should we go?

398
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,708
Well...

399
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:06,184
Weren't you the one who wanted to come out?

400
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,417
You came out without even
thinking of a place to go?

401
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,000
What about you?

402
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,667
Did you come out with
a destination in mind?

403
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,208
You've probably eaten.

404
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,333
Let's skip the drinks.

405
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,042
I don't drink.

406
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,000
You don't drink?

407
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,500
It only causes more trouble if I do.

408
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,750
Oh...

409
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,458
What's with that reaction?

410
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,375
What about a cafe?

411
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:39,583
Pass.

412
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,726
Going out would be a hassle
for you, right, Moon Do-ha?

413
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,167
Yeah.

414
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,625
Well then...

415
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,550
I guess that leaves just
one place we can go.

416
