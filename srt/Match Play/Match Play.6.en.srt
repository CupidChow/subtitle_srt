1
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:06,208
It seems he's very busy.

2
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:07,500
It's a shame,

3
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:10,225
but we'll have to save our call with
Gu Jae-yeon for another time.

4
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,042
Yes.

5
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:12,417
This is Gu Jae-yeon.

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,292
Oh, Gu Jae-yeon! Hello.

7
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:19,250
Yes, hello.

8
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,042
Wow, who is this?

9
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:22,958
If it isn't our very own Gu Jae-yeon.

10
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:30,000
How have you been?

11
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:32,958
Yes, I've been well.

12
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:36,333
Weren't you supposed to be extremely busy?

13
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,958
Seems like you're doing just fine.

14
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,417
You haven't changed a bit, Moon Do-ha.

15
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,417
That doesn't sound like a compliment.

16
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:47,083
How have you been?

17
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:50,000
I've been... okay.

18
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:52,417
Doesn't sound like it.

19
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,417
Gu Jae-yeon.

20
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,917
Want to play some basketball?

21
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:05,833
You'll come, right?

22
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,833
It's fine if you don't.

23
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:10,958
I'll be there.

24
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:12,792
See you in a bit then.

25
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:15,250
What was that... Moon Do-ha!

26
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,375
No...

27
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,042
Hey, are you crazy?

28
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,143
There's an uproar for "basketball court and "Moon Do-ha" right now!
[Note: He's most likely talking about real-time trending topic]

29
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:35,250
I didn't mention a
location, so don't worry.

30
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,292
Hey! You really...

31
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:40,250
That's not the point right now!

32
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,417
Can't we just let it go?

33
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,833
I'll try harder.

34
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:46,417
No, I'll do a good job.

35
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,833
With the members.

36
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,750
I'll have a good talk with them, too.

37
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,542
Do-ha, there's this thing...

38
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,042
Oh, he's here.

39
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:01,167
I'm hanging up.

40
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:02,708
Hey! Hey!

41
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,542
Moon Do-ha!

42
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:11,167
Who hangs up the phone like that?

43
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:12,958
Me?

44
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,833
Did I do something wrong?

45
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:24,625
You didn't.

46
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,667
Liar.

47
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,250
If I'm being annoying,

48
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,667
just say so.

49
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:39,000
Stop avoiding me all the time.

50
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,417
Then I'll try to be less annoying.

51
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,333
Otherwise,

52
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,608
do you want me to show you
what being truly annoying is like?

53
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,542
What if you're even more annoying than now?

54
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:07,917
What do you mean, "what if?"

55
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:10,375
You just have to put up with me.

56
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,500
Stop laughing and answer me.

57
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:18,750
Answer me.

58
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:34,976
I'll give it to you if you answer.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,500
If you answer, I'll give it to you.

60
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,000
Answer me!

61
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,250
Give it to me!

62
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,208
The ball's right here.
Why can't you get it?

63
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,708
You should just answer.

64
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:00,500
But you actually came, so it seems

65
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,792
you don't hate me that much, right?

66
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:10,292
Honestly... I'm not so sure.

67
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,958
Not sure about what?

68
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,042
If it's okay for me to
be like this with you.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,833
Moon Do-ha, you know, don't you?

70
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:26,083
Reality isn't that simple.

71
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:34,958
Let's go. It's getting late.

72
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,250
I know.

73
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,625
I know, but...

74
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,263
But no matter how I think about
it, it doesn't seem like I hate it.

75
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,375
Honestly, what's the big deal?

76
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,917
As long as we don't get caught.

77
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,847
It's fine as long as it's just between us.

78
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,375
See?

79
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,417
You obviously don't hate it.

80
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:08,750
So why act like that?

81
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,208
I don't really remember.

82
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,553
You have something to say to me, don't you?

83
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,292
You have something to say.

84
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,708
You have to.

85
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,167
Come closer.

86
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:40,042
Hey.

87
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,643
It looks like Jae-yeon and Moon Do-ha
are up to something again.

88
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:43,867
Are you going to get involved?

89
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,083
I don't know.

90
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,958
But Park Soo-hyun, aren't
you interested in dating?

91
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,500
There are so many guys here.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,417
Hey! I'm all about a guy's face.

93
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:05,333
And I've seen plenty.

94
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,083
I plan to live my life
looking at handsome faces.

95
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,417
What about a guy with a nice body?

96
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,468
You're the one who kept bringing
it up and tricked me into saying it.

97
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:18,125
So which is it, face or body?

98
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,833
What's this? You actually came.

99
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,083
I told you I would.

100
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,708
It must be nice being in a relationship.

101
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,113
You get to see each other often.

102
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,750
And it's easy to keep in touch.

103
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,042
What's wrong?

104
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,208
Is it just... you can't help but smile
whenever you see my face now?

105
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,542
Yeah.

106
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,542
Seat belt.

107
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,958
But did you forget?

108
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,583
We agreed to speak casually.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,917
You can't back out now.

110
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,083
I'll get to it.

111
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,500
Why are you so slow at everything?

112
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:34,397
You're not putting on your seat belt?

113
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,417
You were slow to accept my confession, too.

114
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,375
Should we go?

115
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,875
Oh?

116
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,083
Oh...

117
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,042
A drama?

118
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,625
For me?

119
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,601
The most anticipated project
for the second half of next year.

120
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,625
You'll take it, right?

121
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,375
Ah, yes, but...

122
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,667
who's the lead?

123
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:43,375
Director, I'm here!

124
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,958
Hey, what are you doing?!

125
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,601
The most anticipated project
for the second half of next year.

126
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,583
Starring Moon Do-ha!

127
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:49,500
Moon Do-ha!

128
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,917
And the martial arts director is... you!

129
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,250
You.

130
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:06,792
Okay, one more time!

131
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:07,583
Yes!

132
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,542
Four, five, six.

133
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,083
Seven, eight.

134
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,958
Nine, ten.

135
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,708
Did you make up

136
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,125
with the members?

137
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,375
Yeah, just do a good job
and stick with it for a long time.

138
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,417
Oh, so you made up?

139
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,208
Of course we had to.

140
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,417
Good job.

141
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,208
What the heck.

142
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,542
Then you'd better do a
good job on this project.

143
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,083
Hey! Underwater scenes,
horse riding scenes...

144
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,833
you'd better get ready.

145
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,917
We just got cast. Why are
you talking about this now?

146
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:52,375
Once filming starts, they'll
train you to death anyway.

147
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,917
So...

148
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:55,833
you're not gonna do it?

149
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,458
Of course I'm doing it.

150
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,375
Of course I am.

151
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,059
We should at least go
out for a day or two, right?

152
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,443
That's how it should be, isn't it?

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,292
A day?

154
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,351
Didn't you used to just fool
around while you worked?

155
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,875
Don't you remember?

156
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,000
Wanna bet?

157
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,375
Bet what?

158
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,542
The winner gets one wish granted.

159
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,042
What wish?

160
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,375
Just agree first.

161
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,250
Why can't you say it?

162
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,958
What is the wish?

163
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,250
I'll tell you when I win.

164
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,292
You've never beaten me before.

Hey, but Park Soo-hyun,

167
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:51,708
do you...

168
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,333
like Moon Do-ha's type?

169
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,083
Well...

170
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,542
for starters,

171
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:01,708
you're not it.

172
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,417
Ah, seriously! Hey!

175

What the heck.

180
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,000
How do I turn this off?

181
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,667
There, it's off.

182
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:03,083
Nothing happened, right?

183
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,500
Of course not.

184
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,750
Don't you know beginner
drivers are actually safer?

185
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,833
What are you laughing at?

186
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:17,583
No matter what anyone says,

187
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,375
I'm a pretty good driver now.

188
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,083
I know.

189
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,833
I'm going back to the shoot.

190
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,958
Call me if you can't park.

191
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:29,458
I'm leaving.

192
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,333
You should call me first.

193
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,250
I've called you so many times.
