1
00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:02,167
What was that about?

2
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:06,375
I'll get back to you later.

3
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:09,417
What's that supposed to mean?

4
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:12,792
This has nothing to do with Mr. Moon Do-ha.

5
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:15,601
It's Shin Jun-oh's business. What do
you mean it has nothing to do with me?

6
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,125
Of course it does.

7
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:19,917
Why?

8
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,500
Are you afraid I'll go kiss
up to Mr. Shin Jun-oh?

9
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:30,000
Our stunt team never kiss up to actors.

10
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:35,208
Besides, if that's what
you think, Mr. Moon Do-ha,

11
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:37,958
then I'm truly disappointed.

12
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,625
That's all.

13
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,583
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon, I need to talk to you.

14
00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:59,167
Yes, what is it?

15
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,708
Um...

16
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,292
It's something a little personal.

17
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:04,667
Can we talk over there for a second?

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,125
We can talk later, then.

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,000
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon!

20
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,375
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon!

21
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:13,625
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.

22
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,500
Please check this.

23
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,333
I ordered something
delicious. Want to join me?

24
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,375
Thanks, but I'm going to eat with my team.

25
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:22,250
Enjoy your meal.

26
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,333
What's with Gu Jae-yeon?

27
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,208
He can't even spare a minute to talk?

28
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,917
If this keeps up,
what if I can't focus and get hurt?

29
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:37,375
Will he take responsibility?

30
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:39,792
Well...

31
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:44,500
Jae-yeon has... a lot of
team members to look after.

32
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,625
Team members...

33
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:50,458
You two have a fight scene to shoot later.

34
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,625
Can't you talk then?

35
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,917
Yes, prepare to shoot. Stand by.

36
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay, let's get ready. Stand by.

37
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,583
- Camera?
- Rolling.

38
00:01:58,708 --> 00:01:59,458
Sound?

39
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,958
Speed.

40
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,917
Ready...

41
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:04,333
Action!

42
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,042
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.

43
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,208
Want to make a bet with me?

44
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,208
No thanks. Please focus.

45
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,208
You'll get hurt if you're distracted.

46
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,292
This scene.

47
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,250
If I get through it
without a single mistake,

48
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,958
I win.

49
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:35,958
Deal?

50
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,625
Cut! Okay.

51
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,458
How did you know?

52
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,958
How did I know what?

53
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,059
The way you came at me so recklessly,

54
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,583
it's no surprise you got hurt.

55
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,125
So, does that mean I lose?

56
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,458
The bet.

57
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:23,833
Is that really important right now?

58
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,292
I was going to make you grant me a wish...

59
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,000
Are you even listening to me?

60
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:35,353
How could you expect to get through that
unscathed with something like that on your mind?

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,250
So you don't want to talk to me anymore?

62
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,875
If you mean talking,

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,875
aren't we doing that right now?

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,583
Not like this.

65
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,542
I mean, like, getting closer. You know?

66
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,042
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

67
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,250
Do you want to get closer to me?

68
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,625
Well...

69
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,583
Why?

70
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,125
Do we have a show to appear on together?

71
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:22,583
What are you talking about?

72
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,208
It's nothing like that.

73
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,917
Then... movie promotion?

74
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:28,708
No.

75
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,708
I said it's not like that.

76
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:34,083
I don't know either.

77
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,792
But.

78
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,333
I'm sure of this much.

79
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,917
We're closer than you
and Shin Jun-oh, right?

80
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:49,500
Right?

81
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,917
We're closer than you and Shin Jun-oh!

82
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,750
Why aren't you answering?

83
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,500
Moon Do-ha.

84
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,750
Huh?

85
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,458
Are you a child?

86
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:20,542
Where's Jae-yeon?

87
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,042
With Moon Do-ha.

88
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:23,542
Moon Do-ha?

89
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,333
Yeah, probably went to see Moon Do-ha.

90
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,000
Are those two on good terms or not?

91
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,708
Hey, what do you think?

92
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,167
More good than bad.

93
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,958
But there are a lot of bad times too.

94
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,417
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

95
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,958
Let's get something straight.

96
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,167
I've felt this since we first met.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,708
Why do you always talk like that?

98
00:05:56,792 --> 00:06:01,167
That whole 'reputation' thing...
Is that your idea of 'sucking up'?

99
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,768
There are things you can
say and things you can't.

100
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,750
Don't you know where to draw the line?

101
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,958
Or is that what you really
think, Mr. Moon Do-ha?

102
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,500
No.

103
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,417
What was that? I can't hear you.

104
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,833
No.

105
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,208
I went too far. I'm sorry.

106
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,309
Before, I thought once the job was over,

107
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,833
we wouldn't see each
other again, so I let it go.

108
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:35,833
But I won't let it slide anymore.

109
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,958
Please watch what you say.

110
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,333
Yes.

111
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,750
Hey, I'm talking to you seriously.

112
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,125
Yes!

113
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,625
When you throw a hook, make it wider.

114
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,625
Hook! Bigger movements.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,167
Got it?

116
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,768
- Mr. Gu Jae-yeon!
- There he goes again.

117
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,125
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon!

118
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:07,583
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.

119
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,167
Did you see me on the wire?

120
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,172
Of course I did. I'm the
one who harnessed you.

121
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,976
I just came from watching the monitor.
Do you know how great it looked?

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,250
- Yeah.
- And the script supervisor said...

123
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,708
the wide shot looked amazing too.

124
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,851
You always say to make the
movements bigger, right, Mr. Gu Jae-yeon?

125
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,542
- So...
- Mr. Do-ha, please wait a moment.

126
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:22,667
Yes!

127
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll be right back.

128
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,292
Hey.

129
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:30,208
Are your ears bleeding yet?

130
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,167
Oh, not yet.

131
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,250
I can't figure you two out.

132
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,000
Are you happy leaving me behind?

133
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,523
Anyone who didn't know better
would think I'm abandoning you.

134
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,000
My scenes are all done.
What do you want me to do?

135
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,458
Still,

136
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,101
since there are no action scenes left,

137
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,285
at least I don't have to
worry about you getting hurt.

138
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,875
- But don't let your guard down.
- Yeah, yeah.

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,167
Don't get sick, don't get hurt.

140
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:16,917
I know that already.

141
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,417
Do you know how much my contract is worth?

142
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,083
I don't know anything about that.

143
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,968
All I know is that if you get hurt,
you're the only one who loses out.

144
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,083
Ah.

145
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,042
Good luck with the rest of the shoot.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,542
I have next week off.

147
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,417
Huh?

148
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,458
It's a day off next week.

149
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,875
Right.

150
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,375
So?

151
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,208
One, two, three, four...

152
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,917
Five, six, seven...

153
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:05,167
Six...

154
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,083
One, two, three...

155
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,792
Another killer workout.

156
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:12,875
I heard Moon Do-ha finished filming.

157
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,333
What, you miss him?

158
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,917
No.

159
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,458
That was a quick answer.

160
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:22,768
Just say so if you want to see him.
Moon Do-ha is going back to Seoul today.

161
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:23,583
What?

162
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,792
Isn't Moon Do-ha filming right now?

163
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,625
He is, but today is a day off.

164
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,417
You two are still seeing each other?

165
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,333
Yeah.

166
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,833
Oh, Gu Jae-yeon.

167
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:45,708
Yes, Director.

168
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,375
Are you free tonight?

169
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,750
You've got to be kidding me.

170
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,042
I just got the call myself.

171
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:53,708
That guy is unbelievable!

172
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,684
What's with him throwing an
apology dinner now, of all times?

173
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,375
And on such short notice?

174
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,625
Shin Jun-oh said he's only free today.

175
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,292
So what? Same here!

176
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,000
I already told the director I had plans.

177
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,583
You told him but...

178
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:11,958
Mr. Moon Do-ha.
I don't want to.

179
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,083
Mr. Moon Do-ha!

180
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,083
Did you say no?

181
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,792
Manager.

182
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:18,625
It's been a while.

183
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,917
How have you been?

184
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:21,522
Mr. Shin Jun-oh will head over first.

185
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,458
Yes, understood.

186
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,583
Mr. Jae-yeon.

187
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:24,851
We've all been following
you. We're big fans.

188
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,875
Our rising star.

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,458
- Shall we head over there?
- Yes, please.

190
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,292
I already said I didn't want [you] to...

191
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,250
Stocks, commercials, investments...

192
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,208
Mr. Shin can really hold his liquor.

193
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,083
This way, this way...

194
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,208
I'm getting drunk.

195
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,625
There's a step here, please be careful.

196
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,208
Director, please have some water.

197
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,375
Thanks.

198
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,625
Hey, I can... handle myself now.

199
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,917
You can go.

200
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,750
Don't you have plans?

201
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,000
I already canceled them.

202
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,458
Should I get you something for hangover?

203
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,125
You weren't planning
on going later, were you?

204
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,250
Earlier... I saw you weren't drinking.

205
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,500
Hey, you can go.

206
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:28,875
Why don't you just focus on your planks!

207
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,708
Huh?

208
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,833
What is this?

209
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:46,000
You're actually here?

210
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,542
What, did you think I was kidding?

211
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,208
No, it's not...

212
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,750
That's not what I meant.

213
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,500
It's your rare day off.

214
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,625
It would be a shame if I made you
cancel our plans.

215
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,583
Did you have somewhere you wanted to go?

216
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,500
And you called me the workout addict...

217
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,875
Have you been here with anyone before?

218
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,042
With a girlfriend.

219
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,208
A girlfriend...

220
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,333
You bring a girlfriend
to a place like this?

221
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,667
I'm sorry about
canceling our plans earlier.

222
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,083
Later...

223
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,042
I'll take you home.

224
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,208
I ask for your understanding.

225
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,083
Mr. Moon Do-ha?

226
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,000
I've been thinking.

227
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,792
Isn't this a date?

228
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,417
A date... what?

229
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:04,000
I pick you up before dawn, watch
over you, then take you home.

230
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,625
That's a textbook date, isn't it?

231
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,042
Oh...

232
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,042
I guess you could see it that way.

233
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:11,708
Although we're not [dating].

234
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:17,708
Why are you looking at me like that?

235
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:24,750
I'm not sure what this feeling is.

236
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:30,292
So...

237
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,375
Next time...

238
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,208
Do you want to go on a date with me?

239
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,250
