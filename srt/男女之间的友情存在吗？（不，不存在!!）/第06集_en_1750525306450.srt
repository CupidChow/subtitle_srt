I think it's not 근� intake a child I'm

11
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,540
I'm not a bad person, so I was told that I was okay.

12
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,540
Mom!

13
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,540
Teacher! There is a red dot on the ground that says Enotchi.

14
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:13,540
Enomota-san and I are not sure.

15
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,540
No, no, I'm also asked to stay at Enotchi right now.

16
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,540
How much? How much are you looking forward to?

17
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,540
It's a big emergency. I couldn't study at home today.

18
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,540
What do you mean?

19
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:33,540
If Enotchi says he's coming, I'll tell him that I can't let my family's position be the same as Enomota's DNA.

20
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,540
Hibari-san, don't you hate Enomota-san and your sister so much?

21
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,540
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

22
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,540
Then what about the family?

23
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,540
If they're going to be fired by night, it's a real battle.

24
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,540
That's true.

25
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,540
You said you were going to be fired by night.

26
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,540
That's true.

27
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,540
You said you were going to be fired by night.

28
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,540
What are you talking about?

29
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,540
I'm telling you that you'll help me.

30
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,540
Maybe you're expecting something like yesterday.

31
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,540
That's not what I'm talking about!

32
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,540
Natsume!

33
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,540
But do you know that you're a doctor?

34
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,540
Are you playing the piano?

35
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,540
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,540
Natsume-kun!

37
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,540
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

38
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,540
I asked Hibari-san about this account.

39
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,540
Don't you remember me?

40
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,540
It was the same class last year.

41
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,540
See? This is about Natsume-kun, right?

42
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,540
That's what I was talking about.

43
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,540
No, no, if it's me...

44
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,540
If it's me, then it's a certain order!

45
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,540
Hibari-san was just so stupid.

46
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,540
So, what do you need?

47
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,540
Make an appointment with us.

48
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,540
There's a friend who says he wants it.

49
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,540
But I'm a little busy with the promotion of the weekly stream.

50
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,540
What? You're a lawyer?

51
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,540
Natsume-kun, you're smart.

52
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,540
Natsume-kun, what are you doing with this kind of relationship?

53
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,540
I'm not sure.

54
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,540
Shishin, it's my turn. Go over there.

55
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,540
I'm going.

56
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,540
Natsume-kun, see you later.

57
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,540
Okay.

58
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,540
A woman's right to be a woman.

59
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,540
Let's go.

60
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,540
Let's go?

61
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,540
Um, what's wrong?

62
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,540
I was thinking about what I should bring with me today.

63
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,540
Oh, that's...

64
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,540
We were in a hurry.

65
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,540
But we're back to normal.

66
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,540
I forgot that I was in a hurry.

67
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,540
Um, that's it.

68
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,540
But I forgot that my house is in N.C.

69
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,540
Oh, I see.

70
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,540
Clothing

71
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,540
Episode 1

72
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,540
Wow! You're a well-known man.

73
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,540
I've heard that you're a serious person.

74
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,540
Yeah, exactly.

75
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,040
How can you be just a burden?

76
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,540
It's nice to hear you dyango have bought Lord Inomotashina.

77
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,540
Bought?

78
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
What?

79
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,540
Hey, are you sure you want to spend time with a guy you like andovate for sure?

80
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,540
I'm not sure if I should use it...

81
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,540
Rin-chan, you're not even supposed to use a big hand.

82
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,540
This is a childhood friend's sword. It's a flower-shaped sword that's a symbol of love.

83
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,540
I'm not going to use it for a night. I'm going to study.

84
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,540
I have a choice.

85
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,540
So, isn't that your order?

86
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,540
It's my first time. I said, I'm going to go out of the room because it's going to be a long time.

87
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,540
You're not good at all.

88
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,540
A girl who has a crush on a girl who has a crush on herself and a crush on herself.

89
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,540
Even me who was the biggest trouble-maker in the world has never experienced such a situation.

90
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,540
Well, Natsu.

91
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,540
You were the main character in Love Come.

92
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
Don't be stupid. I know what you're talking about.

93
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,540
I know. But you shouldn't have done it.

94
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,540
This is what you call self-assessing.

95
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:28,540
You were in the room in the science room with Himari-chan at the end of the test, right?

96
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,540
W-Why is that?

97
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,540
Don't make me say it.

98
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,540
I should have put the key in the science room.

99
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,540
Did you see that? Mr. Enomotash!

100
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,540
So, you're going to let me go to the student room.

101
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,540
If you can't rely on Makishima, how can I convince Mr. Enomoto?

102
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,540
Yu!

103
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,540
I'm studying today, but you can stay at Yu's house.

104
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,540
What?

105
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:06,540
I thought about it, but I thought it would be difficult to go out, so I thought I'd have to stay at Yu's house.

106
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,540
No, no. What are you talking about?

107
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,540
I can't let Mr. Enomoto stay at the room anyway.

108
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,540
I-I can't let you two stay at the room!

109
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,540
Well, you can convince him to stay at the room. I'm here, too.

110
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,540
But...

111
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,540
I'm so excited about the house.

112
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,540
I told him I'd stay at Yu's house.

113
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,540
That's right. I'm sorry I couldn't stay at my house.

114
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,540
No, no, no.

115
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,540
Oh, no. This guy...

116
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,540
Damn it!

117
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,540
Mr. Himari.

118
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,540
What?

119
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,540
The student room after today's school break?

120
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,540
Yes.

121
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,540
Hey, Himari!

122
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,540
Sorry, Yu. I forgot about the party.

123
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Anyway, let's go together!

124
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,540
It's okay. I'll finish it right away.

125
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,540
Are you serious?

126
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,540
You...

127
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

128
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,540
What the hell is going on?

129
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,540
Well, I have to clean up.

130
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,540
All right.

131
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,540
This is fine.

132
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,540
I can't let Mr. Enomoto stay at the room.

133
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,540
Yes.

134
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,540
Yes.

135
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,540
Hello.

136
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,540
Welcome.

137
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,540
Please come up.

138
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,540
Excuse me.

139
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,540
I'm sorry to bother you.

140
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,540
And I'm wearing a hairpin.

141
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,540
No one's here, so you can just leave it alone.

142
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,540
Oh, really?

143
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,540
Everyone's at the meeting.

144
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,540
I'm a family member, so I sometimes work.

145
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,540
Oh, well, then...

146
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,540
Just the two of us until Hii comes?

147
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,540
What's wrong?

148
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,540
No, there's no light.

149
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,540
Oh, and then...

150
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,540
I'll put the clothes here.

151
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,540
I'm wearing a dress.

152
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,540
I have a special flower for cats.

153
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,540
Wow, Yu-kun.

154
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,540
It looks like a fairy's country.

155
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,540
What's this?

156
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,540
Cherry sage.

157
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,540
It's famous for herb, but it has a relaxing effect on the scent of flowers.

158
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,540
So when I study or play games, I put it near like this.

159
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,540
Wow, it's actually a gem.

160
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,540
It's not that big of a deal.

161
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,540
Well, then, from the revenge you did yesterday...

162
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,540
Mr. Enomoto, if you have any questions, please let me know.

163
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,540
It's okay. I think I can answer them all.

164
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,540
I'm in second place in the school year.

165
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,540
I'm in fourth place in the five-street class.

166
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,540
Really?

167
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,540
I'm really surprised.

168
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,540
Surprised?

169
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,540
No, I'm not surprised.

170
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,540
I didn't think it was that good.

171
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,540
Well, that means I'm in first place.

172
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,540
Who is it?

173
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,540
I'm in first place.

174
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,540
No!

175
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,540
That means I'm in the final.

176
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,540
I'm the only one who can't study.

177
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,540
Mr. Enomoto, it's here.

178
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,540
Which one?

179
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,540
Well...

180
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,540
I can solve this by entering into X.

181
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,540
Oh, no.

182
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,540
Well...

183
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,540
No, no.

184
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,540
Mr. Enomoto, I can't get rid of the throat.

185
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,540
I'll bring you something.

186
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,540
I'm sorry for my heart.

187
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,540
Mr. Enomoto is different from Himari.

188
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,540
He's a natural.

189
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,540
If Himari doesn't come soon, my mind will...

190
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,540
No, even if Himari comes, I'll be surprised.

191
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,540
Yes.

192
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,540
All right.

193
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,540
Mr. Enomoto.

194
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,540
The smell of cherry sage is...

195
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,540
Cherry sage?

196
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,540
If you thought it was a good smell,

197
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,540
you could smell the same scent from Yuu's bed.

198
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,540
Oh, I think this is the one.

199
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,540
I drank it on the bed and it spilled a little.

200
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,540
Try the cherry sage tea.

201
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,540
It smells good.

202
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,540
It's good.

203
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,540
What?

204
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,540
It's true.

205
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,540
It smells the same as cherry sage tea.

206
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,540
That's embarrassing.

207
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,540
Because...

208
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,540
I like Yuu.

209
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,540
While I was having a good time with Himari,

210
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,540
Mr. Enomoto was the first to confess.

211
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,540
He was planning to take all the flowers to Tokyo with Himari.

212
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,540
He didn't ask me to,

213
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,540
but he helped me out.

214
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,540
I like you.

215
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,540
I've been...

216
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,540
If I hadn't noticed the feelings of Himari,

217
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,540
what would I have done?

218
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,540
From that moment on, Mr. Enomoto was no longer a support for me.

219
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
I'm done.

220
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,540
Well, I'm relieved.

221
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,540
He's really relieved.

222
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,540
By the way, the next day he refused to confess,

223
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,540
he was greeted by the other person.

224
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,540
He said he had to wake up before Himari came.

225
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,540
Mr. Enomoto, it's almost evening.

226
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,540
Hey, hey, hey!

227
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,540
He's still asleep.

228
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,540
Mr. Enomoto, you're making me feel like I'm out of the love-comer manga.

229
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,540
Thank you!

230
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
Himari, this is wrong!

231
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,540
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,540
It's a good idea to take another woman while you're with Himari.

233
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,540
That's why it's wrong.

234
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,540
When I was studying, Mr. Enomoto was asleep.

235
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,540
Mr. Enomoto is too strong.

236
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,540
What's this? Mr. Enomoto, wake up!

237
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,540
I can't move!

238
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,540
No!

239
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
I'm sorry!

240
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,540
If you think that Yu-kun is sleeping here every night,

241
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,540
you're lying down.

242
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,540
I didn't expect to hear from Kureha's sister.

243
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,540
Do you know about Mr. Enomoto's sister?

244
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,540
I know everything. She's my classmate in high school.

245
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,540
If Kureha comes back from Tokyo,

246
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,540
I'll drink with him.

247
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,540
I'll drink this year's New Year's Eve.

248
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,540
Your brother?

249
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,540
Yes.

250
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,540
Didn't you hear?

251
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,540
He's a big sister.

252
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,540
I think it's Himari.

253
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,540
He doesn't want to show his weakness to others.

254
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,540
But...

255
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,540
You two don't fight often.

256
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,540
You two are adults.

257
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,540
My sister is different.

258
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,540
I don't know if I'm right or wrong.

259
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,540
My sister always gets me in trouble.

260
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,540
Is it Leon?

261
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,540
I don't think so.

262
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,540
But I don't know if my brother likes him.

263
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,540
Seriously?

264
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,540
You're cute, but you're like Kureha.

265
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,540
I'm really worried about her.

266
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,540
I think she's a good sister.

267
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,540
Really?

268
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,540
She came back to the school when she was little.

269
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,540
She's a better sister than my sister, who doesn't contact her family.

270
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,540
I was worried about her,

271
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,540
but it's normal for both of you to be upset with her.

272
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,540
She was confessed while she was fighting Himari.

273
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,540
What?

274
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,540
You said you were going to Tokyo with me?

275
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,540
What do you mean?

276
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,540
I was saying no.

277
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,540
But you were always the same.

278
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,540
It's normal.

279
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,540
Actually, I've been beaten three times.

280
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
Three times?

281
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,540
I counted it four times.

282
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,540
I was like that when I was gone.

283
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,540
Yes, I did.

284
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,540
What's wrong with you?

285
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,540
You're a bad girl who keeps girls in good terms.

286
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,540
No, I can't give up no matter how much I hate you.

287
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,540
You'll say hello to me on the next day,

288
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,540
and I'll bake you delicious cookies.

289
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,540
I'm a cookie!

290
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,540
Hey, Himari!

291
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,540
Calm down!

292
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,540
You can't be like that!

293
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,540
How many times have I been in love with a girl?

294
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,540
First time?

295
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,540
Himari!

296
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,540
Himari!

297
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,540
What are you doing?

298
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,540
First time is first time,

299
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,540
but I'm not sure if Enomoto likes you.

300
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,540
I can't say that you're cute.

301
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,540
Yuka...

302
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,540
I see. I'll refer to the next one.

303
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,540
What's that?

304
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,540
You're so mean.

305
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,540
What about you two?

306
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,540
I didn't feel good until this morning.

307
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,540
I think you're too much.

308
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,540
I forgot.

309
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,540
I was in a relationship with Hii.

310
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,540
Is that so?

311
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,540
I was just looking at you.

312
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,540
You're short.

313
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,540
You're so warm.

314
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,540
You forgot when Enomoto became a student.

315
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,540
I told him that he'd support me,

316
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,540
but he took Yuka to Tokyo.

317
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,540
Well, that's my fault.

318
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,540
But I'm not the one who's upset.

319
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,540
I was told that after Monk worked hard on his first job,

320
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,540
he spent two years to become Yuka's first.

321
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,540
I haven't done anything for seven years,

322
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,540
but I'm not sure what to say to him.

323
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,540
So I'm going to be Yuka and Yuka's first.

324
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
Yes?

325
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,540
If Yuka's the one who's been my favorite,

326
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,540
and he thinks that he's the best friend,

327
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
then it's all okay.

328
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,540
I'm sorry to break the relationship between us.

329
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,540
I should make sure that we're both my friends.

330
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,540
A proud, proud, and proud leader!

331
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,540
Um, Enomoto-san.

332
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,540
I've been thinking about that.

333
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,540
Hii has been a model,

334
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,540
so I think she should show her respect and respect.

335
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,540
Um, thank you.

336
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,540
And if you work hard for Yuka,

337
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,540
you shouldn't do the same thing.

338
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,540
That's why I want to work hard as a backer.

339
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,540
What do you think?

340
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,540
If you do that...

341
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,540
Yay! I have a club, so that's better.

342
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,540
If I study online, I think it'll be useful for my shop.

343
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,540
If that's the case, then, here.

344
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,540
I can't ask you for any more energy.

345
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,540
Yeah, I think that's good.

346
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,540
Well then, I'll be counting on you.

347
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,540
Yeah, I'll do my best.

348
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,540
Let's celebrate Yuka's birthday!

349
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,540
Do you know what you're doing?

350
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,540
You're putting Enomoto's sister in your team.

351
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,540
No way!

352
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,540
You're telling me that you're your friend.

353
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,540
To be honest, I'm sorry to say that I'm cheering for you.

354
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,540
I've done the best I could as a person.

355
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,540
You're still with Kureha-san, right?

356
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,540
Sakura-kun?

357
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,540
I'm so sorry that I can't talk to you.

358
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,540
Do you still have a crush on me?

359
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,540
Don't worry about your future.

360
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Your future?

361
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,540
This time, you're not only a friend and a power balance of love,

362
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,540
but also a partner of evil.

363
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,540
Because you made a mistake in your feelings and your opponent,

364
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,540
you've become a target of your own will.

365
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,540
You're pulling your friend's leg while calling out your best friend.

366
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,540
If you can't be a person who can raise your relationship,

367
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,540
there's no right to be by your side.

368
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,540
You don't have to be the support of Yuu-kun's dream.

369
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,540
You can just go as a dog.

370
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,540
I've only thought about what you're going to say.

371
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,540
So, what should I do in the future?

372
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,540
I'll never lie to Yuu-kun again.

373
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,540
Lies?

374
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,540
I'm always trying to secure the escape route.

375
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,540
As long as you don't fix it,

376
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,540
I won't even buy Yuu-kun and his sister, Enomoto.

377
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,540
I understand.

378
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,540
I'll do my best!

379
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,540
That's fine.

380
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,540
Then, can I buy you a reward?

381
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,540
What? Hino?

382
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,540
I have a responsibility to take over

383
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,540
today's study fair, Marunage.

384
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,540
You can say whatever you want.

385
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,540
Thank you, Onii-chan!

386
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,540
Then, I'll have ice cream.

387
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,540
Black Mon-Bran!

388
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:31,540
Onii-chan, where did you get the message that you shouldn't lie to me?

389
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,540
That's what you're saying!

390
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,540
I'm just asking you!

391
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,540
That's what you're saying!

392
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,540
You're saying that Yuu-kun's coldness is the only thing in your mind!

393
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
I know!

394
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,540
I'm going to be a coward to be a leader!

395
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,540
Dad!

396
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,540
Taku! If you can get the All-Man Ten,

397
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,540
you should do it seriously from the start!

398
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,540
I'm sorry!

399
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,540
I'm going to be a coward to be a leader.

400
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,540
I'm sorry!

401
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,540
I'm sorry!
