1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey, what's up with you?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Come here.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You're not feeling well?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I kept doing nothing.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Did something happen?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What? What's going on?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What the hell are you? It's weird.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Don't do that!

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Did I do something to disturb you?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's not like that.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I feel like I'm 3 meters away from the house.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What are you feeling?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yuu, good morning.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Good morning.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Good morning.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You suddenly got up.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You weren't the person who was going to come back to the game.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What's wrong?

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not feeling well.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yuu, it's me.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yuu brought cookies.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Really?

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You're overreacting!

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The white flowers are blooming in a row.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:45,360
They're looking at each other, looking at each other, and

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,000
breaking up.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm nervous to call them by their names.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm nervous to call them by their names.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm nervous to call them by their names.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm nervous to call them by their names.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm nervous to call them by their names.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm nervous to call them by their names.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm nervous to call them by their names.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm nervous to call them by their names.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm nervous to call them by their names.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm nervous to call them by their names.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm nervous to call them by their names.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm nervous to call them by their names.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm nervous to call them by their names.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, you're always so energetic.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hiji is not doing well.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
She always makes people worry.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm the only one who's worried.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's hard to grasp the distance between these two.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You too, Yu.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Really? Thank you.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The pattern on the milk and cocoa is written.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What a detailed work.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm not that good at this.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's make another one.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's growing under the nose.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yu, you're so mean.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're so energetic.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're so mean.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Are you born?

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I guess I was in the way.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll read the air after the broadcast today and make you two happy.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm not in the mood for this.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What? You were the first girl to be in the flower shop.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're the one who's been talking about us.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're the one who's been talking about us.

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't run away.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I didn't say anything.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm so worried.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I've been thinking about you lately.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're trying to make a name for yourself.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You're trying to kiss me.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're...

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What's with this reaction?

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Why are you so red?

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Is it a pizza commercial?

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're so full of cheese.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're a liar.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yu's saying something weird.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You just said what you said.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's why I said something weird.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So you're...

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Anyway, there's nothing between you and Enomoto.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I was the first one to be in love,

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
but Enomoto isn't like that.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's more annoying to be in a weird relationship.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So I'm going to be in a relationship with him.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yu, you're a fool.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Why?

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All the tricks in this year are your fault.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Drink it and cool down.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Did you get it?

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What's with him?

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He's always the same.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What?

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I can't remember.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Cool down is over.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I thought he was cute.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The flower is said to be a part of the plant's effect.

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's taken out of ethanol.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If you do this, the ethanol will be removed and become white.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Really? What will you do with the color?

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm going to dye it again.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It looks like it's twice, but if you don't do this,

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
it will get dried up immediately even if you apply it on accessories.

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't push it.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't want to be so cute.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't want to be so cute.

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't want to be so cute.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Then don't turn around behind me.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Enomoto, thank you.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I understand.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The color should be on tomorrow.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The sun will come out right away, so it will take more time.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's changed.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If you apply it right away, it will be so messy.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Stop being so serious.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Enomoto is here too.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you don't have Enotchi, you can try it like before.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You can play with it.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What are you talking about?

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I told you it's not weird.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't change the meaning.

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I told you that I was going to try it.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You admit it.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You admit that you tried it.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't spread it.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's time for me to combine the two.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Enomoto.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Himari!

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're a master of Kyuta!

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's right, but what?

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't be so serious.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm glad you took it.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I can do it.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I can do it.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Leave me alone.

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're going to do it?

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You think you're going to play with Enotchi, right?

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Then you should do it.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's not a problem.

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why?

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If we become 30, we'll play together.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Or you can just be a hidden enemy of the match.

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Is that okay?

142
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's just a joke.

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right.

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't think other people would say that.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're going to make a love affair, right?

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's experience it together.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No, no.

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What are you doing?

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You're going to do it for real.

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's okay to do it, but we're the only two in this room.

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If I'm interested in that, we're friends, right?

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We're not friends, we're friends.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm not a bad guy like Himari.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Damn it.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He's cute.

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why is he so cute?

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Why do I look like normal men?

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Hey, Himari.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Show me your left hand.

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I wonder if I'm going to move my hands?

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Kichiku.

162
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Himari!

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're not really trying to take a video!

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm having more fun playing with Enotchi than I thought!

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm having more fun with Enomoto!

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That was really bad.

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You're saying it's okay, so do it quickly.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What?

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What do you mean?

170
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What's wrong?

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm not good at it.

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm just a fool.

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You said something wrong.

175
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hey, you're a man.

176
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hey, you!

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm going home.

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm going home today.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What the hell is he doing?

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Hey, Natsu.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You seem to be having a lot of fun lately.

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Where's the girl you just met?

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
She's just playing with her.

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's right.

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
By the way, where did you go with Rin?

186
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You were confessed, right?

187
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Confess...

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I wonder if it was.

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Are you serious?

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The super-large-sized-money-gassane in the middle of the box

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
is only visible to the person who comes to play with his cookies.

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's good.

193
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You can say you're a good childhood friend.

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Well, Enomoto isn't really taking the first school of elementary school.

195
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I finally met the prince of the white horse.

196
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But you're such a loser.

197
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're really a loser.

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But Rin seems to be a good loser.

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
My childhood friend is the worst.

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Shut up.

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Do you want to diss me or do you want to diss Enomoto?

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Don't be so polite about Enomoto.

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I've been holding you up for a few days.

204
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How strange!

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What's wrong?

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm fine. Answer me quickly.

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I feel like I'm getting closer to you.

208
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I mean, it's not like you're getting closer to me,

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
but you're trying to push me.

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Interesting.

211
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's look at each other.

212
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's like a real flower.

213
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, it's a real flower.

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yu, are you okay?

215
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Sorry.

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I feel like I'm getting used to it.

217
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What do you mean?

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm going to use this to capture the direction of the axis and the feeling of shooting.

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Enomoto, put your right hand up.

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's like you're conscious of the sun's light.

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Kako?

222
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What's that, Himari?

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Let's go to the edge soon.

224
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm not going to the edge.

225
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Be quiet.

226
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I really want to go to the edge.

227
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm going to add it to the edge collection.

228
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't think so.

229
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm going to get it.

230
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So what?

231
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm not going to get it at all.

232
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's all Himari-like.

233
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This is the object of the box that the older sister said.

234
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Then what's the difference between Enomoto and Himari?

235
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I want to capture the face of the moon.

236
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This?

237
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Not that.

238
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I want to capture the face of the moon.

239
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
No, sorry.

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I forgot about it.

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm going to think about it for a while.

242
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You're so careless.

243
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yu, just keep your phone on.

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:41,520
I got the target

245
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,360
I'm so worried that the device that we were gonna gaunt us,

246
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,480
who have been chasing for a very long time selling goods,

247
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,740
And the Nissan-R Effecton MiKo

248
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,140
But, Yu-kun, Hii-chan and...

249
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,980
That's a joke!

250
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,380
You're really a snow!

251
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,740
Hii-chan!

252
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,580
That's what I thought!

253
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,580
I'll throw this away behind the scenes!

254
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,060
Yu-kun, how's the photo?

255
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,300
It's perfect! It's the best!

256
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,900
Please take a photo of this too!

257
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,420
I-I see...

258
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,340
What did you say to Mr. Enomoto?

259
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,580
Hmm?

260
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,980
It's a secret.

261
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,580
I'm sure it's not a record.

262
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,740
Enotchi is cute.

263
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,580
Honestly, I don't think it's good.

264
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,740
I just want to use the picture as it is and use it as a flash.

265
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,020
You want to use it as a red tulip?

266
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,980
Yeah.

267
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,380
The word is the confession of love.

268
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,900
The theme is love.

269
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,340
I'll put flowers on the table and make a bow for the sale.

270
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,540
Hey, Yu.

271
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,540
Huh?

272
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
Make one for me too!

273
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,860
A love bow!

274
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,300
A bow?

275
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,140
For the moment when I fell in love with you...

276
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,300
No?

277
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,020
I suddenly wanted to take a photo of a bow.

278
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,220
I had no choice but to say it.

279
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,980
I wanted to take a photo of myself.

280
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,300
It's not a feeling for a friend. It's something else.

281
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,540
There's a space left in this choker for two years.

282
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,380
I'm also worried about the feeling of trying to cherish this friend for the rest of my life.

283
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,580
It's more important than anything in this world.

284
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,380
It's a promise from that time.

285
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,860
That's impossible.

286
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,260
You're my friend.

287
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,860
You're right!

288
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,980
I thought...

289
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,740
I thought...

290
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,980
I was overflowing.

291
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,540
That's right.

292
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,620
I'm a friend.

293
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,900
I was just kidding.

294
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,860
I always wanted to say that I don't look good on you.

295
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,740
I'm a friend.

296
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,220
Yu didn't try to overcome that line.

297
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,980
I didn't think I was just a friend.

298
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,300
Yu...

299
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,420
I looked at her face.

300
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,980
I wanted to see her face close.

301
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:24,420
I wanted her to see me like a beat-a-mah burning passion.

302
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,180
I had to throw away my friendship that I made.

303
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,500
I had to move forward.

304
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,980
I was preparing for a escape called a friend.

305
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,220
That's why I lost.

306
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,220
That's why I had to do something.

307
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,860
I just wanted to keep my friendship from losing.

308
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,660
I just wanted to be patient.

309
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,820
Now, let's begin the new episode of AXE!

310
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,900
Cheers!

311
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,420
Cheers!

312
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,940
Is this a high-end restaurant?

313
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,700
I'm glad you didn't want to come.

314
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,580
I asked you to invite me because you said you didn't want to.

315
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,340
Don't you dare to make me a match!

316
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,260
I hate that.

317
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,060
You two should get along well.

318
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,540
I don't want to eat.

319
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,180
I've only been here for my birthday.

320
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,220
So, you're going to do the new episode?

321
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,980
Oh...

322
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,980
Yeah.

323
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,220
The tulip flower is the most open-cut.

324
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,820
I've put it on my hairpin.

325
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,500
It's not too bad.

326
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,700
Here, Lin.

327
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,980
Yeah. It's so pretty.

328
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,540
Oh, my!

329
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,380
Sorry! Sorry!

330
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,980
I'm getting excited.

331
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,180
I'm sorry.

332
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,180
I'm sorry.

333
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,180
I'm sorry.

334
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,180
I'm sorry.

335
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,180
I'm sorry.

336
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,180
I'm sorry.

337
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,020
Sorry! Sorry!

338
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,980
I'm so excited.

339
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,340
I'm really excited.

340
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,020
I'm so excited that I can make a great sales.

341
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,500
Oh...

342
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,300
I've decided to sell my catch copy.

343
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,980
I want to give it to the guys who are lucky to have a good relationship.

344
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,340
No, Himari.

345
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,460
You're mistaken.

346
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,100
That's right, Natsu.

347
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,620
I've put it on Lin.

348
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,620
What?

349
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
Oh...

350
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,060
Well, then, please.

351
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,620
Let's do it!

352
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,940
Let's do it!

353
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,300
Let's do it!

354
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,580
Let's do it!

355
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,660
What's this?

356
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,340
I'm so excited.

357
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,620
What do you think?

358
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,620
Thank you.

359
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,620
Oh, no!

360
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,620
This is too much.

361
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,620
I don't think I could have done it in a place like this.

362
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,620
What do you mean?

363
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,620
By the way, Natsu.

364
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,620
What are you planning to do in the future?

365
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,620
In the future?

366
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,620
I'll tell you right away.

367
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,620
I want to make Lin a Natsu's exclusive model.

368
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,620
What?

369
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,620
I want to make her a model.

370
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,620
What?

371
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,620
This is a photo shoot and a complete accessory.

372
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,620
You two should be in love.

373
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,620
Let's not talk about bad things.

374
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,620
Enomoto is beautiful, so I'm grateful.

375
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,620
I'm glad you're here, Yu.

376
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,620
What? Really?

377
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,620
Well, if that's the case, I'll refuse.

378
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,620
That's not good!

379
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,620
Of course, I think Makishima-kun's proposal is good.

380
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,620
But I don't think it's for the sake of the picture.

381
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,620
If I become a model and get caught up in the net, I'll be in trouble.

382
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,620
Lin knows that Lin is such a weak woman.

383
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,620
I think she's already making you feel embarrassed.

384
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,620
What do you want to say?

385
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,620
What do you think?

386
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,620
You two, calm down.

387
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,620
Yu, shut up.

388
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:14,620
If you're going to do it, I think you'll be busy with the culture festival and the report office of the flower.

389
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,620
This is a story of a exclusive model, and it's not about putting Lin in a play.

390
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,620
Himari-chan, what are you so impatient about?

391
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,620
I'm not impatient, but I'm thinking about the picture.

392
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,620
Hey, Yu.

393
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,620
I'm not impatient, but I'm thinking about the picture.

394
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,620
Hey, Yu.

395
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,620
If I had to say it again, I asked you to do it with this picture.

396
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,620
Isn't it okay?

397
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,620
Yu, that's serious.

398
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:57,620
You said that if you change the model, it will be a shock.

399
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,620
That's right.

400
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,620
It's a little strange recently.

401
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:12,620
You emphasize love and affection, and if you don't know how to love, you won't be able to express it.

402
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,620
And...

403
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,620
Let's experience it.

404
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:21,620
It's a little troublesome for you to do that.

405
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,620
Because if you get repeated like that, you'll like it.

406
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:31,620
So I heard someone stop Himari like Enomoto-san.

407
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:37,620
So it's bad, but I can't see Himari this time.

408
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,620
It's coming. It's coming.

409
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,620
It's okay. Himari, you can do it.

410
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,620
Himari, what's wrong?

411
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,620
Nothing. I was just looking for a yoga group.

412
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,620
I gave you one last one at school.

413
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,620
Sorry, I can't do it.

414
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,660
Usual

415
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,620
By the way, what should we do?

416
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,660
Zekko!

417
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,660
What? Zekko?

418
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,820
Why...

419
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,820
It's really...

420
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,820
It's really...

421
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,820
It's really Zekko!
