1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
When did you talk to a girl besides Himari?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good morning, Ossu.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Huh?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Are you free?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Well, you seem tired too.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You're not even as lively as before.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You're not the strongest one in the environment.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You're the only one who's making a mess.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What's the difference?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Ms. Sakunei, you're so mean.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You're the one who's been asked to fix the axis.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, you've got a good sense of humor.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What do you mean?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You've only been making the axis of Himari's imagination, haven't you?

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You're just like the one I've been making recently.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Huh?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're not in a good mood, and you're always the same.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're just like a box that's been replaced.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
A box?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Maybe you didn't mean it?

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You're not enough to have such a passionate love and a desperate despair.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But the sales are good.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Really?

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You're the repeater who's going to buy it back?

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You must have remembered my promise.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you don't have a shop until 30, you'll be at my convenience store quietly.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I know.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Of course, you should get Himari's.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You pay the loan, and the customers around you will be so cute and cute.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
My best skill, Ms. Sakunei.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not going to wait for you here.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm nervous to call you by your name.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm so nervous that I can't get out of here.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I've never seen you before.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I can't believe you're calling me by my name.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're the one I've been making recently.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm a little shy.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm not sure.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm not sure.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm not sure.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not sure.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm not sure.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm not sure.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm not sure.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm not sure.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm not sure.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm not sure.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm not sure.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not sure.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm not sure.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm not sure.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm not sure.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm not sure.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm not sure.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm not sure.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
As Ms. Sakunei said,

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
my flower accessories have fewer repairs.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
My accessories are 1 for 1.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I thought it was a love that can shine for a moment without a doubt, but...

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm telling you this.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I haven't heard the end of the summer in the room yesterday. What happened?

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The end? There's nothing else.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But you're going to confirm it, right?

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't think it's bad to ask Rin-chan's love supporter to think about the future.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I didn't ask you to.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh, there it is! The energy!

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So, Makishima-kun, what's wrong?

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's not a big deal. I'm the one who's talking to Rin-chan first.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Then, it's over, right?

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No, it's just that I'm getting into the competition.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Makishima-senpai!

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What's wrong?

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I want you to look at the swing.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That girl is Makishima-kun's junior in tennis.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't think I should go.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't think I can tell Himari-chan.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, there's no one to disturb me.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hey, Nocchi, I thought of something good.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you want to hear it?

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't want to hear it.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're the only one who can heal the broken heart.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What about today's work?

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll go home after I clean up here.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What about you?

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Then, I'll help you.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Did you have any plans during class?

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, as expected of a new friend.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What's wrong?

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm going to change the theme of the next lesson.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The passionate love and the deep despair of the appearance.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What? What?

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You're so interested in the story.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I see.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Well, there's one thing that Sakura-san said.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I see.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You've made something you thought you liked, right?

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But if you're conscious of the business, you need customers' attention.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Customer's attention?

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Then, what about closing the theme of love as a hobby?

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Isn't that a dato?

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The main target is a woman.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Girls like love.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You said you don't know much about love.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You know I'm very popular even if I don't know about love, right?

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm the strongest when the other person is confessing.

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then, what's love as a hobby of love?

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Do you want to kiss or kiss?

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's a blessing.

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But you know, you can't be born if you don't like the feeling of wanting to kiss.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That is, the feeling of kissing and love at the same time occur.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So, what's the difference between love and sex?

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Love itself is the antenna of love and affection.

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What about the preference around that?

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Do you want to hear that?

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Should I have a big boobs?

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Black hair? Or should I have a little red hair?

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Long front.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't want to kiss the blood of the picture.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Where did that beautiful Enomoto-san come from?

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I just thought it would be easier to imagine if the model was simply there.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't think we should be in a relationship.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hey, stop looking at me like that.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're similar to the experience, aren't you?

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm already excited.

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've never wanted to kiss a girl.

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We don't know the feeling of wanting to kiss.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If we try, we might think, we know this.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I feel like I'm the best at that theory of not thinking about a nice idea.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So, you don't have to kiss your friend, do you?

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
If you don't have a good feeling, what's the difference between connecting your hands like this?

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's the same contact with the skin.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't you want to stop saying that I'm the one who wants to connect with the girl?

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm the one who's connected with her.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're the one who wants to be with her.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's okay. I'm not the only one who wants to say that.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Are you going to do that?

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Wait, wait, I'll calm down.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's just a joke.

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm going to be hit by a car in no time.

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why is it a little redder?

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
My eyes are shaking.

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No, no, don't pull my eyes.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's a very close distance in the first place.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Ah, my breath is...

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Stop it. Don't make my heart pound.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is so boring.

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If I look at him again, he's so beautiful.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You're right.

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But as expected...

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Of course, I knew it.

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Besides, it's not good to say that now.

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What?

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I know.

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm not the most cute person in the world who's scared of me.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm the one who smiles.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes, you're right. You're cute.

158
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Alright!

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Then, I'll give you a present for you.

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Open the door of the door.

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What do you do with the door?

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Secret.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And on Saturday.

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Long time no see. How are you?

165
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm fine.

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I don't have enough oil to make you look good lately.

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I came to see you like this, by asking you to.

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm sorry for the trouble.

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sorry for the trouble between you and me.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Sometimes, it's my brother's fault that I'm trying to get along with you.

171
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I can't get along with you because you're so natural.

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, I'm not used to expensive sushi.

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry that I can't taste it.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I like such a honest thing, Mr. Toto.

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I want you to be my brother and sister-in-law.

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Sakura?

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Well, in the past, there were times when everyone was too lazy to come to the tree.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's a good thing that you don't have that back-to-back.

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I was beaten by a high-ranking judge before.

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You two are classmates.

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes. Sakura is a senior in high school.

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He's a senior who's been called a senior for 10 years.

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Why is he different from his brother?

184
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You have the talent to make accessories.

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's good.

186
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Thank you.

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You can come to my house anytime to make good works.

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Mr. Toto!

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What's going on?

190
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's hard for that welcome-like man to be a man of his own.

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Mr. Hibari, what are you going to do from now on?

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Today, I'm going to make a video to make a road guide to the upper class to drink.

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I really want to have an anime concert with you, but...

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's a tough place for a social worker!

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I was just saying that I was being nice and easy,

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
but I'm scared that I don't know if it's a joke or a real joke.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Hey, Yu!

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You were late. Did you get in?

199
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No, I wasn't.

200
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You always say that you're the best at being nice.

201
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm sure you're not going to get in because you're so cute,

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
but you're not going to get in because you're so cute,

203
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
but you're not going to get in because you're so cute,

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
but you're not going to get in because your brother's a senior, right?

205
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I have a special guest today.

206
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We're not the only ones.

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Hello.

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What?

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Well...

210
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What are you doing today?

211
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm doing a club.

212
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I see.

213
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's strange.

214
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I felt like I was a little bit more upset,

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
but I'm a person who can't speak properly.

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
By the way,

217
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm going to make a video about the next product.

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What are you thinking about the next product shooting?

219
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The next one? No, not at all.

220
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's no good.

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
In order to think about the future of the work,

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I have to challenge myself to something new.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You're right. But something new...

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I see!

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Enoch is going to be the role model of Yu Yu in the film!

226
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What?

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I told you that I'm the one who's making the film.

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I knew that even if you didn't tell me, I knew that Enoch was going to be the role model.

229
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I think it's strange that you're making so many parts.

230
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I-I see.

231
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So?

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I was told that I couldn't do anything because of the repair.

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I thought it might be good to be the role model for someone other than me.

234
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I see.

235
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's very lucky that you can say that you're so beautiful that you can make a good act.

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Enoch is also good, right?

237
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But I'm so proud of you.

238
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
If you change the role model, you'll be shocked.

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Enoch's house is in the shooting location.

240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Really? I'm in trouble.

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If you're going to be in a relationship next time, you'll have to be careful.

242
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Right?

243
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Um...

244
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm not like mother.

245
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Wow.

246
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hey, Himari.

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're always too good at acting.

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Enoch is also a good actor, so I can't go on with what I'm looking for.

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What? What do you mean?

250
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's a secret.

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yes!

252
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's more like a cake than a piece of paper.

253
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I can't stop like this.

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Hey, Yu! Don't leave Enoch alone!

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What about this garnet?

256
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's nice. Eno-Moto-san looks good in red.

257
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The color of the cake is nice, too.

258
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Wow, orange! That's nice, too.

259
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Natsume-kun, Hii-chan, what's this?

260
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, sorry. I wanted to check if Eno-Moto-san looks good in it.

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Was it a feeling?

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It wasn't a feeling, but surprisingly...

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's really nice to say that.

264
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Hey, that's not true.

265
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's nice, but it's really nice.

266
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's nice to go to an accessory shop and pose.

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Stop making a face-to-face joke!

268
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Where are you going?

269
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Himari-san!

270
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Enoch is also a good actor.

271
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Don't say that.

272
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Hey, Yu.

273
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Enoch is beautiful, so why don't you go up?

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I guess the bow is really important.

275
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm glad you're here. Can I try it?

276
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well...

277
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yu, put the necklace on Enoch.

278
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Put it on?

279
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No, I don't want that.

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Enoch is nice, right?

281
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Well...

282
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It means that I'm not a man.

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't want to be a man.

284
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll finish it before he says,

285
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
then, be honest.

286
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Here, take this.

287
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I've always thought about it, but Enoch's uniform is really nice.

288
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Huh? Himari, you!

289
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No, I'm not.

290
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm not a man.

291
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm not a man.

292
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm not a man.

293
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm not a man.

294
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm not a man.

295
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's a great time to live in a place that you think it's the same as the cat's hiding place.

296
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The acce parts are in hand,

297
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
so you can put some flowers in it and make a new look for shooting.

298
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I see.

299
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What?

300
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's so beautiful.

301
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The thickness of the flowers are amazing.

302
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They look like those times.

303
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Those times?

304
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
N-No way.

305
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Did you decide which one to buy?

306
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, yeah.

307
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
For now, it's a short-term job.

308
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If we can get a partner,

309
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I think we can get a partner who's not grown up.

310
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Then, the rose?

311
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
No, the rose seems to have a tree for the beauty.

312
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Eno-Moto, look.

313
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Enoch is the opposite.

314
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It looks like there's a tree,

315
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and it's really beautiful.

316
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I know. It's cute, right?

317
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I think it's cute, but...

318
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What's this?

319
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's a drink.

320
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You should have given it to Enoch earlier.

321
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You're the one who erased it.

322
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Well, I'm not sure if it's the two of you.

323
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Let's practice.

324
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'll buy it.

325
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I've decided.

326
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'll support this love.

327
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I thought I could only leave it to someone who understands Yu.

328
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Eno-Moto, I'm sorry.

329
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That's because Hii-chan is not feeling well.

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You two are friends since elementary school, right?

331
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You've been in a relationship since you were a kid.

332
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No, no.

333
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
When I went to the cake delivery service with my mother,

334
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
she was a quieter girl.

335
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
She was always reading a book in the room.

336
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
She said she'd become friends with Hii-chan's mother.

337
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
She was so calm.

338
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
She was so calm.

339
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I can't imagine what she's like.

340
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What kind of flower do you like, Eno-Moto?

341
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I think it's good to answer the model's request this time.

342
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
A big flower.

343
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I like bigger flowers.

344
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
A big flower?

345
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It might be perfect.

346
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
She's so beautiful and she can't lose her presence.

347
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's not a weird meaning.

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I know.

349
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't say it all at once.

350
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What should I do?

351
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The theme of the flower is love.

352
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I think it's good to have a tulip.

353
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Flower words are love.

354
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's a flower that looks like a flower.

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's a flower that changes the impression.

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
A flower that looks like a flower?

357
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's all the same.

358
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It changes depending on the basic.

359
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The flower shop is a small town,

360
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
but you can see it when you grow it outside.

361
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
There's something I've observed before.

362
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's weird to be told like this.

364
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Why?

365
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I've been interested in baseball and soccer since I was a kid.

366
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I didn't have friends.

367
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I've been told that it's boring to talk about you.

368
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'll buy this.

369
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Enomoto-san is outside.

370
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Why do you like flowers so much?

371
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You can't say that.

372
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm grateful that you can become a model.

373
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But that's not what I meant.

374
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Go ahead.

375
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The result, my beauty.

376
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
When you become a student,

377
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
you become a model for the flowers that only bloom in one night.

378
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
When I was a elementary school student,

379
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I went to the plant garden on my family trip.

380
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
My sister and I were separated there.

381
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I didn't know where I came from.

382
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That girl was also a maigo.

383
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So I looked for a bridegroom.

384
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I gave her a crying child.

385
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That girl said that she would bring this flower back to her memories and decorate it with paper every day.

386
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I thought she would be able to do that.

387
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Then she became interested in flowers and could make a good impression.

388
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
She would be able to hold it for a long time.

389
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And someday she would be able to reach that girl.

390
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's so weird.

391
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
She will be able to see me soon.

392
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I was so nervous that I couldn't talk to her.

393
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's the flower of the hibiscus.

394
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That girl put it on paper.

395
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It was so beautiful.

396
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It was so red.

397
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You said that you look like the color of that girl's paper, right?

398
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I hated this paper since I was little.

399
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But then I thought,

400
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
should I use this one?

401
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm going to give that girl Natsumi's flower to her.

402
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Thank you for telling me.

403
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yu-kun.

404
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The word of the hibiscus is a delicate beauty.

405
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
A new love.

406
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So the guy on the left went back first.

407
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yu-kun.

408
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Please exchange with me.

409
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yes.

410
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Two years ago, when my sister brought the bracelet back,

411
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
the girl's face was covered with it.

412
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
She gave me a flower at the plant garden.

413
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I heard that story many times.

414
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I thought this was destiny.

415
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
There is a person who is closer to me than a friend.

416
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So I thought I would support this love.

417
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But I was wrong.

418
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
These two didn't even help me.

419
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm so happy.

420
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I can't let our happy future be forgotten.

421
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But I've never seen Yu like that.

422
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I thought that if I told Yu to go far away,

423
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I wouldn't be able to go back to that place.

424
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I wonder why.

425
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yu-kun.

426
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yu-kun.

427
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yes.

428
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yes, I love you.

429
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm so happy.

430
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I can't let our happy future be forgotten.

431
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But I was wrong.

432
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I thought that if I told Yu to go far away,

433
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I wouldn't be able to go back to that place.

434
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm so happy.

435
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I can't let our happy future be forgotten.

436
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I can't let our happy future be forgotten.

437
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Tell me, God,

438
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Do you mind, sir?

439
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I want to show you the light of your eyes.

440
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I want to tell you the dark and dark parts.

441
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's not love.

442
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's not love.

443
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I want to admire your shine.

444
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I want to feel the real feelings I wrote with my heart.

445
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I want to reach you someday.
