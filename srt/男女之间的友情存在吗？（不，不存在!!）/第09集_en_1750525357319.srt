00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not

I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I'm not sure if I can do this, but I

4
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,000
did

5
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,920
slack

6
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,840
I did

7
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,080
d

8
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,400
two

9
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,400
Hayaza

10
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,480
すー

11
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,800
new

12
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,300
really

13
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:04,860
It's like, I'm not good enough to be a good friend of my best friend, Niban-san.

14
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,500
That's so cool! What's wrong?

15
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,140
I borrowed it from my sister.

16
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,980
Oh, I thought it was cute.

17
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,780
We were going to act together.

18
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,980
Hey, Christmas is coming up soon.

19
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,580
Did you decide what to wear?

20
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,500
What's the purpose?

21
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,540
I'm having fun every day after I become a Himari.

22
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,020
If you can tell me that I'm good at my work and that I'm a Himari.

23
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,940
It's Christmas this time, but...

24
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,700
Huh?

25
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,660
I told you that I have a Himari in front of me.

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,180
Oh, really?

27
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,700
I told you that I'd come to the store, but...

28
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,860
Um, Natsume, please.

29
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,940
Christmas, why don't you and Himari go out alone?

30
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,140
Why do we have a promise to come to the store?

31
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:05,140
And I don't want Himari to think that she's a bad person.

32
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,300
I lied to Himari that I had gone to the store, but I hope she goes well.

33
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,460
Natsume-kun, let's go for lunch.

34
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,540
Teacher.

35
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,740
Hm?

36
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:22,020
If you have a friend who's with you and wants to be with you.

37
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:28,900
I think it's really good to have a friend who's with you.

38
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,900
What do you think, teacher?

39
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,900
Hmm...

40
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,340
We're like flowers.

41
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,380
We can grow more than one seed.

42
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,980
We can grow more than two or three together.

43
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,060
Hm?

44
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,140
Is that right?

45
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,740
Hey, the receptionist is on the face of a store.

46
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,740
What? Why are you here?

47
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,740
Because I was told that I went to the store when I went to Yu's house.

48
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,740
Well, um...

49
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,740
Didn't you go to play with him?

50
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,740
No, I didn't. But I bought it right away.

51
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,740
I told him that I had Yu, but...

52
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,740
Well, Yu, why do you do that?

53
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,740
I feel like I'm suddenly being scolded by him.

54
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,740
I hate the most timid guy.

55
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,740
No, but he's a good guy.

56
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,740
I'm happy if the two of us are happy.

57
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,740
Yu, are you serious?

58
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,740
He came to Yu's house to get me.

59
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,740
Yu and I have been dating since before.

60
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,740
Well, I was really going to get married with Yu.

61
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,740
I thought that was good, so I was quiet.

62
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,740
You can't make a fuss about it from now on.

63
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,740
Make a fuss?

64
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,740
This is Yu's work, right?

65
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,740
I'm glad you understand.

66
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,740
Did you make me your motif?

67
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,740
What? Why?

68
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,740
I thought that you made me your motif because you were my name.

69
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,740
That's not what I meant.

70
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,740
I was a fool.

71
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,740
I wanted to show you my motif, so I made it.

72
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,740
The words of the sunflower are...

73
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,740
I look only at you.

74
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,740
I'm a flower that shows the straightness of my friend.

75
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,740
Hey, Yu.

76
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,740
If you think about me, don't think that I'm the only one who can do it.

77
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,740
If I'm happy with someone, Yu will be my only one.

78
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,740
That's not good. Yu and I are best friends.

79
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,740
But it's too much to find a partner at the same time.

80
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,740
That's right. But first, we have to make Yu's ideal world.

81
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,740
I'll try my best.

82
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,740
Will you keep looking at me?

83
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,740
I'm just a close friend.

84
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,740
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,740
So, how was this dress?

86
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,740
Maybe 50 points?

87
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,740
I'm sure it's good, but I'm still half.

88
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,740
I want you to make me more on top of what I know.

89
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,740
So, if all of Yu's are completed,

90
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,740
I'll show you the next one.

91
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,740
I've been a little girl since I was a kid.

92
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,740
I'm not good at making something.

93
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,740
Oh, there's a beauty girl.

94
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,740
There's so many girls in this world who are just cute.

95
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,740
Even if I'm a pretty girl who looks like a pure balloon,

96
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,740
I'm worried about that.

97
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,740
I gave her water, too.

98
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,740
Chocolate Cosmos.

99
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,740
It smells like chocolate as the name suggests.

100
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,740
It's autumn when the flowers bloom.

101
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Is it the basement of the opponent?

102
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,740
Can I say something?

103
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,740
Oh, Himari. Good morning.

104
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,740
Hey, it's dangerous to walk on the phone.

105
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,740
Oh, no.

106
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,740
I feel like I'm going to have to do it in three seconds.

107
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,740
But I'm going to lose.

108
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,740
Hey, what are you going to do on the summer break?

109
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,740
Oh, I see.

110
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,740
I'm going to have to go to the morning.

111
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,740
That's right.

112
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,740
Making a tablecloth is important, but next year,

113
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,740
it might be a year to play a lot.

114
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,740
Do you want to play with us?

115
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,740
Are you stupid?

116
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,740
You're going to play with us in the dungeon?

117
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,740
We're friends who can't cut even if we cut.

118
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,740
No, I think so.

119
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,740
Oh, and now...

120
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,740
Are you conscious of me?

121
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,740
No, that's not the case.

122
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,740
No, you can't be serious.

123
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Good morning, Hii-chan.

124
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,740
Good morning, Erochi.

125
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,740
Now, let's go, Yu-kun.

126
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,740
Hii-chan,

127
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,740
we're going to be waiting for you at the three of you.

128
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,740
This is my recent concern.

129
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,740
I want to put it all into the blood of the dragon.

130
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,740
Yu-kun.

131
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,740
Please look at me again.

132
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,740
You made me a place where I thought you'd be embarrassed.

133
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,740
I have the limit.

134
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,740
I'm sure you'll be able to make it even if you don't need me.

135
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,740
Is that okay to say that?

136
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,740
Enomoto, the hero has been waiting for you.

137
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,740
Erochi, please reply!

138
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,740
I feel like I'm hurt.

139
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,740
You two are forbidden to play with each other.

140
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,740
I don't think it's good to have a relationship with someone else.

141
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,740
Here.

142
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,740
Other girls...

143
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,740
I'm already a rival to you.

144
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,740
If you can't be friends with Hii-chan because she's cute,

145
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,740
shouldn't you be a good friend?

146
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,740
Yu-kun, do you want to date Hii-chan?

147
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,740
I don't know.

148
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,740
I like Himari,

149
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,740
but I feel like it's better to show off than to be in love.

150
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,740
Yu-kun, I guess you're the type to say such a troublesome thing.

151
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,740
But I think it's okay.

152
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,740
That means you want both dreams and love, right?

153
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,740
I like Yu-kun's honest thoughts.

154
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,740
And if Yu-kun and Hii-chan can help me,

155
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,740
I have a chance.

156
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,740
I really want to see that mental.

157
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,740
I guess everyone's serious before the tournament.

158
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,740
Yu-yu!

159
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,740
When the flower road is over,

160
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,740
let's go shopping!

161
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,740
It's a weak body of Himari!

162
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,740
Calm down. I've never had such a bad experience.

163
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,740
So, do you want something to buy?

164
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,740
Yeah.

165
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,740
I want a swimsuit for summer vacation.

166
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,740
Swimsuit!

167
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,740
What do you think about

168
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,740
choosing swimsuits with a guy you don't like?

169
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,740
Wait.

170
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
I think I said it last year.

171
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
I feel like I'm thinking about something last year.

172
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,740
Then, let's go with Enomoto-san.

173
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
Why?

174
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,740
It's fine, but I think I'll be in a hurry when I go out.

175
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
I'll call you later.

176
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,740
Enomoto-san!

177
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,740
This is the time to make Himari cry!

178
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,740
Enomoto-san helped me choose swimsuits.

179
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,740
Yu-kun, this is not because you want to see my swimsuit, right?

180
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,740
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,740
I can predict that you'll be crying.

182
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,740
So, I want to save you.

183
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,740
If you know, you have to go.

184
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
But, I'm a friend of your friend.

185
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,740
I feel like you're a man, too,

186
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
even though you were so pure.

187
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,740
Yes. I want to see your swimsuit.

188
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,740
I have to go to the club today.

189
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Do your best.

190
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
Yes.

191
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,740
That's great.

192
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,740
You're too close.

193
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,740
Yu, which one should I choose?

194
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,740
I'm sure...

195
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,740
I'm sure.

196
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,740
I'll choose the one I like.

197
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,740
You can choose yourself.

198
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,740
If you don't have any other people's evaluation, you can't be a fan of me.

199
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,740
That's right, but I bought it to show you.

200
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,740
You should choose the one you like.

201
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,740
Well...

202
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,740
Oh, Yu-kun, are you nervous?

203
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
Shut up.

204
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
You should stop being like that.

205
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,740
Yu seems to want to win the prize for the rest of his life.

206
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,740
Come, let's take a look.

207
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Oh, I see.

208
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
There seems to be a lot of things there.

209
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
A cute dress.

210
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,740
A cute, cute dress.

211
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,740
There are flowers and cheeses, too, but which one should I choose?

212
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,740
Himari, you're the one who likes cuter girls than the other.

213
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,740
You're the one who likes cuter girls.

214
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,740
I'll follow you.

215
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,740
Well, it's not like that.

216
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,740
Then, I'll try to guess.

217
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,740
Oh, I feel bad for this uncomfortable girl.

218
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,740
Yu...

219
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
Oh, it's over?

220
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,740
Hey, Yu.

221
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,740
Actually, I'm wearing a really dirty swimsuit now.

222
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,740
I didn't know you had that in your bag.

223
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,740
You did.

224
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
You did?

225
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,740
Don't tell me you're not going to let me wear that in your bag!

226
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,740
I wonder if you can tell me that.

227
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,740
It's always hard, isn't it?

228
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,740
But if it's really true, I'll solve it now.

229
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,740
Hey, Yu, get back to the water!

230
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,740
It's gone.

231
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Well, it's really bad to hang on the outside like that, isn't it?

232
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,740
I'm sorry!

233
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,740
Gute,

234
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,740
I have a visitor for you.

235
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,740
Nice to meet you. I'm Enomo and Cureha.

236
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,740
I've heard a lot about you, Shinji.

237
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,740
You're my friend, Leon.

238
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,740
You mean, Cureha is your friend Makishima?

239
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,740
Yes, she's my neighbor.

240
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,740
I see.

241
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,740
So you're Cureha.

242
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,740
You have a guest, right?

243
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,740
Yes, I forgot.

244
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,740
Give me your Himari.

245
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,740
You're a bad girl.

246
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
Come here.

247
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,740
Hey,

248
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,740
You've been acting strange lately.

249
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,740
You've been acting strange lately.

250
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,740
You've been acting strange lately.

251
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,740
You've been avoiding me.

252
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,740
You're trying to save my life.

253
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,740
You're just a simple name.

254
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,740
You've been avoiding Himari and you're trying to get back at Rin.

255
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,740
What?

256
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,740
You don't care about this racket?

257
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,740
It's not about hitting the ground.

258
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,740
You're so mean.

259
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,740
I'm going to get back at you.

260
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,740
Stop it.

261
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,740
I'm not going to say anything.

262
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,740
But I don't need anything.

263
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,740
Thanks to Cureha.

264
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,740
I'm not going to say anything.

265
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,740
I'm going to get back at you.

266
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,740
I think you know too,

267
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,740
but you promised to come to our office.

268
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,740
But you said you'd give up despite being rejected and stopped.

269
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,740
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

270
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,740
It's okay. I'm not angry.

271
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:35,740
I just asked the president to do it, and I made all the preparations myself.

272
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,740
I didn't care about the things that I believed in Himari-chan.

273
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,740
I brought a piece of advice to you today.

274
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,740
Advice?

275
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,740
I asked you to ask Himari-chan to come to the office so that you can come in.

276
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,740
But Himari and I...

277
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,740
I told you. It's a dream to open an acess shop.

278
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,740
But I think it's too much to dream of a private store in such a hard place.

279
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,740
Of course, I won't say it's just a dream.

280
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,740
That money is...

281
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,740
It's decided. It's Himari-chan's loan.

282
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,740
I'll give you the amount that Himari-chan will earn from now on.

283
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,740
Oh, I see.

284
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,740
Oh, I see.

285
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
And the model.

286
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,740
I'll prepare a model for you instead.

287
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,740
You can choose your favorite girls from my office.

288
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,740
Please don't say that!

289
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Himari isn't a thing!

290
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,740
It's impossible to get money and introduce a model!

291
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,740
I dream of opening a shop with Himari.

292
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,740
If Himari isn't with me, it doesn't make sense!

293
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,740
I see.

294
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,740
That means that Himari-chan is important.

295
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,740
I know. She's so cute.

296
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,740
She's so cute with that transparent feeling.

297
00:16:52,740 --> 00:17:00,740
But now, Himari-chan is trying to crush that talent for other people's small talent.

298
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,740
That means I'm crushing Himari's talent?

299
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,740
That's right.

300
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,740
Honestly, it's a bad habit for middle school students.

301
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,740
If you have that much of a design, it's just a hobby of the teacher.

302
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,740
And the current work on SNS is also a good one.

303
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:29,740
I wonder if you can say that you're really a friend of your own.

304
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,740
Oh, I see.

305
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,740
It's not because you're a business partner.

306
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,740
I can't give you because I like Himari-chan.

307
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,740
I can't give you because I like Himari-chan.

308
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,740
That means...

309
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,740
Which one do you want?

310
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,740
If you decide to live in a love heart with Himari-chan,

311
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,740
I'll take you to Tokyo with me.

312
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,740
But I'll leave my dream to the devil.

313
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,740
I don't think this person's words are right.

314
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,740
But is it a chance for Himari?

315
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,740
In the end, it's a half-time for both of us.

316
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,740
You're just depending on the youth.

317
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,740
You don't want to chase your dreams seriously.

318
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,740
That's enough!

319
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,740
I won't let you touch me!

320
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,740
Himari-kun?

321
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,740
I forgot to close the key to the entrance.

322
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,740
Himari-san, why?

323
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,740
I got a call from Himari and flew here.

324
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,740
Kureha-kun, you didn't have to rush into my room.

325
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,740
You're so stubborn.

326
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,740
I just brought a joke.

327
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,740
You're just trying to get a fight with someone.

328
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,740
It's not like you've changed.

329
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,740
This two...

330
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,740
You know the rules, right?

331
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,740
You're the one who needs them.

332
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,740
As long as I'm here,

333
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,740
I won't let Himari and Yuu-kun get into my friendship.

334
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,740
I just need to be a satellite.

335
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,740
Here.

336
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
Himari-san?

337
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,740
If you don't want to be thrown into the sea of net,

338
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,740
you can't be in my way.

339
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
Stop it, Kureha-kun!

340
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,740
I don't care about that now!

341
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,740
Himari-kun, this is not related to you.

342
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,740
Himari-kun, who created a world of three-dimensional women

343
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,740
can't be a woman's match.

344
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,740
I don't need it.

345
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,740
Then I'll beat you up with this!

346
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,740
Himari-kun, you're scary.

347
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,740
Sakura-chan, please do this.

348
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,740
No, I can't wait.

349
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,740
Even now, my weakness is...

350
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,740
You have 20 years of work relationship.

351
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,740
I'm in trouble!

352
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,740
Himari-san, your character has changed.

353
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,740
Oh, it's like that from the past.

354
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,740
If you want to get back into that relationship,

355
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
you can do it.

356
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,740
That's impossible.

357
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Anyway,

358
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,740
I know you won't go ahead even if I talk to you.

359
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,740
Kureha,

360
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,740
do you know that you're chasing after your own justice?

361
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
Yes.

362
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,740
I know you're going to put yourself and Himari-chan together,

363
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,740
but I think you were the one who hated

364
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,740
chasing after your own justice.

365
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,740
Sakura-chan, you failed to ask for it.

366
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,740
You're going to be in trouble like this.

367
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,740
You've changed your mind.

368
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,740
Yu-chan, let's have a match.

369
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,740
A match?

370
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,740
During this summer break,

371
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,740
I'll make your full-power accessories.

372
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,740
I'll prove it with quality.

373
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,740
In the first place,

374
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,740
it's the most important information

375
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,740
just to make you win the match.

376
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,740
What do you mean?

377
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,740
I told you.

378
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,740
I told you that I'm preparing for you.

379
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,740
I wonder if you can pay for that.

380
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,740
Kureha,

381
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,740
if my brother-in-law refused to cooperate,

382
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,740
he was going to make that money.

383
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,740
As expected of Sakura-chan.

384
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,740
I'm sorry.

385
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,740
Only Yu-chan, a friend,

386
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,740
can help you.

387
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,740
I wonder if that's all.

388
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
If I win,

389
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,740
will you give me the money for the match?

390
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,740
Of course.

391
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,740
If I lose, I'll give up on the money

392
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,740
and give it to Himari-chan.

393
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,740
But if I win,

394
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,740
give it to Himari-chan.

395
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,740
I understand.

396
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,740
The theme is the summer's memories.

397
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,740
The season is coming to an end.

398
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,740
I'll be back then.

399
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,740
Is there really a value

400
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,740
that Himari gives life to my Akuse?

401
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,740
I think I can confirm that now.

402
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,740
I'm going to give you the money

403
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,740
and give it to Himari-chan.

404
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,740
I'm going to give you the money

405
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,740
and give it to Himari-chan.

406
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,740
I'm going to give you the money

407
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,740
and give it to Himari-chan.

408
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,740
I'm going to give you the money

409
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,740
and give it to Himari-chan.

410
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,740
I'm going to give you the money

411
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,740
and give it to Himari-chan.

412
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,740
I'm going to give you the money

413
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,740
and give it to Himari-chan.

414
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,740
I'm going to give you the money

415
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,740
and give it to Himari-chan.

416
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,740
I'm going to give you the money

417
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,740
and give it to Himari-chan.

418
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,740
I wonder if I can show you

419
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,740
the reality.

420
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,740
I wonder if I can show you

421
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,740
the reality.

422
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,740
It's not love.

423
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,740
It's not love.

424
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,740
It's your light.

425
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,740
I wonder if I can admire you

426
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,740
I wonder if I can admire you

427
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,740
and feel your true feelings.

428
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,740
I want to reach you
