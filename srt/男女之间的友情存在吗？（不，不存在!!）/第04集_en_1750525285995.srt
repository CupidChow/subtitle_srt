1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I don't know why.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm afraid Enomoto's exclusive model is unhappy with the flow of the story.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But why?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Something is coming along.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm afraid Enomoto's exclusive model is unhappy with the flow of the story.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But why?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm afraid Enomoto's exclusive model is unhappy with the flow of the story.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But why?

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm afraid Enomoto's exclusive model is unhappy with the flow of the story.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I noticed it, but I got conscious.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going to break it.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm nervous to call you by your name.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid Enomoto's exclusive model is unhappy with the flow of the story.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I've never seen you before.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid Enomoto's exclusive model is unhappy with the flow of the story.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What are you doing?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid Enomoto's exclusive model is unhappy with the flow of the story.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What's called a kiss from the夕から?

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What's called a trick from the夕から?

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Isn't it like that?

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Don't hesitate to say that.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Please listen me.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What's called a kiss from the夕から?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What's called a trick from the夕から?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Isn't it like that?

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What's called a trick from the夕から?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hey!

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Totsuo Fukuoka

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,400
This looks good.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,680
It Seitake.

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,380
Itraid of kalian'

32
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,900
I have no time to be angry.

33
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,280
Uh-huh.

34
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:22,380
I'm so great with your Mariko Act

35
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,880
Then, that guy over there...

36
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,580
That's it.

37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,920
Very good and tasty.

38
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,440
Geez, that astikawaakte heated up my home...

39
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,920
This is this, he was being camping.

40
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,280
But he might never get much food...

41
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,280
What's that?

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,280
Natsume-kun, you're the best.

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,280
I don't know, but you look so cute, Inuzuka-san.

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,280
You're so mean!

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,280
I'm the only one who's bullied by you!

46
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,280
The Heaven's Order of the Hikari.

47
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Thank you for your invitation, Shouda-kun.

48
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,280
I'll be in the city at the end of May.

49
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
Thank you for your invitation.

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
I'll be in the city at the end of May.

51
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,280
I'll be in the city at the end of May.

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
I'll be in the city at the end of May.

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
Hikaru, Himari, what's the meaning of the Gei-nou-jibusho?

54
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
This guy!

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Wait, Himari!

56
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
Damn, he escaped.

57
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,280
Y-Yu-kun!

58
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,280
I heard that he's coming from Tokyo.

59
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,280
I'm going to Tokyo, so I'll go with you.

60
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Really?

61
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Yuu-kun, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,280
I said I wanted to be a model.

63
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,280
No, it's not because of Enomoto-san.

64
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,280
I have to catch him and talk to him.

65
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,280
I have a good idea.

66
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,280
Oh, handmade cookies!

67
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,280
By the way, I have one Nyu-san-kin.

68
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
I'll go with you.

69
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,280
Hie-chan, will you come with me?

70
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,280
I can't let Enomoto-san catch that Himari in the handmade cookie.

71
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
I'll be in the city.

72
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,280
You two!

73
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Don't you feel that you can catch him right away?

74
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,280
I'm going to catch him from the field!

75
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
You!

76
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
Itagaki!

77
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
You're not the type to show that.

78
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,280
You're a fool.

79
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Himari, listen to me.

80
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,280
Shut up! I'm not talking to you!

81
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
I'm just kidding.

82
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Then, stop that Kamate-chan move!

83
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
Don't say that!

84
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
Himari!

85
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Yuu-kun!

86
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Wait, Himari!

87
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
I said don't do anything!

88
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
Why are you so angry?

89
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,280
I don't like Enomoto-san's model.

90
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
You're not a fool!

91
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,280
You're not going to do that!

92
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
What's that?

93
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Why do I have to be seen in the eyes of a white man or hit by a white man?

94
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
I'm going to Tokyo by myself.

95
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,280
If you're a friend, you can talk to me about that.

96
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
I'm that kind of person.

97
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,280
I was playing with Himari from the beginning.

98
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
What's wrong?

99
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Don't be so quiet.

100
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,280
What if I say something?

101
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
Stop it!

102
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Calm down!

103
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
I'm calm!

104
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Let me go!

105
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Listen to me!

106
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Sorry!

107
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
Stop it!

108
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,280
No way...

109
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
What's wrong?

110
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
It's fine.

111
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,280
I'm the only one who can do anything for you.

112
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,280
I'm the only one who can make you an ax.

113
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
That's Yuu's method.

114
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,280
You don't think only about me, do you?

115
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
That's not true!

116
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
You don't have any?

117
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,280
Then why do you want to be a model for Enochi?

118
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,280
You're the one who's going to be the first to see Yuu's ax.

119
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Why are you giving it to me?

120
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,280
That's my promise!

121
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
You like Enochi, don't you?

122
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
That's why you want to be number one.

123
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
I know.

124
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,280
I know love too.

125
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
I know it.

126
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,280
I want to support you two.

127
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
But...

128
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,280
But...

129
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,280
I can't be satisfied with number two!

130
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,280
I'm going to the place where you need me.

131
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,280
What are you doing here?

132
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
Are you going to be alone?

133
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,280
That's not possible.

134
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,280
I'm asking you to look at Rin-chan.

135
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Why did you ask Eno-Moto to be the model for the war?

136
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
But that's not true.

137
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Rin-chan doesn't seem to be the winner.

138
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,280
I know you're supporting Eno-Moto,

139
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
but it has nothing to do with the model.

140
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,280
You think so?

141
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Love is harder than being a hero.

142
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,280
It's meaningless to be a hero on the way.

143
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,280
You're so convincing.

144
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,280
Rin-chan, who's been a lover,

145
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,280
is so sad that she's showing her affection to her daughter.

146
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,280
But she's a friend to me.

147
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Then why are you so upset?

148
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,280
It's the same thing as the first love.

149
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Recently, Natsu seems to be feeling a sense of belonging to him.

150
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,280
If not, it's not necessary to love Rin-chan.

151
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,280
What Natsu is concerned about is the sense of belonging to Himari-chan.

152
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,280
At this time, forget about love or friendship.

153
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,280
The most important thing is to decide who's most important.

154
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Rin-chan's war model story was definitely the purpose of destroying Natsu and Himari-chan's relationship.

155
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,280
But if you don't abandon your hometown,

156
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,280
you can't forget Natsu.

157
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Who can imagine such a strong feeling?

158
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,280
If Himari-chan is not in this state,

159
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Rin-chan will attack herself.

160
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,280
I don't want to see such a childhood friend.

161
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Well, I'm not going to be a coward to my childhood friend.

162
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,280
You're so kind to me.

163
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,280
I'm not kind!

164
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Don't be ridiculous.

165
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,280
It's not bad to abandon Himari-chan and be tied up with Rin-chan.

166
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Anyway, do whatever you want.

167
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,280
I'll tell you many times, but Rin-chan is the best friend of all time.

168
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
You're kind.

169
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,280
If you say that, I'll be able to stop Himari.

170
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Are you really going to Tokyo?

171
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
I'm going.

172
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Why?

173
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
I want to prove my worth.

174
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
Prove your worth?

175
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,280
You're always saying difficult things.

176
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,280
I don't think you can understand.

177
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
I know.

178
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,280
I was always the one who made a promise.

179
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,280
I was the one who understood and looked at everyone.

180
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,280
I was never forced to do it.

181
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,280
Thanks to Himari, my promise spread to the outside world,

182
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,280
and I made a promise to keep making bad things for Himari.

183
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,280
If I keep that promise, this end will be natural.

184
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,280
I can't stop going to Tokyo.

185
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
No.

186
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,280
I'll apologize for the model's opinion.

187
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Himari is a stubborn girl.

188
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,280
She'll go to Tokyo and she'll be a popular existence.

189
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
I'll be with her.

190
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
I'll be with her.

191
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Then I can't help it.

192
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
I can't help it.

193
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Life is something that can't be as you wish.

194
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
If it can't be as you wish,

195
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,280
you have to use your own strength to catch your own ideas.

196
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
You're so stupid.

197
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
You can't go to Tokyo.

198
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,280
I'm not interested in life as much as you want to be seen by a fan who doesn't know their faces.

199
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Well, I think I heard a lie.

200
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,280
It's a lie, but I'm not going to cry.

201
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,280
I just broke the axis of the yu-nail.

202
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,280
No, no. I'll make a new one.

203
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Anyway, don't say that, Himari.

204
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,280
I'll make all the requests for yu-nail.

205
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,280
First, I'll set Himari's appreciation on the moon.

206
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Second, I'll make a flower axis for me.

207
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,280
And third, I'll test the accuracy.

208
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,280
If I test it this time, I can't avoid it.

209
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,280
I feel like Aronten is going to be a little off, but it's okay.

210
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,280
If I get off tomorrow, I'll definitely say it, so I'll make it.

211
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Huh?

212
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
My parents?

213
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
It's not at all!

214
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,280
The yu-nail requires time to let go of the sadness that will make me lose myself.

215
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Alright, cute guy. I forgive you.

216
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
Oh, hello. Is that you?

217
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,280
You're going to cry while I'm at it?

218
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Absolutely.

219
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,280
I see.

220
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,280
My Tokyo Ikusengen was a big shock.

221
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
Alright, I forgive you.

222
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Well, I guess I'll check it out with the annual Tamei account.

223
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
Huh?

224
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,280
This is Yu's hand.

225
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,280
It really doesn't seem to be my place.

226
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,280
The love rate has been raised.

227
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,280
I'm really going to Tokyo.

228
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,280
It's a little troublesome for you to do that.

229
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
I'll go.

230
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Wake up, Himari. You were touched once.

231
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
There's no way you can stop me.

232
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,280
Hey, Himari. You're back already?

233
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Yeah, Onii-chan. I'm doing my best.

234
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
I see. You're working hard.

235
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
I have curry in the pot, so can I eat it?

236
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
Sure.

237
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,280
Himari.

238
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
Huh?

239
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,280
I haven't been talking to you for a week.

240
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,280
What's going on?

241
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Do you know why?

242
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
It's easy.

243
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Because the Yu-kun's temperament you feel from Himari is low.

244
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,280
So what happened?

245
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,280
You idiot!

246
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
You're going to Tokyo because you're touched!

247
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,280
You're going to defeat the only one who's going to win!

248
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,280
You're going to be the last person to do it!

249
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
You're going to be the last person to do it!

250
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
I'm sorry!

251
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
I'm sorry!

252
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,280
So you're going to break my promise?

253
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,280
You were the only one who asked me to do it.

254
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,280
I asked you to do it because you wanted to make a 200-yen pair.

255
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,280
You made me lose my mind because of that.

256
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,280
You made me lose my mind because of that.

257
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,280
I've never tasted anything like that before!

258
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,280
I know that you're the worst sister in the world.

259
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,280
But I still got the wrong idea because I was touched by Yu-kun's evilness.

260
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,280
I remember that promise.

261
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,280
I can't get rid of the support from Yu-kun's evilness shop.

262
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
That's right!

263
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
But I can't believe it.

264
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,280
I'm sure you didn't feel like you were the worst sister in the world.

265
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,280
No, no, no! I didn't do that!

266
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Then what's the matter with you?

267
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,280
I mean, I've fallen in love with Yu-kun.

268
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
I don't know anything about you!

269
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
How do you feel about me?

270
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,280
You're telling me to give up on you?

271
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
That's right.

272
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,280
The most important thing for me is love.

273
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Or, to give up on Yu-kun.

274
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
It's not the same thing?

275
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Life is a fantasy.

276
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
No matter how much money you have,

277
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,280
it's impossible to give up everything you want at that time.

278
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,280
I went through a high-speed road as a citizen.

279
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,280
I stole many people's houses and important things from the land.

280
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,280
I was more concerned about the people's voices than the people's.

281
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,280
But, I was absolutely in need of this town after 100 years.

282
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Even after I died, I'm doing what I can to make this town.

283
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
You can also walk that kind of life.

284
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Throw out 99 of them and win the most important one.

285
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
If you do that, you win.

286
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,280
I didn't really get the point of your story.

287
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,280
But, I'll give up everything

288
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,280
when I find out the meaning of it and can't accept it.

289
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,280
Yu, I have something important to tell you.

290
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
I have something to tell you, too.

291
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
I'm in the science room.

292
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
It's not something big.

293
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,280
I'm not going to tell you anything.

294
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,280
It's not something big, but...

295
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
I'm talking about the entertainment agency.

296
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Well, um...

297
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,280
I don't know what to say.

298
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,280
You can tell me first. I'll talk later.

299
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Oh, I see.

300
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Well, I have something to tell you.

301
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
A university!

302
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
Oh, no! I made a mistake!

303
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Sorry, wait! This is a mistake!

304
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Wait, wait! It's not a mistake!

305
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
What's with this unhealable kind of thing?

306
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,280
I thought I should quit school.

307
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
I'm going to Tokyo, too.

308
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
I'm going to Himari.

309
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
To me?

310
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,280
I was told to decide what's most important in Makishima.

311
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
I thought it was Himari.

312
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
I thought it was Himari.

313
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Well, I have to find a way to make a living in Tokyo.

314
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
I-It's not like that!

315
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Wait, I'll tell you something simple.

316
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,280
If I work, I might not be able to get a flower accu...

317
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,280
No matter how great a flower accu is,

318
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,280
it's boring if you're not here.

319
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Himari doesn't mean that I'm the one who can't make a flower accu.

320
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,280
There are a lot of things.

321
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,280
I love watching you and watching you on the video.

322
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,280
I love taking the onion rings when I'm back from school.

323
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,280
I love going on a train and having fun.

324
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,280
I love the moment when I laugh at you.

325
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
What are you doing?

326
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
It's fine. I'm not going anymore.

327
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,280
You said you wanted to be a fan.

328
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Are you okay?

329
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
I'm not! I'm getting a cold!

330
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,280
I want to kiss you when I get close to you.

331
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,280
I hate the first kiss of Niu San Kimma Millet!

332
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
I'm just like you.

333
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,280
I can be a model, but if you can, I'd be happy if you could.

334
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
I see.

335
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,280
What do you want to give me?

336
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,280
This is a double-edged sword? It's too small.

337
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,280
The double-edged mini-chip made with a preserved flower is...

338
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,280
a friend ring that only Himari has in the world.

339
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,280
For me, Himari is a friend.

340
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,280
I think I can get angry like this,

341
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,280
but it's not important for others.

342
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,280
That's the truth.

343
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Niu, turn a little back.

344
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Why?

345
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,280
It's okay.

346
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
What are you doing?

347
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Stop it.

348
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
You can do it yourself.

349
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Nya, you can do it.

350
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
You're a bad boy.

351
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,280
You said you were a friend ring, didn't you?

352
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Hey, what about this small one?

353
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
The double-edged...

354
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,280
You...

355
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,280
I have one more.

356
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,280
If we're alone until 30, I'll give you one.

357
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,280
Well, if you're single at that time...

358
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,280
In the end, it's a temporary position.

359
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Well, if you say so, you can be a friend.

360
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,280
I'll hide this love in this ring.

361
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Himari!

362
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
What's wrong?

363
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,280
I heard that you're always with Himari.

364
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
Really?

365
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
What?

366
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Oh, right. I have to say it.

367
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Thanks to you, I got a good one.

368
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Thank you very much.

369
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,280
I'm glad you helped me.

370
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,280
I was looking for a little, but I couldn't find it.

371
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,280
It's a good thing that you're a member of Murasaki's tulip.

372
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
You'll be happy, right?

373
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
Why are you looking at me?

374
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,280
Murasaki's tulip's flower words are still not in Himari's mind.

375
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,280
If I was touched by that timing, I'd want to die.

376
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,280
But someday,

377
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,280
my best friend will be too cute and I'll be in trouble.

378
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
I'm sorry.

379
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
I'm sorry.

380
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,280
I'm sorry.

381
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
I'm sorry.

382
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
I'm sorry.

383
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,280
I'm sorry.

384
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
I'm sorry.

385
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,280
I'm sorry.

386
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
I'm sorry.

387
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
I'm sorry.

389
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
I'm sorry.

390
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
I'm sorry.

391
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
I'm sorry.

392
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,280
I'm sorry.

393
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,280
I'm sorry.

394
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,280
I'm sorry.

395
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
I'm sorry.

396
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
I'm sorry.

397
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,280
I'm sorry.

398
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,280
I'm sorry.

399
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,280
I'm sorry.

400
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,280
I'm sorry.

401
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,280
I'm sorry.

402
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
I'm sorry.

403
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
I'm sorry.

404
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
I'm sorry.

405
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,280
I'm sorry.

406
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,280
I'm sorry.

407
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
I'm sorry.

408
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,280
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,280
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,280
I'm sorry.

411
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,280
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,280
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
I'm sorry.

414
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,280
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,280
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,280
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,280
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,280
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
I'm sorry.
