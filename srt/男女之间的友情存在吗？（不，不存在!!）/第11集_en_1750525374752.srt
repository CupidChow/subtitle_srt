1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I guess it was a day of love between Mitsudo and me.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I had an event that lasted for a week.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Why, why, why?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Why did you do that to Himari?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I was so mean that I completely lost my emotions!

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
At times like this, I'm just...

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I guess that's the reason why Himari kissed me.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I mean, how am I going to date Himari from now on?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to be a Nazi.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I think I'll be having a lot of fun talking to him on the phone.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How was it?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not going to kiss you from the heart.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not going to be a chicken.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The white flowers are blooming in a row.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They're looking at each other, looking at each other.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I noticed that the relationship between us was stable.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm conscious.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm going to break.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm calling out your name.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm nervous.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm going to be a bad guy.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I've never seen you before.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not going to be a baby.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I guess that's the reason why he's in love with you.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm a little bit of a kid.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How am I going to date Himari from now on?

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not going to kiss you from the heart.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not going to be a chicken.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm going to be a bad guy.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not going to be a chicken.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're holding hands with Mr. Crayha, aren't you?

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No, I don't know.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I haven't done anything this time.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Is that so?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He was just sitting down under the clouds and was taken away.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If he doesn't have a friend, he can find out his true self.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Then you should give up on Himari from you.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I can't do that.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Well, if you try to make it a mess, it's better for Himari to go to Tokyo.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That has nothing to do with it.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What?

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm not going to be your enemy.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going to be your enemy.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Don't be so surprised!

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm your favorite woman!

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not surprised!

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What's the matter with you?

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What do you mean?

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No, no!

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You're not going to listen to me!

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What's the matter with Himari?

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Did I say that?

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You were right.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You should be careful when you talk to him.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Did you hide it?

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No, I went to get Himari with him.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I thought he was just talking about Enomoto.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But he suddenly...

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is great!

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I thought I wouldn't be on the show this time,

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
but this is a really interesting story.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're really excited.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You can't just let Himari go back to his best friend.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, that's...

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Then, I guess it's time to focus on what's in front of you.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
See you.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Makishima is right.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you don't win, you'll lose Himari.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
As long as you can do what you can.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But you have to make the best accel.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're right.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're a perfect match for everyone's family.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're a good-for-nothing.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's have fun first.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Play!

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What?

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I did it!

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I did it! I did it!

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What? It's not a dream! Why?

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Why couldn't I do it?

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What kind of face should I show you?

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What should I send you?

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
My lips and the face of the Gyoza...

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Which one is more mochi-mochi?

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you stupid?

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Where in the world is Gyoza's lips and the face of the Gyoza?

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There's a Gyoza from the Gyoza!

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sure he hates it.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Himari, are you okay now?

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hey, bro!

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Sorry, I was kicked by you.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Where are you going?

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What?

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I see.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You were so stubborn that you were trying to get away with it.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And you were just being a little bit too much.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What?

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, I can't help it.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What?

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I thought you'd be scolded.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You should be praised for telling me your feelings.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If you were to be scolded, I'd be the one to take the blame!

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What?

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't need to worry about anything!

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I see.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He was the one who said that.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, then I'll have dinner with you.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I can smell the good smell of the Gyoza from earlier.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Um, bro...

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I mean, the Gyoza...

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What the hell!

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I can't take it anymore!

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry!

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't know.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I feel like I'm getting better.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I feel like I'm still better.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I can't concentrate on Himari's face since yesterday.

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yuku, hello.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hey, Enomoto, where's the club?

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I came to see you since it's lunch break.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I see. It's lunch time.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Are you going to take this out now?

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm still looking.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't know if I'm getting better or not,

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
but I'm going to be in a bad mood if I'm half-dressed.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I see.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You came to take this out with Hii.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You came to take this out with Hii.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
No, I mean,

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I came to take out Himari and Kisu...

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Did you hear that from Makishima?

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I wanted to go, too.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But he didn't say anything.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's a huge problem.

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Enomoto,

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm going to tell Himari how I feel.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You sure?

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah.

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't care if you two date.

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I told him I'd like him even if we were dating.

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Enomoto, you were like this.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm going to be Hii's best friend.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll do my best to make you feel better.

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm going to be a good friend.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll be back.

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
See you.

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Um...

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Um...

151
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm in the right place.

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh, no!

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, no!

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Are you okay?

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm so sorry.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm done.

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm done.

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm done.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm done.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm done.

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm done.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm done.

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Um, Himari,

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I've never done anything yesterday.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So...

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I want you to listen to me when I win the match with you.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm not going to tell you what I said.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I've decided to tell you, but I forgot what I said.

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What?

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm fine, but I'm not sure.

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hey,

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hey, give it to me.

174
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What are you going to make?

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Himawari's tiara.

176
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's great!

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I thought that smile was cuter than the one in the middle school.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Himari doesn't have a father.

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's been a while since my father came back,

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
so I'm going on a trip with my mother.

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I see.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Where's Enomoto?

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
He's helping the shop.

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He can sell cakes, surprisingly.

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He's cutting the cake?

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's hard for me to come back because my two sisters are here,

188
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and it's time for me to go to school,

189
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
so I have to work.

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Then you can come to me.

191
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll go to my brother.

192
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Really? Thank you.

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm going to school.

194
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm going to school.

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm going to school.

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm going to school.

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm going to school.

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm going to school.

199
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm going to school.

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm going to school.

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There are three days left until the match.

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, Yu-kun, you really did your best.

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If you can make that tiara...

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're not sleeping well, Kureha-kun.

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Thank you.

206
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're really a good brother.

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's right.

208
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's toast in front of tiara.

209
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You saw it yesterday, too.

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I want to see something good.

211
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yu-kun, this is...

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What is it?

213
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Why is this happening?

214
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The water in the inside of the flower is lost and it's starting to fall.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm sorry for the timing of the water leak.

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Can you restore this?

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I can't.

218
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
From now on, even if it looks like it,

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
the quality is...

220
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What about the spare?

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I was taken care of by the students.

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Everyone used it as a masterpiece.

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yu-kun, let's go find Himawari right away.

224
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We'll crush the flower in the city.

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Mr. Hibari.

226
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm drinking sake.

227
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Alright.

228
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yu-kun, let's go in.

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Good morning.

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Good morning.

231
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Good morning.

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I finally fell asleep after a long time of sleep.

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I was so dry during the trip.

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What is sleepiness?

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm feeling a little sleepy while I'm not here.

236
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Now, show me the finished product.

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes.

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's great! It's so cute!

240
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hey, Onii-chan!

241
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I think it's a good work.

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I've been able to get over this place with these three.

243
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Then, I'll show you.

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes.

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So cute!

246
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm more excited than the one on social media.

247
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
This is a wedding tiara, right?

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's a fashionable and flashy Himawari.

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The silk is fine, so I think it's really good.

250
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Um, is it true?

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yes, the cutie is the cutie.

252
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I want it.

253
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Then, this match, my...

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Hmm, I wonder if that's okay.

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's cute, but you can't win the match.

256
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You want it now?

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Did you plan to lose whatever you made?

258
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm not that coward.

259
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I planned to give up on Himari when Yu-chan made something good.

260
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Then, why?

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Of course, the situation of the match is to show Yu-chan's full power.

262
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But I don't think it's better to make mistakes and make mistakes.

263
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's not true.

264
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I always have full power in my hands.

265
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Then, why did you bring the second hand?

266
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You know that Himawari was defeated.

267
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Because Sakura-chan taught me.

268
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You tried to fool me.

269
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
No, because if we can make it in time for the match...

271
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
If we make it in time...

272
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What?

273
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm really disappointed because I said it was his first time.

274
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Well, Leon, I'm going home.

275
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Let's see how mom looks like after a long time.

276
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You said something.

277
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Why did you tell him that Himawari was defeated?

278
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You were trying to tell him what you said.

279
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You're a big man.

280
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You were trying to tell him that it's okay to make it in time for the match.

281
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
If you can't be a true priest against evil,

282
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
you should quit quickly.

283
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I want to tell you that I'm not a true priest.

284
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I remember this.

285
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He was defeated.

286
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
When I talked to him, he was very impressed by me.

287
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But I didn't take the quality of the aces.

288
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What do you mean?

289
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Look closely.

290
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
There were two things that were the same as this.

291
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There was one thing that broke the fireworks.

292
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You can understand this, right?

293
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you remember that I said that your aces were a low-quality box?

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No.

295
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
There was no bad product for the aces you sold so far.

296
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But after you sold the box, there were four bad products.

297
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I could see the power of the aces I sold so far.

298
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But I was a little disappointed because I was a little lost in love.

299
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You're not really a creator.

300
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You can't face your dreams with a single match.

301
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If you want to be a creator, just throw away that sweet feeling.

302
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If you want to be in love, stop being a client.

303
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Start the morning glory that brought out the momentary teara in the match.

304
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Hey, Ryu...

305
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm sorry I forgot to tell you before I made this teara.

306
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Himari, let's go.

307
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Why are you calling me out?

308
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Sorry, but I can't go to Tokyo.

309
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I won't let you go as you wish.

310
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You've been asking me since summer, haven't you?

311
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm not doing anything this time.

312
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm just trying to get along with you.

313
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Himari, go to Ms. Kureha's office and aim for the highest in that area.

314
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What?

315
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That's why I have the most important promise with you.

316
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm sure it's easy to get rid of the money problem.

317
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Then you should invite Ms. Kureha to the match.

318
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What do you mean?

319
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's not a great chance to raise your own bloodline.

320
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
If you want to spread the summer's evil, it's a good idea.

321
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's cute to get to your place.

322
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
To learn the right way to use it,

323
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
invite Ms. Kureha to the match.

324
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But I'm not in the way of Yu.

325
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's what Rin should do.

326
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But...

327
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm not saying to give you summer to Rin.

328
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm saying to give you a chance.

329
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
If you really have a bond,

330
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
you can leave for a few years.

331
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
A real bond?

332
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's a great service.

333
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
When you and Himari have a dream,

334
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
if you still feel like you're in summer,

335
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
then promise to be a part of Himari's side.

336
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What?

337
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I promise to protect you.

338
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Then, go ahead.

339
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I was punished by the sin of love and lost my friendship.

340
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yu was facing the right angle.

341
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I was the one who made it so hard.

342
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Is it the last time I'm going to be so hard on Yu?

343
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm so proud of you.

344
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's hot.

345
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's really hot.

346
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Don't stick it on.

347
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Don't overdo it while I'm not around.

348
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Overdo it?

349
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm not in a relationship with you before that.

350
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I mean, you love me too much.

351
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You're not in a relationship with a cute girl like Enochi.

352
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So, Himari.

353
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're not going to pay today?

354
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
We're standing on the path of life.

355
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If I become a model and become famous,

356
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I can show more of Yu's bad habits.

357
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
As a result, our dreams will come true.

358
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I think so.

359
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Maybe I'll be the one to make my grandpa suffer and make him pay for it.

360
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We can make a high school-level love love eroero youth.

361
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You're right.

362
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm not good at saying things like that.

363
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I wonder who we should live for and what our future dreams are.

364
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Himari, do you remember?

365
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If I say that I'm giving up my dream,

366
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I can't abandon Yu's flower acces.

367
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
No, I...

368
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm not going to abandon Yu's acces.

369
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Himari!

370
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Please, I'm not the one who's making my acces.

371
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
No.

372
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This world is just pure.

373
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
If I can't choose one thing,

374
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm sure it's right to reach out to the future.

375
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I have to choose a different path for that.

376
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'll take in a pure like shit.

377
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll take in a pure like shit.

378
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'll see you again on this road ahead.

379
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm sure our love will change at that time.

380
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I believe we can laugh as best friends.

381
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Goodbye, my love.

382
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Please be healthy.

383
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I love you.

384
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm going to break the memories

385
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
that I've been trapped in your eyes.

386
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
If I touch them, they'll break.

387
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll be far away from this place.

388
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm not going to abandon Yu's acces.

389
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm not going to abandon Yu's flower acces.

390
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm not going to abandon Yu's flower acces.

391
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Tell me, God.

392
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You're my soulmate.

393
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I want to show you the glory of you.

394
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I want to say that my heart is empty.

395
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm not in love.

396
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm not in love.

397
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I want to admire your shine.

398
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It feels like my true love.

399
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Can we be sure for future years?

400
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Thank you for watching this video!

401
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

402
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm sorry.

405
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm sorry.

411
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm sorry.
