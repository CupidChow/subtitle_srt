1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm selling the accessories of the preserved flower.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In the fall of 2nd grade, I first knew that selling was difficult.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
After all, I sold it for 5.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I spent 100 on one day and 15 on 100.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I can't do all of them in a day.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, I see.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm finally back!

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Where did you go?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You're the youngest member of the science department, right?

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can't make it a shop.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The girls were coming to see you earlier.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Really?

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
No, it's okay.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Why?

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I thought I couldn't sell it anyway.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm the same as if I didn't have it.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, I sold it.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Here, 15 people came.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
27 in total.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
27?

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I didn't know that much.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hey, Natome.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Why are you looking this way?

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't know.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm not good at it, beauty.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hey, hey.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Why do you have to sell 100 accessories?

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What do you know?

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The sugar teacher of the science department said.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
My privacy...

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hey, Natome.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's so hot.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm telling you to be cute, so give up and confess.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I feel like that.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's cute, but I'm going to be stupid if I say this.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I dream of opening a flower shop like this.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But my parents said I should be a high-ranking official.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So I fought and said I should sell 100 accessories at the culture festival.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hurry up and close it.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Of course.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If you design a child's life without a reason, your parents will stop you.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're stupid.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Shut up.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You're so stupid.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What?

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're a beginner.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's why I didn't want to say it.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Who are you?

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hey, how many accessories do you have left?

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
68.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I think that's enough.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, prepare all of them.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Tomorrow, I'll let this dog go to Himari.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hey, Himari.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This earring looks so good.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Where are you going to buy it?

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, it's a special product.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm going to buy it here, the website called You.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Hey, what are you going to do next?

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I've been selling all the accessories I had prepared for the second day of the festival.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm now working at a convenience store.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm selling the accessories I've ordered.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's a problem to start a personal business with a small business.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's a hassle, but I'm also getting a lot of money to buy flowers.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So I can't complain.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I feel like I'm in a world of my own.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Anyway, I like this kind of time.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
My sister is popular with me, but I can't help it because this is my birth certificate.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm a creator.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I love loneliness, so I can face it with my own self.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You're cute this time, too.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm done with my work.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't be so hard on me, Himari.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's okay. I've been working for an hour, but I'm working hard.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm done for today.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I've already finished my work, so I'm going to show you.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I only have one left.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm tired.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm doing the best I can to make a cute person unique, so I'm a little happy.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Do you feel that way?

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No, I'm serious. I'm cute.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I just remembered the Chinese culture festival.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It was a long time ago.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Then you're getting more and more popular.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Teka, you're going to get better.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's not good. This is my own unique seat.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm so tired.

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I have a good neck, but I'm the only one who's comfortable.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have a good arm, but I'm the only one who's comfortable.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What do you think? You're too thin to call it that.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is our daily life.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I noticed in these two years.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's our box.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Why did you help me?

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I didn't help you.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I thought I wanted to sell it.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's why I just cooperated.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I shouldn't make a mistake.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's...

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's do it!

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What?

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm helping you at the flower accel shop.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're helping me?

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I was actually aiming for this chocolate I got from you.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I've been watching you when you were playing the music in the science room.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Where did you get it from?

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I've heard it from a window in the basement.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't know if you've heard it.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And the back of the cabinet.

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You're doing it every day, right?

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I was putting names on each of them and I was playing the music when I was cutting them.

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You were watching?

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I was actually planning to buy this, but it was a bit more precious than I thought.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I was like, this is bad.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I used the same request as you.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The same request?

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes.

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
A very important one.

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So I want you to take responsibility for this.

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Take responsibility?

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What do you mean?

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Can I have that one?

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
One?

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's not a splatter gun, is it?

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No, I know.

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The one you liked when you were making the accel.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It was straight and beautiful.

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
One?

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So you want me to show you the passion of that one?

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You want me to be alone?

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Then I'll give you as much as you want.

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's the kind of fate that I want to have.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I want to be your best friend.

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Best friend?

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The word of the two-leaf clover is friendship and cooperation.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can't leave you forever.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
By the way, what happened to the entertainment agency that said they had a call?

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I dropped it.

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm not a fan of Max.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's a waste.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, I'm a friend.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If you can't open a restaurant until 30, you have to marry a responsible person.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't you want to quit?

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
After you know that, it's hard to call him brother.

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You like Yu too much.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
If you don't want to, you can get married first.

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Marriage?

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You have a relationship first before that, right?

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You still can't forget that first love?

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It was when I was in elementary school.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's not like the girl I met on a trip is actually Yu's dream.

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's creepy.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Shut up.

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The dreamer is Yu's charm, but soon she will turn her eyes on the real girl.

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What if she makes it?

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You're going to be in school all day.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No one will come.

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm a little bit of a boyfriend.

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yu is not enough.

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm being told by the girls who are on the left.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's because I'm not the only one who talks about Yu in front of my boyfriend.

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm not in a relationship with her because I like her.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Are you bored?

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm going to pull your part.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't know how to feel about love yet.

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Are you really going to marry her until you show up?

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, but I think I'll be able to get married.

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Because Yu won't marry me.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's because of people.

178
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The other guy is an ordinary man.

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
My young body is damaged by a dirty hand.

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You're really going to get into a manly, stupid, and erotic word.

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Do you have a date now?

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I do.

183
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm going to graduate high school soon.

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm a famous girl who's been in the business for a long time.

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm going to get married soon.

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Then I'll be your best friend.

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You're still a little bit of a liar.

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You read too much of the Ero novel.

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You said you were fat.

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Daifuku, don't get in my way today.

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What about the delivery?

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It would be nice if the men were all like Yu.

193
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's a hassle to be in a relationship.

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Besides, I don't know much about love.

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What about Yu?

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
She?

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't have a hobby like this.

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You're right.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We're very similar in some way.

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't think we can get married.

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh, right.

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yu, if we're both single, will you live with me?

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What?

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Well, I'll leave that simple approach to you.

205
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Why 30?

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, let's do our best not to open a flower shop

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
or open a border line.

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
If you're alone until 30, you can't do it.

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't like Himari.

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm a more elegant woman.

211
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yu, you're the best!

212
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I was born and raised in the first place!

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What are you doing?

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Stop it!

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This is the order.

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You said you'd mess up before coming, right?

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Sorry.

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Sorry.

219
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm the one who sent Himari to you.

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm going to sell it to you, so please give me a flower-shaped CD.

222
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Hey, do you always hang out with dogs?

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You don't hang out with them, do you?

224
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Does that have anything to do with you?

225
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Huh?

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, right.

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh, that's bad.

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't have the right to deny our values

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
if Yu doesn't know the value.

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Do you want to be a man and a woman?

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You do, don't you?

232
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What does this feel like if you don't do it?

233
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Do you want to support Yu's dream?

234
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Is it the way to kiss or get a kiss?

235
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
If you want to kiss her, you don't have to do that.

236
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I want Yu to acknowledge this relationship

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
with her friend.

238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's lonely to say bye-bye to a lover.

239
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Now, the part of Himari...

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're so beautiful.

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
No, I was just looking at you.

242
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
By the way, I don't like being beautiful, but I like it.

243
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I feel so innocent,

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
but I mean that I can be a part of the Akusei motif.

245
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If I were to insert the Akusei motif,

246
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'd have to use my neck to make it look like a blue nail.

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
A bracelet?

248
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That beautiful girl was the one I sold at the cultural festival.

249
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Other than Himari,

250
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
someone else has been working on that work.

251
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
No way. Why? Did it go away?

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I can fix that, but...

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Why?

254
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I was looking at your beautiful face.

255
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I couldn't even look at you if you were the first person I saw.

256
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Wait.

257
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What's going on?

258
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Sorry. I thought you were very important.

259
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Sui, please forget about it.

260
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's so hard.

261
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If I go to Himari, I'll be so happy.

262
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'll be so happy.

263
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'll take you to Hakama for sure!

264
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The main character, the group's main character, the same character,

265
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
the dimension of the dimension, the circle.

266
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We'll be in the test area,

267
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
so let's make sure we can separate them.

268
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll be there.

269
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You're so reckless.

270
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You're so reckless.

271
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You can't be a beginner at this elementary school level!

272
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Natsume,

273
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
you shouldn't get in the way of your studying.

274
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Why?

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's great.

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
There's someone who's still important to you,

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
the first-class doctor of the UUU.

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know.

279
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But I wonder if that girl was with the customer.

280
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Natsume, customer.

281
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Hey, Nats.

282
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I came to play with you.

283
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Oh, I heard you're a girl.

284
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You're suddenly saying hello.

285
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I love you so much.

286
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Makishima-kun, what's wrong?

287
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Hey, Himari-chan, how are you?

288
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm having fun today, too.

289
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Thanks to you.

290
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's good.

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm just doing my summer.

292
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Makishima-kun always plays with me.

293
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Hey, wait.

294
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why are you suddenly making fun of me?

295
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You were dating when you were in middle school, right?

296
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Why are you so close to each other?

297
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't want to remember the past with this guy.

298
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You don't like me.

299
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I did something.

300
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Makishima-kun was making fun of me.

301
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm a scammer.

302
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I was being bullied.

303
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm not a scammer.

304
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm just interested in you.

305
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
As expected of the man of the world.

306
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He's so good at making fun of me.

307
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You're the same, aren't you?

308
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Hey, you're here for something.

309
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh, right.

310
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Natsume, did you call a girl at the local office yesterday?

311
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
A girl?

312
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Is she Makishima's girlfriend?

313
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No, no, no.

314
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's not the case.

315
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Hey, Rin-chan.

316
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You're going to fix your bracelet, right?

317
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Hello.

318
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's Enochi!

319
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Hii-chan?

320
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I didn't expect Yu to find her.

321
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I didn't look for her.

322
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
As expected of the man of the world.

323
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Enochi and Rin-chan are the same.

324
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I didn't know Makishima-kun was a childhood friend.

325
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Enochi is different from Chinese.

326
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I played with her a few times when I was in elementary school.

327
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
My brother and Enochi's sister are classmates.

328
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It has something to do with Yu.

329
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What?

330
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The second day of the cultural festival,

331
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
she was the one who sent me the accessories and sold them all.

332
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
She was a student model.

333
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
She's already popular in the magazines and magazines.

334
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
She got the bracelet as a gift from her sister.

335
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That's a very interesting story.

336
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I don't know if you noticed that I made it.

337
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Um, can you show me your bracelet?

338
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
This?

339
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The joint part of the bracelet...

340
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's similar to the bracelet.

341
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Can't you fix it?

342
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
No, no, no!

343
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Enochi!

344
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What?

345
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yu is a little bit silly.

346
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
She's working hard on her first-person Enochi.

347
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Don't be so cold-hearted.

348
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm not that...

349
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But you're amazing at watching.

350
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Here.

351
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Here.

352
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It hurts!

353
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Are you okay?

354
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I told you to fix it!

355
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Hurry up and fix it!

356
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I can't believe you're so good at this.

357
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Actually, this girl...

358
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What should I say?

359
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Um...

360
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
She's always the same.

361
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I didn't mean it!

362
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
She's definitely a student model!

363
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
No, but as expected...

364
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
She's...

365
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Ah!

366
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I've never been so good at this.

367
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I want everyone to take my key holder, Umo-chan, with me!

368
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Enochi!

369
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Amazing!

370
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I never thought that the secret would be this much.

371
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'll take care of this.

372
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's time for you to get into the high school!

373
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I can't believe it!

374
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I can't believe I'm so good at this!

375
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Let's go and see if she's with me!

376
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Second chance!

377
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What are you doing?

378
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Stop it!

379
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Stop it!

380
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What are you doing?

381
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You're going to kill me!

382
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Stop it!

383
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What are you doing in front of the sea?

384
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Don't run away from me!

385
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You're disgusting!

386
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You bastard!

387
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'll let you go in the back of the school!

388
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Stop it!

389
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I think we should change this part.

390
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The beauty of the school will stay the same.

391
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll start then.

392
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Hii-chan, this person...

393
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It always feels like this when you're working.

394
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
When it comes to the aces, it's like a concentration ghost.

395
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't hear anything even if I talk to you.

396
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Do you want to try it?

397
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Try it?

398
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I did it.

399
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What?

400
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're so...

401
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Himari, what are you doing to me?

402
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You're a girl!

403
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm going to kill you!

404
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You're really going to kill me!

405
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Where are you going?

406
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What are you doing?

407
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm going to kill you!

408
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're a criminal!

409
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
How is it?

410
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Thank you.

411
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll go home before you get wet.

412
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
See you.

413
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I wish we could go home together.

414
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What does Hii-chan have to do with that person?

415
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You mean?

416
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
She's a new friend from middle school.

417
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You're not dating?

418
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Are you a type?

419
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No, I'm not!

420
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Well, you're a good person who makes aces.

421
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't think you can understand me.

422
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I probably can't leave you forever.

423
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm sure that's the end of the friendship forever.

424
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
When you stop making aces.

425
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Oh no, it's raining.

426
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Hii-chan,

427
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
do you know someone who has confessed to you despite not knowing their faces?

428
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What?

429
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You mean someone who knows the internet?

430
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I think that's different from what I feel.

431
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What?

432
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
My mother said that

433
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
making something that makes people's hearts grow

434
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
is the kind of person who makes hearts.

435
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You're a good person.

436
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What do you mean?

437
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What's the relationship between that person and the internet?

438
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I didn't know their faces.

439
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But I knew that they were close.

440
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Really?

441
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What do you mean?

442
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Because the person who made the picture of Hii-chan was always on the picture.

443
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That energy!

444
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That story!

445
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The one who made that aces...

446
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's about Natsume-kun.

447
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I think I was a total fool.

448
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I thought only I could understand you.

449
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I thought you and my friendship were both the best.

450
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You can feel that I'm too devoted to my previous life.

451
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm shaking

452
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What is this love for those people?

453
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
How about me, the little girl?

454
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm not gonna be a friend, kiss me, no no

455
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm not gonna be a chicken, I'm not gonna be a chicken

456
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm gonna say, I'm fine with just living

457
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm gonna be a little bit more reserved

458
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm not gonna be a friend, kiss me, no no

459
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm not gonna be a chicken, I'm not gonna be a chicken

460
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm not gonna be a chicken, I'm not gonna be a chicken

461
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm not gonna be a chicken, I'm not gonna be a chicken
