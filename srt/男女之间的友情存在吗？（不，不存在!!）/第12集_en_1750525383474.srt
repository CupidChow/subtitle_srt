1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If the one who is bound to the other is connected to the red thread of destiny,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
what color is the thread that is bound to the other?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Does that exist?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There must be a day.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Even though it should be connected strongly,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the thread that is bound to the other is connected to the other.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It must be a very bad, ugly color.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It must be the color that is like the color of my eyes.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I hate summer.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I get impatient.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I get worried about the men's gaze.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Even though the water supply department is on vacation,

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
it's hard to go to you.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Rion, wait a minute.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Bring the souvenir from the village to Makishima.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm on vacation.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Can you go with me?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to go out.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If you go out, you won't be able to relax.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, please.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, mother is really sweet to you.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No!

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now, I'm sure that you will live in Tokyo.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Even if you promise to win, it's the same.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Even if you are a perfect person with that ugly, ugly heart,

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
you can't even do anything.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's the best feeling.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, I have a high tension.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's rare.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I haven't been to play with a girl today.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not going to play with you.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You have to give me water, even though it's dangerous.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What's the need?

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh, the souvenir from Mr. Kureha.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll give it to you later.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What do you want to say?

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
My sister is going to take you.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That person seems to like Himari.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But Rin has a chance.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's not fair.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Are you still saying such a stupid thing?

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The one who took you out first is Himari.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There's no need to worry.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's true.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Shii-kun, what do you want?

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a difficult consultation.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I was making a fuss to make Rin win.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't want to waste it.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you can get rid of your sister,

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
you can look after Shii-kun.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm not going to let you accept my sister,

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
because I'm more than happy with you.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I know you like Himari,

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
because you came to me with a high school.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But you're just friends.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There's a lot more.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I got it.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I got it.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I didn't expect that evil girl to be like this.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't want to let her take over me.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But is that okay?

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's like she's going to win.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's fine.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't want to win.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You're just like a stubborn girl.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But I don't see Rin as a good person.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I didn't ask you to do that.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And now, I'm just giving it up for you.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm the one who wins.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, my.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I have to keep fighting with this mental monster for the rest of my life.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to be a little bit more sympathetic.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The End

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hey, what's up?

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's rare to have a phone call from you.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Do you want me to do it?

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I have to do the acting part of the work alone until graduation?

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
No, I have to do it until I have a shop.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can't even guarantee that I'll be able to come back.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Can I do it even if I get a shop?

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I can't live a boring life without you for 10 or 20 years.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Damn it!

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm just thinking about it.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's okay.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I believe in you.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm the one who's going to win.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm going to be a big fan of you.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're going to be a role model for Himari in the morning, right?

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm going to Tokyo from today.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What time is it?

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's noon.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Then you still have time.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Let's talk to me.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What?

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're going to Tokyo in the summer anyway, right?

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If that happens, I won't be able to talk to you.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm going to Tokyo?

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hey, didn't you say you'd go around so much in May?

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I was prepared to throw away the accel.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But it never changes.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The situation is different from when I was in May.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What's different?

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Himari is going to be a model for my accel.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I can't stop her.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's why I'm telling you that I'm stupid.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You!

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's not good to live for women.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's not a way to make flower accels just by showing off your shop.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You can't just be a creator and just live with a woman you like.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You can just live that kind of life.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But summer can't choose that.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If you throw away the accel, you can't go back to yourself.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're afraid that you won't live with the people who will make you down.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's clear.

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's not a love for Himari.

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's just that she's using it.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
She's been seeking for her best friend for the past two years.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
She's been seeking for love, so she's only been in love.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's just that she's in love with her own desire.

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
She has no will.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What do you know?

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What do you know?

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I like Himari.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Even if Himari doesn't help me,

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
even if Himari doesn't protect me,

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I choose to be with Himari!

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If you can see your true feelings,

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
there's only one thing you should do.

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're so calm.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, life that I've never had in my life

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
is pretty tough.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's right. I've always been...

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I just want Himari to be watching me.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hey, you!

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Are you okay?

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But that's all I wanted.

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm a coward.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I pretend to support my life,

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and I kiss you with my tail.

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But...

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I've never had anyone who I like

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
as much as I like being a coward.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I should have come at this rate.

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I should have come.

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No, I've already decided.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm not lucky.

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Ms. Kureha said that I'm the best at being cute.

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I was happy to have you say that.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I thought I couldn't do anything.

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I thought I could save you.

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But at the same time,

154
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I thought I was the most important thing to me.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I thought I couldn't get the days to spend with you anymore.

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
If that's the case,

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't need the cutest person in the world.

158
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't need anyone who calls me a fairy.

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
My friends, my family...

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But I wanted to be born into someone I love suddenly.

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Hii-chan.

162
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Enochi, you came to see me off!

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You're so kind.

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You're a kind person.

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I didn't come to see you off.

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I came to say my thanks.

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Hii-chan, thank you for losing to me.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You're mad at me for being so childish.

169
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're a friend of mine.

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You want to be a good girl after this?

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hii-chan's feelings are always the same.

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It doesn't matter if you're a little bit shy.

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Is it important to make your dreams come true?

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's important!

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You've worked hard until now.

176
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You know Enochi, right?

177
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I know that.

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You'll be a weapon for the future and the AXE shop.

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
There are many people who can't be a model.

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But you don't have to be so hard on me.

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If you're so mean, Enochi will be your weapon!

182
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's okay.

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll go.

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know if I can do it, but I'll do it if I can be for you and Hii-chan.

185
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But...

186
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Instead, give me a U-kun.

187
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll give you a U-kun until I open the AXE shop.

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But if I come back, please give me one.

189
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's okay, right?

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Promise me, Yubikiri.

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Why?

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's okay to be friends with U-kun.

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's okay.

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You can find someone like U-kun again if you have a U-kun.

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
No...

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No...

197
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I didn't find U-kun.

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I found U-kun.

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I didn't find U-kun again.

200
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Look.

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You're still too much.

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Hii-chan used to be like that.

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you have something you want, you can take it all.

204
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But the thing you want the most is...

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You can't tell me the truth, right?

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's a lie!

207
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No!

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't want to go to the truth!

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You're right.

210
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But it's my fault.

211
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I have to do something.

212
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I might not be able to be for U-kun even if I go to the truth.

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Well, I think so too.

214
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Hii-chan made a U-kun by herself.

215
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
She made a U-kun by herself.

216
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
She made everyone cry.

217
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
She made me cry!

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I've always thought about it,

219
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
but I'm sure you two are very particular about making a dream come true.

220
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What do you mean?

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's not that simple.

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
My mother started making sweets from her hobby.

223
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
She's been at the shop recently.

224
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Really?

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Even if I keep looking at the future,

226
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I get tired of walking around.

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's not all about the accessories shop.

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But for U-kun...

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I wonder if that's the case.

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Is it important for U-kun to open the accessories shop?

231
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Or...

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Himari!

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Huh?

234
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Himari!

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
U!

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Look.

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
U...

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't go!

239
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I can't choose whether it's a dream or love.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't know which one is right.

241
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But I know that you don't want to go to Tokyo on your own.

242
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But this is all I can do for U-kun.

243
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's not true.

244
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't want to be Himari.

245
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I have to do something for U-kun.

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I have to do something.

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I have to do something.

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's not what I want.

249
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I wanted to make Himari understand

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
my passion for him.

251
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's why I got so much attention on him.

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But I just wanted you to see my desire from the beginning.

253
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If you want to do it for me, don't sacrifice yourself.

254
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I can't enjoy being Himari by my side.

255
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
We're always friends!

256
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
U...

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I...

258
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's enough.

259
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't think that's a good chance for U-chan.

260
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You lost to him in the match, right?

261
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Kurohasa! I knew it!

262
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Please!

263
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Give me another chance!

264
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
No, no.

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I gave you a chance to be Hibari-kun at that time.

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I wonder if you forgot something important.

267
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Himari has money.

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
First, you have to make it for me.

269
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Then I'll pay for that money.

270
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Take it!

271
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
W-What's that?

272
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I got it.

273
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What's this?

274
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Shii-kun, it's too late.

275
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Huh?

276
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's too late.

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But I guess you're the perfect person to be able to make it in time.

278
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
H-Honey!

279
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Shinji, what's going on?

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You're right. I'll change Hibari-chan's fortune.

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
If I'm the only one, I'll be able to make a contract with Hibari-san and borrow money.

282
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You're not going to betray me, are you?

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Betraying me?

284
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You're not the one who refused to cooperate.

285
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Did you think that you wouldn't betray me?

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You're making a dull face.

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Now, I paid for the money.

288
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I have no doubt.

289
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I...

290
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Stop it!

291
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Well, um...

292
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You've done something bad.

293
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Hey, Kyurihake! What are you doing?

294
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Hey, I want to tell you something, so take me to the quiet place.

295
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll do it. I'll do it as I please.

296
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Then, I'll see you today. Bye-bye.

297
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Is this a piece of cake?

298
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Really?

299
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
If you say that you're not good enough, you'll pay for it.

300
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I bought you a high school life, and Hibari-chan and Rin-chan's.

301
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What?

302
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You won't be able to quit school. You won't be able to go to Tokyo.

303
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You won't be able to quit making a bad deal until graduation.

304
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll make a promise to you.

305
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Nakishima-kun, you're really bad at math.

306
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I hate boring things.

307
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
At that point, I can't tell you three's love story.

308
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's natural to pay for the money, right?

309
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Now, let's go out and play with each other.

310
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Of course, Hibari-chan's fault.

311
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What? Why do I have to be blamed?

312
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I think it's all thanks to someone.

313
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I can't tell Hibari-chan about this.

314
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What are you talking about?

315
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm not going to quit.

316
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You're a bad guy.

317
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I got help, but it's so expensive.

318
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It can't be helped.

319
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's actually really good.

320
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You're so sweet.

321
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll see you when you're getting along.

322
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I've seen you many times.

323
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You have a low management ability.

324
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If you have a shop, I'll take care of it.

325
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry, but I'm going to throw away the dream of having a shop.

326
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Why? You gave up on me.

327
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Sorry, I was wrong.

328
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't think you solved the fundamental problem.

329
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Did you say that?

330
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Did you put it in the box?

331
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The reason for this is that it was a distance from my client.

332
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But I did that too.

333
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I was the one who was sweet.

334
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I was the one who was trying to tell you that,

335
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
but I was the one who was telling you the truth.

336
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I thought about it and thought about it.

337
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I thought I shouldn't have been too obsessed with having a shop.

338
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You want to say that our dream is bad?

339
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
No, that's not it.

340
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The dream of having a shop is the dream that we in junior high school have.

341
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The small dream of a shop is the size of a dream itself.

342
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So if you are too obsessed with making small dreams,

343
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
you will lose many things.

344
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
The feeling of wanting to make a flower that will be planted when you were in elementary school.

345
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The goal of wanting to deliver the beauty of this flower to someone.

346
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I think I forgot about the first one that my sister gave me.

347
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I want to have a bigger dream.

348
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't want to have a shop.

349
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I might be greedy to have a shop, a dream, or love.

350
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But I will be able to make it happen.

351
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I won't lose to Saku-nee next time.

352
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I won't make Mr. Kureha stupid.

353
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I won't worry about Mr. Hibari.

354
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Even if Hibari doesn't sacrifice herself,

355
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I will stand up for myself.

356
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So...

357
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So I won't have a shop.

358
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Please keep looking at me as I am.

359
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're too shy.

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I...

361
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Wait, no!

362
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You idiot!

363
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Hibari is not good at being told straight.

364
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm not good at being told straight.

365
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Oh, right, Hibari.

366
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
A forgettable.

367
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
A ring of a friend.

368
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Is our relationship the same as before?

369
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
A ring of a friend in the world.

370
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, right.

371
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I was so shocked at that time.

372
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
What?

373
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
This two-leafed ring has something I haven't said yet.

374
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
This flower's seed is actually purple tulips.

375
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Is that what happened?

376
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
No, um...

377
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
We were friends.

378
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But now, we're not friends.

379
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Himari!

380
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You're late.

381
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Sorry.

382
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I was late to sleep after the convenience store.

383
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Thank you always, Himari.

384
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm sorry.

385
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I was late to sleep after the convenience store.

386
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I want a reward.

387
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Reward?

388
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yu, do you like me?

389
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Huh?

390
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
How much?

391
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The world's most?

392
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The world's most...

393
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Himari's most...

394
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
His most?

395
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Oh, no!

396
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I like you.

397
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Bu-bu-bu...

398
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Bu-bu-bu...

399
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Bu-he-he...

400
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What's that?

401
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Even if it's a Pooha's version of the song?

402
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's so quiet.

403
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The world's most cute Himari.

404
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Come on, come on.

405
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Don't show it to us from the morning.

406
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yu, Hii, good morning.

407
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Good morning, Eno.

408
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You two are trying to get us hungry again, aren't you?

409
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You're my food!

410
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Hii, I won't give you this if you say that.

411
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Here, Yu.

412
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Oh, a boost!

413
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Oh!

414
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Oh, that's bad!

415
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
There's something I think.

416
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm sure we'll always be the same.

417
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
We don't know each other's hearts, but we don't know each other.

418
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
We know that we have to say it, but we're tied to a strange pride.

419
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But we'll keep moving forward.

420
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Our summer in the box is not over yet.
