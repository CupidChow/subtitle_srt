1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I used to like beautiful things.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I used to like the light of the rain,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the youthful movie about friendship and love.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But I never thought that I would be able to make such a thing.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I want to use something I grew up with when I own my own shop.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Because flower axes are my passion.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, no!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yu, let's have lunch.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, Yu, what's the hurry?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, you must have been busy wanting to see me.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You must have been too excited about me.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How about me?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not going to kiss you because I'm going to say it.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm crying with a white flower.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I look at you, look at you,

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and I realize that I have a good relationship with you.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I realized that I was too conscious.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm going to break it.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm nervous to call you by your name.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm so nervous that I can't get over you.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I've never seen you before.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can't believe you're crying.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What's your love for me?

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How about me?

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not going to kiss you because I'm going to say it.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm going to say it's okay to live a simple answer.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to be a little more relaxed.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm not going to kiss you because I'm going to say it.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm not going to be a little more relaxed.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's Eat

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Um...

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going to eat something different today.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes, please.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm too much.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm the cutest girl in the world, so I'm not going to eat it.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's eat it.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I admit that I'm cute.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,560
Hey, Himari!

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
Let's go this way sometimes.

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,360
Well, are you still hanging out with him?

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,860
It's boring to play with such a good guy.

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,760
Even if you say that, I have a very good chance of winning.

43
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,260
Of course, I don't have one.

44
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,760
I'm going home to get a karaoke.

45
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,000
It's been a long time since I've been to Himari...

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,240
I want to sing in the loudest volume for the first time in a long time, but I wonder if it's really okay.

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,760
I don't have a message for you when you send me yesterday.

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
Hey, let's go.

49
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,260
Hey, Himari!

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, you know, I've been a little worried lately.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're avoiding me, aren't you?

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
W-What do you mean?

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, wait, I got it!

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why? What did I do?

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No, Himari didn't do anything.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Then why?

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well...

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Himari, there's a reason why people are called to write.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What's that?

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, I'll just...

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're really kind.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You don't have to worry about other people's words that you don't even know their names.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Did you know that I've been told by other men that I'm a little worried?

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I've been told that a lot lately, too.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So, stop being a fool with me.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're saying that I don't have to be a fool with Himari?

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't you have to worry about that?

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't think I should.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Himari has a relationship with Himari.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't like him thinking about me.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Look at this.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
From the man you mentioned.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He's been like this for a month.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And this is his girlfriend.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You invited him, didn't you?

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Or you said you'd call him right away.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Wow, that's tough.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Love is scary.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's like you're already being surrounded by something.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Thank you for the food.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Anyway, what I want to say is that...

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You may think that love is good or beautiful for a rich person.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But it's not enough to say that you're beautiful.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I think that you're more precious than beautiful.

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I love you in pure water.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You never let me down.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So I'm your best friend.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You can be my best friend.

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't ever fall in love with me.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Of course.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Because I'm the best friend of Himari.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What's that?

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I told you.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's a friend of Himari.

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Himari!

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Seriously, you're the best!

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Please, get rid of her!

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No way!

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hey, wait!

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How about this?

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you get caught by a man, you'll say,

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm in a relationship with you.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:11,340
You're trying to get me into the

104
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,340
future.

105
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,340
Let's go back to the classroom.

106
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,340
Here, let's go!

107
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,340
And then, two years later,

108
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,340
the second year of high school.

109
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,340
I'm so confused.

110
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
I fell in love with Himari.

111
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,340
Himari said,

112
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,340
he quit going to Tokyo.

113
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,340
And I was the most important person to him.

114
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,340
I was so confused that I made a mistake.

115
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,340
Anyway, I'm a soldier.

116
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,340
Hey, you!

117
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,340
Good morning!

118
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,340
Hey, Himari.

119
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
Good morning.

120
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,340
That smile is so cute!

121
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,340
Did you eat something bad?

122
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,340
You're so mean.

123
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,340
You're the most handsome smile.

124
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,340
You look more like a normal person

125
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,340
than a handsome person.

126
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,340
How much?

127
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,340
Huh? The apple yesterday?

128
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,340
Then, this one.

129
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,340
I'm so bad at calling you to school.

130
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,340
You're right.

131
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,340
Shall we change the new belt?

132
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,340
No, this is fine.

133
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,340
This is the first time you've given me a new accent.

134
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,340
I-I see.

135
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,340
I'm so angry!

136
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
I'm so cute and I love you!

137
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,340
I'm so embarrassed.

138
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,340
I'm so embarrassed.

139
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,340
I'm so glad I became a soldier.

140
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,340
But I'm a little relieved.

141
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,340
I thought you said you didn't need a ring.

142
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,340
You think I said I didn't need this ring?

143
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,340
Stop it!

144
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,340
You think you like me too much?

145
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,340
If you like me so much, you'll really date me?

146
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,340
Shut up!

147
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,340
Don't underestimate the human mentality of a person who has decided to go to school.

148
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,340
Hey, Himari.

149
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,340
I noticed, but I have only Himari.

150
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,340
So if you like Himari, you can date me.

151
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,340
Okay, good.

152
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,340
The ending is...

153
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,340
What the hell? Did you get scared?

154
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,340
Did you get scared?

155
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,340
Huh?

156
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
Yeah.

157
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,340
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,340
I was too much.

159
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,340
It's been a hundred years since you've been so fast to get Himari.

160
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,340
Ayu, go ahead.

161
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,340
Ayu is here.

162
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,340
You're so cute.

163
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,340
You're so famous.

164
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,340
I was so nervous that I was really nervous.

165
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,340
Thanks to you, I was able to get him out of my way.

166
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,340
Besides, I was worried about him.

167
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,340
Oh, there he is.

168
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,340
Nazume, come to the hospital for a while.

169
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,340
What?

170
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,340
The Central Prosecutor's Office has been released as a witness?

171
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,340
Hey, you're so loud.

172
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:18,340
I think it was written as a witness, but I couldn't sleep.

173
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,340
So I was sleeping while the exam was going on.

174
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,340
Why did you do that?

175
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,340
I was focused on making the medicine.

176
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,340
Oh, so?

177
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,340
I heard you're going to do a follow-up for Sunday this week.

178
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,340
If you cross the pre-doctorate and the high-ranking line, you'll do something for me.

179
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,340
Sunday is still a day, so I'll do something.

180
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,340
I'll cooperate with the Ministry of Justice.

181
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,340
Sorry, I'll help you.

182
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,340
Hey, Ayu, can I ask you one more thing?

183
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
What?

184
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,340
Ayu is out of his mind.

185
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,340
Oh, isn't that great?

186
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,340
He's already been looking at his face on social media.

187
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,340
Isn't that too calm?

188
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,340
It's not like he's not bad at all.

189
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
He is!

190
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,340
If he finds out that you can make such a cute medicine,

191
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,340
he might be able to win!

192
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,340
What are you saying?

193
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,340
There are things like the time when we were in the last blood.

194
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,340
If he asks me to do a follow-up, I'll tell him.

195
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,340
I wonder if he won't stop doing it.

196
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,340
Himari, I'll repeat it, but I'll tell you again.

197
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,340
Huh?

198
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,340
Yes.

199
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,340
There's no other Himari who can give this ring.

200
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,340
Himari is the only model who can give it to me.

201
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,340
Ayu, you're really...

202
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,340
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,340
Ouch! Why did you hit me?

204
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,340
I dropped something weird!

205
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,340
Ayu said something stinky!

206
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,340
That's why I didn't pull you out.

207
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,340
What? That's because...

208
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
Huh?

209
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,340
Enomoto, why?

210
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,340
I'm taking a break.

211
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,340
Oh, take a break!

212
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,340
When will you start calling me?

213
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:26,340
When he said he would be crying because he had Yu with him.

214
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,340
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,340
Y-Yu, did something happen to Enochitou?

216
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,340
That's what happened to Himari. He's crying a lot.

217
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,340
There were a lot of things going on.

218
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,340
I can't say that he's fighting with Himari.

219
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,340
To be honest, it's more difficult to see than to be honest.

220
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,340
I have a lot of eyes, but...

221
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,340
I'll keep fighting as a friend of Yu.

222
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,340
I'll take my happy end.

223
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,340
I'll have to take the outside out.

224
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,340
You're faster than you thought.

225
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,340
I'll tell you why I'm being watched by Yu.

226
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,340
It's decided.

227
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,340
Everything is for your victory.

228
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,340
I'll kill you!

229
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,340
Sorry, but Yu is my best friend.

230
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,340
I like Enochitou, but I can't let him get away with it.

231
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,340
You don't have much time.

232
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,340
If you're so desperate, you'll feel your love.

233
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,340
Unfortunately, I won't be like you.

234
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,340
Yu chose me.

235
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,340
And I...

236
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,340
Be clear.

237
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:45,340
If you really wanted summer, you should have taken summer to Tokyo.

238
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,340
Before the summer was ready to leave everything,

239
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,340
before the summer was ready to leave everything,

240
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,340
you should have decided the game.

241
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,340
I don't understand the meaning.

242
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,340
I understand the meaning.

243
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,340
But for us, it's not a good idea to be a hero.

244
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,340
Episode 3

245
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,340
Hey, what do you do specifically for the study of the water deer?

246
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,340
I've sent a message to Onii-chan, so I think it'll be fine if I leave it to you.

247
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,340
It's been a year since Yu came to my house.

248
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,340
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

249
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,340
That sauce-pan that Himari's grandpa prepared...

250
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,340
I was so embarrassed to death.

251
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,340
By the way, grandpa is in the hospital,

252
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,340
and his mother has been with him for a long time.

253
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,340
So, it's been a long time since Yu came to my house.

254
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,340
That's a good idea.

255
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,340
Hibari is here, right?

256
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,340
I have to say hi.

257
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,340
Onii-chan isn't here either.

258
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,340
What?

259
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,340
She told me to teach her.

260
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,340
Onii-chan sent me the points from the previous reference book.

261
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,340
I just teach her while watching it.

262
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,340
Onii-chan is busy with work, so she's busy.

263
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,340
Oh, really?

264
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,340
Huh? Are you really going to leave Himari alone?

265
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,340
Yu-kun, welcome to my house!

266
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,340
H-H-Himari!

267
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,340
Now, let's do it.

268
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,340
So, Hibari-san, what about work?

269
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,340
Don't worry.

270
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,340
I've thrown the party around today.

271
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,340
Throw it around?

272
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,340
Yu-kun.

273
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,340
Yes.

274
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,340
I've always been the same as Hibari.

275
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,340
Yu-kun is the most shining moment of the time when you're doing the acce.

276
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:57,340
I believe that your work will someday make this town's name reach the world.

277
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,340
I-I'm so proud of you.

278
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,340
That's why I'm not willing to let anyone judge it!

279
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,340
Don't you think that's the least of the test studies?

280
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,340
But, I can't help but say that I'm a student.

281
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,340
Of course, there's a way to overcome that.

282
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,340
Huh?

283
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,340
This machine will absorb all the power of the high school's three-year-old school.

284
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,340
If that's the case, we don't need any future test studies!

285
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,340
It's not a dream to let Yu-kun pass the highest school in Japan!

286
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,340
H-Himari!

287
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,340
W-Wait, you're going to do it too?

288
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,340
If Onii-chan is still in the switch, she'll be in the way.

289
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,340
Do your best, Yu!

290
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,340
Now, let's study with Onii-chan.

291
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,340
Y-You're welcome.

292
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,340
Yu, I'm taking a bath, so hurry up and get in.

293
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,340
I'm sorry, Onii-chan.

294
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:58,340
I've been busy with work lately, and I'm stressed out, so I have to reward you sometimes.

295
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,340
No, I was originally going to get you to come with me to study.

296
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,340
What? You want me to go?

297
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,340
Hahahaha!

298
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,340
Yu-kata girl.

299
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,340
If I can get my aces together, I'll be in trouble.

300
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,340
No, you're too much.

301
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,340
Oh, well, I mean, if I can get my aces together with Yu-kata, which one would it be?

302
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,340
I'm not saying you can't see me.

303
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,340
Stop it!

304
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,340
B.

305
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,340
Wow, it's like a hot spring hotel!

306
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,340
I've been coming to play with you for a while, but I've never been able to stop and take a bath.

307
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,340
I'm going to come tomorrow anyway, so I'll put the clothes in the drawer.

308
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,340
I'll ask the president to give me the laundry.

309
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,340
Really? Thank you.

310
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,340
Which one is the one I used?

311
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,340
No, no, what are you thinking about? Am I stupid?

312
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Yu, I'll open it for you.

313
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,340
Yaaaaaah!

314
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,340
You're a girl, Kim.

315
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,340
Shut up! I don't have the experience of seeing a girl with a naked face!

316
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,340
I mean, why did you open it?

317
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,340
Yu-san, you've worked hard today.

318
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,340
Should I throw you a backpump on Saturday?

319
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,340
What are you talking about?

320
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:18,340
I couldn't look at you, so I thought I'd give you a hug.

321
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,340
You can't be a man and woman.

322
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,340
We're men, but we're friends.

323
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,340
Or maybe Yu is conscious of me as a doctor.

324
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,340
It's the same as usual.

325
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,340
I can't believe I have that.

326
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,340
Then, do it.

327
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,340
I-I got it.

328
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,340
Then I'll take it off too.

329
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,340
It's embarrassing, so turn around.

330
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,340
No, I'll just throw it back.

331
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,340
If you don't want to take it off, you don't have to.

332
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,340
No, no, that's not it!

333
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,340
Himari, you're so mean to me.

334
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,340
Yu, close your eyes.

335
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,340
Yes, I am.

336
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,340
No, you're not!

337
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,340
You always come to me with a knife in the science room.

338
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,340
No, I can't do it anymore.

339
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,340
I'll throw you a backpump.

340
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,340
It's Himari!

341
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,340
No way, it's really Himari's right to say that.

342
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,340
Himari, you're too mean.

343
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,340
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:33,340
But, are you two playing with each other like this since you were kids?

345
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,340
No, I'm just saying stop it.

346
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,340
Of course, there's no mistake.

347
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,340
I don't have the right to talk to my best friend.

348
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,340
Anyway, I'm relieved that you and Himari got to be together.

349
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,340
What?

350
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,340
Of course, I know.

351
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,340
I'm just saying.

352
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,340
Your words are so convincing.

353
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,340
I was worried that you'd be so rude to me and I was worried that you'd be apologised.

354
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,340
You're being so sweet.

355
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,340
What do you mean by apologising to Himari?

356
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,340
You know, I said that you and Himari were apologising.

357
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,340
So, you said you and Himari got to be together.

358
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:18,340
Well, I did get to be together, but I didn't do anything bad to Himari.

359
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,340
I'm the one who apologised. I'm the one who's sorry.

360
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,340
Huh?

361
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,340
I see, you didn't apologize.

362
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,340
Himari...

363
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,340
Can you tell me that story in detail?

364
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,340
Sorry, I feel like I'm being too rude to Himari.

365
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,340
I was so surprised! I was so surprised!

366
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,340
I'm glad that you came, but if I had known...

367
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,340
You and Himari are going to take a bath together.

368
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,340
I'm so full of calories.

369
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,340
But this isn't bad.

370
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,340
If you react, you'll feel like you're in a strange relationship.

371
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,340
You'll feel good and feel good.

372
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,340
I'm actually a witch.

373
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,340
Huh?

374
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,340
Maybe you... Oh no, oh no, oh no!

375
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,340
You're going to come to my wife's house!

376
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,340
Maybe that's what you're saying!

377
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,340
If this goes on, I'll be ready to make a decision!

378
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,340
Please!

379
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,340
It seems that it's worse to be in a strange relationship with you.

380
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,340
Himari, can you talk to him?

381
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:32,340
Yu-kun, I'm going to study from today, but basically, I have a habit.

382
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,340
It seems that I was drinking a lot at the point yesterday,

383
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,340
and I'm going to repeat the test before I go to the office.

384
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,340
Okay?

385
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,340
Yes, thank you.

386
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,340
Um, by the way...

387
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,340
That's right.

388
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,340
The Civil Affairs Department is in charge of the study efficiency.

389
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,340
I like the relaxation item I love.

390
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,340
Y-Yes.

391
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,340
This is a dog-like technique that can be used to make a smile.

392
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,340
See you again tonight.

393
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,340
Thank you very much.

394
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,340
Is Himari okay?

395
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,340
I'm so tired of my grandpa's pressure, so I'm getting tired.

396
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,340
Yu-kun.

397
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,340
Good morning.

398
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,340
E-Enomoto-san, good morning.

399
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,340
E-Enochi, good morning.

400
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
What's that? Is it a modern ninja?

401
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,340
Yu-kun, didn't you just come out of the car with Hi-chan?

402
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,340
H-He sent it to Himari-san.

403
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,340
I got it.

404
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,340
He stopped at Himari's house yesterday...

405
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,340
He stopped at Hi-chan's house?

406
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,340
No, no, no.

407
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,340
He never said that.

408
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,340
He's been studying with Himari-san for a long time.

409
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,340
Why are you studying?

410
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,340
I have a recommendation for a day.

411
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,340
I can't take it unless I take it.

412
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,340
Then I'll go too.

413
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,340
I'll go too!

414
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,340
I'm so tired of my grandpa's pressure, so I'm getting tired.

415
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,340
Yu-kun, did you just come out of the car with Hi-chan?

416
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,340
No, no, no.

417
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,340
I'm so tired of my grandpa's pressure, so I'm getting tired.

418
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,340
Yu-kun, did you just come out of the car with Hi-chan?

419
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,340
No, no, no.

420
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,340
I'm so tired of my grandpa's pressure, so I'm getting tired.

421
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,340
Yu-kun, did you just come out of the car with Hi-chan?

422
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,340
No, no, no.

423
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,340
I'm so tired of my grandpa's pressure, so I'm getting tired.

424
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,340
I don't care if you're angry or not.

425
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,340
I'm not in love, I'm not in love.

426
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:05,340
I want to be in your light.

427
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,340
I want to be in your light.

428
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,340
I'm so tired of my grandpa's pressure, so I'm getting tired.

429
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,340
I want to be in your light.

430
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:21,340
I want to be in your light.

431
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,340
I want to be in your light.

432
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:40,340
