U ASMR

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,340
Good day.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,860
We found a strong Chinese character!

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:06,620
Ouch!

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,180
We managed to find the soap operaist's Rings.

00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,180
Synthesizer

00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Kiss me, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,000
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's do it!

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What's a case from the U?

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What's a trick?

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What's a trick?

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What's a trick?

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hey, if it's a trick, then I'm in trouble.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hey!

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I was too passionate to make an accessory with the act of being chased.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm glad Enomoto-san joined me.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I have to move forward as an accessory creator.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I want to have a sense of resistance to the box that my sister said before.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Y-Yeah!

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Good morning!

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Good morning.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
As expected of a war model.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sure you can see my fetish zoom well.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But...

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's right, Himari.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Did you see the dog's high jump video I sent you?

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, I saw it.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's summer clothes from today.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Shut up.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I haven't forgotten that you gave me a public appearance before the classmate last year.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's okay.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Everyone has one or two perverted personalities that they can't say.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I also like Yu's eyes.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're saying you're showing off to everyone?

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What if it's a weird thing again?

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What's weird?

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He's trying to make me say it on the top of his mind.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But I'm different now.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What kind of a husband is it?

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's something you can see that you're in a relationship with me.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Don't you really think it's good to be in a relationship with me?

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What?

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I feel like I can't control my emotions through my hateful thoughts.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Then, are you really going to date me?

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What? The classroom is here!

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I remember this pattern.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Ouch!

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hey, stop being a perverted personality!

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Shut up!

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yu is just a perverted bastard!

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He's going to put himself in the spotlight and get a slap!

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's hard to deny it.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What are you going to do today?

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Enomoto said that the school is on vacation.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I wonder if it's okay to have a meeting with three people.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yu, Kei.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Wow, you're so energetic.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Enomoto, you look good in summer clothes.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh, thank you.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh, no!

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're so different from the reaction of the cute girl who was in front of the school.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I feel like I'm being crushed.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Um, did you see the message I sent you?

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's a meeting, right? It's okay.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So what's the problem?

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I wonder what's going to happen to the current material.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The preserved flower will change color as time goes by.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I see.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Then you have to give me a call and look at it quickly.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes, you have to choose the material and shoot it and upload it on the net.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I understand.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The time is the model.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I wonder if it was dark because it seemed to be re-enacted.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I remember the smell of the mist.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh, there it is.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Natsume.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Himari, you too, Yaho.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Oh, Enomoto.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh, no.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's so high that it's only here.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What?

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's not a big deal.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What's wrong with the two of you?

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hey, I was going to make the ax I promised you before.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
At that time?

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If you're in here, you can take any of them.

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Huh? Aren't you lonely?

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I like the order maid.

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh, I knew it.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Can you two just ask for a favor for now?

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There's a possibility that it will be a bad order, and I have to consider the budget.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm making the ax instead of anything.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm doing it with Yu's will.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Sorry, sorry.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I thought it was the same as always.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
No, Mao is a year away from his next month.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I thought I wanted a pair of axes, but there's no point in it.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So you want the same concept for women and men?

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, yes.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Interesting.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's good to be able to approach with a pair of axes.

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yu, you're going to be a good example.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I did it!

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm tired.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yu, you're too weak to be a mentor.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You have to be involved with the user in a more aggressive way.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Those two are too aggressive.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The more mature customers are.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
No, no.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If Yu looks like that, he'll be a little more aggressive.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Really?

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Then, let's consider the future of those two and take care of this one.

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay?

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is the ax I'm making, but I'm going to make it three weeks.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Three weeks?

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, no.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh, this is it.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The word flower is a mature, mature, and mature spirit.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Why is it flowered?

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Isn't it a little bit mature?

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
See, when I was hearing that couple,

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I thought it would be better to take care of the actual part

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
rather than to appeal to the power of love.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Three weeks are a flower to wish for health.

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If we wish for a long relationship,

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I think it's better to feel a little calmer.

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It might be too smelly and you might laugh.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What are you talking about?

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's not a customer's body,

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
but it's natural for us to respect what the creator wants to do.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Thank you.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What about the price?

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I see.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Is there a problem?

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The current price setting is high for high school students.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The customers who bought it so far have no 10% of the total.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The sales are already in the middle of SNS.

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's why it wasn't so bad at our high school.

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But there are some things that I want to do.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It might be a little bit too much,

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and it might be a little bit too much.

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Did you have any problems with the eye?

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Wait, maybe you're going to get it!

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What are you talking about?

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
A-A-A-Oh...

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Sorry, I got stuck in the same sense as Himari!

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's a proof that he's been chasing you!

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You're so forward.

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's a great thing that you're coming from the other side.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's right.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll try my best to make sure that the user gets involved in the future

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and that you can get involved in the future.

158
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Maybe it's because of the reason why you're coming from the other side.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I didn't know about the third week, but it's a good feeling!

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's right. It's going to suit Mao.

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Really?

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Excuse me.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't know the accent.

164
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Senpai, I think it suits you because you have a good sense of balance.

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think you should be able to open your chest rather than showing it to the public.

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I see.

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Actually, I thought it would be a bit embarrassing to have an accent with a pair.

168
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But she said that her accent was really good last year.

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
She also listened to our conversation.

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I knew it.

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I just thought it would be beautiful to think about people's feelings.

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I heard that you can make your own accessories here.

173
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I heard it in the morning.

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I recommend it because it makes you like what you like.

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I think it's a good idea to have a conversation with you.

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Wow, you already have five of them today.

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's amazing.

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It seems that Mao Pi and the others are sending them.

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're really good at talking.

180
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's a pair accent, but I think it's a good idea to have an accent with a pair.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Actually, I heard it from a person from the aquarium department.

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Really?

183
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I have to make sure that I don't waste time.

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You were the image of Yamato Nadeshiko, right?

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Thank you very much.

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Now that we've talked, we can have a conversation.

187
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What?

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I heard that you will definitely make a lot of love with your accent.

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What?

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I knew it.

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I've heard too much about your special product.

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Unlike what I've heard so far, this time it's a perfect order made.

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I think it would be nice if we could have one of them in the world even if the price is high.

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And those two are the best in the world.

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Don't hesitate.

197
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We know the good of your accent.

198
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We will be the best in the world.

199
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Leave it to me.

200
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
At first, it was an original accent, but now it's an order accent in the world.

201
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Now it's an accent that will definitely make love.

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, you're not going to stop being an accent?

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm so happy to hear that.

204
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm grateful that you're the one who's been giving me the best of your accent.

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Anyway, I have to do it.

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Okay.

207
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yu-yu, how are you?

208
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The environment that Hibari-san prepared was so wonderful.

209
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm sorry for bothering you even though you don't have time.

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, it might be a customer, but the science room is empty.

211
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I can't stand being disturbed by the clothes at home.

214
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, I guess I'll have to let you have it for a while.

215
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If you take a break, I'll wake you up when you come later.

216
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What's that?

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's decided on my cute knee pillow.

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's really a good idea to say that it's a gift.

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
No, it's just that it's cute, so it's a gift.

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Well, it's fine.

221
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's not like I can see anyone.

222
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I thought I wouldn't be able to see their faces if it was Enochi.

223
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You didn't think so?

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's not true!

225
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hibari-san's knee pillow is really the best!

226
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Wow, isn't Makishima-kun's jirai place a bit too much?

227
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I think it's better to stop him.

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's too hard.

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let me sleep.

230
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Hibari-san, can I ask you something?

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What?

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You said that when you made Enomoto-san's jirai.

233
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You wanted a jirai with a special love.

234
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Don't you remember embarrassing things?

235
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You felt my love for you?

236
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm happy.

237
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Well, what about you?

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You said that you had a bad eye from Makishima's root when you were in middle school.

239
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You don't like romance, do you?

240
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't like it.

241
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Then why did you say you wanted a love?

242
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That time, you were cute because you were Enochi.

243
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I see.

244
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I was a little upset that I could make another man I like.

245
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I thought I wouldn't be interested in him even if I could make him my boyfriend.

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But now, I want you to be by my side forever because you're my best friend.

247
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Hibari is kind, so I'll do that if I wish.

248
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But I don't want to be a man who can be there.

249
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So I want to be Hibari and Taito.

250
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm sure I'm always focused on making a bad man.

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You've changed a lot.

252
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I used to think that I'd be okay if I was satisfied with myself, but now, I'm burning.

253
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm more satisfied with what I have now.

254
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But at the same time, I'm more satisfied with myself.

255
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But I'm not satisfied with myself anymore.

256
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm not satisfied with myself anymore.

257
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm more satisfied with myself.

258
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm more satisfied with myself now.

259
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But at the same time, I'm scared.

260
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm scared that I might leave myself somewhere again.

261
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I hate love.

262
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Because of the men I love,

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm less able to have time with you.

264
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I really hate it.

265
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't need a lover.

266
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Because, as long as I have this friend ring,

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
you'll always be with me.

268
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But, like before,

269
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
if you ask me if I want to go back to the time when I said I was a friend from the bottom of my heart,

270
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm sure that's my brain.

271
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Because I didn't realize that I liked you.

272
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I didn't feel any more happiness than now.

273
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
My life is probably the most fun now.

274
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's not a lie, really.

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Well, I'm going to make two products today.

276
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm going to hand them over to the person who can deliver them from now on.

277
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If there's someone who's attracted to the beautiful girls,

278
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
it's definitely summer.

279
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What's wrong, Makishima?

280
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I don't want to do that.

281
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Rin, you're used to being so shy.

282
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's a good idea to take it off when you're a kid.

283
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh, really?

284
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No, you don't have to look at that.

285
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Rin, you have a surprise.

286
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I was looking forward to seeing you and Himari.

287
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Makishima, you're the only one who can't be loved by your friends

288
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
when you're in love with someone else.

289
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Well, Natsuya, why don't you talk to me about the future of the U-sports?

290
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Is it possible to make that guy talk to you?

291
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
No, it's just a matter of the two of us.

292
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You can make a decision at the same distance from any student

293
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
who's in the same class.

294
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Since it's a world-class baseball,

295
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
it's only possible to move 100% of the players.

296
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That's why I chose those two and made them watch the U-sports.

297
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What do you mean?

298
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
100% of the players will sometimes become 100% of the players' evil.

299
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I don't know what you mean, but I wanted to talk to Natsuya

300
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
to get him to know me first.

301
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
If things go as planned,

302
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
it'll be a little bit more difficult for him to be mentally stable.

303
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What? What's that for?

304
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Of course it's for Rin-chan.

305
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't know much about it,

306
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
but why would you put it on Enomota-san?

307
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I have a debt to Rin-chan.

308
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't think I'll be able to make it until the first time I'm in love with her.

309
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's a huge debt.

310
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What did Makishima want?

311
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I lost it and I'm starting to think about it.

312
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You made this, didn't you?

313
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes.

314
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
A school student from a girl's school

315
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
bought this accessory and entered the school.

316
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
A school?

317
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The girl was put on the accessory and was taken by a high-ranking salary.

318
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No, it's not like that.

319
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
She asked for the other person's help and made it,

320
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and the salary was also transferred to the front.

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The other person was also on the floor.

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Do you have any proof of that?

323
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh...

324
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I only got my talent, my labor and my salary,

325
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
but I have no chance of getting it.

326
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I see. I'll ask the dog.

327
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
By the way, have you been taking the sales of the school students?

328
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Our students are working as a company for our education.

329
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
They are also doing a legal process,

330
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and my sister is managing it.

331
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh, your sister was Sakura in the summer.

332
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Your white dress was also troublesome,

333
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
but Sakura was too smart and troublesome.

334
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'll talk to the other teachers,

335
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
but even if you decide that you have no problem with your activities,

336
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't think the guardian who doesn't know the situation thinks so.

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'll see the fact that my child was forced to buy a bad student with a high salary.

338
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Do you understand?

339
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes.

340
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Don't make a bad student, I want to tell you,

341
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
but please change the sales for a while.

342
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What I'm asking you now is to wait for me.

343
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What? That's strange!

344
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It looks like the future will be a claimer.

345
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Well, but I think Mr. Sasaki took it out.

346
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm glad I lived at this level for now.

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But this is the way to go.

348
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's over there.

349
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Oh, no, no, no.

350
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm really sorry for being so useless.

351
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I trusted you because you said it.

352
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Oh, my God.

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I said I'd be a good student,

354
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
so I bought a high-end money.

355
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Can't I get a return?

356
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm kidding.

357
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm not going to say that I was rejected.

358
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's a good business to think about.

359
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The one who made me a senior and the one who made me a rumor...

360
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The one who made this!

361
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Oh?

362
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Everyone should die!

363
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The same club senior said he liked her.

364
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That senior liked a girl like Yama and Nadechiko,

365
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
so I thought of that image.

366
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I thought that expression was good to look young and innocent

367
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
when I talk to people I like.

368
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Hey!

369
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You made me a senior and the one who made me a rumor!

370
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Why are you doing this?

371
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Let me go!

372
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, no.

373
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I think the feeling of being a doctor is beautiful.

374
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I was close to the love of Himali and wanted to go further up.

375
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It means that beauty is not limited to being cute.

376
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yu-kun...

377
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's right.

378
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The beautiful feeling of thinking of the person you like...

379
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm sure that it's not limited to being cute.

380
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That's why I thought that my true self is the least.

381
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu.

382
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I love you!

383
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
When the affection you put in on me

384
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and the pain you put in on me

385
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm afraid that I'll break if I have to shake it.

386
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm so close to you.

387
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm a little jealous.

388
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't like the scent of a evening moon.

389
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I can't get back to the moment I saw you

390
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Please tell me, God

391
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Dear my soulmate, I'm gonna show you my brilliance

392
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm not in love with you, not in love

393
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I want to be your light

394
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I want to be your light

395
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I want to be your light

396
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
My eyes on you

397
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
My eyes on you

398
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
My eyes on you

399
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
My eyes on you
