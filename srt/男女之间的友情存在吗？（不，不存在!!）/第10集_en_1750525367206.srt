1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm a little nervous, but I'm going to do my best.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to do my best.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to do my best.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to do my best.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to do my best.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to do my best.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm going to do my best.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to do my best.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to do my best.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to do my best.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to do my best.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to do my best.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to do my best.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to do my best.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to do my best.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to do my best.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm going to do my best.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to do my best.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm going to do my best.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The feeling of summer.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What do you mean?

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I think I'm going to do something weird.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's not what I'm saying.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If Mr. Kureha controls, he'll lose.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I should be in Tokyo, so he pays the debt.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I've never lied to you before.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is your fault.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You can't be a dog.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're a dog!

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But he's really a girl who tries to make you a hero.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll have to pull you out of front of your mother this time.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Kureha is a type that doesn't choose a person for her goal.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
She's using her best to get her feelings back.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What do you mean?

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
She's the type to make her stupid and work hard to get back at her.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're the opposite.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll do my best to cheer for her.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's why I think you're a bit of a pushover.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't know which is right.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll be the one to run away.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't think Kureha can be a loser,

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
but she'll be able to get the flower shop in front of her

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and crush it with her power and money.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I can't laugh.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yu, don't worry.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Even if you lose this game, you can make Himari out of it

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and make the shop with me.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I told you that it's a battle that you can't lose.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Anyway, you can always make the best as usual.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll help you with your actions.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll take Himari with me if I have to win.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's right. I don't have time to focus.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I've been being too sweet all this time.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I've been accepted by strangers.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I might be able to get out of the box that you said.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh, there it is!

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yu!

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Now, let's go find it with the summer memories.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Wow, it's like a youthful moment.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm a little embarrassed, too.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's summer vacation, after all.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm a youthful Madoka now.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No, no, think about it.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's a game that you can win.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yu will be fine from the beginning.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If you become a loser, you'll have a tragedy.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
A tragedy?

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll go to the office and quit immediately.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're going to get angry at Yu for that.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Besides, you'll be a high school student.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Is there a problem? You'll be a loser forever, right?

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That's what you said.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Stop being so clumsy.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's go to the office together.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're clumsy?

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What?

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No, it's like...

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
marriage.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't remember that.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You'll only look at me.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Himari, I'm going to win against you.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You got one of them!

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Himari!

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yu hasn't been picking up lately, so let him be more clumsy.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What kind of request is that?

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yu, Hii.

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Listen, Nocchi.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yu is cold.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
She's been nagging.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You said something weird, didn't you?

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can't let the overwhelming trust in Himari be lost.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yu, let's go find him in the summer.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
See you later, Jone.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why don't you be more careful with the food?

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You're going to win the tournament, aren't you?

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can't see you.

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There's a person's rhythm.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm just protecting my rhythm.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I see. You're interested.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But the rhythm seems to be fully influenced by you.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you call for help, you're rejected.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hey, perfect man.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're being chased by Kureha's hand, aren't you?

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
For example, you're being filmed?

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Well, I heard that you're offering a fun vacation.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You're here all the way here.

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're planning to get a visa, but I don't want to.

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm in the summer, but I'm more interested in you.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't plan to get a visa.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I wish Yu could make a vacation with all his might.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Now, focus on tennis and think about what you want to do.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So, do you have any memories of the summer?

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Not at all.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a well-known theme, so it's too free.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can't do anything with client this time.

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Then, the situation is better than the flowers, right?

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can take a summer-like scenery and put flowers on it later.

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So, the opposite of what Enomoto-san did when he was a model.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But you're not good at that.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Then, let's think about summer-like things in my life.

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Hiji, you're definitely going to be a bad guy.

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
How? I'm a girl student.

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I think you're a good guy.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Then, go and try something.

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yu Guren.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The way back from the club.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I was with my childhood friend, Kimi, and we were at home.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Something's been going on.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The rain suddenly stopped.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The two of us, who were having a sweet talk with each other,

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
we were her schoolmates.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Schoolmates?

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I can't help it.

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I was so scared of the tiger.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes, Kya-kka!

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The gold knight of Ero-neta!

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I guess we should stop aiming for Hii-chan's best.

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're so stubborn.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What about that kind of energy?

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I've liked girls since a long time ago,

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and I'm so noisy about summer-like memories.

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm not really into anything,

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
but I don't mind if it's Yu-kun.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Did you talk about your first experience?

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm so tired of life!

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm the gold knight of Aori!

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's my first time!

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm not sure where I am.

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Anyway, let's think about it.

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll go get it.

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Look at this!

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I want to get Hii-chan!

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm getting a picture.

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What do you think?

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I got a good name.

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Hii-chan is really serious about it.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you get it, I'll give you a cleaning suit.

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hii-chan's clothes doesn't fit me.

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If you fight with me in the natural, I'll kill you.

162
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm serious.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What's wrong with you?

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You're the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one!

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah!

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You're so mean!

167
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Hii-chan, stop it!

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're so young.

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hii-chan, stop it!

170
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hii-chan, stop it!

171
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Hii-chan, stop it!

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hii-chan, stop it!

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Hii-chan, stop it!

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Hii-chan, stop it!

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hii-chan, stop it!

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think there's a lot of skin.

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah, I don't think it's bad.

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, it feels like summer,

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
but it's pretty difficult.

180
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It feels like I'm getting into a hole.

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's hard!

182
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Did something happen?

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well,

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I have something I want to tell you.

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What's this place?

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
A classroom that's been in the classroom since I was a kid.

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's been a bit boring lately.

188
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Don't run away!

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Take this!

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's a must-see!

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Are you a teacher?

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm just...

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Welcome!

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You're always into games.

195
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, I'm so happy to remember when I was in the classroom.

196
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So, what happened today?

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Actually, I was wondering if I could show you other people's works.

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's rare for Natsume-kun to say that.

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Well, I'm a little busy.

200
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's nostalgic!

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Is this Hii-chan?

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, she was teaching me with me.

203
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The works are cute.

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Hii-chan, you're cuter than before.

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No, I'm not cuter now.

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're not getting any hair extensions anymore?

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, I'm not cuter than before.

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, Natsume-kun said he liked Inuzuka-chan's short hair.

209
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're right.

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm talking about a common hair.

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm talking about a common hair that suits Himari.

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You're a master of economics.

213
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You're saying that you love me a lot.

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You're not cut.

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't have to cut it!

216
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I think Enomoto-san has a beautiful hair, and I like her right now!

217
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Everyone, you came all the way here.

218
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Do you want to go to the base?

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Huh? Are you sure?

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You're more inspired by moving your hands, aren't you?

221
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Do you want to try it, Enomoto-chan?

222
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes, I want to try it.

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What about Himari?

224
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Well, I'm looking at her.

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I was not good at making something since I was a kid.

226
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I can do anything.

227
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If I could understand the way to perfection, I was good at observing it.

228
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But I'm not good at making something freely.

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Kai-ga, cooking, and Ikebana.

230
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yu-kun, that's hard.

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Huh?

232
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Wow, it looks like a flower cut.

233
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's hard to do it freely.

234
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If I could clear the curry with my energy here, I'd be really miserable.

235
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh, then.

236
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
First, I'll show you the face when I can't get used to it.

237
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll ignore the back completely and reduce the number of flowers.

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I see. I'll try it.

239
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's beautiful.

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yu-kun, how is it?

241
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's good. It's much better now.

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What?

243
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

244
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
When I was in middle school, my hair was burnt because I was cheating on Yu during work.

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I felt sorry for Yu because he didn't want to apologize.

246
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's why I cut it at the same time as high school entrance exam.

247
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You don't have to cut it.

248
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Enomoto-san, your hair is beautiful. I think your hair is good now.

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Hey, Yu. If my hair was long, it would look like a girl's hair.

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Did you see me?

251
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That Enomoto-chan is a girl from Highbiscus, right?

252
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Do you know?

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I like you, Natsume-kun.

254
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You're amazing. I thought you were seven years old.

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Natsume-kun?

256
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm not saying that you're different, but I really like you.

257
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You're youthful, aren't you, Inuzuka-chan?

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You're cool.

259
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm always cool.

260
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Really? Inuzuka-chan, who was 0 in love with you, suddenly stopped...

261
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I wonder if you're in a mood to fall in love with me?

262
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm not!

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Himari, I think you should do a game of sunflower.

264
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
This is a classic from middle school.

265
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yu made it for me. The sunflower's lace.

266
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I think it's perfect for you.

267
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Isn't it great?

268
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Enomoto-san said that this sunflower is good.

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Really?

270
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If you go looking for a sunflower...

271
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Enotchi, that's a shame.

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It was sudden, so I can't help you with the shop.

273
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Why are you behind me? I don't want to be next to you.

274
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I was still in the morning.

275
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Tea...

276
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yes.

277
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Really? Thank you!

278
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You're not good at Enotchi.

279
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You're avoiding me these days.

280
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry about that.

281
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I didn't mean that.

282
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Then why?

283
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Why?

284
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm so excited that I'm going to die because I'm so conscious of you and the girl.

285
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Can I say that?

286
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm not avoiding you.

287
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It has nothing to do with you, Enomoto-san.

288
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Tea is good.

289
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What? What's wrong with you?

290
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I thought I'd make you fall in love with Enotchi.

291
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I don't understand what you mean.

292
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll get you some tea at the local restaurant.

293
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Sure, I'll do it myself.

294
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Look at your luggage.

295
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What do you think my best friend is thinking about?

296
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I really don't understand.

297
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
If I can be a girl I like, I can't be a man.

298
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I've heard that a man's friendship is not good enough to be a lover.

299
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Of course.

300
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm cuter than Enotchi.

301
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm cute in a miracle, but Enotchi...

302
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Let's be clear.

303
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
If you really wanted summer, you should have taken summer to Tokyo.

304
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Before the summer has left everything,

305
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
you should have decided to fight before the sun set.

306
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I was wondering what you were talking about.

307
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But now I understand.

308
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The more you care about me, the more I get tired.

309
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I can't look away from the fact that I have a better girl.

310
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Ahh!

311
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,100
Two reverend

312
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,300
Wow! She gave it her all!

313
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:31,120
You're a calm girl.

314
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,120
I often said that the important thing to choose flowers is balance.

315
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
Hmm...

316
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,120
This leaf looks like it's not straight, but it's not too straight.

317
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,120
This one has too big a flower.

318
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,120
Perfect.

319
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,120
I want you to put the aces you made with this flower on the edge.

320
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,120
This is the only leaf that can surpass the leaves you made in junior high school.

321
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,120
Are you sure?

322
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,120
Yeah, this is good.

323
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,120
I'm going to look at it some other time.

324
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,120
Fuyu, look at that.

325
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,120
The usual flower flower is in the middle of the field.

326
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,120
When it's in the middle of the field, it's hard to hear anything in real life.

327
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Fuyu, the Himawari is beautiful.

328
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,120
I want to invite you to the next year's party.

329
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,120
I wonder if I should be jealous of the flower.

330
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
But...

331
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,120
Fuyu, I like you.

332
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Look at me instead of the flower.

333
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
Himari!

334
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Fuyu, is that you?

335
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Himari, don't try to be so stupid.

336
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,120
You're choosing the Himawari for the match.

337
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,120
You're not in the mood to bother me.

338
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
What's that?

339
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
What's that?

340
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
It's a flower.

341
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
What's that?

342
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
What's that?

343
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,120
Himari!

344
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
That's what happens.

345
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,120
I'm serious and I'm not going to let you down.

346
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Wait, Himari!

347
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Then what do I do for?

348
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,120
What do I do for this life?

349
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,120
I'll do anything.

350
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,120
I'll do anything.

351
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,120
I can't do this.

352
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
I don't like you.

353
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Himari, where are you?

354
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Here.

355
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
I can't reach such a small voice.

356
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,120
Even if the world is destroyed and I'm alone,

357
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,120
my voice won't reach my heart.

358
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Himari is here.

359
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
What's wrong with you?

360
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,120
You've been acting strange since morning.

361
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,120
I don't need your ring.

362
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
What?

363
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120
What do you want me to do?

364
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,120
The End

365
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,120
I can't get back to you.

366
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
I can't get back to you.

367
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,120

I can't get back to you.

377
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,120
I can't get back to you.

378
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,120
I can't get back to you.

379
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
I can't get back to you.

380
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,120
I want to be your light.

381
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,120
I'm so happy that I can feel the real me I've been looking for.

382
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,120
I'll reach you someday.

383
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
I can't get back to you.

384
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120

I can't get back to you.

388
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
I can't get back to you.

389
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
I can't get back to you.

390
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
