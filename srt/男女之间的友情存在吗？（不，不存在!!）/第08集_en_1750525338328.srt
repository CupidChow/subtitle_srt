1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm broken, I'm broken

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm so excited to call you by your name

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm so excited, I'm so excited

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I've never seen you before

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I can't believe you're calling me

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Is this how you call me?

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm a girl, I'm a little girl

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm a little girl, let's do this

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not gonna say I'm a kid

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not gonna say I'm a bird

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not gonna say I'm a bird

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm really sorry. I didn't know it'd be like this.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,600
We just wanted to show you how good Akuse is.

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,440
So, can you apologize to Himari-san and Natsume-kun?

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,600
I really want you to go straight to the bathroom.

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,920
The kids in the class are pretty much spread out.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,760
Well, but...

21
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,960
I'm the one who's going to support you.

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,360
It's a good thing for this kind of time.

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,620
In the lingerie mood for this match,

24
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,900
溶原心ライド also bobs!

25
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,680
Hey!

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,420
Uh? What? It hurts, but...

27
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,620
Uh, I often see this chat while sitting nearby.

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,400
Oh, I'm just keeping it.

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,200
He's captivated really nicely.

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,200
No need to tell me.

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,800
It's going to be okay, it's going to be okay.

32
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,460
I know this is a kind of love event that feels like we're having a long dream.

33
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,460
I understand why you came to apologize.

34
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,460
I see. Then...

35
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,460
You can just hit me.

36
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,460
I have the right to do that.

37
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,460
That's not a big deal.

38
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,460
When I try to support someone's love,

39
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,460
I might do the same thing as you.

40
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,460
What's wrong, Natsu?

41
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,460
You're not an adult.

42
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,460
What happened?

43
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,460
Well...

44
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,460
Well, but...

45
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,460
I'm just as you wanted.

46
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,460
Do you have any problems with the water supply department?

47
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,460
No, I haven't ordered anything yet.

48
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,460
What should we do?

49
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,460
I wonder if we can get some more.

50
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,460
If we take Yu to somewhere around the weekend,

51
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,460
we'll be able to get into the production.

52
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,460
What? Are you sure?

53
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,460
What do you mean?

54
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,460
I was so bad at it.

55
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,460
I wonder if I can get back to it that easily.

56
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,460
You're right.

57
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,460
I've been making a lot of bad things for the past one day.

58
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,460
I'll be back soon.

59
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,460
I like you, so I have a wound that won't be gone for a while.

60
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,460
Is it because you're trying to stop me from doing that?

61
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,460
It has nothing to do with you, C.

62
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,460
But you're still in this situation.

63
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,460
You're still in this situation.

64
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,460
It's not funny that you're not even a single piece of Enotchi.

65
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,460
That's not true!

66
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,460
You're doubting me?

67
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,460
Well, you know,

68
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,460
Enotchi is a natural-born person.

69
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,460
He's a good writer.

70
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,460
He was a teacher at the study club before.

71
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,460
He was a little bit too much.

72
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,460
I didn't do anything!

73
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,460
I can hear you so strangely if you deny it.

74
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,460
Huh? Where were you?

75
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,460
I was at the teacher's place.

76
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,460
I got the accented accents.

77
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,460
My words aren't as weak as Enotchi's.

78
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,460
I hate that part of you.

79
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,460
What should I do?

80
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,460
I can't do it anymore.

81
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,460
It'll be hard if I get hurt.

82
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,460
I see.

83
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,460
I haven't been able to convince you yet,

84
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,460
but I made the order order maid and talked to you about it.

85
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,460
It can't be helped.

86
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,460
They're aware that we were lying and selling it.

87
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,460
That's strange.

88
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,460
It's a very mature opinion.

89
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,460
It's a bit heavy.

90
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,460
Well, I'll do the same.

91
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,460
So let's go somewhere in the weekend!

92
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
Right, Enotchi?

93
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,460
Yeah, that's right.

94
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,460
I want to go to the shopping mall's tea shop.

95
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,460
I want to see summer clothes, too.

96
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,460
I can also make accents next time.

97
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,460
Yu!

98
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,460
I'm thinking of quitting my job as an actor.

99
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,460
What?

100
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,460
Yu, you're making a bad friend out of yourself.

101
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,460
I'm not making a friend out of myself.

102
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,460
I was wrong to act like a rich man in front of the students.

103
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,460
Wait!

104
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,460
I'm starting from the feeling that Yu wants to be an actor.

105
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,460
I'm not saying I'm making a friend out of myself.

106
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,460
But you've been looking at me with your eyes.

107
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,460
You've noticed that I'm being told that I'm sorry, right?

108
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,460
You can ignore that.

109
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,460
I'm not that strong.

110
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,460
Well, it's fine.

111
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,460
I'm not saying I can't make a friend out of myself.

112
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,460
I think it's time to expand my knowledge.

113
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,460
Stop!

114
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,460
Calm down!

115
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,460
Drink it up!

116
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,460
I don't need it.

117
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,460
Himari, you...

118
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,460
No, I'm not doing it.

119
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,460
I suddenly want to quit making accents.

120
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,460
So you're saying you're quitting, right?

121
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,460
I don't want to.

122
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,460
I always say that I like the eyes of people who make accents.

123
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,460
So...

124
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,460
So what if I can do it?

125
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,460
I want to say that I have to continue making accents.

126
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,460
You're not saying that.

127
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,460
I'm just doing it for my dream.

128
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,460
I'm the one who opens a special shop.

129
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,460
I don't have a chance to be strengthened by others.

130
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,460
What's that?

131
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,460
Hey, Himari!

132
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,460
Hii-chan!

133
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,460
I understand how you feel.

134
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,460
Himari, it's dinner.

135
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,460
Why aren't you wearing your clothes?

136
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,460
What are you doing?

137
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,460
You said you'd quit making accents until you graduate.

138
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,460
It's all your fault.

139
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,460
You're not good enough to be able to make accents.

140
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,460
You're right.

141
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,460
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,460
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
I should have quit.

144
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,460
Why?

145
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,460
What if you lose your passion just like that?

146
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,460
Himari, you understand.

147
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,460
That's fine.

148
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,460
You didn't do anything wrong.

149
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
You said you shouldn't lie.

150
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,460
You should be honest with yourself.

151
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,460
So this time, it's not bad that you care about your feelings for Yu.

152
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,460
Then Yu will understand too, right?

153
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,460
I don't know.

154
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,460
There's nothing we can do now.

155
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,460
You have to overcome it yourself.

156
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,460
In the end, making something is a conversation with yourself.

157
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,460
This time, Yu tried to take his own goal,

158
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,460
but he was shot from the front of the other's evil will.

159
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,460
But if you keep going, you'll get hit someday.

160
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,460
Even if you get hurt by your own selfishness,

161
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,460
it doesn't matter if you keep making it with your smile.

162
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,460
You're at that point of time.

163
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,460
The only thing you can survive is to move forward.

164
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,460
It's not something you can do with your support or your anger.

165
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,460
Himari, what can you do?

166
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,460
I mean, I can't do anything right now.

167
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,460
You should be able to do it yourself.

168
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,460
But Himari has a role as a partner.

169
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:05,460
You were just sweet to Yu's kindness as a friend.

170
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,460
But it's a promise to make a bad habit.

171
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,460
Yu was too sweet to Himari.

172
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,460
What do you mean?

173
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,460
The environment that announced the future was caused by Himari and Sakura.

174
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:25,460
The talent that was used in the space that was sealed like a box was added to the external stimulation.

175
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,460
However, Yu needed training to respond to the environment.

176
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,460
You said that you knew clearly that Yu would try to return to the box by losing to the stimulation.

177
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,460
You said that you knew clearly that Yu would try to return to the box by losing to the environment.

178
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,460
You said that you knew clearly that Yu would try to return to the box by losing to the environment.

179
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,460
Now it's time for Yu to respond to that.

180
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:49,460
Himari, what is the thing that can be done as a friend of Yu's destiny and co-operation?

181
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,460
Yesterday, I was bad.

182
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,460
I was too good.

183
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,460
Did you tell Enochi and Sakura that?

184
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,460
No, I know that I was bad.

185
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,460
I know that you are doing your best.

186
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,460
That's not it. What are you going to do about making a bad habit?

187
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,460
That's not going to change.

188
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,460
I'll quit making bad habits until I graduate.

189
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,460
It's fine if you say you want to quit.

190
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,460
Then I'll quit being a friend.

191
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,460
If you quit making bad habits, you'll just get to know each other.

192
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,460
Wait a minute.

193
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,460
I don't think that's going to happen.

194
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,460
I think that was bad yesterday.

195
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,460
But you can't make bad habits.

196
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,460
It's my dream to release Yu's shop.

197
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,460
I'm not the only one who quit making bad habits.

198
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,460
It's fun to say that, and I want to be a friend.

199
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,460
But if my dream is to be fulfilled, I'm not a friend anymore.

200
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,460
I'm not a kind woman like Enochi.

201
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,460
It's bad, but I'm going to quit making bad habits this time.

202
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,460
You're the one who tried to quit making bad habits.

203
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,460
And then, I'm too good at making bad habits.

204
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,460
Himari-chan, what are you going to do today?

205
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,460
I'm sorry for being a little too good.

206
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,460
Yu.

207
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,460
Enomoto-san, over there!

208
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,460
What's wrong?

209
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,460
It's a new place!

210
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,460
Enomoto-san, you have to stabilize the game.

211
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,460
What's a game?

212
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,460
So that the screen doesn't get blurry.

213
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,460
Yu, I don't know how to do it.

214
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,460
Your mom?

215
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,460
But I defeated her by myself, and I think I did a little better.

216
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,460
Yu, you're fun.

217
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,460
That's right. You're fun.

218
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,460
Yu, you'll understand soon enough when you lie.

219
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,460
I'm not. It's fun to play games with Enomoto-san.

220
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,460
But it looks funnier when you're making bad habits.

221
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,460
That's what I was talking about until last week.

222
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,460
I don't want to make it until I meet her.

223
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,460
No way.

224
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,460
I can't believe that weak people like that can play with Hii-chan for two years.

225
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,460
It has nothing to do with Enomoto-san, right?

226
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,460
I know.

227
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,460
I've decided to be the best of both Yu-kun and Hii-chan.

228
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460
I'm so jealous.

229
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,460
I said I'm jealous.

230
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,460
There's no right to talk to me about my relationship with Himari.

231
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,460
I hate such a world.

232
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,460
What?

233
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,460
I feel like Hii-chan is getting closer to me because Yu-kun doesn't want to say that.

234
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,460
No, that's strange.

235
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,460
I think I said something pretty bad just now.

236
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,460
I did.

237
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,460
I said I'll understand your lie soon.

238
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,460
That's why it's useless.

239
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,460
Um, can I have a minute?

240
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,460
This looks like it's made for someone else.

241
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,460
Hii-chan.

242
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,460
Isn't it?

243
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,460
I didn't feel anything at that time.

244
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,460
It's a fake that I made with a fake.

245
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,460
It's normal to get angry.

246
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,460
Then, what is the condition of the passion that I'm in for?

247
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,460
What am I making for?

248
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:07,460
When I thought about it, I realized that I was making a fake because I wanted to be interested in Himari.

249
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,460
I understood what I liked for the first time.

250
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,460
I made a fake for the first time to lose my trust.

251
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:23,460
In the end, I made a fake for myself by putting everyone's love in the air.

252
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,460
I felt so bad about it.

253
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,460
I thought that my feelings for people are good.

254
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,460
I thought that my feelings are pure water.

255
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,460
I made a mistake.

256
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,460
That's why I decided to leave from making a fake.

257
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:48,460
Even if I keep making more, I'm still not good enough to make something.

258
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,460
Yu-kun.

259
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,460
Are you serious?

260
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,460
Yu-kun, I think you're too difficult to think about.

261
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,460
It's better to make it more clear.

262
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,460
Clear?

263
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:11,460
It's fine to be able to do anything straight like Enomoto-san, but if you make it clear, you won't be worried at first.

264
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,460
I'm straight? Why?

265
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:20,460
Because I'm doing my best to help the house.

266
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,460
It's my job.

267
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,460
I'm always doing the housework.

268
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,460
I'm just being invited by my friends to the club.

269
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,460
That's why I'm playing games like this.

270
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,460
I'm not straight at all.

271
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:41,460
And when Yu-kun and Hii-chan are fighting, I think that Yu-kun is lucky to be alone.

272
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,460
I'm also a person with feelings.

273
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,460
Yu-kun, don't give up no matter how many times I shake you.

274
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,460
Is that strange?

275
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,460
Yes.

276
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,460
Because I like you.

277
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:03,460
You're the only one who can call my name and make the world shine.

278
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,460
Fifth time.

279
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,460
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:13,460
It's fine. You can make a play for Hii-chan.

281
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,460
If you're happy with that, it's okay.

282
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:23,460
Even if you're in love with someone, you're not a fool.

283
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,460
I'm fine with Yu-kun who doesn't make a play.

284
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,460
If you have something else you want to do, you can do it together.

285
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,460
And if you feel like it, I'm happy too.

286
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,460
Which do you want to do with me and Hii-chan?

287
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,460
If you're going to abandon making a play,

288
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:48,460
if you're going to be alone with Enomoto-san, you'll know that you're happy.

289
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,460
But there's no time for that.

290
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,460
Enomoto-san, I'm sorry.

291
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,460
It's okay. You know that you're late for ten laps.

292
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,460
But you're late for seven laps, right?

293
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,460
You're so slow.

294
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,460
Well then, let's go.

295
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,460
Himari.

296
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,460
Can you not enter the club?

297
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,460
The club? I'm sorry.

298
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,460
But you can't make an accident, right?

299
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,460
I want you to forgive me. I won't show you the door.

300
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,460
The door?

301
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,460
First of all, thank you for your time.

302
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,460
Once a month, you have to listen to me.

303
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,460
Yu-chan, you have to listen to Yu-kun.

304
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,460
I know what you're talking about.

305
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,460
Yu, I...

306
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,460
I lied to you that I was going to Tokyo.

307
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,460
I'm sorry.

308
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
Oh, now?

309
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,460
It's okay.

310
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,460
I don't care if it's true or not,

311
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,460
but I don't care about Himari being the best for me.

312
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,460
Himari! What are you doing?

313
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,460
I'll get the door!

314
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,460
Even if you say you want to stop being a bad guy,

315
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,460
I like watching you make bad guys.

316
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,460
I like it the most in the world!

317
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,460
So, if you want to make bad guys, go ahead.

318
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,460
I'll be waiting for you here forever.

319
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,460
That's the answer from me.

320
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,460
No, I said I'd quit.

321
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,460
What?

322
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,460
I've always wanted Himari to be happy and make bad guys.

323
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,460
I realized that I was being too much to say.

324
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,460
I was being too much to say.

325
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,460
I'm sorry!

326
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,460
Yu is really not a bad guy.

327
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,460
I'm too much to say.

328
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,460
If you keep saying that, I'll have to forgive you.

329
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,460
If you want to get back together with Himari,

330
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,460
you can stop being a bad guy.

331
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,460
You're really talking too much.

332
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,460
I'm talking too much! I'm embarrassed too!

333
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,460
If you like me so much,

334
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,460
you'll really get back together.

335
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,460
I don't want Himari to be happy!

336
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,460
And, the winter break.

337
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,460
I was about to start my second summer vacation in high school.

338
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
What?

339
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,460
Is Shinji here?

340
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,460
He's busy, so I'll keep him.

341
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Thank you.

342
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,460
Why did you suddenly come to see Rin?

343
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,460
Of course not.

344
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,460
I came to say goodbye to the friend who put a drop on my face.

345
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,460
Can you say that to me too, Mr. Kureha?

346
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,460
I'm not a bad guy.

347
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,460
I can't take it anymore.

348
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,460
Please tell me, Mr. Kureha.

349
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,460
You're my soulmate.

350
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,460
I wonder if I can show you the way to your eyes.

351
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,460
