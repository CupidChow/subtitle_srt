Ms. Song, was that Director Gu's car?

93

She's not here.

104
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,990
Is there anywhere else Min Seo might be?

105
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,770
I think I know where she is.

106
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,950
Where?

107
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,470

111
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,670
- Hello.
- Hi.

112
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,490
- Mr. Lee.
- Let's talk tomorrow.

113
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,990
A resort would have many work opportunities.

114
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,850
- Yes.
- That's true.

115
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,500
As Director Kim mentioned, we opened Sang Rim Resort now

116
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,250
so our students won't have time to worry about getting a job.

117
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,800
Teaching Director?

118
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,020
Yes?

119
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,730
This is Mr. Lee Kang Hoon, a new teacher in our Architectural Design department.

120
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,030
He came from supervising construction.

121
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,400
so he has much on-site experience.

122
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,960
He also has good carpentry skills.

123
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:52,110
Our students don't know much about the world.

124
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,340
It would be great if you could teach them realistically.

125
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,830
Of course.

126
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:11,490
That Mr. Kim from before had no common sense and almost ruined the children.

127
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,280
Mr...

128
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,640
Lee!

129
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,790
He's Lee Kang Hoon.

130
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,360
Mr. Lee, I hope you guide them well.

131
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,960
The students have to come to their senses.

132
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,790
I understand.

133
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,300
- What a handsome man.
- You'll do well.

134
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,430
Thank you.

135
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,920
- I think we have a good teacher.
- I think he will do well.

136
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,830
We haven't gathered for a while. Should we go and have the blowfish soup you like?

137
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,490
That sounds good.

138
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,160
Hello.

139
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,530
Mr. Lee!

140
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,260
I waited in case you left work right on time again.

141
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,390
Oh, okay.

142
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,760
This is what I mentioned before.

143
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,290
If you form a club soon, I will work really hard and definitely win an award.

144
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,210
Oh, this?

145
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,230
But if you're the only one, I'm not sure I can form a club.

146
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,400
Who are you, again?

147
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,980
Hello, I'm Kang Seo Young from the Architectural Design department.

148
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,930
Oh, yes. Seo Young.

149
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,190
You're top of the class in 11th grade, yes?

150
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,400
Oh, it's just that she's the only one interested.

151
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,850
Oh, yes.

152
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,800
A club?

153
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,080
You need at least five people to form a club.

154
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,730
Oh, I see.

155
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,670
Jae Hee and Jae Hyuk would make three.

156
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,100
You need to get two more.

157
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,900
Great. Then I will look forward to it.

158
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,770
You really are on top of preparing your requirements.

159
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,450
This event is very good for college-bound students.

160
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,460
Guide them well.

161
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,260
I called a taxi.

162
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,790
About the car, we will call the car-repair service

163
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,270
- and have it fixed—
- Leave it.

164
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,450
The culprit needs to remember it.

165
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,060
Leave it until that person admits to it.

166
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,910
Certainly.

167
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,880
I don't want to do it.

168
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,610
Hey, are you playing with me? Why are you flipping back and forth—

169
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,250
Hey, shouldn't we do it then?

I mean, I don't want to do it with them.

171
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,710
You shouldn't be so picky about people.

172
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,500
You have to get along with friends.

173
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,350
They're not my friends...

174
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,050

175

I was wondering what you meant...

176
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,280
Everything is a little tilted.

177
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,220
Look, even the earth is slightly tilted.

178

Yes. We will call right away when we find her.

00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,810
I'm really glad.

337
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,890
True.

338
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,450
What is it between you and Jung Young Joo?

339
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,700
He comes at you like he's going to eat you up so why are you sympathetic toward him?

340
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,900
Am I?

341
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,740
So...

342
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,200
Are you close with Young Joo now?

343
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,600
Do you guys have each other's numbers?

344
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,230
Why? Are you jealous?

345
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,190
Thank you for today.

346
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,210
Do you understand what I'm saying?

347
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,870
It's definitely resolvable.

348
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,120
I will meet with the manager and settle it with the company.

349
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,590
So don't be scared. It's not that serious.

350
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,010
I'm sorry.

351
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,750
Don't worry about it.

352
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,860
For now, don't think about anything and get a good sleep.

353
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,330
Okay.

354
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,910
Hey, where are you?

355
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,000
I found Min Seo!

356
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,900
Oh, right. You were still there.

357
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,430
Right. You found her...

358
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:21,770
I saw her, and I think Min Seo's okay. She's coming here with our homeroom teacher.

359
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,690
Is that you, Ho Sung?

360
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,550
What are you doing here, Ho Sung?

361
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,490
Hi, Ms. Song.

362
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,140
Hi, Min Seo.

363
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,160
Oh, hey... Hi.

364
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,140
I know, right? I'm not sure what I was doing here.

365
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,840
I forgot. Sorry.

366
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,410
Forgot?

367
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,000
How could you forget? How?

368
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,850
I couldn't even go to the bathroom because of you. Okay!

369
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,000
I already peed my pants, jerk!

370
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,300
Where are you? Where? Where? Geez.

371
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,720
Hey, sorry.

372
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,580
He should have gone to the bathroom, though.

373
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,750
Who is it?

374
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,710
It's me.

375
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,750
Ta-da.

376
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:44,030
Jung Young Joo, aren't you eating? It'll get cold.

377
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,510
Gosh, I told you to go ahead.

378
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,910
It's better if we eat together.

379
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,470
Of course.

380
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,310
Hurry and eat. You'll be late for school.

381
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,990
Next on the news.

382
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,520
At the award ceremony hosted by the Ministry of Education

383
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,370
for 2021 employment evaluation of specialist high schools,

384
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,970
Director Gu Mi Hee of Nulji Science and Technology High School in Haerang city

385
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,070
was commended by the Minister of Education.

386
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,110
Through devoted efforts...

387
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:14,470
They considered each specialist high school's employment programs, employment rate,

388
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,690
and alumni satisfaction rate from all over the country...

389
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,240
Don't mind it.

390
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,350
...and was awarded the Minister of Education award.

391
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,960
Nulji Science and Technology High School, which showed exceptional results,

392
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,810
was established in 1991 to focus on cultivating carpentry talent...

393
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,140
Did you meet her at school?

394
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,540
...they raise exceptional technicians to lead the future...

395
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,740
Don't get distracted. Just do well in school.

396
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,120
Learn what you need to learn and get along with other friends.

397
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,360
...Director Gu Mi Hee of Nulji High...

398
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,280
- I'll do well on my own.
- Listen to your hyung.

399
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,400
She won't have anything to say after we win the case at the trial.

400
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,410
Young Joo, don't pay attention to that and focus on school, okay?

401
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:58,660
...Director Gu Mi Hee stated that specialist high schools play an important role

402
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:04,730
in anticipating changes in a fast-paced society and guiding a future-focused education...

403
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,770
Cheol Joo...

404
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,760
Cheol Joo...

405
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,990
You'll get better in no time.

406
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:26,900
I'll keep praying every day. Have strength. Okay?

407
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,360
Thank you.

408
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,230
Thank you so much, ma'am.

409
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:40,420
...The Ministry of Education plans to continue to support the specialist high schools—

410
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,990
Young Joo.

411
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,370
It looks terrible. Why don't they clean it up?

412
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,400
This isn't the first time Director Gu's being weird.

413
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,960
- Gosh...
- True. Come on.

414
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,120
Hello.

415
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,590
Good morning.

416
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,820
Hi.

417
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,680
- Hello.
- Hi.

418
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,960
I wonder who created this piece of art here.

419
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:35,260
How gutsy. How could they do this to Director Gu's car?

420
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,260
You're right.

421
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,270
Why did you do it?

422
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,150
Are you surprised?

423
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,710
I... saw something that day.

424
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,330
So?

425
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:35,260
Did you get home okay last night?

426
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,020
I did. How about you?

427
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,950
I did, too.

428
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,710
What about Min Seo? Is she okay?

429
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:51,360
It seems so. I think she'll come back to school after a few days.

430
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,910
- You hurt yourself yesterday—
- Jung Young Joo.

431
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,570
Thank you so much for yesterday.

432
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,520
There's nothing to thank me for.

433
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,400
I'll buy you dinner sometime.

434
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,410
Okay. If you want to.

435
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,310
Oh, and...

436
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:20,130
Let me know if there's anything I can help you with.

437
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,920
Okay?

438
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,300
Yes.

439
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,740
Okay.

440
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,350
Then that's it for our morning meeting.

441
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,850
You must have all heard.

442
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:43,450
There was almost an unfortunate incident last night.

443
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:47,710
Make sure you keep it quiet so no one gets riled up about it.

444
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,320
Oh, and is she here today?

445
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,780
I told her to take a few days off until she has calmed down.

446
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,540
Aigoo. Children these days are so weak.

447
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,950
Making a fuss about killing themselves over nothing.

448
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,500
It's because they're children.

449
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,720
They look like they're all grown up, but they're still children who need protecting.

450
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,510
Even if it doesn't seem like a big deal to adults,

451
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:14,490
to these young ones, especially those who have no one to rely on,

452
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,080
it feels like there's no escape for them.

453
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,970
She's right.

454
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,700
- Director.
- Hello.

455
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,460
P-Please sit...

456
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,510
I also heard the news.

457
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,640
You have no idea...

458
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,210
how shocked and heartbroken I was.

459
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,800
Make sure that the student is connected to a therapy center,

460
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,220
and please do your best to console the child, Homeroom Teacher.

461
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,640
Let's conclude this incident that way.

462
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,150
Yes, of course.

463
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:59,330
But it seems that the on-site company manager for OJT (on the job training)

464
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:02,630
reprimanded the student too harshly for her mistake,

465
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,530
and even threatened her by exaggerating the price.

466
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,810
I will make sure to look into that.

467
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,220
Oh, that... wasn't a threat.

468
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,880
The student broke an expensive orchid.

469
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,730
Ms. Song Chae Rin, yes?

470
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,360
Yes.

471
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,630
Please do that.

472
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,850
Take responsibility and dig deep.

473
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,240
Make sure you deal with it reasonably so that

474
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,200
neither the company nor the student is affected.

475
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,530
What a relief.

476
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:53,450
It seems that there are many reasonable people like Ms. Song Chae Rin at Nulji High.

477
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,150
Also, while we are at it,

478
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,580
I'll deal with the recent flowerpot terror incident.

479
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,500
I will deal with it reasonably.

480
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,000
I don't like dragging things out.

481
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:14,390
So then should we move the car first?

482
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,510
If no one steps forward to confess by tomorrow,

483
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:22,310
I will press criminal charges.

484
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:25,140
It is part of a school's job to teach

485
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,270
its students right from wrong.

486
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:32,880
That is the best for that child's future too.

487
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:46,400
But it seems that the on-site company manager even threatened her by exaggerating the price.

488
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,230
I will make sure to look into that.

489
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,580
She's very good with her words.

490
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,580
How despicable.

491
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,980
[Gu Byeong Chul]

492
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,710
[Director Gu Mi Hee]

493
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,170
It's me.

494
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,020
The homeroom teacher of that girl who messed up called.

495
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,870
Geez, I'm speechless.

496
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,500
I told you to stay quiet.

497
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,500
Noona, it really wasn't my fault this time.

498
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,480

00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,230
f-friendly?

667
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,320
So it's the former?

668
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,040
But when I saw them...

669
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,150
They look good together.

670
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,090
What...

671
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:35,670
- What is she doing?
- What's that?

672
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,900
Can you look here for a second?

673
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:43,480
It's a carpentry competition hosted by Jin Sung University's architecture department.

674
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,910
Does anyone want to do this with me?

675
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:46,890
"Carpentry competition"?

676
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:50,300
Hey, do it with your boyfriend.

677
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,900
- Looking good together.
- Yes, they can do it together.

678
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,300
- The prize money is 10 million won (~US$8,500).
- Ten million won?

679
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,200
Me, I will do it.

680
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,650
Isn't the club only good for you and the twins?

681
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,800
Everyone else is...

682
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,760
just there for show.

683
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,630
Yes, Ji Won, just don't do it.

684
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,380
They'll take center stage for sure.

685
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,240
Do you think?

686
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,370
But still.

687
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:25,230
I'll do it too.

688
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,130
What?

689
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,640
- What's this?
- What's with you two?

690
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,510
So many couples in our class...

691
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,110
So it was the latter.

692
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,810
What's up with them?

693
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,010
Ten million won...

694
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,660
No, I think it's because of Ji Won.

695
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,940
What's with them?

696
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:54,420
Will she really call the police to the school or what?

697
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:58,060
Geez, it's driving me crazy.

698
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:06,890
What's that?

699
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,840
What?

700
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,560
Get lost.

701
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,790
Did you rent this place?

702
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:51,500
Where are you running off to now?

703
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,010
This is the quietest place.

704
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:57,160
Everyone else is talking about you.

705
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,180
But is it true?

706
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,710
I can't believe it.

707
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:11,000
Don't say, "Mind your own business."

708
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,540
Don't say, "Leave me alone," either.

709
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,830
You already said, "Get lost."

710
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:16,880
So don't say that, either.

711
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,860
Don't you have anything new to say?

712
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,370
Shut up.

713
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:23,020
Seeing you makes me feel like s***.

714
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,730
Hey, hey, hey!

715
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,160
You already said that last time too.

716
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,920
Okay?

717
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,510
You said that... last time...

718
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,680
Yes.

719
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,680
Where are you?

720
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:54,620
Jung Young Joo just told me off and I'm crushed.

721
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,280
Why?

722
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,620
Did you guys fight again?

723
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,580
No.

724
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,960
We didn't fight.

725
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,720
I tried a different method.

726
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,460
What does that mean?

727
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,520
Ms. Song told you to come to the counseling room. Right now.

728
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,130
- Me?
-Yes.

729
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,550
Ho Sung and me too.

730
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:18,570
Did you guys do something wrong?

731
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:20,970
- No.
- Not me.

732
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,800
- Hello.
- Sit, sit.

733
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:40,320
You three weren't in your seats when the flowerpot fell, right?

734
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,760
The day the it fell?

735
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,420
Yes.

736
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,870
Whose is this?

737
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:01,110
It's mine.

738
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:02,900
Is that so?

739
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:07,110
You two, go upstairs.

740
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,870
What is it?

741
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:19,640
Gong Ki Joon.

742
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,530
You're expelled.

743

[School 2021]

749
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,280
Tell it to me straight. Why did you go to the rooftop that day?

750
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,740
How can it be so easy?

751
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,990
Why expel him without even investigating?

752
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:41,600
- Is it fun for you?
- I thought you didn't care about me.

753
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,730
It's true, isn't it?

754
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:45,320
I don't know what I expected from you.

755
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,340
Are you still here? I'm changing.

756
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:49,340
I'll wait in front of the office till you come.

I'll just pretend I never saw—

Hey!

What is he thinking?

760
