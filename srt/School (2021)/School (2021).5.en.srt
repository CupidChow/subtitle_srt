1
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,110
You seem close with Ji Won again.

2
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,450
Do I?

3
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,300
Are you guys back to your old days?

4
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,770
"Old days"?

5
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,070
- What about the old days?
- Geez.

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,170
I mean, you guys are each other's first love.

7
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,270
What are you—

8
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,040
- We are not.
- What?

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,080
You're suspicious. Don't be shy about it and just tell me.

10
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,880
You like Ji Won, right?

11
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,460
Hey!

12
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,610
[I love you]

13
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,370
To Ki Joon.

14
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,070
Hey, it's me, Jin Ji Won.

15
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,470
I'll be honest with you.

16
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,740
I like you as much as the mountains and the sky.

17
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,310
When I see you, I feel like crying because I get excited, and the food tastes better.

18
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,950
I'm the happiest in the world when I'm with you.

19
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,870
Do you want to go out with me?

20
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,900
From Jin Ji Won.

21
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,560
Hey, Gong Ki Joon!

22
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,520
Hey, stop that!

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,870
Stop that!

24
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,690
Crybaby! Crybaby! Crybaby!

25
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,230
I'm not!

26
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,450
[Gong Ki Joon]

27
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,970
You're suspicious.

28
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,360
You like Ji Won, right?

29
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,240
I...

30
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,260
want to try again.

31
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,210
Try what?

32
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,060
Ji Won!

33
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,310
Grandpa.

34
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,230
What...

35
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,710
You're early.

36
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,570
Yes. I even brought my tools.

37
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,690
What?

38
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,530
Were you two meeting up?

39
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,660
I heard that you two are in a competition.

40
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,220
I asked Grandpa to teach us carpentry.

41
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,470
Let's try learning it properly again like we did when we were young.

42
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,240
- All right. Let's go in.
- Okay.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,470
What are you doing? Come on.

44
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,350
Me, too?

45
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,770
Aren't you also competing?

46
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,730
You know, I...

47
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,430
I have a schedule of my own.

48
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,800
Hey. I'm busy, too.

49
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,730
Seriously.

50
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,980
[Episode 5: I'm beginning to get confused about you]

51
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,140
The plane* is hard to use, even after years of practice.
(TN: woodworking tool)

52
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,460
The only way to improve is to keep using it.

53
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,380
Here. You try, Ji Won.

54
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,510
Give that to me.

55
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,720
Okay.

56
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,680
There we go.

57
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,910
Now, Ki Joon, you try.

58
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,730
Here.

59
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,450
Hold on, Ki Joon.

60
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,970
You...

61
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,160
You have to look at the direction of the wood.

62
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,170
Well? Can you feel it?

63
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,620
Can you feel it?

64
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,470
No.

65
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,050
Why can't you feel it?

66
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,640
Well, then...

67
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,700
Try planing five surfaces each.

68
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,960
- Make them smooth.
- Got it.

69
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,790
But... You have to show us how to do it.

70
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,640
I can't tell what to do.

71
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,610
Just give it a try.

72
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,790
You'll understand better the more you try.

73
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,810
- Begin!
- Begin!

74
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,200
All right.

75
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,940
But the plane—

76
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,250
"Feel" what?

77
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,410
She's good.

78
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,920
You're rushing with the saw.

79
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,170
Put this on.

80
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,330
You've hurt your hand.

81
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,960
When did you get here?

82
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,980
You should have said something.

83
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,210
Thanks.

84
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,290
But how did you know?

85
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,310
Know what?

86
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,970
You said I was rushing the saw.

87
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,650
Because I've seen it a lot.

88
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,180
My dad was a carpenter,

89
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,590
and I used to follow him to his workplace when I was young.

90
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,210
What happened to your hand?

91
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,250
I was riding a motorcycle for my part-time job.

92
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,880
It's nothing.

93
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,040
I think you need the bandages more than I do.

94
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,350
It's fine. Keep it.

95
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,900
I have a lot.

96
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,890
Ouch!

97
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,290
Hey.

98
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,490
You really suck at this.

99
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,770
I thought you'd have an advantage since you take after Grandpa.

100
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,410
What made you so confident about joining the competition?

101
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,880
Just wait. I'll get better soon.

102
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:56,240
You said you want to be a carpenter that builds traditional Korean houses like Grandpa, right?

103
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,100
Yes. Ever since I was little.

104
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,400
I envy you.

105
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,730
What for?

106
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,320
Just...

107
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,420
You're certain about everything.

108
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,100
What you want to do. What you want to be.

109
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,100
You will find something you want to do, too.

110
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,010
I don't know. It's not that easy to find.

111
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,180
Who knows?

112
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,320
You could start liking carpentry while doing this.

113
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,880
Life is unpredictable.

114
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,610
Carpentry...

115
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,270
I'm only doing this because it's all I can do right now.

116
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,440
They're quiet.

117
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,940
What?

118
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,920
The guys who won't leave you alone.

119
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,780
Didn't you want me to be your fake boyfriend because you had a lot of those?

120
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,570
There were a lot of them.

121
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,170
Is that cut on your hand okay?

122
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,050
Yes, it's fine.

123
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,540
Go easy.

124
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,140
Don't drain yourself at the beginning.

125
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,880
The competition task hasn't even been announced yet.

126
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,350
There's no time to relax. I have to win, no matter what.

127
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,140
So you have to work harder too.

128
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,700
So much pressure.

129
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,780
What... Is it because of the prize money?

130
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,460
I need the money, and I have to go to college.

131
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,320
And?

132
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,000
And then...

133
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,670
I will live like everyone else...

134
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,140
ordinarily.

135
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,560
We're here.

136
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,620
You're free to go.

137
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,270
Okay.

138
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,650
Bye.

139
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,140
Grandpa.

140
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,010
Are you unwell?

141
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,560
No, no.

142
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,270
It must be because I haven't planed in a while.

143
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm sorry.

144
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,400
I shouldn't have begged you to teach us.

145
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,190
No, I...

146
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,200
It's all right.

147
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,080
I'll be fine after I rest a bit.

148
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,440
Don't worry.

149
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,550
Still, I'm just glad I get to see you often.

150
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,120
- I like that, too, but...
- Pardon?

151
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,110
Are you really all right?

152
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,930
I'm fine.

153
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,200
Don't worry about it.

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,630
But that Ki Joon...

155
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,390
Wouldn't it be nice if he walked you back?

156
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,000
That's not it. I told him to tidy up the carpentry room.

157
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,860
- Oh. Is that so?
- Yes.

158
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,630
Good job.

159
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,770
- All right, walk back safely.
- I will.

160
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,710
You rest well, Grandpa.

161
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,550
- I'll see you in.
- All right.

162
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,130
Are you still here?

163
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,630
What are you doing?

164
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,760
You really don't have to walk me back.

165
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,900
What?

166
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,980
I'm going to the convenience store.

167
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,830
Why are you following me?

168
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,100
We passed the convenience store.

169
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,550
I'm going to that other one over there.

170
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,980
Why?

171
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,240

Yes, but... there's something left.

198

All right, so they finally announced the competition task.

219
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,600
Well, as expected. A two-person bench.

220
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,950
By using what you've learned in recent weeks,

there won't be any issues, right?

222
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,410
Additionally, you all have to apply as a two-person group,

223
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,980
so we have to form pairs.

224
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,410
Well, it looks like you're all already paired up.

225

Take the design and review it in your groups.

226

Plan the detailed work process in advance,

227
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,460
and try the simulation multiple times with your partner.

228
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,920
This will help reduce mistakes at the competition.

229

Yes. His Grandpa's sick. They're at the hospital.

341
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,140
I see. Is Ki Joon taking care of him?

342
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,890
Hey, weren't the twins perfectly fine just a minute ago?

343
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,480
Now they're both suddenly sick?

344

I hear twins often get sick together.

345
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,040

Yes.

Oh, is it Director Gu?

356
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,270
Aigoo. You got the answer to the hardest question.

357
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,890
They're Director Gu's niece and nephew.

Why do you keep calling me?

359

Eun Bi... tell me honestly.

How much did you borrow? For what?

361

How is a trainee supposed to get money?

362
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,830
I just bought things like this.

363
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,350
Do you want me to be looked down on by the other trainees?

364
00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:00,810
I don't know. I was going to debut and pay everyone back when I got paid.

365
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:05,490
Geez. So that's why you worked part-time in that costume.

366
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,660
Then you can sell all those and pay people back.

367
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,740
Hey. I worked hard to get these.

368

Never mind. I'll work part-time to pay them back.

Not at all. I can't even tell I had surgery.

I feel like I could leave the hospital right now.

No way. The doctor said he has to monitor you for a few more days.

All right.

00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,810
Ask him for his business card. We want to give him a call.

499
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:09,230
If you need his number, I can give that to you now.

500
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,350
You know that's not what I mean.

501
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,030
If he knows what we mean, he'll give his response by providing his business card.

502
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,980
But that hyung is pretty narrow minded. I'm not sure it'll work out.

503
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,160
If it doesn't work, make it work.

504
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,370
"If something doesn't work, it's because you didn't try hard enough."

505
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:37,420
I live by these words. I know you're the same, Mr. Lee.

506
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,620
M-Me?

507
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:53,680
I suppose after playing it big, a small task like this doesn't satisfy you.

508
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,400
But that's a bad thing to do.

509
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,890
Come on. Not all lies are bad.

510
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,290
There are good lies, too.

511
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,910
"Good lies"?

512
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:11,900
Listen. If we told Mom you ate a hamburger, she would be upset, right?

513
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,420
If Mom is upset,

514
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,980
- you'll be upset too, right?
- Yes.

515
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:22,260
So if Mom asks you, "What did you have for dinner?"

516
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,960
don't say, "A hamburger."

517
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,780
Say, "We ate something yummy." Okay?

518
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,480
Okay.

519
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,380
Then the hamburger is a secret, okay?

520
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,220
Ah Reum!

521
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,040
Mom!

522
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,150
What secret?

523
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:01,100
Where did Ah Reum go?

524
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,770
Right here!

525
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,360
I got you right in my hands!

526
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,030
Ta-da!

527
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,790
What do you want to do now, Ah Reum?

528
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,830
Well, I want to do that, Dad.

529
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,580
That one? Okay.

530
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,820
Have fun.

531
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,630
Geez.

532
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,580
How can you let her eat fast food every day?

533
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,580
Fine, I'll feed her lots of good food.

534
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,710
Is Mother-in-law okay?

535
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:34,550
I think she's getting worse after Dad passed away.

536
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,080
Mother-in-law and Father-in-law had a really great relationship.

537
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,420
The audacity.

538
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,790
You still call her "Mother-in-law"?

539
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:48,900
What then? Should I call her "ahjumma"?

540
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,360
How are the carpentry-class students? Are they doing well?

541
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,160
Geez, it's a whole mess.

542
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,910
Kang Seo Young works too hard.

543
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,530
And Gong Ki Joon, he's a complete beginner.

544
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,310
And the twins are...

545
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,100
Aigoo, I have a lot to say, but...

546
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,500
I won't say them.

547
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,280
But Jin Ji Won.

548
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,300
Jin Ji Won is pretty good.

549
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,230
Ji Won came to our school to become a carpenter in the first place.

550
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,810
What about Young Joo? He should be good.

551
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,510
He won a carpentry-competition award even before coming to our school.

552
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,930
I think his dad was a carpenter too.

553
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,430
I see.

554
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,730
No wonder. That's why he is rather good.

555
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,590
Dad!

556
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,020
Hey!

557
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,890
So I guess you're somewhat of a teacher.

558
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,030
I thought you would slack off.

559
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,160
You're pretty interested in the students.

560
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,520
I'm not interested. Geez, I don't know. I just want it to be over already.

561
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,100
I'm suffering big time because of that Kang Seo Young.

562
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,110
And why is she so persistent?

563
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,390
I can understand her.

564
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,450
You have to help her.

565
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,970
- I heard Seo Young and Young Joo are in the same group.
- Yes.

566
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,930
Doesn't that team have a chance of winning?

567
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,110
I don't know. We'll have to watch what happens.

568
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:24,120
Are you coming back to school tomorrow?

569
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,860
Yes.

570
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:30,020
If I miss more school, I think Grandpa will get really angry.

571
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,170
Besides, I have some things I need to do outside.

572
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,700
What things?

573
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,210
Have you ever been to a real estate office?

574
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,910
Of course.

575
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,630
Really?

576
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,200
Yes.

577
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,520
My dream in September of the 10th grade was to be a realtor.

578
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,240
I went to a lot of real estate offices back then.

579
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,620
Why real estate all of a sudden?

580
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,770
You need to help me.

581
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,930
Mom, I'm going to school.

582
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:08,510
Son! Come home early. I'll have delicious food ready.

583
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,270
- Be back soon.
- All right. See you!

584
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,480
Oh, Seo Young!

585
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,080
You have a package.

586
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:26,920
M-Motorcycle... gloves?

587
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,840
Are these yours?

588
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,570
No, it's a gift.

589
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:34,000
Oh, really?

590
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,600
The one in your profile picture?

591
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,220
Yes.

592
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:44,610
Well, maybe it's a good time to return it to him.

593
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,550
"A good time"?

594
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:50,080
It's Young Joo's birthday soon.

595
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,780
Didn't you know?

596
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,660
No.

597
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,920
I thought you would know.

598
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,640
You should do something for him.

599
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,430
You're his girlfriend.

600
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:10,060
It's his birthday today.

601
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,900
Oh, my.

602
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,730
You'll give it him just like this, won't you?

603
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:17,650
How else would I?

604
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:21,190
Aigoo, you're hopeless.

605
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,360
You still have time, right?

606
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,970
Sister Director!

607
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,180
Long time no see.

608
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,670
Didn't you miss me?

609
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:47,320
Life must be pretty good if you're coming up with such nonsense.

610
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,810
Why does that sound like you were worried about me?

611
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,830
Happy birthday.

612
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,630
I wanted to do something for you,

613
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,950
but I'm kind of frazzled these days.

614
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,360
Sorry.

615
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:05,320
Don't get distracted by useless things and prepare for the competition.

616
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,280
Don't hurt Ji Won's chances.

617
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,540
What is this?

618
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,090
I scanned everywhere, starting from my neighborhood.

619
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,980
Did you already go to this many places?

620
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,000
Try calling this number for now.

621
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,030
Let's take a look after school together.

622
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,220
Oh, okay.

623
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,090
Thank you.

624
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:43,870
Punk.

625
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,610
Don't mention it.

626
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:19,840
I'd like to see the place too, please.

627
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,850
What are you doing?

628
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,700
Sorry.

629
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,640
Will you say sorry after causing an accident too?

630
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:08,480
Hey, it's okay. He has a lot on his mind lately.

631
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,810
If you have your mind on something else, don't use the tool.

632
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,000
What's going on with you?

633
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,340
Did something happen again? Is it because of Grandpa?

634
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,480
I can't do this.

635
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,280
I'll get going.

636
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,010
This will take some getting used to. You're a teacher?

637
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:04,110
So anyway...

638
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:08,120
Will you be bringing your students to our department's carpentry competition?

639
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,270
Yes.

640
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,520
Well, that's how it turned out.

641
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,950
Hyung.

642
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:19,180
So about that...

643

[Nulji Science and Technology High School, Lee Han Soo]

644
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:28,010
He said he would really like to meet you.

645
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,880
He asked for your business card.

646
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,490
He will be meeting with him just about now.

647
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,570
He'll get the message across.

648
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:55,780
I think he has some sense in him.

649
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,540
Well then. I'll let them know.

650
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,190
Sure. See you around.

651
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,860
Hey.

652
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,090
You know,

653
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,540
I'm beginning to get confused about you.

654

00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,520
Yes, what?

657
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,730
Earlier, you left abruptly.

658
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,480
Where are you? The hospital?

659
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,400
Yes.

660
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,210
Nothing is wrong, is it?

661
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:56,790
No.
