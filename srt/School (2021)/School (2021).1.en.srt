00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,280
I'll be going now.

170
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:50,470
♫ Without knowing, I want to know your heart ♫

171
00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:01,100
♫ My heart has grown overnight ♫

172
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:11,880
♫ I want to see the sparkling night sky ♫

173
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:22,380
♫ I miss you more on these strange roads ♫

174
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,060
Grandpa.

175
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,480
Oh, welcome.

176
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,670
What are you doing here? You have back pain.

177
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,800
Yes...

178
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,210
Are you using this space again?

179
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,230
I'm trying to clean things up in advance.

180
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,900
Why suddenly?

181
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,810
Was the house auctioned off?

182
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,100
Yes.

183
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,920
The bids fell through for so long.

184
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,030
It was about time it succeeded.

185
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,590
Just leave it. I'll do it.

186
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,000
All right.

187
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,990
I'll earn a lot of money and buy this house back for you.

188
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,470
I should live long to see my grandson become rich.

189
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,730
It won't take that long.

190
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,130
I have a lot of time,

191
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,240
and I need money.

192
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:36,730
Anyway, there was a lot of trial and error in the beginning.

193
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,910
It really couldn't be helped.

194
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,840
So the important thing is that

195
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,950
I realized, "I'm becoming a professional in my field."

196
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,450
That thought made me feel really proud.

197
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,730
At the center were Nulji High School's Architectural Design department and the apprenticeship class.

198
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,350
I utilize a lot of what I learned at school in the field now.

199
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,270
That's all I have to say today. I'm not sure if it was helpful.

200
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,250
Now, feel free to ask any questions you have.

201
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,340
Yes?

202
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,740
So were you hired full-time right after taking the apprenticeship class and graduating?

203
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,740
Yes.

204
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,920
For me, I signed a company contract in the 11th grade,

205
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
I worked and studied at the same time,

206
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,100
was hired full-time before graduating, and I'm still working there.

207
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,500
Yes?

208
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,880
Wouldn't it still be better to work after going to college?

209
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,970
Did you regret it or anything?

210
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,750
I'm not sure.

211
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,320
Rather than going to college without any thought,

212
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,080
isn't it more efficient to work at a company

213
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,760
and go when you think you need to?

214
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,560
You all know P-TECH, right?

215
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,790
Yes, we know.

216
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,770
P-TECH?

217
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,710
I use that to take weekend college classes.

218
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:51,280
Of course, there's no College Scholastic Ability Test requirement nor tuition.

219
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,440
Yes?

220
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,570
But it's hard enough for us to earn our certificates now.

221
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,940
Isn't an apprenticeship too much?

222
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,900
Right, an apprenticeship can be more work than a regular curriculum.

223
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,680
But think about it.

224
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,280
You're going on-site to learn while still attending school,

225
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:22,900
and you get a salary deposited every month to your bank accounts.

226
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,370
Well? Isn't this really appealing?

227
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,360
You won't start your twenties with a debt.

228
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,240
You'll start with savings.

229
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,940
Yes?

230
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,300
How much is the monthly salary?

231
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,440
Monthly salary...

232
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,580
Monthly salary...

233
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,000
Every company is different.

234
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,250
But I guarantee you it's more than the minimum wage.

235
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,570
Including the four national insurances.

236
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,130
Yes?

237
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,760
So...

238
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,990
what's an apprenticeship?

239
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,360
What?

240
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,620
Hey.

241
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,760
Be quiet.

242
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,320
Why?

243
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,950
Just be quiet.

244
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,900
All right, no more questions?

245
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,870
That's about it for your sunbae's talk.
(T/N: Sunbae is an informal way to address a senior)

246
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,510
They're recruiting one more apprentice

247
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,210
at Sang Rim Housing, where Jung Min works.

248
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,110
- So if anyone's interested—
- Me.

249
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,790
I get to go on-site, right?

250
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,380
I want to do it.

251
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,130
Oh, you.

252
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,330
Ji Won. Yes.

253
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,110
All right. Anyone else?

254
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,800
Me too.

255
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,080
You too?

256
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,910
Why? Oh, okay.

257
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,800
Okay.

258
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,590
What are you doing?

259
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,300
Put your hand down...

260
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,120
Put your hand down.

261
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,670
Hey, Gong Ki Joon.

262
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,630
Why does an apprenticeship interest you?

263
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,410
You don't even know what it is.

264
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,540
Why?

265
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,810
Am I not allowed to be?

266
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,430
No, but...

267
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,210
You never even took the major classes properly while doing taekwondo.

268
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,840
They said they would teach me.

269
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,480
You're doing this on purpose, right?

270
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,290
What are you talking about?

271
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,890
- Wow.
- Wow.

272
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,410
- I say yes.
- I bet 500 won (~US$0.50) they used to date.

273
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,600
That can't be right.

274
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,250
The whole class saw Jin Ji Won beating up Gong Ki Joon in fourth grade.

275
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,740
Ki Joon got a double nosebleed. It was a mess.

276
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,060
Hey, that was then.

277
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,730
Why would Ki Joon suddenly apply for the apprenticeship?

278
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,630
Because he wants to work with Ji Won?

279
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,220
No. I applied to earn money.

280
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,400
Yes.

281
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,190
Even in elementary school, there was a rumor they were dating.

282
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,210
Please focus on my skills instead of rumors.

283
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,700
I've dreamed of being a carpenter since elementary school.

284
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,640
It has never changed.

285
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,270
They were supposed to select one.

286
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,410
This isn't romance. It's a "screw-you."

287
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,160
I did it for the money, not my dream.

288
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,860
I'm prepared to endure it.

289
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,050
Ho Sung, do you know anything?

290
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,400
You have been close with them since elementary school.

291
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,980
Ki Joon and Ji Won, are they enemies or lovers?

292
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,210
It's hard to tell.

293
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,740
Gosh...

294
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
What is going on? You guys were badmouthing me, weren't you?

295
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,110
Yes. Hold on a second.

296
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,770
Seriously.

297
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,880
How did the apprenticeship with Sang Rim go?

298
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,340
What?

299
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,350
- They're both good.
- Yes.

300
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,580
Well, you only have to meet the bare minimum for the major grades.

301
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,680
For now, you should both prepare for an interview with Sang Rim.

302
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:48,040
Ki Joon, you only did sports, didn't you?

303
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,970
How about we just go with Ji Won?

304
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,460
Stop talking about that!

305
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,380
- I'm hungry. Hungry!
- Hear me out!

306
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,890
Come on!

307
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,110
I'm hungry!

308
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,610
- When is Min Seo coming?
- I think that's her.

309
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,770
Oh, there is Min Seo!

310
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,040
- Min Seo!
- Min Seo!

311
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,500
- Hey, Min Seo!
- Min Seo!

312
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,840
Look who got off work on time.

313
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,990
Of course, you guys were desperately calling me.

314
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,800
Hello.

315
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,690
- He's there!
- Hurry!

316
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,270
- Let's go.
- Yes.

317
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,910
[Byeol's Diner]

318
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,400
- Hello.
- Hey, guys.

319
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,460
Long time no see.

320
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,330
Hurry, go in.

321
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,410
Long time no see, Oppa.

322
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,710
Yes.

323
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm a bad son.

324
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,370
Aigoo. At least you know.

325
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,890
Jjolmyeon for all four of you?

326
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,200
Yes!

327
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,740
Aigoo, aigoo, I'm full. Aigoo.

328
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,930
It took me super long, even after getting the apprenticeship, to do OJT (On-the-job training).

329
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,010
I know.

330
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,260
They said we could go on-site right away so I put my hand up.

331
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,760
Wow.

332
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,890
But it's unexpected that Ki Joon applied for an apprenticeship at our company.

333
