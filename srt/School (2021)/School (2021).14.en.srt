Well...

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,570
- Director Gu?
- Mr. Lee Kang Hoon,

10
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,050
I'm glad I ran into you.

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,870
- Sorry?
- You...

12
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,450
You're fired.

13
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,180
Clear out your desk today.

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,500
What do you mean by doing this so suddenly?

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,520
I thought you were prepared for it.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,290
When you ask me so innocently, I don't know what to say.

17
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,860
What did he do wrong?

18
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,180
How dare you interrupt adults talking.

19
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,000
Jung Young Joo, you're next.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,400
Just wait.

- What?
- Jung Young Joo.

22
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,470
Enough.

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,080
We should talk inside.

24
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,300
There aren't many teaching days left this year anyway.

25
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,270
The other teachers will divide up the rest of your classes.

26
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,550
We'll take care of the administration.

27
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,270
So don't get on Director Gu's nerves anymore,

28
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,920
and gather your things.

29
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,280
But—

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,670
But how can you ask me to suddenly leave?

31
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,180
It's too unreasonable.

32
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,270
The board agreed to it.

33
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,780
On what grounds?

34
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,750
It says on the notice, "Neglect of Duties."

35
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,350
So why did you have to leave work without a valid reason?

36
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,590
You have your head in the sand.

37
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,320
Leave quietly so that the students

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,300
aren't angered.

39
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,790

[Episode 14: It's time for me to step up again]

It's time for me to step up again.

41
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,990
Yes. Of course.

42
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,200
Hey. Are you guys going to let Mr. Lee leave like this?

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,730
What will you do?

44
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,680
Protest like last time?

45

Will anything change?

46
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,660
Director Gu will never go back on her words.

47
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,080
We have to do something.

48
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,260
We have to make an effort, at least.

49
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,930
Anyone who wants to stand with me, meet me after school.

50
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,470
Okay, but where should we meet?

51
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,250
Should we gather at school?

52
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,910
You're right.

53
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,620
It'll take time to make signs,

54
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,250
and it doesn't feel right to prepare those at school.

55
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,420
Where do we meet?

56
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,100
Let's use my place.

57
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,240
Can we?

58
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,150
I want to do something too.

59
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,110
I have to go to work, so you guys should start without me.

60
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,070
You know where my house key is, right?

61
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,980
Oh, my God. Do you even know that?

62
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,200
W-We live together anyway.

63
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,730
You what?

64
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,870
- Wh-Why?
- Did I hear that wrongly?

65
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,390
- They live together?
- J-Jin Ji Won?

66
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,580
It's all my fault.

67
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,170
I'm sure we can change it.

68
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,820
This is definitely using an unfair dismissal for retaliation.

69
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,490
Let's find a way.

70
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,220
The school did all we could.

71
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,460
I didn't know there would be evidence coming out of nowhere.

72
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,850
So? How much is the settlement amount?

73
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,450
You don't need to worry about your position over that amount, honey.

74
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,240
Fine, let's talk at home.

75
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,680
Gosh.

00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,720
Is it Uncle?

77
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,520
Yes.

78
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,130
Jae Hee, Jae Hyeok, what is it?

79
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,000
Aunt,

80
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,780
please cancel Mr. Lee's dismissal.

81
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,510
He did nothing wrong.

82
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,460
- Why would you fire him?
- Hey.

83
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,130
That guy caused our company a lot of damage.

84
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,830
Aunt, just expel Jung Young Joo too.

85
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,750
Go ahead and try.

86
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,620
There was a valid reason for doing that.

87
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,400
It's not something for you to get involved with, Jae Hee.

88
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,270
I finally became close with Mr. Lee and my friends.

89
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,650
You ruined everything, Aunt!

90
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,090
Lee Jae Hee, I've always told you that

91
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,960
I don't have any sons or daughters,

92
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,080
and both of you are like my children.

93
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,000
If you just stay put, I'll help you walk down an easy path.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,130
- So—
- I don't need anything.

95
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,200
I'm not your child!

96
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,150

97
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,670

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,060
Hey, Min Ki, Min Ki!

100
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,550
Class is over. You need to go home.

101
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,020
What?

102
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,490
Where are you going?

103
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,110
Wait for me.

104
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,440
Hey!

105
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,170
Why do you keep running away and avoiding me?

106
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,350
You ignore all my texts.

107
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,460
I... Eun Bi...

108
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,600
I have to rush home.

109
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,390
I asked if you wanted to have dinner together.

110
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,060
Bring Hyun Woo too.

111
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,840
If we're taking Hyun Woo, we should go somewhere with stroller access, right?

112
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,930
I don't have time.

113
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,080
Really?

114
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,050
- Tomorrow?
- No. Not tomorrow, not ever.

115
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,110
I have to look after Hyun Woo, and I'll start a part-time job soon.

116
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,880
My parents said they can't support a baby financially, so I'm on my own.

117
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,260
Sorry, Eun Bi. I have to go.

118
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,890
Are you doing this because of those posted comments?

119
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,170
It's not even true so why do you care?

120
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,410
That's not it.

121
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,000
I have a lot on, Eun Bi.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,730
I'm not the person I used to be.

123
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,340
I hope you understand.

124
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,700
He's so cute.

125
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,620
The school and us...

126
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,160
I thought...

127
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:10,350
I thought I was more helpful to Eun Bi than anyone else.

128
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,400
I ruined her future.

129
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,080
Come on.

130
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,040
The people are mistaken.

131
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,070
Even if they are,

132
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,830
once her image is ruined, it's over for her.

133
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,980
Because of me, false rumors are

134
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,620
happening before she even has a proper start.

135
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,420
It's okay. It will be fine.

136
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,300
Don't cry. You're a man.

137
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,820
Why are you crying so much?

138
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,520
But...

139
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,890
when did you and Ji Won start living in the same house?

140
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,240
Why didn't you tell me? Geez...

141
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,140
I was going to. I was just all over the place.

142
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,660
That's true.

143
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,500
So I ruined Eun Bi's future.

144
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,820
All this talk about ruined futures.

145
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,430
- Hey.
- Hey.

146
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,240
What's up with this atmosphere?

147
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,860
Just get used to it.

148
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,970
Aigoo. Ho Sung has been repeating the same thing for three hours.

149
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,370
We gave up trying to console him.

150
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,850
Ki Joon just returned from work, so he's getting the update.

151
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,160
Starting tomorrow, we're protesting with signs.

152
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,450
- Are you with us?
- Yes.

153
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,840
I'll do whatever I can.

154
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,460
So why is he crying?

155
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,650
Young Joo, the thing is...

156
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,660
Young Joo...

157
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,410
Listen to me.

158
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,150
I thought I was more helpful to Eun Bi than anyone else.

159

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,050
or just hurry up and go.

169
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,080
[What are we to learn at this institution where teachers keep disappearing?]

170
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,100
What is it?

171
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,190
Will this be enough?

172
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,520
We can only do as much as we can.

173
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,980
It's all my fault.

174
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,440
I shouldn't have

175
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,620
asked him to testify.

176
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,700
Why are there so many unjust things, and I have no power?

177
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,130
There will be a way.

178
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,980
Ji Won is an expert in this field,

179
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,810
so let's trust her and go with it.

180
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,490
[I'm hungry. Want to get a late night snack?]

181
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,540
Did you wait long?

182
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,340
My sister caught me leaving, so I had to make an excuse.

183
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,900
Not at all. I just got here.

184
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,100
Let's go.

185
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,590
Let's hurry.

186
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,840
Are you going to keep staring at me with that gentle and kind look?

187
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,240
It's because you're so precious.

188
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,380
How are you feeling these days?

189
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,880
I'm busy

190
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,350
because of you, Jung Young Joo, and everyone else.

191
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,920
I have no time to think about anything.

192
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,740
Thank you...

193
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,280
to you and Young Joo both.

194
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,650
I'm sure you miss Grandpa a lot.

195
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,330
I do.

196
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,560
I can't believe it.

197
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,280
I still feel like he's going to greet me when I come home.

198
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,110
In the morning,

199
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,320
I feel like he'll nag me to eat before going to school.

200
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,700
Maybe I shouldn't have brought it up.

201
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,570
No.

202
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,650
I'm going to talk about him every day

203
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,660
and miss him a lot.

204
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,980
And then...

205
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,420
if I want to cry, I will.

206
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,260
That's how it's going to be.

207
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,550
You told me to do that.

208
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,290
Sorry.

209
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,800
I should be comforting you.

210
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,250
No.

211
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,130
Without you, I wouldn't have been able to handle it.

212
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,480
Thank you.

213
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,580
No more crying.

214
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,120
Finish your food.

215
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,360
Don't get home and say you should have finished the food or whatever.

216
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,090
Eat up.

217
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,320
Okay.

218
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,570
Go on.

219
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,120
Is it good?

220
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,800
Are you happy?

221
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,490
Weren't you sleeping?

222
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,420
Dad, aren't you going to school?

223
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,720
No.

224
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,230
I'm not going to go for a while.

225
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,100
Why not?

226
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,770
Well...

227
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,210
It's just tiring, so I'm going to rest for a bit.

228
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,420
- Lucky you.
- What?

229
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,820
I go to preschool even if I don't want to.

230
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,790
Oh, I see.

231
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,220
Is going to preschool tiring for you?

232
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,440
What else can I do?

233
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,370
I have to do what I have to do.

234
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,680
Everyone!

235
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,580
Mr. Lee Kang Hoon of the Architectural Department has been dismissed unfairly.

236
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,780
He was fired for testifying against the foundation

237
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,500
regarding an on-site apprentice from our school who was injured five years ago.

238
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,070
We must protect our teacher.

239
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,180
Unfair dismissal.

240
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,930
Withdraw, withdraw, withdraw.

241
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,230
We want to keep learning from Mr. Lee Kang Hoon.

242
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,200
Unfair dismissal.

243
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,860
Withdraw, withdraw, withdraw.

244
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,380
Everyone.

245
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,630
Mr. Lee Kang Hoon of the Architectural Department has been dismissed unfairly.

246
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,940
Mr. Shin.

247
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,550
- Good morning.
- Hi.

248
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,250
Will you read through this? It's about Mr. Lee.

249
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,820
- For an on-site apprentice...
- Oh, I see.

250
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,990
You guys are going through a lot.

251
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,130
Do you think any of the teachers would stand with us?

252
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,110
I'm sure all teachers know Mr. Lee's dismissal was unjust.

253
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,420
I don't know about that.

254
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,100
The lives of adults aren't that simple.

255
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,040
Sorry?

256
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,860
Anyway, keep it up.

257
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,710
Everyone, Mr. Lee Kang Hoon of the Architectural Department has been dismissed unfairly.

258
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,150
Ms. Song.

259
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,840
Ms. Song.

260
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,700
You guys...

261
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,390
Don't do this, guys.

262
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,300
I know how you feel, but this is a problem for the teachers.

263
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,500
- This is adults' business—
- It's about our teacher.

264
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,610
So it's our problem too.

265
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,020
Don't worry about us.

266
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,680
We'll make sure it doesn't affect our classes.

267
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,170
Get those kids out of there!

268
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,130
What business does Mr. Shin Cheol Min have with you, Director?

269
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,590
What is it?

270
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,860
Oh, yes.

271
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,320
About the new Animal Care and Drone departments,

272
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,030
that's the list of teachers who signed up for training over the holiday break.

273
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,840
Only half of the current teachers signed up.

274
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,360
It must be because they have no common grounds with these departments.

275
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,520
I suppose it would be better to hire new teachers, yes?

276
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,340
Aren't you doing it?

277
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,010
Pardon?

You're in the Architectural Department too.

279
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,510
It's too soon for you to retire. Are you planning to relocate to another school?

280
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,090
Pardon? I don't follow what you mean...

281
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,900
I'm Sang Rim's... I mean...

282
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,890
Wasn't this already worked out with Director Oh?

283
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,040
That was a long time ago.

284
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,270
Look at the mess we're in now.

285
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,610
What time is the Animal Care Department teacher arriving?

286
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,680
You told him the correct amount, right?

287
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,890
Yes. He arrives at two o'clock.

288
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,330
I'm sure he'll bring the correct donation money.

289
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,060
You can go.

290
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,360
All right.

291
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,910
Ah!

292
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,220
And get those noisy kids out of there.

293
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,550
All right.

294
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,110
I keep telling you to get into blue-chip stocks, not politically-themed stocks.

295
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,860
I'm suffering a serious loss. Have you any recommendations?

296
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,190
It's really serious. Give me some recommendations.

297
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,200
Avoid politically-themed stocks. Stick with blue-chip.

298
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,420
But this is the only way for me to make up for my loss.

299
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,740
Seriously, don't get into it.

300
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,480
Just get into blue-chip stocks and...

301
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,160
I heard rumors about that.

302
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,650
Did you?

303
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,350

- Yes.

Yes, it's really good.

Why suddenly have grilled ribs?

311

Ah Reum likes it.

I knew you would be feeling down.

313

Don't worry about it and eat as much as you want.

314
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,000
Delicious.

315

Ah Reum, the sweet-and-salty taste is great, right?

316

If I hadn't, wouldn't you have lost your job?

It's only our impression that it was an unfair dismissal.

But my mom says

that the board never agreed to it.

What?

My mom is the head of the foundation.

572
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,130
So all faculty dismissals have to go through the board.

573
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,970
But more than half disagreed with the dismissal, so it fell through.

574
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:57,340
I checked the board meeting log on our school website last time.

575
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:01,050
It said that the board agreed to dismiss Mr. Lee.

Aunt is meticulous about keeping records,

579

so she makes sure all meetings have minutes,

580
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,480
and then she just doesn't reveal the adverse parts.

- That's not right.
- It's not.

582

But if the board disagreed,

583
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,450
doesn't that mean Mr. Lee's dismissal was unfair?

Why? What did Mr. Lee say?

591
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:08,570
He said we submitted the proposal for six benches

592
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:11,180
and we received all the funds,

593
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,120
so we have to build all six and install them.

594
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,520
He didn't say that when the bench broke.

Why is he suddenly...

596

657
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:03,590
He's not here today. Why?

658
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:07,510
Do you have the phone number of his mom or brother?

659
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,830
Call them and ask if he's home.

660
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,450
What's going on?

661
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,820
He hasn't been answering my calls.

662
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,460
I'm nervous about something.

663
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:21,580
You know how he has been struggling and blaming himself for Mr. Lee's dismissal?

664
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:25,370
Earlier today, he learned that the board's record of opposing the dismissal

665
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,160
is in the director's office.

666
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,600
That's when he got this weird look in his eyes.

667
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,550
Maybe I'm overreacting,

668
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:35,250
but I get more nervous as I think about it.

669
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:40,670
Ki Joon.

670
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:46,130
Where are you going? Mom said to put this in your fridge.

671
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:49,100
Can you put it in the fridge? I'm in a hurry.

672
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,350
Where are you going? Is something going on?

673
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:54,250
I have to get to school right now.

674
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:56,560
Keep a watch in case Young Joo comes by.

675
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,410
- Okay?
- Okay.

676
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,230
How did you get in here?

677
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,600
What are you doing right now?

678
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,140
Don't you know that the when you smash it, security is notified?

679
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,920
I know that,

680
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,170
but I don't care.

681
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,770
Seo Young told me what happened.

682
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,070
I know why you're doing this,

683
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,510
but it isn't right.

684
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,800
I should have been punished for throwing that flowerpot anyway.

685
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,640
I'll just think of this as punishment for that.

686
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,160
Don't stop me.

687
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,110
I've thought about it and made my choice.

688
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,180
Stop acting like an idiot!

689
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,290
This all happened because of me.

690
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:49,320
I have to resolve it.

691
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,890
"Because of me"?

692
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:54,930
How do you think Mr. Lee would feel if you did this?

693
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:59,610
"I'm glad. I'm happy I have my job back, thanks to Young Joo."

694
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,490
Do you think he'd say that?

695
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:07,180
You're doing this to make yourself feel better.

696
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,060
- Shut up.
- Mr. Lee...

697
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,070
made his choice to do the right thing

698
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:16,290
even if he got fired from the school.

699
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,330
What right do you have?

700
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:21,870
Who are you to trample all over that?

701
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,630
If you act like this,

702
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:29,540
you're spitting on Mr. Lee's decision.

703
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,760
Do you really not know that?

704
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,250
And besides,

705
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,190
don't I even matter to you?

706
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:48,790
What?

707
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,970
I have to get back at you

708
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:54,100
for disliking me so much.

709
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:58,900
So... you have to stay by my side,

710
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,440
so I can pay you back.

711
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,730
Okay?

712
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,720
Is anyone there?

713
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,710
Sh*t.

714
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,930
Hey, hey.

715
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:16,690
There's a surveillance camera here.

716
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,190
Let's go that way.

717
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:30,340
Geez.

718
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,110
Hey!

719
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:39,010
Jung Young Joo... you... seriously!

720
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,980
Hey.

721
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,300
I scolded him for the first round,

722
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,860
but I'm not sure I managed to get through to him.

723
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:57,180
You should get... what do you call it... straighten out the facts for him as the second round.

724
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,180
Get rid of that hammer.

725
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,290
You're scaring me to death.

726
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,740
Hey...

727
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:08,250
Hey, where are you going?

728
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,860
Why did you come all the way here?

729
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,940
Why did you tell Ki Joon?

730
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,510
- Are you angry?
- Yes.

731
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,730
Why?

732
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,830
"Why"?

733
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,480
I couldn't focus on anything during work.

734
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,010
I was worried you'd do something and drive yourself into a corner again.

735
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,590
You only thought of yourself.

736
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:46,220
Don't you think of those who worry about you?

737
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,490
I'm sorry.

738
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:01,530
Nothing happened, so it's fine.

739
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:04,740
There has to be another way to resolve Mr. Lee's case.

740
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,400
Oh!

741
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,990
Ki Joon!

742
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,150
Are you okay?

743
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,850
What about Young Joo? Did you find him?

744
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,710
I barely talked him out of it.

745
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,950
Nothing happened.

746
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:37,730
That's such a relief.

747
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,830
Why are you out here? It's cold.

748
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:43,040
What else could I do when you left like that?

749
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,100
I wanted to chase after you,

750
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,390
but you asked me to watch for Young Joo,

751
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,700
so I couldn't leave here.

752
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,620
I was really worried something had happened, and—

753
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,590
Hey.

754
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,900
I'm glad.

755
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,570
What is it? Are you okay?

756
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:07,090
Yes. I am.

757
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:08,920
I'm happy.

758
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,240
I'm so happy that you're by my side.

759
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,480
Geez.

760
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,130
So...

761
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,510
You saw her get on the bus,

762
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:59,150
waved at her and then left?

763
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:00,740
Yes.

764
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:04,530
At that hour, it was the last bus running.

765
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:06,390
What a relief.

766
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:09,020
"A relief"? Yes...

767
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,020
What?

768
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,650
What is it?

769
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,450
You...

770
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,140
What?

771
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,640
Seriously...

772
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,440
"What a relief," did you say?

773
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,140
That hurts... that hurts.

774
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,610
That hurts!

775
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,260
What?

776
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:37,870
You only thought of yourself.

777
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:40,550
Don't you think of those who worry about you?

778
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,540
[Come back, Mr. Lee. We're friends, aren't we? Who is this dismissal for? Return Mr. Lee to us.]

779
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,520
What's that?

780
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,700
Why police cars here?

781
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,020
Did something happen?

782
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,080
I don't know. What's going on?

783
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,970
I've got a bad feeling about this.

784
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,560
Hey.

785
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:18,380
You guys should hurry and get inside today.

786
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:33,380
We should use a stronger phrase.

787
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,840
Let's make another one.

788
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,550
Oh, no. Oh, no!

789
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,220
Guys. It's a mess.

790
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,430
What's wrong now?

791
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,670
There was a burglary at school last night

792
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:44,740
and Director Gu's office was robbed.

793
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,370
- What?
- The director's office?

794
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:48,520
Is that even possible?

795
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,100
The director's office?

796
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,390
What is the meaning of this?

797
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:15,600
What is all this?

798
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,310
Well...

799
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,060
It looks like there was a burglar.

800
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:23,780
But I don't know why they would rob the director's office...

801
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:30,600
Have you figured out what's missing?

802
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,860
Find it.

803
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:38,120
Find it right now!

804
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,780
- Who could it be?
- The director's office?

805
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,640
What's going on?

806
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,500
Why would the director's office—

807
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,250
There's no way.

808
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,040
Ki Joon!

809
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,170
Is it that student?

810
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,200
I'll talk to him.

811
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,240
Ki Joon...

812
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,700
Did you by any chance...

813
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,560
come to school last night?

814
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:07,200
♫ Dream on, dream on, dream on ♫

815
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:14,650
♫ Dream on, dream on, dream on ♫

816
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:24,800
♫ My heart keeps thinking of you. I can't even understand myself ♫
