1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,270
Da,

3
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,030
I heard that Cloud Brothel 
has selected a Courtesan tonight.

4
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,669
Wanna see how she's like?

5
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,270
Women

6
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,660
are all monsters with a big mouth,

7
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,110
waiting to drain your last drop of blood.

8
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,910
I find them yucky.

9
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,310
Tong.

10
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,670
Cheers.

11
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,829
A group of unidentified men in black

12
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,870
seemed to be going for Prince Yi.

13
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,950
You seem pleased.

14
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,030
Something good happened?

15
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,310
I just heard there's a good show coming up.

16
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,190
A good show?

17
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,230
What show?

18
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,310
If someone is too cocky,

19
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,590
then one day,

20
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,870
they must be doomed.

21
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,900
Tong, I'm having so much fun talking to you.

22
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,030
We should make it count.

23
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,150
Let's enjoy the night.

24
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,150
Enjoy the night.

25
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,829
What?

26
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,270
Let go of me!

27
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,070
Let go!

28
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,150
Are you really into Bao?

29
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,030
Who said it?

30
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,540
The auspicious spider is a token of marriage.

31
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,430
You really don't know,

32
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,190
or pretend you don't?

33
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,950
How do I know that auspicious spider is inside?

34
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,829
Plus,

35
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:58,070
whether I like him or not is between the two of us,

36
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,710
not others.

37
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,830
Who are others?

38
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,750
I am.

39
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,470
I am. Okay?

40
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,070
By the way,

41
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,710
shouldn't you be watching
 the lanterns with Miss Min?

42
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,150
She must be lovely today.

43
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,500
You liked the gift Bao gave you, didn't you?

44
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,230
Yeah, I did.

45
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,950
Prince Yi, don't keep your lady waiting.

46
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,230
I'll go find Lan Miao.

47
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,590
Don't get me wrong.

48
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,550
There's a food stall over there.

49
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,500
It looks good.

50
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,470
Don't you want to try it?

51
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,750
If you want to ask me out, just say it.

52
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,230
Thank you so much!

53
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,870
Thank you.

54
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,710
Thanks, everyone.

55
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,620
Si Yan.

56
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,430
Come here.

57
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,500
Do the makeup for the kids.

58
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,140
Coming.

59
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,510
Pitch-Pot Contest

60
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,230
is about to start!

61
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,390
Mister.

62
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,710
You were so close!

63
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,630
What a pity!

64
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,830
Better luck next time!

65
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,710
Who else wants to try?

66
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,990
The rules

67
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,230
are simple

68
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,390
Aim the jar

69
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,900
with the cloth bag.

70
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,350
If you hit one,

71
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,510
you can get the corresponding prize.

72
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,390
Two copper coins for one toss.

73
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,350
Spend ten coins,

74
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,390
you'll get one for free.

75
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,830
Our prizes are

76
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,070
cute hair clasps,

77
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,350
luxurious jade bracelets.

78
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,870
The most precious

79
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,220
and most popular one

80
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,630
is this.

81
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,590
The goods of the princes of East City.

82
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,470
Come take a look and play.

83
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,020
Take a look.

84
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,630
It's simple.

85
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,670
I want to try.

86
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,790
Don't bother.

87
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,740
You can't hit any.

88
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,310
Why are you here?

89
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,550
Let me tell you something.

90
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,590
I am so good

91
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,870
at this game.

92
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,750
Only god knows how much

93
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,910
I spent on this when I was a kid.

94
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,790
Prince Yi,

95
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,630
don't stand idle.

96
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,070
Pay the good man.

97
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,590
I have to pay?

98
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,150
It's only ten coins.

99
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,750
I'll give you

100
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,860
half of the prize I get.

101
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,590
You are not at a loss.

102
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,830
Sir.

103
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,590
Prince Yi, welcome.

104
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,310
I can't take your money.

105
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,670
Okay.

106
00:09:59,270 --> 00:09:59,950
I'll aim for that one.

107
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:07,950
Well done!

108
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,510
Congratulations!

109
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,110
You won a Balsam hair clasp.

110
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,070
We have more prizes.

111
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,710
Why not keep going?

112
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:21,910
OK.

113
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:24,990
Go get it!

114
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,830
Go! Go! Go!

115
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,470
I'll try again.

116
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,710
Looks like, someone

117
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,030
is not as good as she said.

118
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,470
What do you know?

119
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,460
I was being reserved.

120
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,270
My last toss.

121
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,110
I want the biggest prize.

122
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,750
Watch closely.

123
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,430
Go!

124
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,470
You can do it!

125
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,350
Come on!

126
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,830
Got it!

127
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,310
See?

128
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,580
What did I say?

129
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,660
How's...

130
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,950
How's this possible?

131
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,390
How can she be that strong?

132
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,020
Why is there a stone on it?

133
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,990
Yeah.

134
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,430
You profiteer!

135
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:38,830
Profiteer!

136
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,910
No, no no, I'm not.

137
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,190
That's unacceptable!

138
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,910
What have you done?

139
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,310
No, no.

140
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:45,790
It's mine.

141
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:46,630
Refund!

142
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,190
Run!

143
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,390
Profiteer!

144
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,870
Don't go!

145
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,230
Don't go.

146
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,590
I am wronged!

147
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,630
Why did you run?

148
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,470
It's not us who lied.

149
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,390
You are the one to talk.

150
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,870
You ran even faster than me.

151
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,350
Luckily,

152
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,990
this is not lost.

153
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,390
The hair clasp I won is gone.

154
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,110
Bummer.

155
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:30,700
It's not gone.

156
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,870
He's finally giving it back to me.

157
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,070
You're not gonna threaten me with it?

158
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,430
Really?

159
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,950
You won't have something big

160
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,510
waiting for me in the future.

161
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,790
Now that you reminded me,

162
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,470
I should think again.

163
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,590
No, no, no.

164
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,990
Don't do that to me.

165
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,350
Since you gave me the hair clasp back,

166
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,270
I'll give you this.

167
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,350
What a surprise.

168
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,900
I thought Prince Yi of East City

169
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,580
didn't like this folk gadget.

170
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,750
Didn't expect you to like it.

171
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,710
This is a family.

172
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,190
No kidding.

173
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,310
This set of general matryoshka

174
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,750
does kinda look like you and your brothers.

175
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,230
The biggest one

176
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,950
is Prince Da.

177
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,990
He frowns every day.

178
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,070
It's exactly like him.

179
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,750
This one with fair complexion

180
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,830
looks like Prince Xiu.

181
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,750
This heartless smile

182
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,070
looks like Prince Bao.

183
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,430
As for this scheming general...

184
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,110
That's what you think of me?

185
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,350
No.

186
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,540
Scheming people

187
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,630
are normally kind on the surface,

188
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,670
cunning behind the scenes.

189
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,710
You don't smile when you are with or without anyone.

190
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,510
Scheming inside and out, from head to toe.

191
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,260
I quit.

192
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,430
I'm just kidding.

193
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,390
Don't take it so seriously.

194
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,830
But,

195
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,700
who is the second biggest one?

196
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,030
It's Prince Teng.

197
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,710
I have heard

198
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,630
people in the mansion mention Prince Teng.

199
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,990
Many years ago,

200
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,350
we had wars with Northland.

201
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,830
I went to the front with Teng.

202
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,270
Live on.

203
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,110
Teng!

204
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,310
If it wasn't for my impulsive fall

205
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,230
into Northland's trap,

206
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,590
Teng wouldn't have been hacked to death.

207
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,030
At that time,

208
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,870
Teng was lying in front of me.

209
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,630
Yet I couldn't do anything.

210
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,670
That's why you became what you are now.

211
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,550
You took all the stress

212
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,230
and pain by yourself.

213
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,310
It's all because of me.

214
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,670
Wars are unpredictable.

215
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,830
No one wants it.

216
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,700
So I have to do my best

217
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,870
to make up for it.

218
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,590
East City is missing a Prince Teng.

219
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,190
I'll be the next Prince Teng.

220
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,589
But does Prince Teng want

221
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,510
you to be the next Qi Teng?

222
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:23,150
Maybe Prince Teng sacrificed himself to save you

223
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,310
not because he wanted you to be the next him,

224
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,590
or wanted you

225
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,220
to live on his shoulders.

226
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,390
He saved you

227
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,100
because you are brothers.

228
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,910
He wanted you to live well.

229
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,750
To live as Qi Yi.

230
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,030
What are you singing?

231
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,990
Prince Teng might be perfect,

232
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,350
but you are not him.

233
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,590
And you don't have to be him.

234
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,670
Everyone is unique.

235
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,180
Go.

236
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:57,830
Tong.

237
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,230
Where are you going?

238
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,510
Da.

239
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,950
It would be boring for us

240
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,630
to drink with each other.

241
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,340
I'll go find ladies

242
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,590
to make this fun.

243
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,430
No.

244
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,910
I don't want ladies.

245
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,630
I just want to win.

246
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,150
I just want to win over my father's respect.

247
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,110
Run!

248
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,070
What about you?

249
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,510
You go first. I'll meet you later.

250
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,070
Go, now!

251
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,070
You are such a pretty and kind lady.

252
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,390
I'm in an emergency.

253
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,470
Can I hide here for a while?

254
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,390
Finally, you are here.

255
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,670
Do you think I'm pretty?

256
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,030
I have seen so many celebrities.

257
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,910
You are definitely the top-class.

258
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,030
What about now?

259
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,790
Do you still think I'm pretty?

260
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,750
Beauty is superficial.

261
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,150
You don't have to care so much.

262
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,070
It doesn't matter.

263
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,350
Now I understand Master's intentions.

264
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,550
Although being a maid,

265
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,790
she seems

266
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,190
competent.

267
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,110
What are you talking about?

268
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,860
Do I know you?

269
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,670
Does it matter?

270
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,030
Are you having fun

271
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,870
in the Palace Makeup Service?

272
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,190
What's happening now?

273
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,150
Does she know my quest?

274
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,110
Miss.

275
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,790
You must have misunderstood.

276
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,630
I'm only a maid.

277
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,430
I know nothing.

278
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,190
As long as you complete the task of killing Qi Yi,

279
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,110
Kill who?

280
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,510
Master will help you stay in the Makeup Service.

281
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,190
Whether it is prosperity, wealth,

282
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,630
or the Head Matron you want to be,

283
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,270
Master can satisfy you.

284
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,620
Make a wise decision.

285
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,070
What?

286
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,870
What did you say?

287
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,590
We finally meet.

288
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,350
Kill him!

289
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,430
What's happening?

290
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,510
Qi Yi, don't fall for it!

291
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:01,750
Yi.

292
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,670
Don't chase them.

293
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,190
Yi.

294
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,110
What are you doing by dressing me like this?

295
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,270
Who are you?

296
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,590
What are you getting me for?

297
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,910
Let go of me!

298
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,550
Let go!

299
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,550
Stop!

300
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,110
Qi...

301
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,910
Yi.

302
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,590
Yi.

303
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,950
Prince Yi.

304
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,220
You can beg me for mercy.

305
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,670
I might consider

306
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,590
sparing her life.

307
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,910
She is just a maid.

308
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,310
I don't care about her life.

309
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,470
Oh, really?

310
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,150
Are you telling the truth?

311
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,350
Si Yan.

312
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:22,660
Si Yan.

313
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,550
Si Yan, watch out!

314
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,510
Courtesan?

315
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,870
It's her.

316
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,100
What do you say?

317
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,580
Prince Yi?

318
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,150
Is it a yes?

319
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,140
Si Yan, watch out!

320
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,820
You, let Si Yan go!

321
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,950
Then I'll spare your life.

322
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,070
I see you are not so smart.

323
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,510
Out of many people in the mansion,

324
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,790
you took a maid.

325
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,100
Kill her.

326
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,750
Xiu, what did you say?

327
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,950
I have to save Si Yan.

328
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,030
Now I'm a little envious of you.

329
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,870
Look at those idiots down there.

330
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,510
They like you so much.

331
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,390
For you,

332
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,510
they almost start fighting.

333
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,950
Prince Yi.

334
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,310
What about you?

335
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:06,870
Yi.

336
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,590
Look at that.

337
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,590
Look at that!

338
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,750
Yi, watch out!

339
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,390
Idiot, can't even save yourself in the game.

340
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,750
Why did you do this?

341
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,430
I'm not worth it at all.

342
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,270
We had so many misunderstandings.

343
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,950
But this time,

344
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,510
I was lying to her.

345
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:33,990
I will never walk out on you.

346
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,710
Let go of him!

347
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:08,990
You little maid,

348
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,630
well done in this mission.

349
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,870
You can be a pair of love birds in hell.

350
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,510
Jack, time-out!

351
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,260
Jack, time-out!

352
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,550
Miss Si Yan,

353
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,980
there are only two chances to call a time-out.

354
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,060
You have used both of them.

355
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,550
No!

356
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,270
Qi Yi.

357
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,590
Qi Yi.

358
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,510
Qi Yi!

359
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,510
How is he?

360
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,430
You are imprisoned.

361
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,430
Open the door.

362
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,710
Let me out

363
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,390
Open the door!

364
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,950
First Lady said

365
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,910
You're not allowed to leave the room

366
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,350
until everything is found out.

367
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,670
How is Qi Yi now?

368
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,429
How is he?

369
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:36,989
My lady,

370
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,469
the prince's pulse is unstable.

371
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:41,389
It may be a sign of being poisoned.

372
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,790
I can use acupuncture to force the poison out.

373
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,900
But given his situation right now.

374
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,230
I can't stop his bleeding.

375
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,350
From now on,

376
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,510
it's up to god's will whether he can live.

377
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,310
My lady.

378
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,870
It's all my fault.

379
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,150
If it wasn't for me and Yi got separated,

380
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,750
maybe he wouldn't be like this.

381
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:04,910
Yi.

382
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,150
Yi.

383
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,590
You're awake.

384
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,990
Yi heard me speaking.

385
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,670
Si Yan.

386
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:16,860
Si Yan.

387
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:17,830
Si Yan.

388
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,470
Si Yan.

389
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,790
Rui.

390
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,550
It's getting late.

391
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,430
You should go back and rest.

392
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:35,710
Si Yan.

393
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,710
My lady.

394
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,510
It seems

395
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,470
the maid of Palace Makeup Service, Si Yan,

396
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,470
must have something to do with this.

397
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,350
I can't let her ruin Yi.

398
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,630
Find a reason,

399
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,910
get rid of her.

400
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,310
Yes, my lady.

401
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,940
So nice.

402
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:14,830
There's only one last mission left.

403
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,870
But where is this

404
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,990
Rosewood Power Box?

405
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,230
Doctor, her BP is falling.

406
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,510
Get ready to save her life.

407
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:56,990
Peach.

408
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,230
What's wrong?

409
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:58,950
Peach.

410
00:37:59,350 --> 00:37:59,700
Peach.

411
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,590
My lady, you are awake.

412
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,420
You almost scared me to death.

413
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,070
Why did you faint?

414
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,910
You've been looking sick lately.

415
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,110
I'm going to call you a doctor.

416
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:15,870
No need.

417
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,230
I'm aware of my health situation.

418
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,070
Just take care of your own business.

419
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,550
It's my bad.

420
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,870
I've been here for so long.

421
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,430
Yet things haven't gone so well

422
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,230
with Prince Yi.

423
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,380
Now suddenly Si Yan popped up.

424
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,350
Don't forget.

425
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,670
Now, you are General Min's daughter, Min Rui.

426
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,790
With the support of the lord and the lady,

427
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,110
a maid is no match for you.

428
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,190
Right.

429
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,830
Now I am Min Rui.

430
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,310
You.

431
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,260
Just keep the status quo.

432
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,870
If I can't find out which prince

433
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,670
will finally become the crowned prince...

434
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,390
My lady,

435
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,510
you're saying...

436
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,150
I don't have much time left.

437
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,470
Instead of guessing,

438
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,270
I'd better make a crowned prince!
