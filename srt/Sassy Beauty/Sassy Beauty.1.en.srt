1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,160
I'm going to live stream.

3
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,389
I didn't sell fakes.

4
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,520
I was framed.

5
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,520
I will not quit as a beauty blogger!

6
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,880
What happened?

7
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,550
Where did she go?

8
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Was there a car accident?

9
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,360
Really? Oh no...

10
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,630
Is anyone calling the police?

11
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,030
Okay, ready? On the count of three.

12
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,880
Three.

13
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,910
Two.

14
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,390
One.

15
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,910
Hello, everyone.

16
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,440
I'm your girl, Chestnut.

17
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,880
So, recently I heard about some

18
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,550
false rumors of my live commerce.

19
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,320
Please don't believe it.

20
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,000
I want to warn those who speak ill of me.

21
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,750
Enough is enough.

22
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,079
At the end of today,

23
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,160
there will be a raffle.

24
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,190
The prize is my outfit today.

25
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,160
C'mon, fellas.

26
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,550
Move your fingers!

27
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,440
My headwear, jewelry,

28
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,000
haute couture,

29
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,240
bag, and shoes.

30
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,600
Everything I wear will be given to you!

31
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,440
Buy it now!

32
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,520
Lady Yan, too many mean comments.

33
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,670
I can't block them all.

34
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,550
Today, I will report to you

35
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,000
the turnover of this quarter.

36
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,920
What's the number?

37
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,720
I can't find it.

38
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,440
Stuck in such a critical moment?

39
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,720
Are you kidding me?

40
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,670
I-I'm so sorry, Lady Yan.

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,720
Glasses.

42
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,040
Lady Yan, I'm here.

43
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,070
The decline in sales

44
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,550
is due to the counterfeit goods crisis.

45
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,350
It would be hard to mute the public

46
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,159
and redeem yourself.

47
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,480
At least we can't do it in a short time.

48
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,200
That's your job.

49
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,110
Otherwise, what's the difference between

50
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,040
you and this worthless rookie?

51
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,070
Get her out of my sight.

52
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,110
Lady Yan.

53
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,040
After this, you should

54
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,070
go to Mr. Si's

55
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,950
VR Park

56
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,230
to participate in the live event for VIPs.

57
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,070
Your dress is here.

58
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,070
It will be live-streamed.

59
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,070
The ingredients of the new mascara

60
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,480
have been sent to the Health & Quarantine department.

61
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,320
And,

62
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,510
the chairman has arranged a blind date for you.

63
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,230
Twenty-five years old.

64
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,040
Young and rich.

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,110
Talented.

66
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,510
He is a game architect...

67
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,790
Not interested!

68
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:18,950
Glasses.

69
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,040
How do I look?

70
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,070
Gorgeous?

71
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,600
Of course.

72
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,070
The VR park wants you

73
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,950
to hurry up and be there.

74
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,440
Should we leave now?

75
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,320
Go!

76
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,350
Today's Live bonus

77
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,350
is to experience with me

78
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,830
how it feels like

79
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,790
to have a theme park at home.

80
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,000
Look!

81
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,440
This lush green place

82
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,950
is South Jiuzhai.

83
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,760
This vast desert

84
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,320
where caravans come and go

85
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,550
is Northland.

86
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,350
This culturally prosperous place

87
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,720
where many merchants gather

88
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,510
is East City.

89
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,070
Who is he?

90
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,640
He's kinda cute.

91
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,080
Qi Yi!

92
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,400
Please don't die!

93
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,640
Don't cry.

94
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,440
No matter

95
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,030
how many times we may start over,

96
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,590
I will always love you.

97
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,470
Qi Yi.

98
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,550
No...

99
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,790
No!

100
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,320
They seem so miserable.

101
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,030
The Beauty Blogger?

102
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,400
What's this?

103
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,150
What can I see with it?

104
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,960
Your future.

105
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,520
Si Yan...

106
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,760
You are here.

107
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,110
Wow...

108
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,760
Look at this...

109
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,230
It's so realistic.

110
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,230
I guess that old fogey spent a lot of money.

111
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,400
Was there something

112
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,590
on my face?

113
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,350
Can I borrow your mirror?

114
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm pretty.

115
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,590
Who am I right now?

116
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,440
The emperor's wife?

117
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,110
Or...

118
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,150
A prince's favorite concubine?

119
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,400
No?

120
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,520
At least,

121
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,910
am I going to be chosen for the emperor's harem?

122
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,670
And you are my maid.

123
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,440
Lady Yan.

124
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,640
Are you nuts because of the hot weather?

125
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,960
Who are you?

126
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,320
She is Hu Ying, from the Hu family.

127
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,880
We just greeted each other, remember?

128
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,280
Who are you?

129
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,400
We grew up together, like sisters.

130
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,470
What are you trying to play?

131
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,710
I'm not your sister.

132
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,350
What a bad taste of the game designer...

133
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,440
The protagonist dresses like a maid.

134
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,000
We are heading to East City to take the maid exam

135
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,150
of the Palace Makeup Service.

136
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,880
Maid?

137
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,880
Are you kidding me?

138
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,550
Si Yan, don't worry.

139
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,080
We'll be picked.

140
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,790
Picked?

141
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,230
Who are they to pick me?

142
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,080
Where the hell is this place?

143
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,550
I want to quit the game!

144
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,200
Time-limited makeup in the carriage?

145
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,000
Isn't it too hard as a novice task?

146
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,520
Si Yan, are you okay?

147
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,670
Listen up.

148
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,790
We've got a change of plan.

149
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,150
The makeup rating exam 
will be carried out in the carriage.

150
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,230
There are enough tools 
in the makeup box in the carriage.

151
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,550
After a stick of incense is burnt out,

152
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,400
we will arrive at the posting station.

153
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,440
Then,

154
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,000
matrons and court ladies

155
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,110
of the Palace Makeup Service

156
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,030
will evaluate and rate

157
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,320
everyone's makeup.

158
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,840
Oh no.

159
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,760
They changed the exam site.

160
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,910
No way.

161
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,030
The first place

162
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,590
will become a 5th-rank court lady

163
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,230
and learn from matrons.

164
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,440
The runner-up

165
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,790
will become a 6th-rank court lady.

166
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,670
Besides learning from matrons,

167
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,880
they will also need to perform
 daily duties in the mansion.

168
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,910
The third place

169
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,760
will work as the ladies and masters want.

170
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,320
Mainly rough work.

171
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,840
What about the fourth place?

172
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,320
How dare you

173
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,790
ask me questions?

174
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,350
Since you want to be the fourth place,

175
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,790
I'll create one for you later.

176
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,640
Keep moving!

177
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,000
Full makeup before a stick of incense is burnt out.

178
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,640
How long is that?

179
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,840
Don't stay still!

180
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,440
Hurry up!

181
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,110
What are these?

182
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,520
Which one is the foundation?

183
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,790
Is this suitable for my skin?

184
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,520
There is no product description.

185
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,790
It's over?

186
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,320
Si Yan.

187
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,520
Are you okay?

188
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,910
Listen up.

189
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,110
We've got a change of plan.

190
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,280
After half a stick of incense is burnt out,

191
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,000
we will arrive at the posting station.

192
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,350
Then,

193
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,840
What?

194
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,470
How did it become half a stick of incense?

195
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,400
You can't go back on your word!

196
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,640
I can't?

197
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,670
You!

198
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,550
Throw her out of East City!

199
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,400
Si Yan.

200
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,550
Are you okay?

201
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,640
What are you doing?

202
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,030
We have plenty of time.

203
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,230
You don't have to do this now.

204
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,000
Listen up.

205
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,150
We've got a change of plan.

206
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,000
After a quarter of a stick of incense is burnt out,

207
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,640
we will arrive at the posting station.

208
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,080
Oh no.

209
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,320
Damn you.

210
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,350
Use this.

211
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,960
It's faster.

212
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,000
Thank you.

213
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,230
The Palace Makeup Service

214
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,440
in the East Mansion

215
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,150
is not a place for loud losers.

216
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,230
Otherwise,

217
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,320
it'll be a waste of all the good cosmetics.

218
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,080
Si Yan.

219
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,080
Are you okay?

220
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,080
I'm starting to feel sorry

221
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,350
for those emperors who traveled incognito.

222
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,440
Carriages are no fun at all!

223
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,080
Lan Miao.

224
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,590
Look at my eyebrows.

225
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,069
Could you

226
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,000
help me with them?

227
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,280
I want curved ones

228
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,760
or thick ones.

229
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:16,880
Sure.

230
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:17,640
Or,

231
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,680
slim ones.

232
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,040
Okay.

233
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,520
Lan Miao.

234
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,800
Are you an idiot?

235
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,710
She is wasting your time.

236
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,640
Can't you tell?

237
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,560
Stay out of this.

238
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,040
Mind your own business.

239
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,310
No wonder you're being bullied.

240
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,310
Between your eyebrows,

241
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,400
No wonder so many silly girls were killed in dramas.

242
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,830
Don't feel sorry for her.

243
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,350
Can you help me try it?

244
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,190
Something is missing...

245
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,710
Lan Miao.

246
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,070
Could you lend me this?

247
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,710
I need this for my makeup now.

248
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,190
I called it first.

249
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:58,920
Gimme that.

250
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,160
It's mine.

251
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,470
Give it to me.

252
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,400
Are you having carsick, Lady Yan?

253
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,040
Everything in this box

254
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,350
is for all of us.

255
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,560
There is no yours or mine.

256
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,280
Plus,

257
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,400
I am just concerned.

258
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,110
I'm afraid that such beautiful things

259
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,590
will be wasted.

260
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,000
Do you agree?

261
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,800
Lan Miao?

262
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,000
Who wrote lines for NPC?

263
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,310
This is not the way to create conflict.

264
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,280
I can't take it anymore.

265
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,830
Fine.

266
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,950
You said it's a waste.

267
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,950
Then no one will use it!

268
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:28,830
You...

269
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:32,710
Give it to me!

270
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,110
Let go of me!

271
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,230
Help!

272
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,800
I quit!

273
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,680
Stop the game!

274
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,830
Why am I back here again?

275
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,000
I want to quit.

276
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,070
Hello, Miss Si Yan.

277
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,470
Nice to meet you, finally.

278
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,710
Here is not a VR park.

279
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,070
This is the back end of the awakening system.

280
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,190
Wait.

281
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,350
What?

282
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,880
What awakening system?

283
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,070
Si Yao's technology company

284
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,190
has developed

285
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,470
a game simulation system
for vegetative awakening.

286
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,950
And you are the first tester

287
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,590
of the PVIC system.

288
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,040
Are you joking?

289
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,230
I'm not a PVS patient.

290
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,400
Why are you taking me for an experiment?

291
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,830
A year ago,

292
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,760
you suffered a serious car accident

293
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,590
and fell into a vegetative state.

294
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,880
Nonsense.

295
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,280
I don't remember it at all.

296
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,280
After you left the VR park,

297
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,350
you went to the blind date your father set up.

298
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,430
I heard that

299
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,400
you hate drunk and frivolous women.

300
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,590
The awakening system

301
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,830
hid some unpleasant real experiences of players

302
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,760
to allow them to have a better experience.

303
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,560
I'm really in a vegetative state?

304
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,310
I've been in bed for a year?

305
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,470
So...

306
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,190
This game was developed by my dad?

307
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,040
It can be said that he made it for you.

308
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,280
The system sets a series of game tasks.

309
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,560
Testers' brainwave signals will be boosted

310
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,920
as they complete game tasks.

311
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,160
With strong enough brainwave signals,

312
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
testers may be able to wake up in reality.

313
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,920
You are saying that

314
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,680
if I win the final victory in the game,

315
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,760
I can wake up in reality?

316
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,800
Is it for real?

317
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,800
Do you have an exit mechanism in this game?

318
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,430
Or...

319
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,430
What is my worst result?

320
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,760
If you can't successfully 
stimulate the brain nerve to recover,

321
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
there will be a high probability 
of returning to a vegetative state.

322
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,800
Do you still want to opt out?

323
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,760
Anyway, there's no way out.

324
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,230
Do I have any other options?

325
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,560
First,

326
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,760
from the initial interface

327
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,000
when you enter the game,

328
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
different characters

329
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,920
represent different game quests.

330
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,110
You just tried the makeup maid quest,

331
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,000
to become a makeup master.

332
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,040
There are four other quests

333
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,280
for you to choose from.

334
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,160
You can choose your favorite character

335
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,680
according to your personal preferences.

336
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,640
Why not analyze player data

337
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,800
for an optimal match?

338
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,520
The character you just played

339
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,760
is the optimal match by the system.

340
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,400
You mean

341
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,800
I'm suitable for being a maid?

342
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,830
The East City,

343
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,880
as the largest capital of the Kingdom of Tianqi,

344
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,470
is an important trading port.

345
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,520
Residents here are open-minded

346
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,350
and keen on makeup.

347
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,430
They are good at makeup production

348
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,400
and new makeup creation.

349
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,920
The Palace Makeup Service in East Mansion

350
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,880
represents the highest level 
of makeup in East City.

351
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,520
For the identity you choose,

352
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,400
her final goal is

353
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,310
to become the Head Matron
of the Palace Makeup Service.

354
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,430
As a maid,

355
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,400
if I can become the Head Matron,

356
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,590
then can I wake up?

357
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,000
Wait a second.

358
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,880
Are all the players in that carriage

359
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,560
in a vegetative state like me?

360
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,160
At present, in this mission,

361
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,350
you are the only conner.

362
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,160
Others are all

363
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,310
non-player characters.

364
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,470
Then...

365
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,830
Who are you?

366
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,040
I'm your butler, Jack.

367
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,310
Since you are my butler,

368
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,000
then is there any instruction manual

369
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,430
or special rewards?

370
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,640
Sorry.

371
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,190
I can't answer this question.

372
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,190
Wish you good luck.

373
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,310
What took you so long to get here?

374
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,160
I want to make a complaint.

375
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,040
You're not qualified as a butler at all.

376
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,680
Miss Si Yan,

377
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,160
In the game setting,
unless players fail to pass,

378
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,560
they have two chances to call a time-out

379
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,680
which will allow them
to choose whether to continue or not.

380
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,070
You just inadvertently called a time-out.

381
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,070
Do you want to quit?

382
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,350
The game has just started.

383
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,520
I know nothing about my character,

384
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,070
identity,

385
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,590
background,

386
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,470
and all other things.

387
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,880
I'm not prepared at all.

388
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
According to the big data on your game style,

389
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,000
you hate explanations.

390
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,310
Normally you will skip those.

391
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,070
How can you use that data on me right now?

392
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,230
Hurry.

393
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,000
Your character's name is Yan.

394
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,680
You were born in the dead of winter.

395
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,400
Your mother is only a mistress in the family.

396
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,710
She died of a cold after giving birth to you.

397
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,000
When you were a teenager,

398
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,040
your father was framed by schemers.

399
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,160
He opened the warehouse

400
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,830
and was put to death for that.

401
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,000
How sad!

402
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,400
You were adopted by
a kind-hearted person by chance,

403
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,830
and become the seventh daughter
of the Si family.

404
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,160
My butler,

405
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,830
is there any other information

406
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,520
that I need to know?

407
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,110
For example, Hu Ying.

408
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,880
A drama queen.

409
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,710
Get rid of her.

410
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,680
So obnoxious.

411
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,760
For players,

412
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,350
unless you encounter a special NPC

413
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,680
or a special event,
you can't get her disappeared.

414
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,710
So,

415
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,280
Miss Si Yan, do you want to continue?

416
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,680
Players only have two chances to call time-out.

417
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,830
It is recommended that
you use the chances with caution.

418
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,710
I can't even pass the first level.

419
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,110
How can I pass the next one?

420
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,760
I thought it was a single room!

421
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,110
A bunch of losers!

422
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,110
You finally caught me.

423
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,470
In your East Mansion,

424
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,710
how could you treat me like this?

425
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,400
Bro.

426
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,920
Have some rest.

427
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,310
Do you think this is a guest house?

428
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,830
Single room?

429
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,560
It's typical for shabby places like

430
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,110
the East Mansion.

431
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,160
So stingy.

432
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,880
It is certainly not
as generous as the Northland.

433
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,000
Are you from Northland?

434
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,070
Will you get suspected

435
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,760
because you come here?

436
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,880
I have my explanation.

437
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,430
The chess piece you talked about.

438
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,110
That stupid spy is already useless.

439
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,640
Don't try to get attached.

440
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,070
Who the hell are you?

441
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,160
Don't dream of climbing up.

442
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,710
Who instructed you
to pretend to be a foreign merchant

443
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,710
and infiltrate into the East Mansion?

444
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,110
Tell me.

445
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,710
Three years ago,
the East Mansion defeated the Northland.

446
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,070
Two sides signed a treaty.

447
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,760
Why does the Northland send spies

448
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,950
at this point?

449
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,310
What is your intention?

450
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,160
Master!

451
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,920
I tried my best!

452
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,590
Stop acting.

453
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,880
You won't die.

454
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,520
Am I dead?

455
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,350
I'm still alive.

456
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,040
Aren't you a hitman?

457
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,760
The poison you have

458
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,000
has just been replaced with
hallucinogenic pills.

459
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,070
Hallucinogenic pills?

460
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,040
You just tried to commit suicide.

461
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,710
What are you afraid of?

462
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,310
I came here to the East Mansion

463
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,680
just to see the top dancer of the Cloud Brothel.

464
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,710
Top dancer?

465
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,920
Then who is the master you mentioned just now?

466
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,040
That's mystery Prince Yi.

467
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,280
Greetings, Prince Yi.

468
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,110
Prince Yi?

469
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,950
The East Mansion is so bustling.

470
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,070
Si Yan, don't go out.

471
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,470
No matter

472
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,040
how many times we may start over,

473
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,190
I'll always love you.

474
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,350
No!

475
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,000
It's him.

476
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,040
The makeup ratings of this year

477
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,110
will be decided by Lady Cui,

478
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,070
the Head Matron

479
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,830
of the Palace Makeup Service.

480
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,070
Of all the maid selections over the years,

481
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,310
never before has there been
such a high-level one.

482
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,680
It is said that

483
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,160
among all the matrons in the palace,

484
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,800
Lady Cui

485
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,680
has been promoted the fastest.

486
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,000
Really?

487
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,590
How many years did it take her
to become the Head Matron?

488
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,800
Lady Cui also started as a maid.

489
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,070
Perhaps,

490
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,160
ten years.

491
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,710
Ten years?

492
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,520
Greetings, Lady Cui.

493
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,160
If you want to be a maid in the service,

494
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,590
at least your makeup has to be

495
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
clean, fresh,

496
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,920
decent and appropriate.

497
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,470
These points

498
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,070
are the main criteria

499
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,040
for the test today.

500
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,680
Yes.

501
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,000
Shang Ying.

502
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,310
Dirty.

503
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,950
Level C.

504
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,830
Li Mei.

505
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,590
Not fresh.

506
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,800
Level C.

507
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,640
Lan Miao.

508
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,520
Lady Cui,

509
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,880
I didn't do this makeup well this time.

510
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,000
Please give me another chance.

511
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,880
It's bad.

512
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,280
Half of your makeup is exquisite,

513
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
while the other half isn't.

514
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,350
So uneven.

515
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,040
I have given you enough time.

516
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,070
In the service,

517
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,400
you must learn to do makeup efficiently.

518
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,190
Unlike maids in other places,
maids in the service

519
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,470
don't have time to do makeup slowly.

520
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,680
Lan Miao.

521
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,040
Level B.

522
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,920
Hu Ying.

523
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,040
What's wrong with your eyebrows?

524
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,920
They're so weird.

525
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,230
I...

526
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,310
Yeah.

527
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,920
They're so ugly, aren't they?

528
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,520
Have a look!

529
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,190
Aren't they ugly?

530
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,230
They...

531
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,350
You did this!

532
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,950
The carriage doesn't move now.

533
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,590
It's the best time for me to do makeup.

534
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,040
I think these thick bushy eyebrows

535
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,800
suit you quite well.

536
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,470
You!

537
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,520
Watch your manners!

538
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,280
Lady Cui,

539
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,590
in my opinion, her makeup,

540
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,110
except for the eyebrows,

541
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,110
is quite elegant to some extent.

542
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,310
Talking nonsense without blinking.

543
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,310
There must be something fishy between them.

544
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,280
Fine.

545
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,190
I'll give you one more chance.

546
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,710
Hu Ying.

547
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,040
Level C.

548
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,920
Thank you, Lady Cui.

549
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,040
Why did Prince Yi just change clothes?

550
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,280
It's such an important day.

551
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,760
Where have you been?

552
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,640
A riot broke out in the city.

553
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,760
I was just on my routine visit.

554
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,400
I know that is your duty.

555
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,950
But everything has to be prioritized.

556
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,310
I heard that
Miss Min arrived at the posting station.

557
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,470
I know.

558
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,520
Later,

559
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,880
go to the Treasure Pavilion first.

560
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,760
Take the present I picked

561
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,040
as a welcome gift for Miss Min.

562
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,350
Then go to the station to pick her up.

563
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,040
Take her to the Meeting Tower.

564
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,830
While you're on the road,

565
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,950
have a chat with her.

566
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,880
Don't fail my expectations of you.

567
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,230
Yes.

568
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,760
I heard that since last night, Prince Da

569
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,470
has been yelling to pick up Miss Min.

570
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,040
Thank Heavens. Your Highness keeps

571
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,710
the engagement gift of the King and General Min,

572
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,590
the White Jade Box,

573
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,760
in the Treasure Pavilion.

574
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,070
Otherwise,

575
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,110
they would have taken it away.

576
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,160
The box belongs to

577
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,920
whoever owns it.

578
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,950
Prince Yi hasn't seen

579
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,830
the White Jade Box, right?

580
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,520
Since Prince Teng took it back
from the battlefield,

581
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,830
no one has seen it.

582
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,430
Unfortunately,

583
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,760
one makeup box inside

584
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,000
is missing for no reason.

585
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,110
The Treasure Pavilion has

586
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,830
found an old craftsman to remake one.

587
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,920
They're almost identical.

588
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,160
I hope Prince Teng can bless

589
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,760
that everything will go smoothly.

590
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,760
About that spy from the Northland,

591
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,070
what do you think?

592
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,520
I'm just a servant.

593
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,710
How dare I talk about politics?

594
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,710
I just think it's hard to

595
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,800
link a top dancer with a spy from Northland.

596
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,590
It's more like...

597
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,800
More like what?

598
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,280
It's more like slander.

599
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,600
Prince Yi is becoming
more and more like Prince Teng.

600
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,520
I'll do everything

601
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:15,870
that you just asked.

602
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,670
Be careful.

603
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,560
For girls,

604
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
they like men to lead them.

605
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,000
Farewell.

606
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,120
Si Yan.

607
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,870
Three minutes to go.

608
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,600
Glasses!

609
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,150
Only three minutes left!

610
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,120
Can you change my makeup?

611
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,800
Yes.

612
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,190
Gold leaf makeup.

613
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,840
Are you okay with this?

614
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,800
I want the same look.

615
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,360
The same one.

616
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,760
Okay.

617
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,710
Not bad.

618
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,950
Si Yan's makeup is so delicate.

619
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,150
Where did you learn this?

620
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,760
Si Yan.

621
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,390
Indecent and inappropriate.

622
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,390
Level C.

623
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:41,630
Why?

624
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,080
Why level C?

625
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,390
In a makeup contest,

626
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
doesn't beauty matter the most?

627
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,600
Inappropriate? Indecent?

628
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,230
How can people say that the Service

629
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,390
represents the highest level of makeup skills
in the East City?

630
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,560
You are just too complacent.

631
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,190
How dare you!

632
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,390
How dare a lowly maid say something so rude?

633
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Am I wrong?

634
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,950
You rated me as level C,

635
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
just because you can't accept

636
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,430
this new makeup style.

637
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,560
Or is it because

638
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,230
my makeup is too beautiful?

639
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,320
you are right

640
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,710
We rated you as level C,

641
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
not because we can't accept
this new style of makeup.

642
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,910
But it's because your makeup is too pretty,

643
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,470
The best makeup look
must be decent and appropriate.

644
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,840
You're a maid.

645
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,040
Always remember your identity

646
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,870
and know the occasion you're in.

647
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,470
All your intentions

648
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,230
are painted on your face.

649
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,840
Since it's a makeup contest,

650
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,080
it should be all about makeup looks.

651
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,000
Why do you have to
talk about decency and appropriateness?

652
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,670
Even if I'm a scoundrel,

653
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,840
I'm still beautiful.

654
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,360
You have to admit that, right?

655
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,080
If you're not decent,

656
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,760
what's the use of being beautiful?

657
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,470
You're here to serve your master,

658
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,760
not to have a beauty contest with your master.

659
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,280
Don't think I don't know

660
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,710
what your intentions are.

661
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,520
You thought if you were in the service,
you would have access to His Highness

662
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,760
and climb up.

663
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,080
I'll tell you what.

664
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,710
Don't dream of being a Cinderella.

665
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,760
Maids

666
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,840
will always be maids.

667
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,870
So you think
whoever wanting to be in the service

668
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,080
aims to seduce His Highness?

669
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,430
Well...

670
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,600
Lady Cui, you too.

671
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,520
Even if the game setting is ancient times,

672
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,910
how could this happen?

673
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,120
So patriarchal.

674
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,190
Listen to me.

675
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,670
It's out of date for women to please others.

676
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,040
Right now,

677
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,470
you do your makeup to please yourselves.

678
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,710
Also,

679
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,320
what's wrong with wanting to be a Cinderella?

680
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,230
Is it wrong?

681
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,630
Don't you all want that?

682
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,910
Since you are so dissatisfied with my decision,

683
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,430
then this place is not suitable for you.

684
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,000
Come.

685
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,120
Get her out of here.

686
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,280
Send her back.

687
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,800
How can you do this?

688
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,190
Si Yan.

689
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,560
I won't go!

690
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,190
I did nothing wrong!

691
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,560
Let me go!

692
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,910
I did nothing wrong!

693
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,000
How can you drive me away?

694
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,390
Let me go!

695
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,190
Wait.

696
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,430
See.

697
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,320
It's so cliché.

698
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,360
There must be a hero to save the beauty.

699
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,950
In your opinion,

700
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,360
about those counterfeit goods,

701
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,430
who the hell is messing with me?

702
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,080
If those counterfeit goods
were sent to customers,

703
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,910
then Si Yan's business will...

704
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,080
I believe

705
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,000
we will have an answer very soon.

706
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,670
Mole.

707
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,800
No.
