My eyebrows?

My eyebrows!

Wait up.

It isn't necessarily disastrous

to have lost your eyebrows

51
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,159
because it gives you a chance

52
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,750
to build the desired brow shape.

53
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,350

I'll settle with you later.

176
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,120
Miss Si Yan,

177
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,400
it seems that you're

178
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,120
adapting well to the system rules.

179
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,560
When you're under the eaves,

180
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,680
you need to bow your heads.

181
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,280
Ugly girl. Why didn't you look where you were going?

182
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,520
Don't panic.

183
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,280
She's going through peri-menopause.

184
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,240
The fox borrows the tiger's awe.

185
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,590
I'm Si Yan.

186
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,630
What's your name?

187
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,550
I'm Tangier.

188
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,360
I can pick them up myself.

189
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,610
[Tangier: Maid]

190
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,420
[Bond yourself with this player and look out for each other?]

191
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,760
There's even team bonding mode!

192
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,870
It looks like this maid

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,400
is the crucial point of my breakthrough.

194
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,560
Let me help you out, Tangier.

195
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,710
It's faster this way.

196
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,160
What's this?

197
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,800
This is awesome.

198
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,240
My Lord.

199
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,440
Prince Da arranged for this match

200
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,680
so he can show off in front of Miss Min.

201
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,280
Qi Da,

202
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,880
I know you're good at archery,

203
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,600
but you gotta

204
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,000
give us a chance to shine, too.

205
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,760
For the insiders, Qi Da is demonstrating his archery skills.

206
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,720
Those who don't know archery

207
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,320
might think this is a sideshow.

208
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,280
Why?

209
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,590
Are you both scared?

210
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,720
This is awesome! Fabulous!

211
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,160
Prince Da, you live up to your reputation!

212
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,200
Nice archery skills!

213
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,000
I, I, I, I'm flattered.

214
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,560
I heard that Miss Min

215
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,200
I heard that Miss Min

216
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,760
grew up next to General Min.

217
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,400
You must

218
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,160
be very good at the horseback archer.

219
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,530
You're so humble!

220
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,960
Speaking of archery,

221
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,560
Qi Yi is comparable to me.

222
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,600
Qi Yi,

223
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,400
As Miss Min is here,

224
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,600
why don't you show us what you can do?

225
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,160
I'm recovering from a cold.

226
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,120
Qi Da,

227
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,530
please excuse me.

228
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,960
Since when are you becoming this soft?

229
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,840
Man up.

230
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,450
Let's not hide anything.

231
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,240
It's embarrassing.

232
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,920
Prince Da,

233
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,080
My Lord has not fully recovered from the cold.

234
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,320
Please cut him some slack.

235
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,890
You minion, how dare you speak in front of me?

236
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,160
Since Prince Da insisted,

237
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
it'll be disrespectful to turn it down.

238
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,440
I'll do my best.

239
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,960
Miss Min,

240
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,480
please root for me.

241
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,360
Qi Yi,

242
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,770
the sword has no eyes.

243
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,080
Please be careful.

244
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,450
Since Qi Yi rarely cooperates,

245
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,880
let's do something a tad harder.

246
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,920
My Lord, please don't mind me.

247
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Please don't hesitate. You have to win.

248
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,360
Qi Da, no!

249
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,600
Miss, Miss, Miss, Min.

250
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,920
Are you okay?

251
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,930
It's fine.

252
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,800
Peach came to the rescue in time.

253
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,690
Earlier... earlier... earlier, thank you!

254
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,610
Prince Da, don't mention it.

255
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,520
Us girls from the North have always been good at horseback archer.

256
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,600
Peach is the best among all.

257
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,690
If Prince Da is interested,

258
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,530
I'll arrange for her to have a match with you.

259
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,040
Qi Da, no one plays this rough!

260
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,920
Life was almost lost simply by 
 being in the match field.

261
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,530
Qi Da would not have done it on purpose,

262
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,810
but it was probably deliberate.

263
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,370
You must have been frightened.

264
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,920
Qi Yi,

265
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,970
I was caught off guard and scared.

266
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,490
Please see me off to Peace Pavillion.

267
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,400
Sure.

268
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,240
This way.

269
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,520
This is delicious!

270
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,040
If you can't resolve your worry

271
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,450
by having a great meal,

272
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,290
have two yummy ones.

273
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,370
Where is the meal box for Lady Wei?

274
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,920
Zhiqiu must have taken it.

275
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,920
Thank you for walking me back.

276
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,920
I appreciate it.

277
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,000
Don't mention it.

278
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,330
It's on my way.

279
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,800
You are still fighting a cold.

280
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,120
You should be taken care of better.

281
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,570
I'll send some Angelica lamb bone soup over.

282
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,370
It works well to warm up the body.

283
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,890
If it's not too much trouble.

284
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,840
Not at all.

285
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,760
I often make the bone soup for My Lady...

286
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,210
eh, for my Dad to drink.

287
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,210
If you'll excuse me.

288
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,690
Take it easy.

289
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,810
How come I run into him everywhere.

290
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,250
Enemies are bound to meet unwillingly.

291
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,330
Please go and fetch Dr. Pei.

292
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,970
Don't let anyone know.

293
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:06,810
I understand.

294
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,770
Dr. Pei?

295
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,410
Something must be wrong.

296
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,290
After the young master fell in the water,

297
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,450
you've gotten colds.

298
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,730
But it shouldn't cause rashes.

299
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,960
These rashes shape like flowers and willows.

300
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,330
Polluted water wouldn't trigger them.

301
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,920
It may be caused by people.

302
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,170
Are you suggesting that he's poisoned?

303
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,410
Right.

304
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,520
Did the young master take any decoction?

305
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:40,960
Once in the morning,
 and once at night.

306
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,130
The in-house doctor

307
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,050
prescribed it specifically for the colds.

308
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,320
Ginseng and Veratrum are working against each other.

309
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,240
In my opinion,

310
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,650
you should stop taking it.

311
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,330
I'll prescribe some topical ointment for the young master.

312
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,200
When will the rushes fade away?

313
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:07,970
It's hard to say.

314
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,930
It can range from ten days to half a month or even longer.

315
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,840
It depends on how well nursed you are.

316
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,240
That long? The Flower Feast is a few days away.

317
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,610
If the rashes are still present by then,

318
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,680
My Lord,

319
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,960
shall we tell the First Lady everything?

320
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,530
You'll be able to get better and not to worry.

321
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,130
No.

322
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,490
The Flower Feast is hosted by my mother.

323
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,040
It cannot have any problems.

324
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,760
Not to mention, my skin rashes

325
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,120
might become gossips if people find out.

326
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,090
We can't take either measure.

327
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
What shall we do?

328
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,450
Will it speed up the healing process 
 by doubling up the dosage?

329
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,650
Well...

330
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,050
It turns out you can adjust fires like that. 
Why didn't you say so earlier?

331
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,370
If the participant doesn't have the skill to complete the task,

332
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,810
she can seek help from the housekeeper.

333
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,810
You have proven to be helpful.

334
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,090
Don't mention it.

335
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:24,970
Try it.

336
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,890
I forgot that you don't eat.

337
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,130
There are so many delicious foods in this world.

338
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,720
Hot pot. BBQ. Sushi.

339
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,650
You have no clue how they taste.

340
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,090
Life must be boring for you.

341
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,130
In the programming setting,

342
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,480
there's no eating function by default.

343
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,650

515
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,050
I modified the prescriptions.

516
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,170
It is the recipe of the nourishing facial masque 
 in my family for generations.

517
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,940
It works like magic for acne.

518
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,690
Feel free to show it to My Lady.

519
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,570
Who knows.

520
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,010
My Lady may appreciate you.

521
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,450
Did you replace the prescriptions yourself?

522
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,930
Who gave you the authority?

523
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,410
I would never dare to, Zhiqiu.

524
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,620
Please don't get me wrong.

525
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,860
I put a lot of thought and effort into this.

526
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,730
There won't be any problem.

527
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,450
I think you're trying to frame me.

528
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,570
By offering this to My Lady,

529
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,580
if anything goes wrong,

530
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,740
the fault is all mine.

531
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,330
You will replace me.

532
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,620
Zhiqiu, please don't take me wrong.

533
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:33,490
How about this?

534
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,570
I'll follow your prescription

535
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,770
to make a new one now.

536
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,180
Don't bother.

537
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,860
Why? Are you worried?

538
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,740
Were you exposed?

539
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,890
There's no need to make the decoction again.

540
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,410
Follow me to see My Lady with your prescription.

541
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,780
We'll see how she punishes you.

542
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,780
Please don't do it, Zhiqiu.

543
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,860
My Lady, it's the girl outside.

544
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,170
She burned your decoction

545
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,540
and sugarcoated it

546
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,090
as the modified prescription.

547
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,020
I think

548
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,100
she's trying to trick you.

549
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,780
First, she blocked me from meeting My Lady.

550
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,980
Now she lied about everything.

551
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,420
In this case,

552
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,860
drag her out

553
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,650
and send her away.

554
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,380
Yes.

555
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,140
Hur-ry.

556
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:31,850
Hur-ry?

557
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,660
Hurry. Drag her out and bludgeon her.

558
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,620
You threw water on my face. Are you nuts?

559
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,260
Yes.

560
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:37,860
Hold on.

561

Before that,

562
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:41,860
My Lady,

563
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,380
do you feel anything different on your face?

564
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,970
It feels cool and stings.

565
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,340
Such a bold minion!

566
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,660
How could you throw water on the face of My Lady?

567
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,860
Come, guards. Take her out.

568
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,740
Forgive me, My Lady.

569
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,700
The water I threw on you is the washed rice water,

570
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,610
but it's the best makeup remover for your skin.

571
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,140
Wait.

572
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,810
What do you mean?

573
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,300
My Lady, the acne on your face

574
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,740
is buried under a thick layer of makeup.

575
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,970
The veil also makes the skin hard to breathe.

576
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,980
You have to remove the makeup first before having any treatments.

577
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,420
My Lady, please feel the differences.

578
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,460
Don't you feel much better on your face now?

579
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,540
The stinging sensation seems to have lowered by a little.

580
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,610
You seem to be right about it.

581
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,090
My Lady, please don't trust her.

582
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,060
Should I trust you instead?

583
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,380
Look how you've ruined my face.

584

Hey.

585
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,060
Are you sure you can heal my skin?

586
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,860
I guarantee.

587

can these treat the acne?

592
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,060
Skincare products are very complicated.

593
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,900
Taking it orally or applying it to the skin,

594
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,860
the ingredients are all herbs.

595
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,340
You'll see the results with time if taking it continuously,

596
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,540
but it's nothing but a gimmick

597
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,930
to quickly convince Lady Wei

598
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,700
that I'm the savior for her rotten face.

599
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,420
In reality,

600
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,370
she's the only person who can treat her face.

00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,460
What happened here tonight

685
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,940
stays here.

686
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,260
If you leak anything,

687
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:07,580
you're fired.

688
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:08,380
Did you hear me?

689
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:09,860
Yes, my Lady.

690
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,220
Clean this up.

691
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,150
My Lady.

692
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,430
Whoever sends those to me

693
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,710
will get a beating!

694
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,630
Eh.

695
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,390
I haven't put on the clay masque yet.

696
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,940
Is the lead valid?

697
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,220
Absolutely.

698
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,020
I heard it in the pharmacy.

699
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,820
Prince Yi doesn't have a cold.

700
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:56,940
He has rashes shaped like flowers and willows.

701
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,100
On top of that,

702
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,340
he spent a lot of money at Cloud Brothel a few days ago.

703
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,860
Qi Yi.

704
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,510
I've finally caught you tripping.

705
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,140
You there, stop!

706
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,620
Help me!

707
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,460
Greetings, Prince Yi.

708
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:31,910
What's going on?

709
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,420
Si Yan

710
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,110
ruins my eyebrows.

711
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:38,670
Not me!

712
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:44,950
Your brows indeed look unique.

713
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,230
Don't make a big fuss here.

714
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,140
Go back.

715
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,460
If you'll excuse me, Prince Yi.

716
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,460
Thank you!
